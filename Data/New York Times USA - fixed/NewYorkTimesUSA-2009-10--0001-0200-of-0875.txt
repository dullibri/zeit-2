HEADLINE: It's Never Too Early for a Party

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
WAITERS hoisted bottles of Champagne with sparklers plunged into the corks; demiclad young visitors danced on banquettes, their improvised antics captured by cameras; others tossed back tequila and rang up four-figure tabs. 
 That cheerfully dissolute scene, reminiscent of party nights in Miami Beach or St-Tropez, was in fact played out on a recent Saturday at Bagatelle in the meatpacking district in Manhattan, home to a weekly bacchanal masquerading as a brunch. By midafternoon, the restaurant, with its Old World woodwork and chandeliers, teemed with young Europeans and New Yorkers shedding their proprieties along with their coats. Some of the men were turned out in T-shirts, while their female companions flaunted sequins, stilettos and lots of flesh -- the better to catch the eye, perhaps, of a promising mogul or banker. 
 Recession? Not in this precinct, it seemed.

HEADLINE: Bill Would Make Ratings Agencies Share Liability

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A key House lawmaker wants to make credit rating agencies -- which have been widely criticized for failing to give investors adequate warning of the risks in subprime mortgage securities that triggered the financial crisis -- responsible for each other's assessments by holding them collectively liable for inaccuracies.
 A new draft bill by the lawmaker, Representative Paul Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat, includes a plan meant to address what critics contend is the crux of the current system's problem: companies that issue securities -- as opposed to investors -- pay the agencies for ratings of those securities. 
 Raymond McDaniel, chairman and chief executive of the rating agency Moody's, said the company supported enhanced regulatory oversight of the industry. But imposing collective liability could increase the number of meritless lawsuits over unhappiness with ratings and create an unpredictable business environment, he told the lawmakers Wednesday.
 Mr. Kanjorski, chairman of a House Financial Services subcommittee, contends that establishing collective liability could spur the powerful rating agencies -- Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings -- ''to police one another and release reliable, high-quality ratings.''
 ''This is the start of a process,'' he said at a subcommittee hearing. Mr. Kanjorski's draft also includes Obama administration proposals to tighten government oversight of the rating industry, as part of the effort to overhaul the nation's financial rules.
 Congress is escalating its scrutiny of the Wall Street rating industry as well as closely examining possible legislative changes to reshape the business.
 At another House hearing, two former Moody's employees detailed allegations of misconduct at the big ratings firm as lawmakers took aim at an industry they condemned as rife with conflicts of interest and needing reform.
 Seeking accountability for the role of the ratings industry in the financial crisis, members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee questioned a high-level Moody's executive, who denied the former employees' claims.
 The rating agencies had to downgrade thousands of the securities last year as home-loan delinquencies soared and the value of those investments plummeted. The downgrades contributed to hundreds of billions in losses and write-downs at big banks and investment firms.
 The agencies are crucial financial gatekeepers, issuing ratings on the creditworthiness of public companies and securities. Their grades can be key factors in determining a company's ability to raise or borrow money, and at what cost securities will be purchased by banks, mutual funds, state pension funds or local governments.
 Moody's chief credit officer, Richard Cantor, acknowledged that the firm misjudged the extent of the subprime mortgage disaster, but said it has voluntarily made improvements to its operations and transparency over the past year.
 Appearing at the hearing next to the two former Moody's insiders, Mr. Cantor said the allegations of inflated ratings and conflicts of interest at the firm leveled by an ex-analyst, Eric Kolchinsky, are groundless.
 Moody's reviewed the complaints by Mr. Kolchinsky, who was suspended from his job, and found them to be ''unsupported,'' Mr. Cantor testified. He said Mr. Kolchinsky has refused to cooperate with Moody's inquiry into the matter.
 Mr. Kolchinsky told lawmakers that he thought that Moody's violated securities laws by issuing credit ratings the firm knew to be inaccurate. ''They still went forward and issued the rating,'' he said.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission contacted him on the matter only last week, Mr. Kolchinsky said.
 An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, said Tuesday that the agency ''has established an examination program for credit rating agencies'' that includes ''reviews of disclosures, policies and procedures regarding municipal securities ratings.''
 ''We are focusing carefully on the tips and complaints we receive and following up, where appropriate, with examinations targeting suspected problems,'' he said.
 The House panel's chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns, a New York Democrat, said the allegations, if true, ''indicate troubling behavior'' in the credit rating industry.
 But Mr. Kanjorski was less impressed by the Moody's insiders' allegations.
 ''I didn't hear anything terribly shocking,'' he said, asserting they presented no evidence of fraud or ''real gross neglect or negligence'' by Moody's.
 The other former Moody's employee, who was responsible for compliance, warned regulators in March about what he said were deficiencies in the firm's monitoring of municipal bonds.
 Scott McCleskey, who was a senior vice president for compliance at Moody's until he left a year ago, wrote a letter to the S.E.C. alleging a ''lack of meaningful surveillance of municipal securities, contrary to statements by Moody's to the public and to Congress.''
 Mr. McCleskey told the S.E.C. he became aware that New York-based Moody's did ''virtually no surveillance'' on public finance securities, the debt issued by states, counties, towns and school districts.
 When he raised concerns to managers, he said, his views were ignored. At one point last year he and others were told in a meeting that they were forbidden to mention the issue in any e-mails or other written form, Mr. McCleskey said.
 Although he was responsible for compliance, Mr. McCleskey said he was excluded from meetings with S.E.C. examiners -- who met only with staff members from Moody's legal department and outside attorneys. Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, said she found that ''shocking.''
 An S.E.C. official and high-ranking executives of Moody's, S.&P. and Fitch are scheduled to testify at the Financial Services panel's hearing. S.&P. is owned by McGraw-Hillc.
 The S.E.C. recently proposed rules designed to stem conflicts of interest and provide more transparency for credit rating agencies. One of the S.E.C.'s proposals would bar companies from ''shopping'' for favorable ratings of their securities, by requiring companies to disclose whether they had received preliminary ratings from other agencies.

HEADLINE: Answering Iran's Nuclear Challenge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''How to Press the Advantage With Iran,'' by Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett (Op-Ed, Sept. 29):
 How refreshing to read rational and accurate information about Iran, historical evidence of why Iranians are afraid for their security, and how the words ''axis of evil'' still resonate as America's warlike policy. 
 Diplomacy was what Barack Obama promised before he became president. This was an overwhelming reason for many to vote for him. How many years of war and death -- both of Americans and the people in those countries being invaded -- do we have to endure? 
 Not only does this policy threaten the moderates in Iran, but it also gives rise to the radical elements in the surrounding countries. 
 How I would like to see real diplomacy, which was promised to us this last election, and not the hypocritical words (and actions) of the past years. 
 Priscilla Ciccariello Sag Harbor, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Substitute the words ''Al Qaeda'' for ''Iran,'' and one understands very quickly why the Leveretts' proposal to work with Iran is so wrong.
 Iran and Al Qaeda are unapologetic sponsors of terror, responsible for the deaths of thousands around the world. They cannot possibly be compared to China during the Nixon era, as the Leveretts suggest, when China was largely a poor nation of peasants and was not training international death squads. 
 If we shudder at the idea of sitting down with Osama bin Laden, then negotiating with Iran should make us equally nauseated.
 Iran, like Nazi Germany, is simply a bully. It senses weakness acutely, and when we beg the Iranians to negotiate, even after they have violated prior agreements, we simply encourage more aggression.
 The United States' only recourse is to lead a coalition of the willing (Britain, Australia, Poland and Israel come to mind) to impose a blockade or take military action. Nothing short of that has any chance of success.
 Ari Weitzner New York, Sept. 29, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 The Op-Ed article by Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett urging that the United States pursue a new relationship with Iran based on a comprehensive framework of security and economic cooperation was a welcome injection of sanity into the mix of ultimatums, threats and defiance that have so far marked the exchanges over Iran's nuclear policy.
 It is surprising, however, that although the Leveretts point out Iran's understandable fear of American encirclement, they do not mention the Iranians' much more justifiable fear of an Israeli attack.
 If we expect the Iranians to refrain from developing a nuclear weapon, they must be assured of reciprocal restraint by Israel, which already has an arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
 A solution to the current standoff that is too seldom mentioned is a nuclear-free Middle East. A treaty based on such a solution would enhance the security of the entire region, including Iran and Israel. Rachelle Marshall Stanford, Calif., Sept. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''In New Confrontation With Iran, Path to Iraq Is Again in Spotlight'' (front page, Sept. 30): 
 It is encouraging that responsible people are cautioning against a rush to judgment with respect to Iran's nuclear program, and that the current administration is not predisposed to rush to war. Perhaps we have learned from the mistakes made over Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.
 I believe that the ultimate solution to nuclear proliferation can be found in the recommendations of Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, William J. Perry and George P. Shultz to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons. 
 In the meantime, I hope that the leaders of our country and countries throughout the world will use a combination of carrots and sticks to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons rather than threats of military retaliation, which may have the unintended consequence of causing Iran and other nations that do not currently possess nuclear weapons to pursue them. 
 John A. Viteritti Southold, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Several years ago, an Israeli intelligence official told me that if Iran ever came close to building an atomic bomb, Israel would destroy that country's nuclear facilities. And it appears that the critical moment has arrived. 
 Unless Iran, in coming talks with the United States, agrees to end its nuclear activities, Israeli pilots are virtually sure to rev up their engines.
 So far, the main deterrent has been Israeli concern over American and world reaction. But that concern now seems far less justified. For if the bombs thunder down, the world may shriek its outrage publicly. But behind closed doors, even Israel's foes and Iran's ''friends'' are likely to celebrate. Many Arabs view Iran as a greater danger than Israel, while the Russians and the Chinese, who have close financial ties with Iran, would no longer be pressured to support sanctions on that country.
 Thus, an Israeli air assault could turn Israel into a worldwide hero, however unheralded. Seemingly a fine, pragmatic solution to the Iranian threat -- if not to the Arab-Israeli problem. For it would surely improve the domestic standing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an unbudgeable hawk, and thereby indefinitely delay peace on that Middle Eastern front.

HEADLINE: State Issues Rules on Upstate Natural Gas Drilling Near City's Water

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Mireya Navarro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After months of deliberations, state environmental regulators on Wednesday released long-awaited rules governing natural gas production in upstate New York, including provisions to oversee drilling operations near New York City's water supplies.
 The regulations, in a report requested last year by Gov. David A. Paterson, do not ban drilling near the watersheds, as many environmental advocates had urged. But the report sets strict rules on where wells can be drilled and requires companies to disclose the chemicals they use.
 The prospect of gas drilling in upstate New York has stirred strong opposition from a coalition of environmental groups, city politicians and residents, who fear that expansive operations of this sort could contaminate the city's drinking water. But it has gained firm supporters upstate who say the economic benefits of a new gas boom far outweigh any potential risks, especially given the weakness of the economy. 
 The gas industry has argued that vast gas reserves could be found in the Marcellus Shale basin, which extends for roughly 600 miles through Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. 
 The million-acre watershed supplies 15 million people, including 9 million New Yorkers. The Department of Environmental Conservation, which issued the preliminary guidelines, said that it found no reasonable basis for a drilling ban near the watershed, but that measures were necessary to allay concerns raised last year in public hearings. 
 Under the new rules, for example, drillers would be required to disclose the chemical fluids used for each well. Buffer zones would be created around reservoirs and aqueducts in the watershed. Wells drilled within a 1,000-foot corridor of underground tunnels that carry drinking water to New York City would require special approval, and in some cases, state inspectors would have to be present during some phases of operations.
 The proposals will be open for public comment until Nov. 30, said Yancey Roy, a spokesman for the agency. State regulators will release their final report sometime next year, which will open the door for drilling permits to be issued. 
 Some critics of drilling said that they recognized that the regulators had made an effort to address some of their concerns and that drillers would have to comply with more stringent rules in New York than in other parts of the country. Still, they expressed some dissatisfaction. 
 ''We need to have a zero-risk policy here, and it is not appropriate to allow drilling in such a unique and extraordinarily valuable resource,'' said Kate Sinding, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The record in other states is so abysmal, and it doesn't take much to do better than other states.'' 
 About 8.5 percent of the Marcellus Shale within the state of New York is located under the New York City watershed, Ms. Sinding said. 
 The Manhattan Borough President, Scott M. Stringer, said the protections outlined did not go far enough and could expose the city to billions of dollars of expenses if it needed to invest in water filtration plants to counter contamination.
 ''A buffer zone is not a ban,'' he said. ''Quite frankly, a lot of these are half-baked measures that put the watershed at risk.''
 Mr. Stringer said that he was asking that the public comment period be extended to at least 90 days and that he had secured a commitment from both Mr. Paterson and the state environmental department's commissioner, Pete Grannis, that a hearing on the proposed rules would be held in New York City.
 Geologists have long known about the Marcellus Shale and its abundant gas reserves, but until recently there was no way to extract the fuel in an economical way. 
 That changed several years ago when operators figured out a way to merge two technologies: horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Because wells have been drilled horizontally, sometimes for miles, operators can now gain access to pockets of gas that would have been unreachable. High-pressure water mixed with chemicals is then injected into the wells to break the shale and allow natural gas to flow out. 
 Some geologists estimate that the Marcellus basin holds an estimated 500 trillion cubic feet of gas, of which 50 trillion cubic feet could be recovered. That would be enough to meet the nation's needs for about two years.
 There are already about 13,000 active oil and gas wells in New York, about half of them already using hydraulic fracturing. In drilling through shale, a great deal more water is needed to crack the rocks. While a conventional well requires using about 80,000 to 100,000 gallons of water, shale rocks require anywhere between three million to five million gallons per well.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Shrank Less Than Expected in Quarter

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The American economy performed better than expected this spring, contracting at its slowest pace in a year, the government reported on Wednesday. The report offered more evidence that the recession probably ended this summer, and that the economy would now grow through the end of the year. 
 The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product -- a billboard number that tallies the country's economic output -- shrank by an annual rate of 0.7 percent from April through June, a revision from earlier estimates of a 1 percent contraction.
 It was a sizable improvement from the pace of decline in the first quarter of the year, when the economy shrank at a rate of 6.4 percent as the financial crisis sent shock waves through the economy and caused businesses and consumers to virtually lock down spending and investment.
 The numbers for the second quarter appeared to get a lift from the government's $787 billion stimulus package. Federal, state and local governments spent more, and business spending on equipment and software was better than first reported. Military spending rose, and American exports posted a narrower drop than imports, a balance that lifts the government's G.D.P. figures. Economists were heartened by the final revisions after an earlier adjustment found no change in the pace of contraction in the second quarter.
 ''I think it sets the stage for a stronger rebound in the third quarter,'' Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, said. ''The stimulus program may be flowing through a little bit quicker than people had thought. State and local governments were so hard-pressed, and when the stimulus package passed it provided some immediate relief.''
 Many expect the economy to bounce back sharply -- at least on paper -- in the third quarter because of stimulus programs like the $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit and the $3 billion cash-for-clunkers program. Many economists anticipate that businesses will begin rebuilding their depleted inventories to make up for month after month of cost cutting.
 But none of this suggests that businesses will be creating many jobs anytime soon.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said the economy will feel very weak for some time, and many economists say millions of people will remain out of work even as the economy posts gains. The national unemployment rate, already at 26-year highs, is expected to climb to 9.8 percent when the government reports its monthly job figures on Friday.
 Personal spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, fell at a rate of 0.9 percent in the second quarter as people worried about job losses and tried to rebuild their guttered finances. And even though consumers thronged car dealerships when offered government rebates of $4,500 and are buying homes with the tax credits, many economists believe this spending will end once the taxpayer-financed enticements dry up. 
 In a more somber data point, a gauge of business activity in the Midwest faltered in September, falling to 46.1 after rising above a crucial threshold level of 50 a month earlier. The drop defied predictions that the Institute for Supply Management's Chicago Purchasing Managers Index would rise to 52.
 The numbers underscored how much weakness and slack remains in the economy, and came after last week's weaker reports on existing-home sales and orders for manufactured goods.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Bill to Keep Government Running

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With time running out, Congress on Wednesday passed a stopgap measure to keep the federal government operating for another month while it struggled to finish nearly a dozen overdue spending bills. 
 The interim spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, was needed since the current fiscal year was to expire at midnight. In the absence of the annual spending measures, the federal government technically would have no authority to spend any money on anything, including the armed forces.
 ''With our men and women in uniform fighting on two fronts, and with our economy in a critical stage in this recovery from the worst recession we have faced in several generations, it is inconceivable that we would allow for any disruption of the essential services provided by the federal government,'' said Senator Daniel Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
 The bill, approved by 62 to 38, continues spending for most federal agencies at current levels. It provided more money for veterans programs and the 2010 census while reducing by $4 billion a payment due from the financially struggling Postal Service to cover future retiree health care. 
 The interim bill was attached to a $4.7 billion spending measure covering the operations of Congress, a measure that drew criticism for being too generous with congressional projects and salaries when many Americans are suffering financially. 
 Republicans also criticized Democrats for putting the legislative budget measure first in the line of a dozen spending bills, suggesting that the majority was taking care of its own interests before finishing Pentagon and domestic security bills.
 But two procedural efforts to derail the spending initiative were defeated and there was never much doubt the Senate would send the plan to President Obama since lawmakers were eager to avoid a government shutdown and any resulting public backlash.
 Authors of the bill said the legislative measure provided an increase of 3.5 percent, or $156 million, in spending on Congress and related agencies such as the Capitol Police Department. The bill allocates $926 million for operating the Senate and $1.4 billion for the House.
 Senator Ben Nelson, the Nebraska Democrat and a chief author of the measure, said he considered the bill fiscally restrained except for $50 million added by the House for renovations to the Cannon Office Building, one of the three structures housing the personal offices of lawmakers. The Senate deferred to the House on that project.
 But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, led others in criticizing the measure as out of kilter with the downtown in the national economy.
 ''People who are having trouble making mortgage payments and putting food on the table are probably a little surprised although maybe they shouldn't be,'' Mr. McCain said. ''National unemployment is almost 10 percent, the public debt is close to $2 trillion and the deficit is projected to hit $1.6 trillion this year and we go on spending.''
 With the added breathing room, Congressional leaders will try to finish off the remaining 11 spending measures that have been slowed partially by a fight over earmarks, the pet projects sough by many lawmakers. Congress has had difficulty in recent years completing the measures on time given the focus on other business and sharp partisan differences.

HEADLINE: Lessons From U.S. For Private Equity

BYLINE: By LAUREN SILVA LAUGHLIN

 BODY:
Europeans pride themselves on their history. But in private equity it's the United States that has the benefit of experience. Outfits like Alchemy Partners and Permira are among the European buyout firms that have been forced by the financial crisis to adjust management teams and funds. Firms in the United States have problems too, but stronger debt markets, stickier investors and more mature operations are a few reasons the Americans are in better shape. 
 Most big American firms have been around a relatively long time. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts set up shop in 1976. Blackstone was established in 1985, and Carlyle a couple years later. Thus each had already suffered through a buyout blow-up, at the end of the 1980s. 
 With the odd exception like Candover, which hasn't escaped trouble despite its nearly 30-year history, European firms are mostly younger. Permira raised its first pan-European fund in 1996. Jon Moulton regarded as a veteran in the business, set up Alchemy Partners in 1997, and Guy Hands started Terra Firma in 2002.
 Perhaps as a result of their comparatively recent arrival on the scene, some European firms depended heavily on individual founders -- to their personal cost. Mr. Moulton recently stepped down amid public disagreement with his partners over Alchemy's strategy. Mr. Hands quit as chief executive of Terra Firma, though he has stayed on as chairman and chief investment officer. 
 Damon Buffini, chairman of Permira, also said in June that he would step down and become a plain old partner. The honchos of private equity funds in the United States, like K.K.R.'s Henry Kravis, remain in place. 
 That partly reflects more mature businesses that beefed up their management ranks during the boom. Blackstone's hiring of Hamilton James to run the firm day-to-day under founder Stephen A. Schwarzman is one example. And buyout firms in the United States appear to have managed their investors better. Consider Cerberus, the private equity firm that has had several troubled investments, including a $1.1 billion punt on Chrysler, the carmaker that subsequently sought bankruptcy. Even its most troubled funds are still around.
 Part of the reason is that quite a bit of investment cash comes from Cerberus executives themselves. Even allowing for that, American firms have had less trouble than European rivals keeping investors. 
 Conversely Permira, for instance, had to allow its investors to cut their future commitments to a fund by 40 percent last year when one large investor, SVG Capital, ran short of cash itself.
 Moreover, the United States firms did better damage control, not just with their fund investors but more recently with policy makers and the general public. The Europeans have faced more outrage. 
 American firms have also been quicker to get companies they own out of trouble. First, they have had more success finding ways to revise bank loans. European companies are finding it harder: Terra Firma, for instance, is now tangling with Citigroup to try to restructure the debt of the music group EMI.
 Additionally, the Americans have done a better job refinancing in the recovering debt markets, even though that can be a costly exercise. The high yield market, for example, has issued nearly six times as much as Western Europe has so far this year, according to Dealogic. Sure, the boom-time leveraged buyout market was always bigger than Europe's, but only by about 61 percent between 2005 and 2007, Dealogic reckons. 
 Some of the United States firms are even rebounding. K.K.R. is set to complete a merger with its Amsterdam-listed fund vehicle on Thursday as a step toward a New York listing. Blackstone's stock has more than tripled in price since February. 
 Of course, this could be a false dawn, especially if the United States firms' portfolios suffer more than expected in uncertain markets. And with investors still restless, they are far from home and dry. For now, though, it seems as if the relatively mature private equity firms in the United States have managed to steer a less troubled course than their adolescent European peers. It's a rare history lesson from the United States to Old Europe.

HEADLINE: Capturing the Dreams of Young Entrepreneurs on Film

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
MARY MAZZIO, a filmmaker who had already produced one movie about entrepreneurs, decided to make another on the subject last year, this one inspired by the work of a nonprofit group focused on at-risk youths.
 Ever since that first movie, ''Lemonade Stories,'' was produced in 2004, she said, ''I've been obsessed with the notion of entrepreneurs,'' adding, ''It really is just a metaphor for being an adventure in life.''
 While ''Lemonade Stories'' looked at the influence of mothers on entrepreneurs, her new documentary ''Ten9Eight: Shoot for the Moon,'' follows a group of students from ''Harlem to Compton and all points in between'' as they compete in a business plan contest run by the nonprofit group Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship.
 ''In America,'' the trailer states, ''a kid drops out of high school every nine seconds. Imagine if they didn't.'' 
 Starting Nov. 13, the new movie, ''Ten9Eight,'' will be shown at select AMC theaters in cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In addition to a theater release, Ms. Mazzio is in talks with several companies to show the film next year on television.
 ''I hope millions of kids see it,'' said Steve Mariotti, the founder of Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship. For some youngster out there, he said. ''it will be life-changing.'' 
 Next Wednesday, the competition that inspired the film, the OppenheimerFunds/NFTE National Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge 2009, will hold its final rounds at the Marriott Marquis in Midtown Manhattan. Twenty-nine aspiring entrepreneurs, ages 13 to 19, all of whom have had to overcome huge obstacles, Mr. Mariotti said, are vying for the $10,000 grand prize.
 There is a long history of promoting entrepreneurship among youths in this country. Junior Achievement was formed by business leaders, community volunteers and educators in the 1920s and is a worldwide program today. Its Web site, www.ja.org, notes that hundreds of thousands of volunteers reach millions of students each year.
 In September, a national survey from Junior Achievement found that most teenagers who were questioned thought that entrepreneurship should be taught in college or earlier. Nearly half, 46 percent, said kindergarten through grade 12 would be the best time to learn the essentials.
 Half the students surveyed by Junior Achievement said they would like to start a business someday. But most believed it would be ''difficult but possible'' or ''somewhat challenging'' to do so in this economic climate. 
 ''Teens are not only paying attention to the economy, but these poll results also clearly demonstrate that they're also hungry to learn the skills it takes to start and grow a business,'' Jack Kosakowski, president of Junior Achievement USA, said in releasing the survey results.
 Other groups are paying attention as well. The Young Entrepreneur Foundation, part of the nonprofit group National Federation of Independent Business, has developed an online small-business game for high school students. 
 The simulation game, Johnny Money, was developed with the help of the Wharton Societal Wealth Program at the University of Pennsylvania. It allows students to create virtual businesses.
 According to Julie Carney, senior manager for the Young Entrepreneur Foundation programs, more than 100,000 virtual businesses have been created in the game's first year. ''Hopefully, playing the game will encourage students to consider careers as entrepreneurs and small-business owners,'' Ms. Carney said.
 A byproduct of the game, said Prof. Ian C. MacMillan, co-director of the Wharton program, is that it creates ''employability.'' Not everyone will be an entrepreneur, but everyone will need a job, he said.
 Students who have played the game come away with practical knowledge about business decision-making, how to complete day-to-day tasks like taking inventory and how to treat people at work. ''They learn a huge amount'' and in the process become significantly more employable, he said.
 Wharton and the foundation intend to take the game to all English-speaking countries next, then to countries that teach English. The hope is to create a version in Spanish, Professor MacMillan said. ''We think it's something really profoundly far-reaching.''
 Mr. Mariotti started his Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship in the Bronx in 1987 and now has a annual budget of about $15 million domestically and $5 million overseas to work with more than 60,000 children worldwide. Eventually, he wants to create a world championship business plan competition. 
 The goal is to provide students with tools to become entrepreneurs, with boot camps, incubators and contests. Participants receive at least 60 hours of training, which helps them prepare for the competition -- and, as important, keeps them in school.
 The group has commissioned research to evaluate program effectiveness and maintains a vibrant alumni community. In a follow-up survey of alumni, the network found that 70 percent were students at the postsecondary level, 43 percent had part-time jobs and 33 percent were still running a business.
 One successful alumnae is Jasmine Lawrence, 18, now a computer engineering freshman at Georgia Tech University. With the help of the group, she started a business called Eden Body Works, selling beauty products. The business took off, her products were sold in Wal-Mart and she was featured on ''Oprah,'' all as a teenager.
 ''The boot camp with N.F.T.E. gave me all the tools I needed to be a young entrepreneur,'' she said. ''They still continue to nurture me.''
 Currently, she said, she is in confidential talks with a buyer for Eden Body Works, which has allowed her to focus on her next goal of ''doing amazing things in technology.''
 ''Being in college has been a big change for me,'' Ms. Lawrence said. ''My course load is huge, the classes are hard. I feel like a real student now.''
 Her story is told as well in ''Ten9Eight.''
 Ms. Mazzio said, ''I want as many kids who can see it and look at their lives and those in the film, and say, 'Yes, I'm facing these same obstacles. They look like me and talk like me and they are moving ahead.' ''
 She got the approval from a backer, the Templeton Foundation, to start shooting the film in the spring of 2008. 
 ''We were off and running,'' Ms. Mazzio said. ''It was really exciting. I didn't know how this story would end. We were making bets: who do we think will take the cake, who will win the contest? We didn't care, but their stories were so compelling, it was so interesting that I went from city to city to city.''
 Usually stories about disadvantaged youth in the inner cities are bleak, she added, but ''this film is meant to be the exact opposite.''

HEADLINE: Bharti and MTN Abandon Talks on Potential Merger

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Politics appears to have trumped business in emerging markets on Wednesday, when the Indian company Bharti Airtel and its South African rival, the MTN Group, called off a $24 billion deal to create a low-cost telecommunications giant. 
 The two companies have been in intensive talks for about four months, but the deal was ultimately derailed by the South African and Indian governments, according to people on both sides of the transaction. This is the second time that MTN, South Africa's flagship phone company, and Bharti, India's largest mobile company, have come close to a deal and then called it off. 
 Governments in emerging markets and global development groups have trumpeted the benefits of more ''South-South'' trade, or trade between developing countries, as a way to ease poverty and secure economic growth. But striking deals can be difficult because of immature capital markets and hands-on governments, which make corporations less independent than their counterparts in developed economies. 
 The Bharti-MTN deal was also heralded as a way to counterbalance China's growing influence in both sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. China recently passed the United States as the largest export destination for South African goods, and became South 
 Africa's largest trading partner, according to the South Africa's Department of Trade and Industry. 
 In this case, protectionism may have gotten the upper hand. While management from both MTN and Bharti were ready to move on a deal, the two governments were not, said analysts, executives and deal makers involved in the talks. 
 ''The deal was pretty much through from the companies' perspective, but the governments could not see eye to eye,'' said Kamlesh Bhatia, a principal research analyst with the consulting firm Gartner. Heavy government intervention had not been anticipated because both companies are publicly traded and controlled by investors. 
 But the South African government, under Jacob G. Zuma, who became president in May, has been jockeying to maintain and create national corporate icons, say bankers who do deals in the country. 
 In this instance, the government pushed for MTN Group, a mobile and fixed-line phone company with more than 100 million subscribers, to maintain a listing in Johannesburg as well as on India's exchange in Mumbai, which is against Indian rules. 
 The government also seemed anxious to maintain MTN's local character. Speaking about MTN early Wednesday, South Africa's communications minister Siphiwe Nyanda said ''It would be sad if we saw this entity move into the hands and management of foreign nationals.'' 
 India's financial regulators were also inflexible. They were not willing to immediately change rules about dual-listings, said people involved. Regulators and finance officials from South Africa visited India last week to meet with their counterparts here, but the two groups could not reach a compromise. 
 Many other countries have no such dual-listing prohibitions, and MTN will probably attract the interest of telecommunications companies in other emerging market countries, analysts say.
 Wednesday was the last day for Bharti and MTN to agree to a deal, according to a deadline set by both companies.
 Bharti blamed the South African government for the deal's collapse. ''This structure needed an approval from the government of South Africa, which has expressed its inability to accept it in the current form,'' Bharti Airtel said in a statement. Bharti Airtel sounded a regretful note Wednesday, calling the alliance a ''vision based on solid fundamentals'' that could have offered ''substantial synergies.'' 
 The deal would have been the single largest foreign direct investment into South Africa, Bharti noted. ''We hope the South African government will review its position in the future and allow both companies an opportunity to re-engage,'' Bharti said. 
 Last year, Bharti and MTN discussed a tie-up for several weeks before Bharti suddenly called off talks. 
 At the time, Bharti approached MTN about a deal that would essentially be a takeover. The Indian company's management was surprised when MTN turned the proposition around, and suggested that it take over Bharti instead. Later, another Indian telecommunications firm, Reliance ADA Group, made a run for MTN, but their offer was also unsuccessful. 
 MTN, which is the largest or second-largest telecommunications company in 21 markets in Africa and the Middle East, will most likely be the target of another takeover offer from outside India, analysts said. China Mobile or a Middle Eastern carrier are probable buyers, they say.

HEADLINE: Donor Gives Lincoln Center $10 Million

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When David M. Rubenstein turned 54, he read that white Jewish males were likely to live to 81. ''So I said, 'I have 27 years to go,' '' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''I could be like the pharaohs and say, 'Bury me with my money.' Or I could start giving it away.''
 Mr. Rubenstein, who turned 60 last month, has spent the last six years doing just that. Having amassed a fortune worth $2.7 billion, according to Forbes, as managing director of the Carlyle Group, the heavyweight private equity concern that he helped found in 1987, he currently serves on the boards of about 30 major institutions and says he donates generously to all of them. 
 Now Mr. Rubenstein has given $10 million to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts for its $1.2 billion redevelopment project. In appreciation, the center's new visitors' and ticket space on Broadway -- scheduled to open Nov. 24 -- will be named the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center. The redesigned indoor space, between 62nd and 63rd Streets and running from Broadway to Columbus Avenue, was formerly known as the Harmony Atrium.
 ''You can go there and get discounted tickets, and there will be free concerts,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday at Lincoln Center. ''I thought it was a very good idea.''
 Like movie stars, philanthropists have their golden periods, when they are in ascent and in demand. By that measure, this is Mr. Rubenstein's moment. In the same year, 2004, he joined the boards of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and of Lincoln Center, where he is now vice chairman. In May he was named to the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, its Congressionally appointed governing body.
 Mr. Rubenstein is also on the boards of Duke University in Durham, N.C., where he earned his bachelor's degree; the University of Chicago, where he earned his law degree; and Johns Hopkins University, which is in his hometown, Baltimore. 
 He underwrites scholarships for Washington students -- Mr. Rubenstein himself lives in Bethesda, Md. -- and is on the board of, among others, the Council on Foreign Relations, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Asia Society, Ford's Theater and the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution. 
 Somehow, Mr. Rubenstein finds time for them all. Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, said: ''You can never send him an e-mail and not get a response within three minutes. He's a very disciplined, organized man.''
 This is not Mr. Rubenstein's first high-profile gift. In 2007 he paid $21.3 million for a 710-year-old copy of the Magna Carta, the British declaration of human rights that served as the foundation for the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Mr. Rubenstein bought the last one in private hands and gave it to the National Archives in Washington. 
 Mr. Rubenstein also bought a copy of the Declaration of Independence, which he loaned to the National Archives, and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, which he loaned to the Smithsonian. 
 And he has underwritten the restoration of two Torah scrolls, one from the Auschwitz concentration camp and another from Dachau.
 Mr. Rubenstein describes himself as a workaholic, and he also sounds like something of an ascetic. He is on a plane 250 days a year. He does not drink, smoke, eat meat or ''chase women'' and credits his constant work pace with keeping him healthy. ''I've never been sick a day in my life,'' he said.
 ''Why would anybody want to drink?'' he added. ''I don't want to be loose. I like where I am.''
 Growing up an only child in an exclusively Jewish neighborhood of Baltimore, Mr. Rubenstein had modest beginnings. His father sorted mail for the United States Postal Service. His mother was a homemaker. 
 ''When I was growing up, I didn't think about money because I didn't have any money,'' he said. Mr. Rubenstein wanted to go into public service and said he went to the schools that gave him the biggest scholarships. 
 After law school Mr. Rubenstein joined the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he helped create the Municipal Assistance Corporation during New York's fiscal crisis of the 1970s. ''I liked the intersection between government and business,'' he said. 
 Carlyle, based in Washington, manages more than $85 billion from 29 offices around the world and owns 400 companies, including Hertz and Dunkin' Donuts. In June the company paid a $20 million settlement and agreed to change its business practices in response to an investigation by New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, into the use of outside intermediaries, known as placement agents, often politically connected people hired to help investment firms gain access to state pension fund officials. 
 While Carlyle hasn't been immune to the economic downturn, Mr. Rubenstein said, ''we have weathered the storm pretty well.'' 
 After making sure his three grown children are provided for and helping support the work of his wife, Alice Rogoff, as co-founder and chairwoman of the Alaska Native Arts Foundation, Mr. Rubenstein said, he wants to direct his money toward a range of worthy causes. ''My view is, if you have money, you can spend it, you can save it, or you can give it away,'' he said. ''I bought all the things I need to buy.''
 Over the next five years, Mr. Rubenstein said, he plans to narrow his benefactors ''to ones where I feel I will make the most impact.'' For now, he is trying to jam in as much he can. ''I'm sprinting to the finish,'' he said. ''I want to work harder the next 20 years than I did the last 20. When you turn 60, you realize you've lived more than half your life.''
 ''Being happy in life is not easy,'' he said. ''I would give up all the money I have if I could be 50. You can always make money.''

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Orchestra Announces New Chief

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Orchestra took a major step toward finding a way out of a financial and managerial mess on Wednesday, announcing that it had hired a permanent chief executive after an extended leadership vacuum.
 The decision means the orchestra can now fully embark on the search for a permanent music director. It has been operating under the temporary guidance of a principal conductor, Charles Dutoit, who has a long relationship with the orchestra.
 The unsettled state at the orchestra's top and its deep financial problems have led to fears for the future of one of the world's storied musical institutions. 
 The board of directors' choice to run the orchestra is Allison Vulgamore, who has spent nearly 17 years as president of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and, along the way, become one of the highest-paid orchestra executives in the country. She starts on Feb. 3.
 In a brief telephone interview, Ms. Vulgamore said her first tasks were to ''align'' the sometimes competing views on the board and in the orchestra. She also said she would come up with a new business model. 
 ''We need to be the first major orchestra to find balancing excellence with fiscal stability and have no regrets about having done it,'' she said. ''There's a lack of infrastructure around the business acumen'' at the Philadelphia Orchestra, she said.
 Ms. Vulgamore's immediate tasks will include dealing with deficits, something that many orchestras face as the recession shrivels endowments and donations. Philadelphia's last fiscal year, ending in August, produced a $3.3 million deficit, and a $7.5 million gap is expected this fiscal year. Ticket sales are also down.
 The Philadelphia Orchestra cited what it said were Ms. Vulgamore's successes in Atlanta: raising the endowment, tripling the budget, enlarging the audience and adding educational programs. An amphitheater for outdoor performances also opened on her watch. The orchestra itself increased its profile and flourished musically.
 Richard B. Worley, the Philadelphia Orchestra's new chairman, called Ms. Vulgamore a ''very smart person with long, deep and successful experience in transforming an orchestra.''
 But a plan to build the Atlanta Symphony an expensive new home, designed by Santiago Calatrava, fell through, with only $114 million of $300 million raised. One arts consultant said Ms. Vulgamore should be held at least partly responsible for the failure. 
 ''Ultimately it comes down to the executive and the committee that was responsible for the fund-raising,'' said Drew McManus, the consultant, who runs a Web site about the orchestra business.
 Ms. Vulgamore's last reported salary -- $598,000, up from $422,000 a year earlier -- outstripped that of the last executive director in Philadelphia, James Undercofler. He earned $420,000, even though Philadelphia is considered a more elite orchestra.
 Ms. Vulgamore was the fifth-highest-paid chief executive in the 2005-6 season, the latest in which complete figures were available, while the orchestra's budget was the 12th biggest and its musicians ranked No. 15 in base pay, according to Mr. McManus's figures.
 ''I think she was paid an extraordinarily large sum with an extraordinarily large increase,'' he said. ''I don't think she should be paid more than the executive from Chicago.'' Deborah R. Card, the president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, earned $425,000 for the 2007-8 season, according to tax forms.
 Mr. Worley declined to comment on Ms. Vulgamore's salary but said the orchestra was willing to pay for the best candidate.
 Ms. Vulgamore said the Atlanta Symphony's home, the Woodruff Arts Center, was responsible for canceling the Calatrava project. She also declined to comment on salary issues, but pointed out that she contributed 18 percent of her pay back to the orchestra and made other donations to it.

HEADLINE: No-Fault Fixer-Upper

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
UNDER certain circumstances, the smell of a whole roast turkey could help sell a house. Even Preston Wright, a vegetarian, would grant you that.
The main problem with the turkey that greeted Mr. Wright when he first scouted his future home in St. Paul was a matter of timing. It had sat in the oven for a month. 
 Or two. Mr. Wright doesn't really know. Whatever happened to the home's previous resident -- and her 11 foster children -- all he knows is that they left in a hurry. 
 ''It's astonishing to me that they were showing this home and they hadn't cleaned it up,'' he said. But when you buy a house out of foreclosure, a more common occurrence since the housing bust, unsavory surprises are part of the bargain. 
 Mr. Wright first had a whiff of his unlikely new dwelling at the end of June 2008, but he had been hoping for weeks to get a tour. The home in the city's unfashionable east side had gone into foreclosure in October 2007 -- along with some 1,800 other St. Paul houses that year, according to the city's Department of Safety and Inspections. Mr. Wright had taken to scanning Ramsey County aerial maps in search of these bank-owned properties. 
 He wasn't a property flipper trying to cash in on the housing crisis but part of a small wave of new urban homesteaders. The City of St. Paul said the number of buyers moving into once-vacant properties has nearly doubled, year over year, while foreclosures have started to fall.
 Mr. Wright was prospecting his own neighborhood, Highwood Hills, for a particular kind of place. He had lived in the neighborhood since 2000 with his partner, Philip Blackburn, and knew that dozens of hobby farms had once dotted the area, 10 minutes east of downtown. Some of the small farms had never been developed, so Mr. Wright began daydreaming: he wanted to buy a place big enough to grow an orchard within the city limits.
 Last summer, Mr. Blackburn was tooling around on his motorcycle and spotted a for-sale sign on a piece of property that his partner had been coveting. Mr. Wright had seen the bank-owned parcel on the government maps, and it had just gone on the market. The land he came upon included a farmhouse dating from 1900 on 2.6 acres that had never been developed. But that doesn't mean it hadn't been used. Along with a lawn and open fields, the yard contained a family garbage dump, a buried stone patio, a tree house, a collapsed horse corral and a teetering garage. All for $316,000. 
 Even that price might have been too expensive for Mr. Wright, who is an experimental electronic composer and a Web producer for Minnesota Public Radio.
 ''We're just artists who happen to work for nonprofits,'' said Mr. Blackburn, 46, who manages Innova, the record label of the American Composers Forum. ''We're not born into excessive amounts of money.''
 Yet while everyone else was signing up for exploding loans with exotic names, Mr. Wright was salting 50 percent of his income into investments and retirement accounts. ''I've always been an extreme saver,'' he said. Improbably, Mr. Wright had reached age 43 without ever possessing a credit card, a car loan or any other consumer debt. 
 The two decided that Mr. Wright would buy the house and Mr. Blackburn would pay for the renovations. Mr. Wright was prepared to put down 10 percent. But that was no guarantee a bank would gamble on the rest. The house was a 3,600-square-foot jumble of additions, with eight tiny bedrooms. Who knew what it was actually worth? 
 The bank's appraiser said the structure would need repairs before a loan could be approved. There were three broken boards on the patio stairs, for instance. And the kitchen cabinets needed doors. 
 On some level, the fix-it list was absurd, Mr. Wright said. The house had no working heat. The electricity came off a temporary hook-up -- a glorified extension cord. ''The owner of the property was Deutsche Bank in Germany,'' he said, and ''they weren't coming over to fix it.''
 The situation baffled Mr. Wright: to qualify for a mortgage, he would first have to trespass and repair those cabinet doors. ''This is a kitchen that 24 hours later'' -- after closing on the house -- ''we would tear out,'' Mr. Blackburn added. 
 Mr. Wright closed on the house in August 2008, and Mr. Blackburn took an equity loan against his own home (which he now rents out) and began acquiring the materials they needed, eventually spending $15,000 on the renovation. The place needed new floors, new cabinets, new fixtures, new toilets, new appliances and new sinks. In some rooms, it needed new walls. They did almost all the work themselves. 
 They got a lot for the money. Mr. Blackburn, a self-described ''bargain whore,'' had excellent timing. During an economic panic, construction materials and home furnishings go on sale. By haggling, he scored ceramic Italian floor tile for $4 a square foot, about half the original price. He picked up 1,600 square feet of Brazilian koa flooring from Lumber Liquidators for $3.49 a square foot -- more than $1 a square foot below its current price.
 The tubs, toilets, sinks and mirrors came from Craigslist. Mr. Blackburn is especially proud of the glass vessel sink retrieved from the owners of a McMansion in the suburbs. The canary-colored basin and a matching glass vanity cost $200, and came in its original packaging. 
 Craigslist also provided tools for the job: an air compressor, a tile saw, a ladder. ''You certainly don't want to rent them,'' Mr. Wright said. ''Because it's not going to take you three nights. It's going to take you three months.''
 It actually took a year to lay the flooring and tile, rehab the bathrooms and kitchen, and resuscitate the heating system. ''What you save in money, you lose in time,'' Mr. Blackburn said. He had some construction experience from building musical installations like a ''sonic playground'' for a St. Paul park. Mostly, the men had been educated in home renovation from YouTube videos and a steady diet of HGTV. The TV sat unplugged for six months while they toiled every evening into the night. 
 They settled into an amicable division of labor. Mr. Wright spent this spring and summer taming the yard, planting hundreds of seedlings, a vegetable plot and a wildflower garden. Mr. Blackburn did battle with the flooring, tiling and plumbing. 
 The design emerged through negotiation. ''I gave him permission to do any colors he wanted,'' Mr. Blackburn said.
 ''That's the way he phrases it,'' Mr. Wright said. ''I didn't trust him to pick any colors.''
 ''And I didn't trust him anywhere near a power tool.''
 The dingy basement, with its warren of low-slung bedrooms, now has a floor made from rubber playground squares, and walls lined with funhouse Mylar mirrors. For the toilet in the master bath they crafted a stately mantel out of scrap marble. 
 Ultimately, Mr. Wright was reassured that design blunders could not damage the value of the house. That's because, according to the county tax office, it had very little. In 2008, the assessor put the value of the structure at $48,800. But he priced the land at $337,900. 
 Mr. Wright puts more stock in his new home. There's plenty of space. Each man keeps a music studio. This is where Mr. Blackburn, an environmental sound artist, stores some of his handmade instruments, including a shofar fashioned from the nether regions of a walrus. The couple's Savannah cat, Percy, has his own three-room suite. 
 In truth, however, it's the land that brought Mr. Wright to this spot, and it's the land where his wildest ambitions lie. On a recent weekday evening, Mr. Wright offered a tour of his grounds. This can take a while. The lot is 600 feet deep. You can push a lawnmower all weekend, Mr. Wright said, and not finish the job. 
 Three rows of newly planted apple trees, 52 in all, run down a gentle slope -- what Mr. Wright calls the Grand Alley. Two years from now, each sapling will start producing a different variety of apple. How long is this colonnade? 
 ''About a seven-iron,'' Mr. Blackburn said. 
 ''You need to be able to come down from the house in a grand way,'' Mr. Wright said. ''A woman would pick up her skirts and mosey down this way.''
 ''Or a drag queen,'' Mr. Blackburn said.
 Seven peach trees stand at the top of the hill; 17 hazelnut bushes rest near the bottom. A hundred blueberry shrubs, to the south, branch off the Grand Alley. And who knows where all 29 grape varietals reside? The budget for the orchard came in at $3,500 -- plus another $1,700, if you count the wood chipper, the rototiller and two riding mowers. 
 His orchard passion dates to a childhood spent in Washington state's fruit country, where he walked to school every day through vineyards and orchards. This new vista in Minnesota is his attempt to get back there, and perhaps a test run for eventually working on the 93 acres of jungle he and his partner own in Belize, which they bought with traveler's checks. 
 In the meantime, the place still has its share of discoveries. 
 Mr. Blackburn, at that very moment, needed to show Mr. Wright something in the melon patch. Mr. Wright strode over. He breathed in quickly and covered his mouth. 
 ''Oh, my god. The deer. It's dead,'' Mr. Wright said.
 A doe had gotten her head stuck in a scrap of old iron fencing that was anchored in the ground. The couple had cleared three bed frames and a mound of trash, but endless junk still lurks. ''Oh boy,'' Mr. Wright said. Flies buzzed over the carcass. 
 Before fall settled in, Mr. Wright said, there was a leaking porch to mend, unsightly stairs to refinish and a demolished bedroom wall to rebuild. And now there was a burial pit to dig. 
 From their land they could see the sun setting, a ripe peach rolling over the glass towers of the St. Paul and Minneapolis skylines. The neighboring houses don't have the same view, Mr. Wright explained. The place next door, he said, a 2.4-acre spread, has been on and off the market for three years, and is currently priced at $249,900. 
 Naturally, Mr. Wright is interested. ''Don't encourage him,'' Mr. Blackburn said. ''There's no view, it's surrounded by trees and the house is a piece of junk.'' 
 But that may just be the couple's bargaining position. Mr. Wright is hoping the seller becomes ''desperate,'' he said. ''I'm waiting for it to get cheaper.''

HEADLINE: With Eye on Better Future, Nets Try to Focus on Now

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
An adage in professional sports says that an organization can successfully market one of two things: wins or hope. 
 The Nets ran low on the first last season and near fumes on the other. In a short span, they traded three popular players, adding youth but not always more immediate talent. They play in an outdated arena and sustained crippling financial losses. The franchise had already placed one foot in Brooklyn, a proposed move that has been ensnarled in legal and regulatory challenges, and the economic downturn. 
 Then came the announcement that the Russian tycoon Mikhail D. Prokhorov would become the team's principal owner, giving the Nets revitalized hope for the new arena in Brooklyn and deep pockets to lure free agents. 
 The deal maintains the organization's wishful eye toward a better future. In the present, Prokhorov's involvement, which needs the approval of N.B.A. owners, adds another layer to a franchise caught in purgatory. 
 The Nets are between owners. They are between homes. And as a basketball team, they are in the middle of a transition, having traded the All-Star Vince Carter and his sizable contract this off-season, along with Ryan Anderson, to the Orlando Magic for Courtney Lee, Rafer Alston and Tony Battie. 
 ''Yeah, we're in a tough situation,'' said guard Devin Harris, who without Carter will become more of an offensive centerpiece after averaging 21.3 points and 6.9 assists a game last season. ''Obviously the move to Brooklyn has kind of separated us from our fans a little bit. It's not something we can control. The best we can do is go out and win as much as we can.''
 The added roster pieces were on hand Tuesday for the Nets' first practice. They joined a team with several building blocks and no obvious cornerstone. When a reporter asked Coach Lawrence Frank to talk about the Nets' new players, he responded: ''Which ones? I've got a lot of new ones.''
 He must steer the team through the present, as murky as it may be, without being preoccupied with a new owner and arena. The Nets finished 34-48 last season, tied for 11th in the N.B.A.'s Eastern Conference. 
 ''All that other stuff, as much it's news, it really doesn't impact them,'' Frank said. ''They're in a Nets uniform, they're going to bust their tails to represent the Nets. That stuff, they have no control over. So I think it's like that horse that wears the blinders. You can't get distracted by things you can't control.'' 
 Still, some of the Nets are sneaking a peek. The backup point guard Keyon Dooling acknowledged that he scanned the headlines about the team's off-the-court moves. 
 ''Of course you pay attention to it,'' Dooling said. ''Why wouldn't you? The type of owner you have directly affects salaries, budgeting, facilities, etc., etc. That's a part of the game as well, that you should pay attention to. I think it's a misconception that jocks don't care. That they just go out and play. That's a big misconception. Guys should take more time to say what they have to say about that instead of just saying the political answers.''
 In some ways, it is fitting that the Nets have an international owner. Their roster includes Yi Jianlian, who plays for China's national team, and Eduardo Najera, the only player in the league born in Mexico. 
 ''We have a global game,'' Dooling said. ''We have international players. We've got a businessman who has done far and beyond what most people in the world have done, so why should it be a big deal when he wants to come and expand his brand?'' 
 The current roster may not resemble the one Prokhorov or Brooklyn inherits. Seven players have contracts that expire after this season. In addition, Frank; Rod Thorn, the team president; and Kiki Vandeweghe, the general manager, are in the final year of their contracts. 
 Harris, Lee and the second-year center Brook Lopez combine for a solid core. If Prokhorov's deal with the developer Bruce C. Ratner for an 80 percent stake in the team receives the approval of at least three-fourths of the league's owners, the Nets could become buyers instead of annual sellers and re-emerge as participants in the free-agent sweepstakes in 2010. That is when LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh are scheduled to become free agents. 
 Prokhorov, who owns a share of the Russian basketball team CSKA Moscow, carries a reputation as a players' owner. 
 ''With a new owner whose reputation is a winning reputation, obviously, we have a little more direction,'' Harris said. ''Obviously, Brooklyn looks like it could be a little bit more of a possibility now. And then we'll kind of go from there.'' 
 If so, Frank's job will be made easier. The Nets have no stars, he emphasized, only one team. 
 ''It's everyone's team, and everyone has to take ownership in it,'' Frank said. ''You can't just put it on one guy.''
 Left unsaid was that Prokhorov may be the one guy the organization needs to firmly take ownership.

HEADLINE: Businessmen In Honduras Offer Plan To End Crisis

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Ginger Thompson contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras 

 BODY:
Stung by the loss of their American visas and concerned about Honduras's increasing international isolation, the country's leading businessmen have put forward their own plan to resolve the political crisis here. 
 In the plan, which was made public earlier this week, supporters of the coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya three months ago have for the first time suggested his return as president. But at the same time the plan calls for him to face trial on charges that he stole money while in office. 
 ''What we're trying to do is break the ice,'' said Adolfo J. Facusse, president of the country's manufacturing association. 
 Mr. Facusse said he had put forward his own proposal because he thought that other countries, particularly the United States, were preparing to reject the results of a presidential election scheduled for Nov. 29. The State Department has warned that it may not accept the results if there is no political agreement. 
 ''They continue deteriorating our elections process,'' Mr. Facusse said. ''This is the most destructive thing they can do in a democracy.'' 
 He added, ''The less support the candidates have, the less they can do to solve the problems.'' 
 The United States has stepped up sanctions in stages in an effort to press the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti to negotiate with Mr. Zelaya. After initially suspending military aid and then some economic aid, the United States said in early September that it would revoke visas to members of the de facto government and their supporters. 
 When Mr. Facusse arrived in Miami on Sept. 12, immigration officials told him that he was no longer welcome. The United States Embassy declined to say which other business leaders had had their visas revoked. 
 Mr. Facusse and other leaders have proposed that after an accord is reached, troops or police officers from other countries in the hemisphere will keep the peace and an interim multiparty government will take charge. Mr. Zelaya would face trial, but he would not serve prison time if convicted; instead, he would be sentenced to house arrest. 
 Nelson Avila, an economic adviser to Mr. Zelaya, said the ''plan was born dead.''
 ''The dialogue is based on the presumption of guilt of President Zelaya, and legally that does not exist,'' he said. 
 There are other signs that the coalition of politicians, businessmen and the military that supported the coup is feeling pressure from the international community. On Monday, the political parties forced Mr. Micheletti to back away from a decree suspending civil liberties.
 The main presidential candidates have already tried to jump-start the negotiations, traveling to Costa Rica to meet with the country's president, Oscar Arias, who has tried to mediate peace talks. Mr. Arias's proposal, known as the San Jose Accord, calls for restoring Mr. Zelaya as president, but sharply curtailing his powers. The plan would provide a full amnesty to both sides. 
 Last week the presidential candidates met with Mr. Zelaya, who secretly returned to Honduras on Sept. 21 and has taken refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. 
 Mr. Facusse said that Mr. Micheletti agreed to consider his plan after he suggested that Mr. Micheletti step down as leader of the de facto government and be named congressman for life. 
 Mr. Facusse was clearly dissatisfied with the efforts of other countries to mediate the crisis here. ''Because of the bad image the military created, everybody interfered, and we ended up with the San Jose Accord,'' he said.
 One of the de facto government's main supporters in Washington, Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, has announced plans to visit Tegucigalpa on Friday. One Congressional staff member said Mr. DeMint hoped to meet with members of the de facto government and other Hondurans. Other staff members said he intended to encourage Mr. Micheletti and his supporters to resist.

HEADLINE: Web Survey Finds Speed Is Quickest Overseas

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The performance of broadband Internet connections has surged ahead in many countries in the last year, even before government stimulus packages aimed at upgrading networks take full effect, according to a study to be published Thursday.
 The most advanced broadband connections are in South Korea, Japan and Sweden, according to the study, conducted by the Said Business School at Oxford and the University of Oviedo in Spain, and sponsored by Cisco Systems, the telecommunications equipment maker.
 The work differs from some other efforts to assess how countries stack up on the basis of broadband, a form of high-speed Internet connection, because it measures the performance of these connections, rather than simply comparing market penetration rates. As broadband has become more widespread -- some governments want to turn it into a universal service like electricity or water -- the quality of connections has grown more important. 
 The study takes into account the download and upload speeds of Internet connections, along with the latency, or delay, in the hookup. These measures will be increasingly important in the future, Cisco says, as consumers embrace online services like high-definition Internet television and video conferencing.
 The top three countries, along with six others in Europe, have sufficiently robust Internet connections to allow the average broadband customer to take advantage of these kinds of services already, according to the survey. A year ago, in an early survey by Cisco, only one country, Japan, met these criteria.
 Sixteen more countries, including the United States, France and Germany, fell into the second-highest category, meaning that the average Internet connection ''comfortably'' handles the needs of consumers for popular Web uses today, including social networking and low-definition video streaming. For the United States, that was a jump from last year, when the average Internet connection only barely met users' needs, according to the survey.
 Fernando Gil de Bernabe, a senior director at Cisco, cited network upgrades by Internet providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T as a reason for the better performance.
 ''Last year, it was quite painful for the U.S.,'' he said. ''This year it showed a big improvement.''
 But the United States still ranked behind such poorer countries as Bulgaria and Romania, the survey showed. Internet connections in Eastern Europe are often superior because network operators invested straight into the latest equipment, leapfrogging past broadband providers in other countries.
 Highlighting performance gaps is, for Cisco, a way to try to drive sales of networking equipment. But governments have also been paying more attention to speed and other quality issues, as broadband has climbed the political agenda in national capitals. A number of countries have recently announced or started to put into effect spending plans aimed at spreading broadband availability.
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranks countries on a variety of individual criteria, like average advertised download speed and how widely available broadband service is. Japan, South Korea and France are at the top of its list for speed, while the highest market penetration is in Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, the O.E.C.D. said.
 The O.E.C.D. has been urging policy makers to look at issues like the divide between broadband speeds or availability in urban and rural areas, as well as discrepancies between advertised and real speeds.
 To try to come up with a more complete picture of where countries stand, the Cisco-sponsored researchers created an overall index of ''broadband leadership'' including the performance scores and market penetration. By that measure, South Korea ranked highest, followed by Japan and Hong Kong, with the United States ranking 15th.
 ''One commonality from all the countries at the top is that they all have a national broadband agenda,'' Mr. Gil de Bernabe said.

HEADLINE: Funds Try to Ward Off New Regulations

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
Hedge funds, trying to separate themselves from the big Wall Street banks, are stepping up their efforts to head off new regulation from Washington. 
 Representatives of the industry's main lobbying group met on Wednesday with the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner; Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve; and Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to lay out their views of President Obama's sweeping package of reforms to the nation's financial regulatory system. 
 Of particular interest to the group, the Managed Funds Association, is the possibility that Congress will deem some hedge funds as systemically important to the financial system and subject them to onerous regulation and reporting requirements. The group has been focused for months on persuading lawmakers that, unlike big banks, hedge funds do not pose a systemic risk to the economy.
 ''As we have made clear, we were not the contributors to these financial problems and, where hedge funds have met their demise, nobody got any taxpayer money to help bail them out,'' said Richard H. Baker, the association's chief executive. 
 Hedge funds have also been engaged in heading off restrictions on trading credit-default swaps and betting on the decline in a company's stock price.
 As part of its push in Washington, the association is expected to elect Darcy Bradbury, a former assistant Treasury secretary and the chief lobbyist of a big fund, to lead its effort. Ms. Bradbury, a senior vice president for the D. E. Shaw group, will succeed Eric Vincent, who is credited with turning the once-sleepy organization into a powerful lobbying group.
 In her new role, Ms. Bradbury will work closely with Mr. Baker, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana who was hired in February 2008. Since then, the group's membership has grown by 45 percent to 1,100 members and now represents most of the $1.5 trillion industry.
 ''The M.F.A. had historically been under resourced and did not have the staff to respond appropriately to the broad range of Congressional inquiries, much less ones from the regulators, the states and the international community,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview. 
 Mr. Vincent, the president and chief operating officer of Ospraie Management, a large hedge fund based in New York, is expected to become executive chairman of the association. 
 ''His prescience in pulling together industry leaders and motivating them to get more involved in the legislative process has been a tremendous asset to the entire industry,'' Mr. Baker said.
 The group's members are also expected to elect several new directors from big industry players.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 2, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about efforts by a group of hedge funds to head off regulation in Washington misstated the position of Darcy Bradbury, who is expected to lead the efforts of the group, called the Managed Funds Association. Ms. Bradbury is a senior vice president and public affairs director of the D. E. Shaw Group; she is not its chief lobbyist. The article also misstated the association's future relationship to Eric Vincent, whom Ms. Bradbury would succeed. He is expected to remain on its board, not to become its executive chairman.

HEADLINE: Dementia Debate Could Intensify

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
For the past decade, Brent Boyd, a former N.F.L. lineman who began experiencing memory loss and dementia-related symptoms in his 40s, has received relatively low payments from the National Football League's disability plan because the plan-appointed doctor concluded that football ''could not be organically responsible for all or even a major portion'' of his condition.
 Boyd is not alone: other retirees have found that the league's disability plan, run jointly with the players union, is not structured to consider dementia to be an occupational risk.
 But debate over that approach might intensify now that a study commissioned by the N.F.L. found that dementia-related diseases appear to have been diagnosed in the league's retirees vastly more often than in the national population. Although the matter would need to be addressed through the collective-bargaining process between the league and the union, reactions to the study included several calls for reforming the disability plan -- including one from Representative Linda T. Sanchez, Democrat of California, who as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee said she would encourage a formal hearing on the subject. 
 ''I can't tell you how frustrated I am, because I've been fighting this for years,'' said Boyd, 52, unemployed in Reno, Nev., and taking the prescription drug Aricept for his dementia-related symptoms. He receives $40,000 per year in disability from the league, far less than the $110,000 he would receive annually if his condition were linked to his seven-year career with the Minnesota Vikings.
 Boyd added: ''I was told once that the owners would never open up this can of worms -- approving any connection between brain injuries with N.F.L. football. Now that claim is clear to any reasonable person. I don't think there's any way they can make their case anymore. I'd like to see how they try to weasel out of it this time.''
 The N.F.L. study, conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, used a phone survey to ask 1,063 retired players of various ages dozens of health-related questions, one of those being whether they had received a diagnosis of ''dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other memory-related disease.'' About 6 percent of respondents said they had, five times the national average. Players ages 30 through 49 showed a rate of 1.9 percent, or 19 times that of the national average.
 The paper acknowledged limitations in using phone surveys to assess prevalence rates of diagnosed dementia, as did several experts in telephone interviews.
 The N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello declined to comment on the disability plan in an e-mail message, other than saying, ''That is a subject for collective bargaining.'' The union's executive director, DeMaurice Smith, was unavailable for comment; his spokesman, George Atallah, also declined to offer specifics but said the Michigan report ''will affect how we look at'' the issue.
 ''There are some things that we're doing that are not just talk,'' Atallah said. ''Both at and away from the bargaining table.''
 The league's disability plan does not forbid applications requesting payments based on brain-related disorders being related to football, and has made a few such awards, said Douglas Ell, the plan's primary lawyer. But the plan structure and environment make receiving the higher benefit level very difficult and often impossible.
 Players are eligible for $110,000 in aid but only for conditions (either physical or mental) developed within 15 years of their retirement. So, for example, a player who retires at age 30 and develops cognitive impairment at 50 can receive no benefit from the plan board, which consists of three appointees each from the league and the union.
 Any player who develops the condition and applies within the 15 years faces an environment in which the N.F.L. has consistently denied any evidence of a link between a professional football career and heightened risk for dementia. (Reacting to the Michigan study on Tuesday, both a league spokesman and a co-chairman of the league's concussion committee said the study was flawed and further study was necessary.)
 Gene Upshaw, the longtime head of the players union who died last year, discouraged any connection in a 2007 interview. ''I think we're just a reflection of society,'' he said, before adding: ''I don't want to take that next leap to say, you know, football caused dementia. I just don't believe that.''
 The league and union began the 88 Plan to provide up to $88,000 of annual assistance for players institutionalized for dementia, and up to $50,000 for those diagnosed with dementia receiving at-home care. Both sides emphasized that the plan had nothing to do with the players' football service. According to the N.F.L., 106 retirees have been awarded a total of $6 million of benefits, or about $56,600 per player since the plan began in early 2007.
 In June 2007, as chairwoman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, Sanchez called a hearing in which the league and the union testified about the N.F.L.'s pension and disability policies. She said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the latest data, combined with the league's continued denials of any established link between football and dementia, would be of great interest to the Ways and Means Committee, which provides governmental oversight of pension plans.
 ''Today's news adds a degree of urgency,'' Sanchez said. Speaking of the plan administrators, she added: ''They don't want to recognize it because it opens the door for all these past claims that they've been denying and neglecting. It makes them pony up.''
 Sanchez was not the only member of Congress to react to the Michigan report. Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, ''I intend to speak with the N.F.L. about this matter and insist on the need for the league to improve its disability benefits program and provide full coverage for the players who are most in need of help.''
 According to the last available government filing, the N.F.L.'s pension-disability plan had $1.11 billion in assets and almost $1.76 billion in liabilities as of early 2007. That 63 percent funding rate is considered by pension experts to be dangerously low, meaning the league and the union might need to negotiate new funding rates to meet the current claim structure.
 And for dementia to be covered more broadly, both the league and current players would presumably need to divert even more revenue from their pockets and into the plan.
 ''It absolutely should be changed, especially in light of the new data,'' said Dr. Eleanor Perfetto, whose husband, Ralph Wenzel, is an 88 Plan member institutionalized for dementia. She is a policy and research analyst for Pfizer and a former epidemiologist.
 ''Dementia doesn't fit into the 15-year limit,'' she added. ''When they came up with this 15-year arbitrary number, they were probably thinking of physical conditions. This is the kind of disease where you don't see the functional changes until that time has passed.''

HEADLINE: After Suicides, France Wrestles With Worker Stress

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Media attention to a recent spate of suicides at France Telecom has revealed a paradox at the heart of French society: even with robust labor protection, workers feel profoundly insecure, with many complaining that the pace of economic change is pushing them beyond their limits.
 A popular image outside France is of a cosseted work force protected from layoffs by near-hermetic job security and pampered by a 35-hour workweek. But the reality is often different, according to experts, union representatives and the workers themselves.
 ''When I started as a psychiatrist, 35 years ago, my patients were talking about their personal lives,'' said Marie-France Hirigoyen, a French psychiatrist who did pioneering work on bullying and workplace relations. ''Now it's all about their jobs. People are suffering in the workplace. They shouldn't be, from the logic of management. After all, they have a good job, a nice vacation. But they are suffering.'' 
 In statistical terms, the 24 suicides at France Telecom since February 2008 -- including eight since the beginning of summer, with the latest confirmed on Monday -- are not extraordinary for a company employing 102,0000 people in France. 
 The World Health Organization put the suicide rate in France at 26.4 per 100,000 for men and 9.2 for women in 2005. That is the highest among large European economies, but still well behind Japan. In the United States, the comparable rates are 17.7 for men and 4.5 for women.
 Mental health experts are always extremely cautious about attributing a suicide to any one cause: one often never knows what forces act upon a person. But what has caught the attention of the public and the French government is that many of the suicides, and more than a dozen failed suicides, have been attributed by some experts and labor officials to work-related problems.
 Adding to that is what Dr. Hirigoyen described as the spectacular nature of some cases. In one case a man stabbed himself, hara-kiri style, in the middle of a meeting (he survived); in another, a woman killed herself by leaping from a fifth-floor office window. On Monday, a 51-year-old employee threw himself from a highway bridge.
 ''Stress has become a national sport,'' said Michel Marchet, the secretary of the banking chapter of France's General Confederation of Labor, or C.G.T. union. ''We need employers to modify the way that they organize work, but we don't have the impression that anything will happen soon.''
 Despite the 35-hour workweek law, European Union data shows that the French last year worked a 41-hour week on average, putting them 13th of the 27 nations in the bloc. (Austria was ranked No. 1 at 44 hours.)
 In 2006 and 2007, three technicians working at the automaker Renault's research and development center, near Paris, committed suicide, according to Benoit Coquille, a company spokesman. At the time, union leaders cited pressures on the job.
 In response, Carlos Ghosn, the Renault chief executive, went to the center to talk with workers and managers. Detailed questionnaires were sent to more than 11,000 employees, and face-to-face meetings were held to discuss work conditions. Mr. Coquille said the company decided to go back and explain again basic management rules throughout the chain of command. 
 It is impossible to say that there have been no additional work-related suicides, Mr. Coquille said, but since then, ''there haven't been any with an obvious connection to the job.''
 France Telecom has hired Technologia, the same consulting firm that helped to guide Renault's response, to assess its situation. It is in an unusual position: despite a partial privatization in 1997, two-thirds of the company's work force are still classified as public servants and cannot be fired. Yet, even that level of job security can bring stress. 
 France Telecom is being forced to compete with private companies in a fast-moving global market. From 2006 through 2008, the company cut more than 22,000 jobs through voluntary departures. Nearly half of those were workers who either took early retirement, accepted transfers to civil service positions outside the company or left to start their own businesses with the company's backing. 
 (By comparison, BT Group, the former British telephone monopoly that has been carrying out its own wrenching reorganization, cut 15,000 jobs in 2008 alone and has said it will cut an additional 15,000 this year.) 
 Sebastien Crozier, head of the Confederation of Professional and Managerial Staff, part of the general union at France Telecom, estimated that in the last five years, half of all France Telecom employees had either changed jobs internally, changed work locations, or both. That, he said, has created a sense of constant upheaval and insecurity.
 Further, there is a sense that managers are deliberately trying to get employees to quit, he said. Since giving up civil service status would mean sacrificing retirement benefits, many people simply try to hold out, even if it means they have little of substance to do or they feel they are not being used effectively.
 In response to a flurry of media attention, France Telecom has said it will freeze worker transfers until the end of October, establish an anonymous help line for troubled employees and add extra psychological and human resources support. 
 ''We are the only incumbent telecoms operator not to have carried out mass redundancies,'' said Olivier Barberot, the head of human resources at France Telecom. 
 ''Most people, the bulk of them, have been able to increase their skills and move on to new jobs,'' he said. ''But some have had difficulty adapting.''
 In an interview, Xavier Darcos, France's employment minister, said the problem of workplace stress was not confined to France. But he criticized the company's previous approach, saying future reorganization would be ''better supervised.'' 
 ''Maybe he underestimated the effect of the transformation on staff and the media impact,'' Mr. Darcos said of France Telecom's chief executive, Didier Lombard. 
 ''We are in a transforming economy, and the evaluation tools used are a bit out of date,'' Mr. Darcos said.
 Nonetheless, he said, a job, even a highly stressful one, is better than unemployment.
 ''For us, unemployment is the absolute failure,'' Mr. Darcos said. ''We prefer to have people who don't feel totally happy at work, or to work part time, rather than people being unemployed.''
 The unemployment rate in France was 9.8 percent in July, up two percentage points from a year earlier. It probably would have been even higher without government programs to subsidize the auto industry and keep workers on the payroll, at least part time.
 In the end, at France Telecom, though, some things are inevitable. Echoing comments by Mr. Lombard and Mr. Darcos, Mr. Barberot, the company's human resources chief, said, ''We can't stop the reorganization.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Announces Plan To Aid Artists

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Wednesday announced five programs to support the 1,400 nonprofit groups, 40,000 employees and ''countless artists'' making up New York City's cultural sector. The city plans to provide indoor and outdoor space for art exhibitions, specialized job training, financial counseling to cultural institutions and artists, and $25,000 grants to two art ''clusters'' in city neighborhoods. The sector generates more than $5.8 billion in economic impact through direct spending, according to the city. The programs, which will be administered by the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Department of Cultural Affairs, build on a set of plans announced in April to help all of the city's nonprofit organizations survive the economic downturn.

HEADLINE: An Interview With Iran's Foreign Minister

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from an interview with Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian foreign minister, that was conducted Tuesday at the Iranian Mission to the United Nations by Neil MacFarquhar. Mr. Mottaki spoke in Persian, and his remarks were translated by an official interpreter. 
 Q.Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, told a news conference on Tuesday that the new uranium enrichment plant that Iran revealed last week was illegal because Security Council resolutions say that Iran is supposed to report any nuclear facility when construction starts. What is your reaction to that?
 A. The secretary general is in a position where he should talk in accordance with the laws and regulations.... According to international law, which has also been approved by our country, all member states have the commitment to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency six months before the injection of uranium into the centrifuges. 
 But we have informed the I.A.E.A. before the installation of the centrifuges or before the injection of the fuel. We did it 18 months before. 
 Q.But the secretary general was saying that the Security Council resolutions trump the I.A.E.A. guidelines, so Iran is supposed to follow the resolutions, which say Iran is supposed to announce any nuclear project right away.
 A. In relation to that principle we have also violated nothing, because nothing has been done with regard to nuclear energy in that facility. We had a plan for the site; we had a plot of land where the plant was being built and a building that was constructed on the site. We have already informed the agency.... 
 Q.I want to go back to the timing of the nuclear announcement. There is some curiosity about why Iran chose last week to announce the plant.
 A. It is always the same, some people will ask why you have announced so late, and some others will ask why you have announced so early.... Q.American officials say that Iran discovered that the United States was about to unveil the enrichment plant, so the Islamic republic wanted to pre-empt the announcement, they wanted to take away the surprise.
 A. That is not going to cover the mistake committed a few days ago in Pittsburgh. We think President Obama was misled in that episode. It is not good for a person like the president of the United States to say something about which he has no information. It was a trap for President Obama through misleading information. Some terrorist organizations provided the source of this wrong information. 
 The wrong analysis has also been provided as usual, as it happened during the Bush administration, by the United Kingdom. At least they could have asked the I.A.E.A. about this matter. When we informed the I.A.E.A., the agency gave an official response to Iran, expressing its appreciation for our move in informing them. Now they are making the arrangements for the agency inspection. 
 In our opinion we think that the statement in Pittsburgh was a scandal. Of course we don't have many expectations of President [Nicolas] Sarkozy [of France] because he defended up to the last moment the policies of the radicals in the White House. After their failure or defeat in the United States, he has been constantly confused. Some of his actions emanate from this confusion. 
 Q.The general sense is that every year Iran says ''We have told you everything, this is it,'' and then another piece of the nuclear program emerges. So over all the politicians in the West, like the secretary general, are saying that there is a lack of credibility. They hope when Iran goes to the talks on Thursday it will be more transparent. How do you react to the demands that Iran be more transparent, more credible?
 A. The secretary general of the United Nations should not talk with complicated philosophical language. He must speak based on solid evidence and in compliance with the laws and regulations. I think our positions have already been accepted and supported by many countries of the world. Many countries that are seeking to gain access to peaceful nuclear energy say to us that your resistance has also encouraged us to seek our legitimate rights. We think a new world is going to be born. In this new world nothing can be monopolized and you cannot impose your will on other nations. 
 There was a time when some world powers or countries did whatever they wanted. But they must know that the world has changed. The people in the United States must know that the former U.S. administration in the past eight years has jeopardized their reputation in the entire world. They created heavy failures and defeats for the United States in various parts of the world. We think the secretary general of the United Nations should not repeat the rhetoric of the leaders of an old defeated system. 
 Q.The five permanent members of the Security Council--Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States--plus Germany, who will participate in the talks on Thursday, are saying that they want Iran to be transparent and to convince them that it is credible. How does Iran approach the talks on Thursday with those demands?
 A. The upcoming talks on Thursday will be considered a two-way street. By offering a new package to the five plus one, we have already shown our determination and seriousness for constructive cooperation. We think that this proposed package from our side could be regarded as a suitable framework for our upcoming talks. Iran's policies are completely transparent.... I think we should also witness from the other side a strong political will for serious dialogue and constructive cooperation.... 
 On paper they claim to recognize Iran's right for a peaceful nuclear program. That is not enough to say that on paper. That must be realized. So I think we should talk and negotiate in those things and issues we have raised in the proposed package with seriousness and earnestness. It covers different parts--political and security matters, international issues, economic issues too, social and cultural matters. 
 Q.What do you expect from the talks?
 A. The important thing is that during the meeting the two sides should reach a common decision for having a dialogue on the proposed topics. If they reach such a conclusion, then they will have a long agenda for our talks.... There are various dimensions in the proposed package dealing with the nuclear issue including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the I.A.E.A., the inspection system, disarmament, strengthening the position of the I.A.E.A.... Q.Speaking about the I.A.E.A., the question comes up repeatedly as to why Iran does not accept the additional protocol in the I.A.E.A. safeguards agreement that allows for more intrusive inspections for nuclear sites. If Iran does not want to develop a nuclear weapon, why doesn't it just accept the additional protocol and that will provide the transparency and credibility that the United States and some other countries are demanding?
 A. Do you think that acceptance of the additional protocol is mandatory? We followed and we implemented the additional protocol for over two years at a time when the Parliament had not approved the protocol. But it did not create any confidence. We have indicated our good will. 
 Q.But given the lack of confidence and the revelations about new facilities, scientists and others are saying Iran should accept the additional protocol now because it would create confidence.
 A. That is called the two-way street, as I told you. You cannot ask for everything from one side. The Parliament has voted that the government is not allowed to implement the additional protocol. With regard to the fact that the Security Council has intervened in the work of the agency, and transferred the issue from the I.A.E.A. to the Security Council, after that the Parliament made the decision that the government stop implementing the additional protocol.

PERSON: Henry Bellmon 

HEADLINE: Henry Bellmon, Governor And Senator, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Henry Bellmon, a former Oklahoma governor and United States senator who took a judicious approach to conservative politics and who was a leading figure in Richard M. Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign, died Tuesday in Enid, Okla. He was 88 and lived on his wheat and cattle farm outside Billings, Okla.
 The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his former chief of staff, Andrew Tevington, said. 
 Mr. Bellmon was the first Republican governor of Oklahoma since it became a state in 1907. First elected in 1963, he served one four-year term and then, because state law prohibited a second term, converted his popularity into a successful bid for the United States Senate. After 12 years in Washington, which he later said had proved exhausting, he returned to tend to the family's 1,600-acre farm. He won another term as governor in 1986.
 Considered the architect of the state's rising Republican Party, Mr. Bellmon paved the way for a Republican successor, Dewey F. Bartlett, after his first term as governor. 
 In 1967 and early '68, Mr. Bellmon served as national chairman of the Nixon for President campaign, then stepped down to start his own Senate race. In a 2005 interview with OETA, the Oklahoma educational television network, Mr. Bellmon referred to himself as one of the ''early bird'' supporters of Mr. Nixon.
 He recalled being invited to the White House at the end of the Nixon presidency, along with about 20 other Nixon supporters, on the afternoon of Aug. 8, 1974. There the president informed them that he would go on television that night to announce his decision to resign the next day, to avoid impeachment because of the Watergate scandal.
 ''He thought he'd done some great things,'' Mr. Bellmon said of the meeting. ''Then he sort of dropped his head and sat for a moment looking down, and then he looked right at us and said, 'I hope I haven't let you down,' and he started to cry.''
 Mr. Bellmon, who called himself a conservative, took a somewhat swerving course during his many years in office. In his first term as governor, he protested when federal officials tried to require the city of Enid to place at least one black teacher in each of its 22 schools. Yet he also called for passage of a state civil-rights law and a minimum-wage law. 
 He was certainly a fiscal conservative who opposed new taxes. But when Oklahoma's teachers took a ''professional holiday'' in 1964 to protest their pay levels, he ordered a top-to-bottom overhaul of the school system and a pay increase for the state's 25,000 teachers. 
 As a senator, he was not averse to taking on his party's leadership. In 1975, when President Gerald R. Ford announced a $52 billion federal budget deficit, Mr. Bellmon denounced it as ''the worst news the nation has received since the adoption of the guns-and-butter policy of President Johnson during the early days of the Vietnam war.'' He was similarly critical of President Jimmy Carter's budgets.
 When President Carter was calling for adoption of a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty with the Soviet Union, Senator Bellmon accused Mr. Carter of adopting ''the position of a gullible pacifist.'' At the same time, he refused to vote for legislative amendments to outlaw forced busing of students for racial purposes.
 When Mr. Bellmon ran again for governor, Oklahoma was being battered by plunging oil prices and a weak farming sector. The state's economy and its 320 state-chartered banks were experiencing their greatest difficulties since the days of the Dust Bowl. Reluctantly, Mr. Bellmon called for increased taxes and fees, putting himself at odds with fellow Republicans.
 The oldest of four sons of George Bellmon, a pioneer farmer on the Cherokee Strip, and his father's second wife, the former Edith Caskey, Henry Louis Bellmon was born on Sept. 3, 1921, in Tonkawa, Okla. At 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, he played football in high school.
 After graduating from Oklahoma A & M (now Oklahoma State University) with a degree in agronomy in 1941, Mr. Bellmon joined the Marines. He was awarded the Silver Star for bravery on Iwo Jima.
 Mr. Bellmon's wife of 53 years, the former Shirley Osborn, died in 2001. Besides his second wife, the former Eloise Bollenbach, he is survived by three daughters, Patricia Hoerth, Gail Wynne and Ann McFerron; his brother George; and four grandchildren.
 As governor, Mr. Bellmon once signed a resolution requiring that the Confederate flag be restored to a 14-flag display on the steps of the state Capitol. He supported a woman's right to choose to have an abortion.
 ''Basically, I'm a conservative,'' he once said, ''but I am sure as hell not a John Bircher.''

HEADLINE: House Leaders Trying to Give All Democrats a Say

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate poses the main hurdle to President Obama's effort to overhaul the health care system. But passing so far-reaching a bill in the House is not going to be easy either.
 Few Democrats doubt that ultimately the House will approve its version of a program to expand insurance coverage and restrain long-term health care spending, given the party's sizable majority. But first Democratic leaders must bridge some big cracks in their ranks, especially over taxes and abortion, to keep their defections to a minimum. 
 ''Everyone wants their own way,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York. 
 As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel has his own demands. He is standing by his panel's proposal to help offset the health bill's cost with an income tax surcharge on the wealthiest taxpayers, though he concedes ''it will be adjusted'' to hit fewer people. Even limited to families with at least $1 million annual income, the plan is opposed by dozens of Democrats from affluent and Republican-leaning suburban districts.
 Mr. Rangel is resisting some proposed alternatives, like a tax on insurance companies for their high-end policies or, as Mr. Obama proposed, a limit on the tax deductions the wealthy can claim.
 Mr. Rangel is one of a small group of House leaders now meeting almost daily behind closed doors with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, to distill from the three bills produced in separate committees the one package that will go to the House floor. Ultimately, Ms. Pelosi will have to decide the disputes, Democrats say, presumably with input from the White House.
 The rank-and-file Democrats are getting their say, too. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi held the latest in a series of private caucuses in the Capitol basement to tutor House Democrats on some aspect of the effort -- the day's topic was containing health care costs -- and to hear their complaints. 
 ''There are issues that have to be resolved,'' Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said as he left the session.
 The goal is a measure that can win at least the 217 votes needed for passage in a chamber where Democrats have a 256-to-177 edge over Republicans (there are two vacancies). With Republicans expected to be unanimous in opposition, Democrats can afford no more than 39 defectors.
 At present, the factions of the disgruntled and politically nervous add up to more than that, though the numbers overlap among some of the groups.
 They include many of the 52 Blue Dogs, the conservative Democrats who are uncomfortable with the scope and expense of the health care legislation, even though it includes offsetting savings in Medicare payments to hospitals, insurers and drug companies.
 ''We want to be helpful to pass a health care bill,'' said Representative Dennis A. Cardoza, a Blue Dog from California, ''but a lot of these bills don't feel right to us.'' 
 Mr. Obama cheered up the Blue Dogs when he called for a $900 billion ceiling on the 10-year cost of a health care package, down from his initial $1 trillion estimate. But he angered Ms. Pelosi and other liberals, who now are trying to shrink the House bills while protecting subsidies for uninsured middle-income people to buy coverage and fielding Democrats' requests for higher Medicare reimbursement rates to rural areas and urban medical centers.
 The Blue Dogs and other Democrats, including some in the larger business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, object to the surcharge on the wealthy. Though it would affect about 0.3 percent of taxpayers and roughly 1 percent of small businesses, some lawmakers are haunted by recollections of 1994, when the Democrats' votes for a deficit-reduction law that raised taxes on the rich came in for blame after the party lost its majority. 
 But there is no agreement on other ways to comply with Mr. Obama's directive that a bill cannot add to deficits. Union allies oppose borrowing the Senate idea to tax insurance companies, arguing that companies would pass on their costs in higher premiums that could hit union workers who receive generous benefits. 
 Ms. Pelosi has said that any House bill will include a public option for the uninsured to buy coverage in exchanges, and opposition among more conservative Democrats has lessened. On Wednesday, a group including liberals and conservatives held a news conference to promote the idea as a cost saver. 
 Democrats on each side of the abortion rights issue are facing off over how tightly to write language restricting subsidies from being used for insurance policies that cover abortion, which suggests that some votes will be lost depending on the outcome. 
 Defections are certain to come from among the 74 freshmen and second-term Democrats. Many are from Republican-leaning districts; 48 Democrats, many newcomers, are from districts that voted for Republicans in the last two presidential elections.
 Charlie Cook, the longtime nonpartisan election analyst, said the political climate for the party was ''the worst since '94.'' At its core is distrust of government, which is only stoked by the prospect of a bigger federal role in the one-sixth of the economy represented by health care.
 ''There's the fear of passage'' of a health bill, said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, ''but that's versus a fear of failing to pass.'' 
 Mr. Welch said the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, restated to a group of House Democrats recently, ''Success is the only option.''

HEADLINE: Ending Rocky Tenure, Chief Is to Leave Bank of America

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Less than a year ago, Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, celebrated his daring takeover of Merrill Lynch as the crowning triumph of a long career. On Wednesday, that conquest proved to be his downfall, as he announced his resignation after months of legal and political scrutiny over the star-crossed merger. 
 Mr. Lewis, who started at the bank in 1969 as a low-level loan officer and rose through the ranks to build it into a financial powerhouse, told board members in a 5 p.m. conference call that he had decided to take early retirement, said four people briefed on the discussion. 
 The board appeared caught off-guard by the timing of his announcement but accepted it even though members were not immediately prepared to name a successor. He had already discussed the matter with the chairman and a small group of directors, the people said. 
 Mr. Lewis leaves as Congress, the attorney general of New York and investors turn up pressure on both him and the bank over not disclosing Merrill's losses and bonuses to shareholders. A federal judge recently refused to accept a settlement that had been brokered between Bank of America and the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying the bank and the commission never fully explained how the decisions had been made.
 The controversy is likely to occupy the bank even after the departure of Mr. Lewis, who has already had to testify to Congress on the matter. 
 ''This was a necessary and overdue change,'' said Michael Garland, a spokesman for Change to Win, an investment group that has been pressing for Mr. Lewis's ouster for months. ''The onus is now on the board to engage with shareholders to name a successor who can quickly restore Bank of America's credibility with regulators and investors.''
 Federal officials did not call on Mr. Lewis to step down and were notified of his decision late in the afternoon, according to two people briefed on the situation. However, regulators have urged other management and board level changes at Bank of America, Citigroup and other financial firms that have received taxpayer lifelines. 
 Mr. Lewis is not entitled to severance pay but stands to collect pension benefits worth $53.2 million, largely from a retirement program that was frozen in 2003, according to an analysis of corporate filings by James F. Reda & Associates, an independent consulting firm. Mr. Lewis also will walk away with $81.8 million in stock and other compensation that he accumulated over his career, the analysis found. 
 The government-appointed compensation czar, Kenneth R. Feinberg, does not have authority over any pay that was legally binding as of last February, so much of Mr. Lewis's compensation package may go untouched. However, Mr. Feinberg is likely to examine whether all of Mr. Lewis's exit compensation is beyond his office's reach.
 Mr. Lewis is the latest of more than half a dozen Wall Street chiefs to be unseated by the credit crisis. Charles O. Prince III of Citigroup, Richard S. Fuld Jr. of Lehman Brothers, G. Kennedy Thompson of Wachovia Corporation, and John A. Thain, the Merrill Lynch chief executive whom Mr. Lewis forced out after the merger, lost their jobs in the fray. 
 There are no immediate successors to replace Mr. Lewis. The board plans to interview a number of his current deputies, but will seriously consider outsiders, according to people who have spoken with board members. Robert K. Steel, a former Treasury official who briefly ran Wachovia before its collapse, is one possible contender. 
 In Mr. Lewis's tenure as chief executive, shares soared to a high of $54.85 in the fall of 2006, from around $25 in April 2001. But after the Merrill Lynch deal, its stock price plummeted. Bank of America shares, which were trading around $33.74 right before the deal was announced, fell to a mere $3.14 a share, although they have since rebounded. On Wednesday, they closed at $16.92.
 Mr. Lewis approached a group of about five Bank of America directors on Monday with his plans to retire, according to a person briefed on the discussions. They praised his work and tried to persuade him to stay, this person added, but he remained steadfast in his decision to retire. 
 Charles K. Gifford, a board member at Bank of America, said in an interview that Mr. Lewis's decision came as a surprise to many directors.
 In the conference call, Mr. Lewis, speaking in a measured voice, told the 15 directors that he knew it was time for him to retire, Mr. Gifford said. 
 ''He said he felt it was the time, and that he was the only one who could understand that,'' Mr. Gifford said. ''The guy just cares so much about the institution. I mean, that's what he told us.''
 Mr. Gifford said the board had never discussed asking Mr. Lewis to resign and that several members expressed respect for him on the phone call. However, no one asked him not to resign, Mr. Gifford said, adding that Mr. Lewis sounded as though he had fully made up his mind.
 Mr. Lewis, 62, has been under immense pressure since the bank merged with Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis. The deal capped a string of bold acquisitions -- including the mortgage lender Countrywide, the credit card lender MBNA and FleetBoston Financial -- that transformed Bank of America into the nation's largest consumer bank. But Merrill quickly turned into one headache after another, though Merrill's units are performing well now.
 Some have defended Mr. Lewis, saying that while he was initially eager to snap up Merrill, he was given little choice by federal regulators when they urged him to move forward with the deal even when Merrill's losses turned out to be larger than first thought. Mr. Lewis has defended the merger as strategically important to the long-term prospects of Bank of America and has said the deal is already paying off in improved operating profit. 
 But shortly after the merger was sealed, shareholders began questioning whether Mr. Lewis paid too much for Merrill. Investment bankers left as the cultures clashed. And the merger pushed the bank toward a second bailout from the government soon after its completion, upsetting many investors who worried about the $45 billion taxpayer lifeline, and who saw the value of their shares evaporate. In the spring, they voted to strip Mr. Lewis of his chairmanship. 
 According to people close to Mr. Lewis, he believed that accepting the second bailout was one of his biggest mistakes because it put Bank of America into the ''extraordinary'' bailout category, alongside Citigroup and the American International Group, and Mr. Lewis considered his bank to be much stronger than those companies. 
 Executives at the bank believe it has recovered sufficiently to repay its bailout money, and they have pressed their case in Washington. But even optimists at the bank concede that the bank's immediate prospects are uncertain given the fragile state of the economy.
 Mr. Lewis also disliked the added attention that came with the bailout, these people said, and he said that he hoped to return the bailout funds or a portion of them before he left the company.Adding to the pressure was the firestorm that erupted over whether he adequately disclosed the risks of the acquisition to his shareholders. After Mr. Lewis clinched his deal, Merrill lost a staggering $15.3 billion during the fourth quarter, but paid out billions of dollars in bonuses that Bank of America shareholders were unaware of when they voted to approve the deal. He has since hired his own legal counsel. 
 Mr. Lewis began thinking about retiring while he was on vacation in Aspen, Colo., in late August, according to the sources briefed on his decision. He surprised colleagues when he returned to work sporting a beard, something no one could remember him doing in decades. 
 The bank chief was visiting New York on Wednesday when he told the board of his decision. He ended the call by saying, ''I remain sure of what I am doing,'' said two people who were listening to the call. Soon afterward, he boarded a plane and flew home to Charlotte, N.C.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the pending departure of Kenneth D. Lewis as chief executive of Bank of America misidentified the state where Mr. Lewis began his tenure with the bank. It was a small bank in North Carolina, not South Carolina.

HEADLINE: At 60 M.P.H., Office Work Is a High-Risk Job

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: JOPLIN, Mo. 

 BODY:
Looking back, Paul Dekok wonders what he was thinking that May morning when the urgent call came in. Mr. Dekok, a manager at the Potash Corporation, learned that a 25-ton truckload of the company's additive for livestock feed had been rejected by a customer as contaminated. 
 Scrambling to protect his company's credibility with a big customer, he grabbed his cellphone to arrange a new shipment, cradling it between his left ear and shoulder, and with his right hand e-mailed instructions to his staff from his laptop computer -- all while driving his rental car in a construction zone on a two-lane highway in North Carolina. 
 ''I thought I was doing a great job because I was being productive,'' Mr. Dekok said. ''It's an adrenaline rush. It's the buzz we all get of trying to do everything you can in business.'' 
 But later, reflecting on the risks he took that spring day in 2007, he saw himself in a different light: ''I was Bozo the clown.'' 
 Mr. Dekok may be rethinking how he works on the road, but tens of thousands of Americans barely give it a second thought. They have turned their cars, vans and trucks into mobile offices, wired with phones and computers to stay in close touch with bosses and customers. 
 On Wednesday, the Transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, called the broader phenomenon of distracted driving a ''deadly epidemic'' at a meeting on the issue in Washington. Real estate brokers, pharmaceutical sales people, entrepreneurs, marketers and others say they have little choice but to transform their cars into cubicles. In this merciless economy, they say, they have to make every minute count, and respond instantly to opportunities and challenges. 
 And they argue that the convenience of constant contact -- and the chance to tick off items from an endless to-do list while driving -- far outweigh what they think are slim chances that it could lead to a wreck. 
 For white-collar employees, pressures to multitask are largely self-imposed. For blue-collar workers, the demands to stay connected while driving are often imposed by their bosses. 
 Truckers, plumbers, delivery drivers and others are tethered to dispatchers with an array of productivity devices, including on-board computers that send instructions about the next job and keep tabs on drivers' locations. Such devices can require continual attention -- distracting drivers who are steering the biggest vehicles on American roads. 
 The compulsion to work while driving often trumps clear evidence that such activity is dangerous. Studies show that someone who talks on the phone while driving is four times more likely to crash, even using a hands-free headset, than someone who is simply driving. The risks are even greater when sending text messages. 
 For all the perceived benefits of multitasking behind the wheel -- like staying a step ahead of competitors -- the dangers have begun to take their toll on companies, leading some to ban the practice by employees. 
 Some families of victims killed in collisions with a multitasking worker have successfully sued the driver's employer for tens of millions of dollars. 
 Researchers say there is another reason to question the benefits of working behind the wheel: a growing body of research shows that splitting attention between activities like working and driving often leads to distracted conversations and bad decisions. 
 ''There is an illusion of productivity,'' said David E. Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. ''It's actually counterproductive.''
 ''To the extent that someone is focused on driving, the quality of work product is diminished,'' he added. ''To the extent someone is focused on work and not driving, there's a risk of crashing and burning. Something's got to give.''
 The Drive to Compete
 Potash, a large public fertilizer and chemical company, never told managers like Mr. Dekok, or regional salesmen like Rob Hudson, that they needed to multitask while driving. 
 But given that both men drive an average of 150 miles each day visiting feed mills and other customers, their cars inevitably became rolling offices, the place where they call clients, plan meetings and make hotel reservations. 
 ''I'd be on my cellphone, writing notes in my planner, driving with my knee, and with a sandwich in my lap,'' Mr. Hudson said. He felt he could not ignore his phone, he said, because he never knew which call or e-mail message would be one he could not miss. 
 ''For the clients, a lot of times it's an urgent request for a delivery,'' he said. ''In the animal feed business, they never stop eating. It's not like that can wait until tomorrow.'' 
 Plenty of other workers feel similar pressures. IDC, a market research firm, estimated last year that there were 111 million mobile workers in the United States, including all manner of people who do work outside an office, whether in a car, cafe, or airport lounge. And in a 2007 survey, IDC found that 70 percent of owners of BlackBerrys and other smartphones used their device in a car at least once a week. (The survey did not specify whether the phone users were drivers or passengers, but 80 percent of people typically drive alone). 
 ''It's a seconds-count economy,'' said Sean Ryan, an analyst at IDC. 
 Mr. Ryan feels the pressure. He schedules work calls to make his own 45-minute commute -- from Boston to Framingham, Mass. -- more productive. 
 At stop lights, he checks texts and e-mail messages. He does not want to miss something important, but he also sees the practice as a time saver. ''I might as well get a quick e-mail taken care of, or at least delete spam,'' he said. ''When I get to the office, I've saved 15 to 20 minutes of work.'' 
 David Vered, 53, chief executive of Pacific Yogurt Partners, which operates Golden Spoon frozen yogurt stores in the San Francisco Bay Area and helps manage other stores around the state, sometimes does not wait for stop lights to check his e-mail. 
 He has trained employees to send concise messages so that he can read them while driving on the highway as he visits stores.
 ''With the BlackBerry, you can hold it up over the steering wheel,'' he said. ''I just hit 'open' and see what the issue is.''
 On his lengthy commutes, he occasionally schedules calls with lawyers to do lease negotiations, or with contractors to discuss construction of a new retail outlet. 
 But his phone can also ring with an urgent problem, like a broken frozen-yogurt machine. Mr. Vered's workers need to know what to do. If he delays, he said, they might be paralyzed, wasting time and money.
 ''I respond to them as rapidly as possible,'' he said. ''I don't like holding people up. And I'm not just holding them up: I'm paying them. I want them to be as effective as possible.''
 Studies show that drivers who send text or e-mail typically take their eyes off the road for an average of five seconds. 
 But Mr. Vered said he was vigilant about safety. Besides, he said, he never reads e-mail on his bigger laptop computer, which he keeps on a desk he has installed on the passenger seat of his small Toyota S.U.V. 
 ''That's dangerous because you have to shift the field of vision away from the road,'' he added. 
 Mr. Vered said he was an adept multitasker.
 ''I'm in a zone,'' he said. He uses a Bluetooth cellphone device attached to his ear so he can keep both hands on the wheel unless he is dialing or reading a text. ''I've done it my whole life, so I know how to multitask,'' he added.
 As his own boss, Mr. Vered can choose whether to multitask while driving. 
 But other employees, particularly blue-collar workers, do not have that luxury. Many employers deploy an array of devices to stay connected with their drivers at all times.
 The Mobile Office
 ''When someone's toilet overflows, they call a bunch of plumbers -- the first plumber there wins,'' said Brian Edds, a marketing director for Xora, a company based in Mountain View, Calif. 
 Xora's software lets workers using mobile phones receive dispatch and navigation directions, deal with payroll, fill out invoices and otherwise manage their work as if they were sitting at a desk.
 IDC, the research firm, estimates companies spent $850 million last year for such software from Xora and its competitors, and estimated the market size would double in five years. The software has been installed on the phones of millions of electricians, service technicians, home health care workers, sales people, plumbers and others -- at companies like Coca-Cola, Merck, Pitney Bowes and Xerox, and the city of Chicago.
 Xora's customers include the Roto-Rooter Services Company, the plumbing chain.
 In the past, Mr. Edds said, a mobile worker might have had to scribble down directions from a dispatcher. 
 ''Now he gets sent the information in an organized manner, so he can click on the address, and get the best route, so he gets to a job very fast,'' he said. 
 Stephen R. Poppe, chief information officer for Roto-Rooter, said that when employees turned on their device, it warned them not to use it while driving. But employees can bypass the warning, and Mr. Poppe conceded the company cannot stop them from doing so, 
 ''It's like telling your daughter, 'Don't talk while driving,' '' he said. ''She answers, 'Sure, Dad.' ''
 The company also needs quick responses from its plumbers. 
 ''We want to know right this minute if they're going to take that job or not, or we'll assign the job to someone else,'' he said. ''We'll know within 60 seconds.''
 Mr. Edds said that Xora software included a standard warning screen urging users not to use it while driving. But he acknowledged that it could be ignored -- and often was.
 ''Like the warning screens on in-dash navigation systems, most users treat them as a speed bump on their way to do what they want to do,'' he said.
 And sometimes a computer in the driver's seat can be a deadly distraction.
 Unintended Costs
 Jered Noe was driving a Coca-Cola delivery truck on a quiet stretch of two-lane highway in Seminole County, Okla., two Novembers ago. 
 Samantha Dawn Earnest, with her three children, Jason, 7; Dakota, 5; and Hailey, 4; was driving along the same road in the other direction in her green 1999 Chevrolet Malibu. 
 In the back seat, Jason and Dakota talked about decorating the walls of their shared room. Jason favored pictures of dinosaurs. Dakota preferred horses. 
 As Ms. Earnest crested a hill, the delivery truck swerved into her car, spun it around and sent it careening across the highway. Jason died on impact.
 Ms. Earnest, stunned and bleeding, saw the truck driver walking toward her.
 ''I said, 'Why, why, why?' '' she recalled screaming at him. ''He told me, 'I just took my eyes off the road for a second because I was looking at my computer.' '' 
 She started chasing him. 
 ''I went into a mad rage,'' she said. ''If he'd said he'd fallen asleep, maybe I'd have understood. But using a computer?'' 
 Mr. Noe, 24, received a suspended sentence for negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, and the Earnest family sued Mr. Noe's employer, the ADA Coca-Cola Bottling Company. 
 The company settled, and the terms of the agreement are confidential. ADA did not respond to requests for comment.
 Lawyers and expert witnesses in cases involving multitasking drivers say such lawsuits are common. 
 Last year, International Paper reached a settlement to pay $5.2 million because of a 2006 accident in which an employee on a phone hit another driver, whose arm had to be amputated. 
 Katherine McArthur, a lawyer in Macon, Ga., who sued International Paper in that case, said the company permitted employees to use a cellphone while driving if it had a hands-free headset. (This remains the company policy, according to International Paper). 
 But Ms. McArthur said that several studies show that drivers using headsets face the same likelihood of crashing as someone holding the phone to their ear. That risk has been compared to driving at the legal limit for intoxication.
 ''What I'm arguing in these cases is that these companies are authorizing something as bad as drunk driving and that they knew about the research or should have known,'' she said. Ms. McArthur said that companies should expect more such lawsuits.
 ''They're the deep pockets,'' she said. Some may pay before an accident even happens. Insurance executives say that when setting premiums the industry has started to consider whether companies have policies on cellphone use.
 The Calculus
 There might be another reason for drivers to reconsider working behind the wheel: a growing body of studies suggest that such work may be less valuable than many people assume. 
 The reason, researchers say, is that the brain can effectively perform only one difficult task at a time. 
 Mr. Meyer, the Michigan professor, found that when someone tried to multitask, important neural regions must switch back and forth, taking time and creating inefficiencies. 
 That can be particularly dangerous, of course, when a driver suddenly feels the tires slipping on an icy road in the middle of a phone call. But that 2001 study, and numerous others, also show that multitasking motorists can pay another price -- in the quality of their work. 
 In 2006, for instance, researchers at University of California, Los Angeles, used brain imaging to show that multitaskers were less effective learners. 
 According to that research, a person focused on a single task remembers what he has learned using the hippocampus, a part of the brain critical to storing and recalling information. 
 But when that person multitasks -- like trying to learn something new while driving -- the brain relies more on the striatum, a part of the brain used more for learning motor skills. 
 The researchers concluded, ''Don't multitask while you are trying to learn something new you hope to remember.'' 
 ''The brain is fundamentally built to unitask,'' said Clifford Nass, a communications professor at Stanford, where he is also a co-director of a new automotive research laboratory. 
 That limitation can put drivers at a disadvantage if they are negotiating with someone who, say, is in an office and less distracted. 
 Driving, Mr. Nass said, taxes the parts of the brain that make it more difficult to appreciate nuances of a conversation. ''A person is much more manipulatable when they're behind the wheel,'' he said. 
 Mr. Nass said that the counterproductive effects can linger after the ride. Research shows that the brains of heavy multitaskers can become so accustomed to hopping from task to task that they have trouble focusing on longer, more in-depth ones. 
 Some companies have weighed several factors -- including the safety risks and the cost of potential lawsuits -- and banned employees from doing work on their phones behind the wheel. (In a survey taken in August of its 13,000 member companies, the National Safety Council found 469 with such bans.) 
 Some corporations that have imposed the bans have found that productivity has not suffered. 
 AMEC, an international engineering and project management company, banned its 9,000 North American workers, starting in 2005, from talking on the phone while driving -- a decision the company made after executives heard about a fatal accident caused by a driver talking on a cellphone.
 AMEC surveyed its workers a year later, asking them to respond anonymously to encourage candor, and 95 percent said their productivity had not been affected. 
 In 2004, Exxon Mobil started asking the same question after it became concerned about the safety of its 90,000 workers and 100,000 contract workers, who drove up to 1.5 million miles each day, said Michael Henderek, the company's safety executive at the time. The company wanted to know what a ban would do to the bottom line.
 ''Exxon Mobil is a corporation in which 50 percent of employees are engineers,'' said Mr. Henderek. ''It's driven by data.''
 The company determined that research equating the dangers of behind-the-wheel multitasking with drunken driving was reliable. So in early 2004, Exxon Mobil ran a pilot project, restricting some employees from using the phone while driving. It found no loss in productivity, and quickly imposed a ban for all workers and contractors. 
 ''To not act was irresponsible,'' Mr. Henderek said. ''The risk to employees was much greater than any marginal benefit of the productivity you get.''
 Exxon Mobil was particularly concerned about its big fuel trucks. 
 ''The last thing you want to have,'' Mr. Henderek said, ''is an incident between the fuel fleet and the community.''
 Tragedy Begets a Change
 Last March, Potash's chief executive, William J. Doyle, attended a conference in Bahrain that focused on safety in the fertilizer industry. 
 He was particularly moved by a harrowing speech -- not about chemical safety, but distracted driving. Before day's end, Mr. Doyle had sent an e-mail message to several Potash executives telling them the company needed to change its policy.
 ''It said, 'We have to get a cellphone policy in place. We can't subject people to this anymore,' '' John Hunt, Potash's executive in charge of safety, health and environment, recalled. 
 On April 1, Potash banned its 5,000 workers from using their phones while driving, telling them they could be fired if they broke the rule. ''There's always an extra 15 or 30 minutes where someone can pull the car over to place a call. Nothing is that critical,'' Mr. Hunt said, explaining the policy.
 Mr. Dekok, the manager, was skeptical. But his grudging acceptance vanished when he heard a speech by David Teater, an executive with the National Safety Council, which has made a cause of eliminating driver distraction. 
 This year, as part of that, the group began an effort to get corporations representing one million workers to ban their employees from using cellphones while driving. 
 At the invitation of Potash, Mr. Teater, 53, a former college football player with an easygoing manner, recently gave company workers and their families a version of the stump speech he has given dozens of times. 
 Over 40 minutes, Mr. Teater detailed the increased risks drivers face when multitasking. He talked about cognitive distraction and the need for stronger laws. He thanked Potash for being a leader and urged the audience to tell others to rethink their priorities. 
 ''We don't need our phones as much as we think we do,'' he said. 
 Then Mr. Teater, his audience already rapt, showed pictures on a projector of people who had been killed by multitasking drivers. 
 The last photo he showed was of a 12-year-old blond boy, smiling -- it was Joe Teater, Mr. Teater's son. 
 On Martin Luther King Day in 2004, a driver talking on a cellphone on her way to church hit the Teaters' car, killing Joe and injuring his mother, who was driving. (After his son's death, Mr. Teater worked 18 months for a company that is developing technology that can prevent a driver from using a cellphone while the car is in motion, and he still owns shares in the company.)
 Many of the Potash employees teared up as Mr. Teater concluded. They thanked him, and said they would change their behavior and urge friends and family to do the same. 
 Mr. Hudson, the Potash salesman, still wishes there could be some compromise on the policy. He acknowledged that he has had more than a few scary moments in the past when he's ''swerved off the beaten path'' while multitasking. But he still feels drive time should be productive. 
 ''You'd think we could have some leeway on the highway -- when you're on open road and you're wide awake,'' he said. ''It's a little over the top to have a 100 percent ban. But then, where do you draw the line?'' 
 For Mr. Dekok, the line is now clear. If he is driving and the phone rings, he lets it go to voicemail. He knows every rest stop on his routes, and which ones have good cellular and Wi-Fi service. 
 He does not drive more than 30 miles without stopping to respond to messages. And he delegates more authority to subordinates so they can deal with problems when he is on the road. 
 Business is just as urgent as it always has been, but he has a new view of the calculus. 
 ''After you go cold turkey, and get rid of the cellphone when you drive, you see other people's behavior,'' he said. ''It's like getting sober and realizing everyone else is still drunk.'' 
 Articles in the Driven to Distraction series examine the dangers of drivers using cellphones and other electronic devices and efforts to deal with the problem.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the hazards of multitasking while on the road for business misstated, in some editions, the given name of the daughter of Samantha Earnest, whose son Jason was killed when their car was hit by a delivery truck whose driver was operating a computer. Mrs. Earnest's daughter is Hailey, not Dawn. The article also rendered incorrectly in some editions part of the name of the company that employed the driver. It is the Ada Coca-Cola Bottling Company, not ADA. Because of an editing error, a picture caption with the continuation of the article also misstated the job title for Paul Dekok, whose company, Potash, has banned the use of cellphones in company cars. He is a manager, not the general manager.

HEADLINE: Plan Outlines Removal of Four Dams on Klamath River in Oregon and California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
A draft plan to remove four aging dams along the Klamath River in Oregon and California was released Wednesday, a long-awaited step toward ending a protracted dispute over the waterway.
 The Klamath dams, built from 1918 to 1961 along an upstream stretch of the river, are owned by PacifiCorp, which uses them to generate electricity. But they have angered Indian tribes along the river, as well as fishermen and environmentalists, who blamed them for a decline in salmon populations and subsequent economic hardships.
 Last year, federal and other officials announced a nonbinding agreement to remove the dams, and Wednesday's draft plan added a specific, nuts-and-bolts dimension to that agreement. In releasing the draft plan, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called the Klamath ''one of the most challenging water issues of our time.'' 
 Competing interests have long debated how to manage the Klamath, a river whose salmon populations once rivaled any in the world. Environmentalists argue that the fish populations have declined because of the dams preventing upstream spawning, while farmers have pleaded for more water for irrigation and others for more electric power. 
 The federal government has often played the unhappy role of referee. In 2002, environmentalists asserted that a significant die-off of fish had resulted from a diversion of water to farmers that was ordered by the Interior Department. Four years later, fishermen complained when low levels of salmon in the river led to government restrictions on commercial fishing. 
 The draft plan, which was developed by representatives from about two dozen federal, state and tribal agencies, environmental groups and irrigators in discussions with officials from PacifiCorp, will go to stakeholders and the public for review. 
 Kirk Miller, the deputy secretary and chief counsel of California Natural Resources Agency, which represented the state in negotiations, said he hoped for approval by year's end.
 Under the agreement, the Interior Department would study the cost and environmental impact of removing the dams, including the effect on fish populations and downstream river conditions, to help Mr. Salazar make what he called ''a full informed decision.'' In a nod to PacifiCorp, the company would continue to operate the dams until their removal and would not be liable for any effects of the demolition. 
 Greg Abel, the company's chief executive, said in a statement that ''this is a balanced and reasonable outcome that best protects the interests of our customers,'' as well as ''helping to peacefully resolve numerous conflicts in the Klamath basin.'' 
 About $200 million of the estimated $450 million cost of removing the dams would be covered by a small surcharge on PacifiCorp's customers, most of whom reside in Oregon. The rest of the money would come from the company's customers in California and the sale of bonds there. 
 The federal government would be required to prepare timetables for the dams' removal and plans to reduce cost overruns and dispose of sediment and debris. 
 ''The agreement calls on each of us to do our part,'' said Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon, where lawmakers have approved the PacifiCorp surcharge.
 Mr. Salazar has until March 2012 to decide whether to go forward with the plan. If approved, removal of the dams would begin in 2020.
 ''We haven't seen salmon in our country for 90 years,'' said Jeff Mitchell, a council member for the Klamath Tribes of Oregon. ''This agreement represents our best chance of finally bringing the salmon home.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Model for Health Care Thrives Without Public Option

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: ZURICH 

 BODY:
Like every other country in Europe, Switzerland guarantees health care for all its citizens. But the system here does not remotely resemble the model of bureaucratic, socialized medicine often cited by opponents of universal coverage in the United States. 
 Swiss private insurers are required to offer coverage to all citizens, regardless of age or medical history. And those people, in turn, are obligated to buy health insurance. 
 That is why many academics who have studied the Swiss health care system have pointed to this Alpine nation of about 7.5 million as a model that delivers much of what Washington is aiming to accomplish -- without the contentious option of a government-run health insurance plan. 
 In Congress, the Senate Finance Committee is dealing with legislation proposed by its chairman, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, which would require nearly all Americans to buy health insurance, but stops short of the government-run insurance option that is still strongly supported by liberal Democrats. 
 Two amendments that would have added a public option to the Baucus bill were voted down on Tuesday. But another Senate bill, like the House versions, calls for a public insurance option. 
 By many measures, the Swiss are healthier than Americans, and surveys indicate that Swiss people are generally happy with their system. Switzerland, moreover, provides high-quality care at costs well below what the United States spends per person. Swiss insurance companies offer the mandatory basic plan on a not-for-profit basis, although they are permitted to earn a profit on supplemental plans.
 And yet, as a potential model for the United States, the Swiss health care system involves some important trade-offs that American consumers, insurers and health care providers might find hard to swallow. 
 The Swiss government does not ''ration care'' -- that populist bogeyman in the American debate -- but it does keep down overall spending by regulating drug prices and fees for lab tests and medical devices. It also requires patients to share some costs -- at a higher level than in the United States -- so they have an incentive to avoid unnecessary treatments. And some doctors grumble that cost controls are making it harder these days for a physician to make a franc. 
 The Swiss government also provides direct cash subsidies to people if health insurance equals more than 8 percent of personal income, and about 35 to 40 percent of households get some form of subsidy. In some cases, employers contribute part of the insurance premium, but, unlike in the United States, they do not receive a tax break for it. (All the health care proposals in Congress would provide a subsidy to moderate-income Americans.) 
 Unlike the United States, where the Medicare program for the elderly costs taxpayers about $500 billion a year, Switzerland has no special break for older Swiss people beyond the general subsidy. 
 ''Switzerland's health care system is different from virtually every other country in the world,'' said Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied the Swiss approach extensively. 
 ''What I like about it is that it's got universal coverage, it's customer driven, and there are no intermediaries shopping on people's behalf,'' she added. ''And there's no waiting lists or rationing.'' 
 Since being made mandatory in 1996, the Swiss system has become a popular model for experts seeking alternatives to government-run health care. Indeed, it has attracted some unlikely American admirers, like Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News talk show host. And it has lured some members of Congress on fact-finding trips here to seek ideas for overhauling the United States system. 
 The Swiss approach is also popular with patients like Frieda Burgstaller, 72, who says she likes the freedom of choice and access that the private system provides. ''If the doctor says it has to be done, it's done,'' said Mrs. Burgstaller. ''You don't wait. And it's covered.'' 
 While many patients seem content, the burdens fall more heavily on doctors, especially general practitioners and pediatricians. 
 Dr. Gerlinde Schurter, Mrs. Burgstaller's physician, says she feels squeezed by government regulators and insurance companies that have fought to hold down costs -- most recently with a 15 percent cut in lab fees that forced her five-member group to lay off its principal technician. 
 Dr. Schurter also fears a so-called blue letter, a warning from an insurance company that she is prescribing too many drugs or expensive procedures. 
 If doctors cannot justify their treatments, they can be forced to repay insurers for a portion of the medical services prescribed. And while prescriptions are covered, the government has insisted that consumers fork over a 20 percent co-payment if they want brand-name drugs, rather than 10 percent for generics. 
 Similarly, the government health office also lowered reimbursements across the board for medical devices in 2006. 
 These are among the reasons health care costs consume 10.8 percent of gross domestic product in Switzerland, compared with 16 percent in the United States, the highest level of spending among industrial countries, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 Still, along with lower costs and the freedom to choose doctors come bigger bills for individual patients. On average, out-of-pocket payments come to $1,350 annually. That is the highest among the 30 countries tracked by the O.E.C.D. and well above the $890 average for the United States, which comes in second. 
 Then there are the hefty prices of the insurance policies themselves, which can top 14,000 Swiss francs a year for a family of four in Zurich, or about $13,600. That is roughly comparable to the national average annual premium for a family policy under employer-sponsored group plans in the United States, but in high-cost American cities the figure can be much higher. 
 Direct comparisons are hard to make, however, because in the American system, employers and employees share the cost of premiums, which are also exempt from individual and corporate income taxes. 
 Nevertheless, Swiss citizens relish the lack of bureaucracy, especially compared with systems in Britain and Germany, even if their doctors grumble. 
 As in the United States, practitioners typically are paid on a fee-for-service basis, rather than on salary. But they make less than their American counterparts. According to the O.E.C.D., specialists in Switzerland earn three times more than the nation's average wage, compared with 5.6 times for American specialists. General practitioners in Switzerland make 2.7 times more than the average wage, versus 3.7 in the United States. 
 That is partly because the Swiss health insurers are not shy about using their muscle with physicians. 
 Pius Gyger, director of health economics and health policy at Helsana, the country's biggest insurer, cannot suppress a smile when asked about the effectiveness of the so-called blue letters. 
 ''If there's something strange, we knock at the doctor's door,'' he said. ''For doctors, it's an incentive to treat economically, but often perceived as a threat.'' 
 He estimates that only about 3 percent of doctors get the letters and that fewer than 1 percent actually have to return money. Still, Mr. Gyger said, ''it's an easy exercise for us and it has an effect.'' 
 Despite pressure on general practitioners, hospital physicians like Edouard Battegay at the University of Zurich say universal coverage also lowers costs by reducing emergency room visits. 
 Indeed, his E.R. is as quiet and efficient as a Swiss watch, and he still expresses amazement at what he saw when he worked briefly in Seattle. 
 ''I've seen things in the U.S. that I've never seen here; it was a state of disaster,'' he said. ''Chronic disease management is better here. If you don't treat hypertension, you treat strokes. Not treating patients is expensive.'' 
 And even Dr. Schurter -- who says her income has been flat for the last five years -- praises the virtues of the Swiss system for patients struck by catastrophe. 
 When her daughter was found to have leukemia seven years ago, ''I never worried for a second how and if she'd get treatment and if it would be paid for,'' she said. ''All was granted as naturally as the air we breathe.''

HEADLINE: Broken in U.S.A.

 BODY:
An immigration crackdown by the Obama administration has led to the imminent firing of about 1,800 workers at American Apparel, the trendy clothing company whose downtown factory is one of the largest still left in Los Angeles. 
 This time the feds came with payroll audits rather than the guns and dogs of the Bush years. The director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, called it a milestone in the fight against illegal immigration: ''Now all manner of companies face the very real possibility that the government, using our basic civil powers, is going to come knocking on the door.''
 The government has to enforce the law. But one has to ask who benefits from a crackdown like this. 
 Mr. Morton's own boss, the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, used to argue that crackdowns made no sense when workers had no shot at legalization. ''To look 'tough,' what little enforcement we have ends up being arbitrary and unfair,'' she wrote in a 2007 op-ed article in The Washington Post when she was still the governor of Arizona.
 American Apparel wouldn't be our first target in the notoriously shady garment industry. The government has not charged it with knowingly hiring or exploiting illegal labor. By most accounts it has tried to maintain a legal work force given how hard it is for employers to weed out applicants whose fake documents look authentic. 
 Unlike companies that routinely seek out illegal immigrants (the better to exploit them), American Apparel pays $10 to $12 an hour, well above the minimum wage and industry standards, plus health benefits. It hires locally, cultivates a trained work force and is seen as a valued corporate citizen in Los Angeles. The city's mayor called the firings ''devastating.''
 President Obama and Ms. Napolitano inherited a failed immigration policy. They have promised do better in setting priorities, hunting down abusive employers and pressing for comprehensive immigration reform that will give workers hope and a path to legalization. 
 A crackdown that forces 1,800 taxpaying would-be Americans into joblessness in a dismal economy is a law-enforcement victory only in the bitterest, narrowest sense. As a solution to the problem of unauthorized workers -- 1,800 down, millions to go -- it's ludicrous.

HEADLINE: Chevron Names Successor As Its Chief Steps Down

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation said Wednesday that its vice chairman, John S. Watson, would become chairman and chief executive when David J. O'Reilly retires from those positions at the end of this year. 
 Mr. O'Reilly, 62, will retire from the company and its board on Dec. 31 after a 41-year career, including 10 years as chairman and chief executive.
 Mr. Watson, 52, will be succeeded by George L. Kirkland, 59, as vice chairman, Chevron said. Mr. Kirkland will continue to oversee exploration and production of oil and natural gas.
 Mr. Watson, a 29-year Chevron veteran, was elevated to second in command in April. As vice chairman, he oversees areas like strategic planning and government affairs. 
 He earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from the University of California, Davis, and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago. He has sought to shed unprofitable refineries and focus on oil and gas assets that Mr. O'Reilly amassed through acquisitions and deepwater exploration. 
 Shares of Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., fell 59 cents, to $70.32 in trading Wednesday.

HEADLINE: China's Day Arriving Sooner Than Japan Expected

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
For years, Japan has been readying itself for the day that it is eclipsed economically by China. But as a result of the global slowdown, Japan's difficulty in managing its economy and China's rise -- on vivid display Thursday as Beijing celebrated the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic -- that day may come sooner than anyone predicted.
 Though recent wild currency swings could delay the reckoning, many economists expect Japan to cede its rank as the world's second-largest economy sometime next year, as much as five years earlier than previously forecast. 
 At stake are more than regional bragging rights: the reversal of fortune will bring an end to a global economic order that has prevailed for 40 years, with ramifications across arenas from trade and diplomacy to, potentially, military power.
 China's rise could accelerate Japan's economic decline as it captures Japanese export markets, and as Japan's crushing national debt increases and its aging population grows less and less productive -- producing a downward spiral.
 ''It's beyond my imagination how far Japan will fall in the world economy in 10, 20 years,'' said Hideo Kumano, economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
 Not long ago, Japan was ''the economic miracle,'' an ascendant juggernaut on its way to rivaling the United States, which has the biggest economy.
 Now, many here ask whether Japan is destined to be the next Switzerland: rich and comfortable, but of little global import, largely ignored by the rest of the world.
 Yet even this widely held hope among the country's 127 million people may be slipping from Japan's grasp.
 The per-capita gross domestic product of Japan, which surged past that of the United States in the late 1980s, stalled at $34,300 in 2007; it is now a quarter below American levels and 19th in the world. Both income inequality and poverty are on the rise.
 Unemployment stands at a record high of 5.7 percent, while prices and wages are falling fast. Japan's economy shrank at an annualized rate of 11.7 percent in the first three months of the year before recovering to a modest 2.3 percent annual rate of growth in the second quarter.
 The Chinese economy is likely to expand 8 percent in 2009, while economists expect the Japanese economy to shrink 3 percent for the year before returning to anemic growth of about 1 percent next year.
 The Chinese economy grew about 10 percent a year for most of the last two decades. Over that period, Japan stagnated as huge public works projects aimed at reviving the economy went toward protecting moribund industries instead of fostering new ones, failing to lift Japan out of its doldrums while creating a huge debt burden.
 The troubles in Japan have been confounded by its worst recession in postwar history, brought on by the financial crisis that swept across the globe. As demand evaporated in important overseas markets, production and exports slumped as much as 40 percent this year.
 Even Japan Inc. is increasingly falling off the global map. In 1988, Nomura Securities issued a ranking of companies by market capitalization, and 8 of the top 10 were in Japan, topped by Nippon Telegraph & Telephone.
 As of July 31 this year, not a single Japanese company made the global top 10.
 The list was dominated by companies based in China and the United States; Toyota Motor ranked No. 22, at $144.5 billion, and only five other Japanese companies made the top 100.
 The richest man in Japan, the retailing entrepreneur Tadashi Yanai, was 76th in the most recent global Forbes list, behind moguls from countries like Mexico, India and the Czech Republic -- a far cry from the late 1980s, when Japanese industrialists like the railroad tycoon Yoshiaki Tsutsumi were among those at the top.
 China has also surpassed Japan in having the biggest trade surplus and foreign currency reserves, as well as the highest steel production. And next year, China could overtake Japan as the largest automobile producer.
 A new government has vowed to take Japan on a new development path, one that relies less on the exports that have long driven growth and is more focused on increasing domestic demand. The Democratic Party, which recently swept the long-ruling Liberal Democrats out of power, has promised to strengthen social welfare and redistribute wealth more evenly.
 Per-capita income in China is still less than a tenth that in Japan. But by other measures, the Chinese economy long ago overtook that of Japan.
 In terms of overall purchasing power, China surpassed Japan in 1992 and will overtake the United States before 2020.
 In some ways, this reflects economic fundamentals: As countries develop, growth tends to slow. Annual growth in Japanese gross domestic product averaged 10.4 percent in the 1960s and 5 percent in the 1970s, but only 4 percent in the 1980s and 1.8 percent in the 1990s, according to Goldman Sachs. In the first decade of this century, growth has been even slower.
 Some economists say Japan does not need to fear its neighbor. China became Japan's largest trading partner in 2006, and China-bound exports were among the first to show signs of recovery in the recent slump. As the global auto market stagnates, carmakers like Toyota and Nissan are making a renewed play for the Chinese market.
 ''Japan is neighbors with a rapidly growing market,'' said Nobuo Iizuka, chief economist at the Japan Center for Economic Research. ''That is a great advantage, not a threat. The question is, can Japan build on that advantage?''
 Still, said C. H. Kwan, a senior fellow at the Nomura Institute of Capital Market Research, based in Tokyo, ''this is a big psychological shock to Japan.''
 Mr. Kwan, a native of Hong Kong, migrated to Tokyo after being awed by the 1979 book ''Japan as No. 1,'' by Ezra F. Vogel, who sang the praises of the country's fast economic growth.
 Now, he is working on a book of his own: ''China as No. 1.''
 Based on current growth and currency trends, Mr. Kwan forecasts that the Chinese economy could surpass that of the United States in 2039. And that date could move up to 2026 if China lets its currency appreciate by a mere 2 percent a year.
 ''We're no longer talking about China making lots of shoes,'' he said. ''China is about to leave everyone behind in a big way.''

HEADLINE: Manhattan Apartment Sales Bounced Back Over the Summer, but Not All the Way

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After a year of declines in Manhattan co-op and condominium sales, the residential market has perked up enough for real estate appraisers and brokers to at least debate the question on the minds of many New Yorkers: Has the market reached a bottom yet?
 Market reports released on Friday showed that during this year's third quarter, July through September, the number of sales rose steeply from the second quarter, but remained below the levels of last year's third quarter. 
 Sale prices moved roughly sideways, with some up and some down, compared with those in the second quarter, though the prices of loft apartments and new condominiums continued to fall, according to third-quarter data.
 A report by one broker, Prudential Douglas Elliman said the number of sales was up 45.6 percent from the second quarter, but down 16 percent from the third quarter of last year. It put the average co-op and condo apartment sale price at $1.32 million, off 10.6 percent from the same quarter in 2008, but up 0.8 percent from the second quarter. Co-op prices were down 5.9 percent from the previous quarter, while condominium prices were up 3 percent. 
 Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who, as the president of Miller Samuel Inc., prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that while the Manhattan housing market may be improving in some ways, it had ''not yet found a bottom.''
 Mr. Miller cited high local unemployment, tight credit and a ''shadow inventory'' of new condominiums not officially listed on the market as reasons for pessimism. On the other hand, he noted, sales have picked up and the number of owners listing apartments is falling. 
 Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, was more upbeat. She said that her firm had experienced its busiest summer in years, because buyers who had been ''unwilling to pull the trigger'' in the spring had more confidence in the market. ''We see the market as stabilizing,'' she said. ''It has hit bottom.'' 
 Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, another broker, declared that with the rebound in the stock market and slowing job losses, buyers were becoming more comfortable. ''Confidence is returning to the marketplace,'' he said.
 Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group brokerage firm, said that ''if we are not at a bottom, we are close to it.'' She added that the rise in sales and the decline in inventory were strong signs of an improving market at a time when the Wall Street bonus season is approaching.
 She said listings in September had fallen to the lowest level in a year and were nearly 10 percent below the level of a year ago, when the economy staggered after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
 Yet despite the increase in sales, she said she had seen little evidence that prices will rise significantly in the near future. In fact, she said, the average sale price on Upper East Side town houses is still 50 percent below the price in the first quarter of last year. 
 Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the market reports for Brown Harris Stevens and another brokerage, Halstead, said that despite the surge in sales and increased confidence, prices of large Upper East Side apartments with three or more bedrooms lagged 42 percent below the prices of a year ago, and 12 percent below the second quarter. 
 He said that during the third quarter of last year, there were eight sales of apartments for more than $20 million, including two for over $40 million and four others between $30 million and $40 million. In the last quarter, he said, there was only one sale of more than $20 million. 
 The Elliman report put the average sale price of a co-op at $1 million and the median price at $630,000. It found that the average price of a condominium was $1.58 million, while the median price was $1.02 million. 
 Spring is usually the busiest season for apartment sales in Manhattan. But Mr. Miller said that because sales in the spring were chilled by difficult economic conditions, the usual surge in sales happened later, during the third quarter, rather than in the second quarter. ''The spring market in effect occurred this summer,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Partial Shutdown Ended in Michigan

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
After months of trying to solve a $2.8 billion state deficit, fatigued and frustrated Michigan lawmakers reached some budget agreements early Thursday, but only after a standoff had shut down the government briefly for a few hours overnight. 
 The technical shutdown, which most in Michigan slept through, had no practical effect, and state employees returned to work as usual on Thursday, officials in Lansing said. But the impasse over cuts to nearly everything, even as the state's new budget year was dawning at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, underscored the size of the financial struggle in a state where the economy was all but devastated even before the recession arrived elsewhere. 
 In the end, lawmakers reached agreements on how to solve much of the deficit, and they gave themselves a one-month deadline extension -- keeping government employees working -- on the rest. But there were no painless answers, and much of the turmoil fell along partisan lines. Republicans control the state senate, and Democrats control the house and the governor's office. 
 Some Republicans have staunchly opposed raising taxes in the face of the state's high unemployment rate, and the early morning agreements -- which are next to be considered by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm -- reflected deep cuts across the board, from revenue sharing with Michigan's cities to Medicaid payments. Some Democrats, loathe to go along with some of the cuts to education and college scholarships, have indicated they still may consider tax increases on the matters left unresolved. Michigan's annual state fair, meanwhile, which is the oldest in the country and which had been targeted for cutting, survived, at least for 2010, under the agreements.
 While other states experienced surpluses during parts of the last decade, Michigan has faced deficits for at least eight years. Whatever conclusions officials in Lansing ultimately reach on this year's budget, some in the state say they are still more fearful of Michigan's budget prospects two years from now. That is when federal stimulus money, which is being used to plug some of the holes this year, is no longer promised.

HEADLINE: Putting the 'I' in Aid

BYLINE: By PETER BERGEN and SAMEER LALWANI. 
Peter Bergen is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Sameer Lalwani is a research fellow there.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is right to warn that efforts to rebuild that country depend on winning the ''struggle to gain the support of the people.'' And few issues do more to stoke the resentment of ordinary Afghans than the tens of billions of dollars of foreign aid from which they have seen little or no benefit. They see legions of Westerners sitting in the backs of S.U.V.'s clogging the streets of Kabul and ask themselves what exactly those foreigners have done to improve their daily lives. 
 Eight years after the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. And by some estimates 40 percent of international aid leaves the Afghan economy as quickly as it comes in -- going to pay Western security contractors, maintain back offices in the West and pay Western-style salaries, benefits and vacations -- while as little as 20 percent of that aid reaches its intended recipients. Compounding this problem, the salaries of imported civilian workers are orders of magnitude higher than those of their Afghan peers. Some employees of the United States Agency for International Development, for instance, earn more than 300 times the monthly pay of an Afghan teacher. 
 Yes, when it comes to large-scale projects like building roads and hospitals, Western contractors have to take the lead because Afghan companies are years away from having enough experience. But there is a way for the Afghan government to recoup some of the billions of dollars of aid flowing to those contractors and being recycled back to the West: tax it. 
 Foreign contractors and corporations working in Afghanistan do not pay income taxes there; and if they do pay taxes at all, it is to their home governments. America and its European allies could easily give up claims on taxes from their citizens working in Afghanistan and instead condition contracts so that the workers and the companies that employ them pay Afghan taxes. The loss in tax revenue suffered by Western countries would be trivial compared to the good will this would engender among Afghans. Right now the government's tax revenues total a paltry $300 million. Taxing foreign technical assistance alone -- an estimated $1.6 billion annually -- could double this revenue. 
 And this would require little sacrifice from the 70,000 or so foreigners working in Afghanistan. Afghan taxes are quite low, with the highest bracket set at 20 percent, while technical advisers from Western development agencies can earn $9,000 to $22,000 per month and private contractors can earn even more. With Western unemployment rates high, it is unlikely that having to pay a relatively paltry amount of tax to Afghanistan would deter contractors or corporations from taking on lucrative work there. 
 The money isn't the only issue: because it is dependent on foreign aid for about 90 percent of its budget, Afghanistan is fiscally and politically unaccountable to its people. The government needs to build a taxation bureaucracy or it will never develop many of the abilities critical to governance, like budgeting and allocating resources. Since the taxable Afghan population is now tiny -- most citizens are either desperately poor or operate within the large black market economy -- the quickest path to developing a working revenue system is by taxing the foreign workers and companies. 
 New tax revenues from foreign contractors should be used, above all, to pay down a substantial portion of the cost of building up the Afghan National Army, which is $1 billion to $2 billion annually. Foreign contractors have a vested interest in helping the army develop, as it will eventually provide the security that will allow them to continue enjoying their lucrative contracts after Western forces eventually withdraw.
 While they face risks, contractors in Afghanistan are also faring quite well financially. It's time they returned some of that wealth to the Afghan people.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Upgrades Forecast for World Economies

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund on Thursday forecast that the world economy would expand 3.1 percent next year, after a year in which much of the world struggled through a recession. 
 In its World Economic Outlook, the fund's prognosis was marginally better than its prediction in July that growth in 2010 would reach 2.5 percent. But it emphasized that the upswing was mainly a result of aggressive crisis management in the United States, Europe and Asia, not a self-sustaining recovery.
 ''Premature exit from accommodative monetary and fiscal policies seems a significant risk, because the policy-induced rebound might be mistaken for the beginning of a strong recovery in private demand,'' the fund wrote.
 It added that the ''fragile global economy'' was still vulnerable to other potential shocks, including a run-up in oil prices, a widespread outbreak of swine flu, global political events and protectionism.
 The forecast masked significant differences among regions, the monetary fund said. It predicted China's economy would register 9 percent growth next year.
 But the United States can expect an expansion of 1.5 percent, and the 16-nation euro zone a 0.3 percent growth rate, weak performances for advanced industrial economies.
 The I.M.F. said the American economy would contract 2.7 percent for all of 2009, and the euro zone's would shrink 4.2 percent.
 The forecasts come as the monetary fund acknowledged that the world was emerging from a difficult recession, helped by stimulus policies in the United States, Europe and China.
 ''The global economy appears to be expanding again, pulled up by the strong performance of Asian economies and stabilization or modest recovery everywhere,'' the fund wrote.
 The monetary fund emphasized what private sector economists have observed about the upswing, that it is driven mainly by a rebuilding of depleted inventories. But the fund also said there were ''some signs of gradually stabilizing retail sales, returning consumer confidence and firmer housing markets.''
 But it also observed that rising joblessness remained a threat.
 ''Unemployment rates are expected to remain at high levels over the medium term in a number of advanced economies,'' it stated.

HEADLINE: How Do Japanese React to China's Rise? Depends on Their Age

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
How Japanese see the coming role reversal with China depends largely on what generation they are from. Young Japanese, in particular, feel apathy and bewilderment. They came of age in Japan's lost decade of economic stagnation. 
 When the Internet research company Macromill asked 500 20-year-olds whether they would describe Japan's future as ''bright'' or ''dark,'' 82 percent chose dark. Japanese executives are the most pessimistic in the world, according to a recent cross-cultural survey that scored responses from 7,200 respondents on the outlook for their businesses in the short term.
 ''Many in Japan have lost hope,'' said Yuji Genda, a labor economist at Tokyo University. ''And a society that loses hope loses the will to try to make things better.''
 It has been a spectacular rise and fall for Japan. At the end of World War II in 1945, the country lay in ruins, hardly able to feed itself and relying on emergency shipments of food and supplies from the occupying United States Army.
 By 1968, Japan's economy was on a road to rapid recovery, overtaking West Germany to jump to No. 2 in the world under the wing of its ally and biggest trading partner, the United States. 
 Growth slowed somewhat after the oil supply shocks of the 1970s. But into the late 1980s, the world was awash with Japanese money as corporations snapped up prime real estate like Rockefeller Center in New York.
 Remembering the good times, retiring baby boomers are nostalgic for the glorious past. Indeed, bars, restaurants and even small theme parks recreating motifs from the Showa era -- the period of the previous emperor's reign from 1926 to 1989 -- have popped up all over the country, serving retro beers and displaying posters of long-gone movie stars.
 ''Japan had good times. We all worked hard, and companies only knew how to grow,'' said Atsushi Kachi, drink in hand at the Nippon Saisei Sakaba, a 1950s-era restaurant in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo that serves grilled meats and beers of the age. ''Back then, people believed their lives would get better,'' said Mr. Kachi, 59, who works for a trading company.
 Japanese familiar with World War II and its disastrous aftermath have a different perspective. Japan may soon be eclipsed by China, said Masaru Mizuno, 77, a longtime bureaucrat who once ran Japan Tobacco, one of Japan's largest companies. ''But it is not as if we will go back to an era of mass starvation,'' he said.
 ''The overall size of the economy does not matter. The lives of ordinary Japanese have so improved in the last few decades,'' Mr. Mizuno said. ''What is there to complain about?''

HEADLINE: Activist Energy With a Light Touch

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Known to many New Yorkers primarily for art exhibitions, Asia Society is a grander entity than its Park Avenue galleries might suggest. According to its press materials, the institution's overarching mission is to ''promote understanding among the people, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States'' and to generate new ideas in ''the fields of policy, business, education, arts and culture.''
 Are those fields listed in order of importance? If so, it might explain why the work in the society's surveys of new art, like the current ''Hanging Fire: Contemporary Art From Pakistan,'' tends so often to be topical in content, market ready in format and didactic in delivery.
 One of the first of the society's big one-country shows, ''Inside Out: New Chinese Art'' in 1998, sold itself on the notion that the most significant work emerging from China was all by brash, young, implicitly democracy-loving rebels in thrall to the Western media and eager to break with their own cultural past. This profile was meant to win Western hearts, and it did. That many artists still produced ink-and-brush landscapes and calligraphy and were subtly but radically updating these traditions was barely acknowledged. 
 In 2005, ''Edge of Desire: Recent Art in India'' focused heavily on art that addressed current social issues like sectarian violence and the effects of a global market economy. Not represented was a range of new abstract or near-abstract art and sculpture from South Asia that doesn't necessarily look ''Indian'' and that is personal, and only incidentally political, in content. 
 This exhibition of new art from Pakistan, with its references to war, religion and consumerism, largely conforms to the Asia Society model, except for its size. The Chinese show had more than 60 artists, the Indian survey more than 40. Both were spread over two New York City spaces. ''Hanging Fire'' has 15 artists and takes up just two Asia Society galleries, one very modest in scale. 
 So it doesn't pretend to be a survey. It's a closely edited group show drawn from a small pool of artists, most of whom attended the National College of Arts in Lahore. Given these restrictions, it's surprising that the show has the variety it does.
 Lahore had been a cultural hub for centuries by the time Pakistan was separated from India in 1947, and it has remained so. After partition, the National College of Arts was forged from an existing colonial institution, and schools were also established in other cities. Various forms of up-to-date modernism were introduced, often by local artists who had returned from study in Europe. 
 But progress was never smooth. Contemporary art maintained an uneasy relationship with the country's successive military governments and with the state religion, Islam. Social and cultural repression was particularly intense during the era of Islamization initiated by General Zia ul-Haq in the late 1970s, when women were discouraged from public participation in cultural life and only landscape painting, calligraphy and abstraction passed official muster. 
 Despite obstructions, and also because of them, art moved forward with an activist urgency that it has not lost. Catalytic figures appeared, many of them women. Salima Hashmi, the curator of the Asia Society show, is one. After graduating from the National College in 1968, she began to teach there, remaining an influential and vocal presence.
 The senior artist she has chosen for the show is a former teaching colleague, the painter Zahoor ul Akhlaq, who had tremendous impact on younger artists before he died in 1999, the victim of a violent crime: he was shot and killed when someone broke into his home. As a teacher, he revived interest in manuscript painting (also known as miniature painting), the indigenous genre dating back to the Mughal dynasty, encouraging young artists both to master its demanding forms and styles and to infuse them with new content. 
 Several artists he inspired now have international reputations, most notably Shahzia Sikander, but also Ambreen Butt, Imran Qureshi and Saira Wasim. Mr. Qureshi, who was born in 1972 and has become an influential figure himself, has a series of paintings in the show of observant Muslims going about their lives. The style is crisp and deft, but the figures of bearded young men are clearly meant to pique our jihadist fears.
 The show has direct references to violence, two of which involve images of animals. Rashid Rana's gorgeous ''Red Carpet 1'' is collage of thousands of tiny photographs taken in a slaughterhouse. Huma Mulji's ''High Rise, Like City Drive'' consists of the taxidermied form of a water buffalo set atop a neo-Classical column. Although the piece, made for the show, comes with elaborate socio-political glosses, it is, intentionally or not, a monument to the death of an innocent being. 
 A hyper-realist drawing of a single bullet by Ayaz Jokhio, Arif Mahmood's photograph of a boy playing with a toy gun and Ali Raza's image, collaged from burned paper, of a veiled and screaming woman are in line with an international view of Pakistan as one big danger zone. Faiza Butt's confectionary, gender-blend painting of turbaned men surrounded by hair dryers, pistols and ice cream cones takes some of the edge off of this paranoiac view and is one of the more interesting of the show's several exercises in issue-driven whimsy.
 The others probably suffer from being seen in a Western institutional context, where they lose some of their complexity. They include Asma Mundrawala's little pop-up versions of nostalgic fantasies; Adeela Suleman's motorbike helmets for women, made from cooking pots; Hamra Abbas's rocking-horse version of the winged creature who flew the prophet Muhammad to Jerusalem from Mecca; and Bani Abidi's video of a Paskistani pipe band taking a stab at ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' 
 This light-touch approach to politics has become common in contemporary art in the last decade, perhaps in reaction to heavy-hitting work of the 1990s. Wit can be effective but can too easily devolve into cleverness without some toughing edge of weirdness. Mahreen Zuberi's gouache paintings of dental procedures have that edge. So do Nazia Khan's semi-abstract drawings of -- what? Cloth? Wrinkled skin? Damaged flesh? That we can't tell is what gives the work some resistance, makes it feel personal rather than just an illustration of smart ideas. 
 This sense of the personal is very much present in a 1997 triptych by Mr. Akhlaq called ''A Visit to the Inner Sanctum 1-3,'' in which he acknowledges his debt to miniature painting but goes beyond it with a dark, near-abstract vision of birds and calligraphic characters that seem to emerge from a rain of ashes. Anwar Saeed's gawky homoerotic figures, particularly those painted and collaged on the pages of a little printed book, similarly feel as if they're about something that mattered deeply to the artist, that they're a physical extension of him. 
 A student and teaching colleague of Mr. Akhlaq, Mr. Saeed was visiting him the night of the shooting and was badly wounded himself. The miniature-size pictures in the book were his first attempts to retrain himself physically to paint. That he returned to art with images considered morally unacceptable in his culture adds a political dimension to his work that intensifies it without entirely defining it. 
 In a neutral context, we would probably stop and look at these paintings because they are baffling and magnetic, as personal as diary entries. We might then become aware ofthe complicated skill that went into their making. Only last are we likely to want to place them in the political context of ''contemporary art from Pakistan.''
 If exhibitions encouraged us to approach art in something like this order, rather than the other way around, we might have an art experience deeper and more lasting than that given by even the most polished institutional package tour.

HEADLINE: Twins Stay Alive, but Not Without Incident

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Manager Ron Gardenhire should have been wearing a smile of relief after the Minnesota Twins squashed the Detroit Tigers, 8-3, to keep their slim chances of winning the American League Central alive. If the Twins had lost Thursday, their pursuit of first place would have been over.
 Instead, Gardenhire was red-faced and stern-voiced and did not show a hint of a smile. Gardenhire was annoyed because Jose Mijares, a Twins reliever, had inexplicably thrown behind Adam Everett. The Tigers reacted by plunking Delmon Young, who angrily pointed at his own dugout to blame Mijares. 
 ''Our guy just lost his composure,'' Gardenhire said. ''I have no clue what he did, why he let the ball fly like that. It's all been taken care of. I talked to Mr. Leyland and told him we screwed up on that and you guys did what you had to do and we'll go from there.''
 Where Gardenhire's Twins and Manager Jim Leyland's Tigers go from here is toward a dramatic weekend. The Twins are two games behind the Tigers with three games remaining. While the Twins are still in a tenuous position after splitting the four-game series, they have guaranteed that Friday's game against the Kansas City Royals will be meaningful. 
 ''We're still breathing,'' said Joe Mauer, who went 2 for 4 with two runs batted in and a run scored as the designated hitter.
 With the Twins leading by seven runs in the eighth inning, Mijares became upset after two Tigers took bases on defensive indifference. Mijares responded to the Tigers' running from first to second by throwing a pitch behind Everett. On Jeremy Bonderman's first pitch in the ninth, he hit Young in the back of the right knee. Young fell to the grass, grabbing his knee. After Young stood up, he marched toward the Twins' dugout and seemed ready to scold Mijares.
 ''He needs to understand how to play the game,'' Young told reporters from Minnesota. ''This isn't the minor leagues over here.''
 As Mijares dressed quickly and spoke to no one, he moved his head from side to side to see who was around him. When reporters approached Mijares, he kept tying his shoes and said, ''I don't need no questions now.''
 Although the Twins had secured their most important victory of the season, they were subdued and embarrassed. Mike Redmond, who was catching Mijares, said Mijares ''just lost it out there,'' and guaranteed that he would not be reckless again.
 ''It definitely took some fun out of the game for me,'' Redmond said. 
 The Tigers did not reward the majority of the 40,533 in attendance who had hoped to see them clinch their first division title since 1987. Little has gone smoothly this season for the Tigers, who will face Jake Peavy and the Chicago White Sox on Friday. 
 The fans in this beleaguered city are still waiting for a celebration. 
 Mel Nashatka woke up at 3:50 a.m. on Thursday to make the 45-minute drive from his home to Sun Steel Treating, Inc., in South Lyon, Mich. Nashatka and his fellow employees have taken 20 percent pay cuts and have lost some medical benefits so Sun could stay open. He was at his desk by 5 a.m.
 Because it was a slow day, Nashatka was able to drive to Comerica Park to see if the Tigers could clinch the division. He went online, bought two tickets for $64 and persuaded Chris Benning, a co-worker, to join him. 
 ''You get to forget about your own personal issues and come out and enjoy the game,'' Nashatka said. ''It takes you away for a while.''
 Unemployment in this beleaguered city is about 25 percent, a sobering statistic that is much more relevant than Magglio Ordonez's batting average. Still, Andrew Ryba, a teacher who played hooky in hopes of seeing the Tigers secure the division, said it was good ''to be talking about something besides losing benefits and unemployment.''
 Tigers center fielder Curtis Granderson said fans had told him that they had already purchased playoff tickets, but he wondered how much impact the Tigers could have on the bleak situation. 
 ''If we happen to win this whole thing, it's still going to be the exact same position we're in,'' Granderson said. ''It's one of those things where you get something to smile about for a little, but the reality is still there.''

HEADLINE: New York Philharmonic Won't Go to Cuba Without Patrons

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Ginger Thompson and Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
Violinists, bassoonists and timpanists in Cuba? Fine. A bevy of rich Americans? Sorry.
 The New York Philharmonic scratched its trip to Cuba at the end of October because the United States government was barring a group of patrons from going along, the orchestra said on Thursday. Without them and their donations, the Philharmonic said, it could not afford the tour. 
 About 150 board members and other donors had promised to pay $10,000 each to spend Oct. 30 to Nov. 2 in Havana, where the orchestra was to play two concerts, said Zarin Mehta, its president. The money was to have covered the cost of the proposed trip, which came at the invitation of the Cuban government. 
 Supporters, both individuals and executives of donor companies, usually tag along with major orchestras when they travel around the world. For some, the travel amounts to high-class tourism, along with a chance to make business connections in foreign capitals. In effect, orchestras would not be able to raise tour money without giving the donors a chance to accompany them.
 ''The patrons were excited about giving us the money with the opportunity of going to see Havana and be a witness and support their orchestra,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''This is what's important to them.'' Mr. Mehta said he would not consider taking the patrons' money while leaving them behind.
 ''I wouldn't want to insult them,'' he said. ''I think it's most likely they would say, 'Go another time.' '' That's what the orchestra will try to do, he said.
 Mr. Mehta said he had hoped that pressure applied by New York elected officials -- including Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representatives Steve Israel and Charles B. Rangel, who have supported the trip -- would help to have the decision overturned. ''They haven't been successful,'' he said. ''They're befuddled.''
 The spokesman for the State Department, which guides the Treasury Department in deciding which Americans can go to Cuba, said the reason was simple.
 The sanctions on Cuba permit performing artists to enter, said the spokesman, P. J. Crowley, but ''there's no permitted category of travel that would include the Philharmonic patrons. Basically they're tourists, and we don't license tourist travel to Cuba under the present circumstances.''
 He said there was also an economic component to the decision: the wealthy patrons could spend large amounts of money in Cuba, which would effectively violate economic sanctions. 
 In response to the Philharmonic's position that it could not go without the financial supporters, he said, ''Perhaps the New York Philharmonic should have checked with the government before announcing the trip.'' 
 The cancellation was an embarrassment and something of a setback in the New York Philharmonic's effort to cast itself as the nation's flagship traveling orchestra. It made headlines with a trip to Pyongyang, North Korea, nearly two years ago (no United States government permission for patrons was required) and leaves on Sunday for an Asian tour that will take in another Communist nation, Vietnam.
 The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issues licenses to visit Cuba because of the longstanding economic sanctions aimed at the island's Communist government.
 According to the orchestra, the office said informally that the players and staff members would be allowed to go, but not the patrons. 
 A lawyer for the orchestra has delivered a brief to the licensing office, making its case that the categories are elastic and an exception should be made for the donors. Several board members were allowed to accompany the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra when it visited Havana in 1999.
 The trip plans came about amid a warming of relations between Cuba and the United States. The Obama administration has restarted talks about migration and eased limits on remittances and travel by Cuban-Americans to the island to visit relatives. But as a sign of the political thorniness involved in closer ties, the administration extended for a year the law used to impose the trade embargo on Cuba.
 Bills pending in both houses of Congress would lift travel restrictions on all Americans to Cuba. The bills have a surprising level of bipartisan support, helped by lobbying by agricultural and business groups eager to expand commercial ties.
 ''This exposes how arbitrary the rules are governing American citizens' rights to travel to Cuba,'' Julia E. Sweig, an expert on Cuba at the Council on Foreign Relations, said of the Treasury Department's position. ''If you have a family member there, you can go. If you play an instrument or sport, you can go. But if you're a philanthropist who wants to support arts in Cuba, you can't?''
 J. Christopher Flowers, a Philharmonic trustee, said he was still hoping to go to Cuba with the orchestra someday. ''It sounds absolutely fascinating,'' he said, but he declined to offer an opinion on the decision. ''It's up to the government to make the rules and for us to follow them,'' he added. ''It's not for me to try to figure out our policy with respect to Cuba.''
 Mr. Flowers said he did not know whether he would have spent much money in Cuba. ''I've never been there,'' he said. 
 Mr. Mehta said the next opening for a Cuba trip would probably come in June or July. The orchestra will try to come up with concerts quickly to play at its Avery Fisher home for the time it would have been in Havana.
 As for programming on those dates, Mr. Mehta said, Latin American music is a distinct possibility. ''The thought has crossed our minds.''

HEADLINE: Pakistani Military Ready to Move Taliban Fight to Group's Stronghold in Waziristan

BYLINE: By ISMAIL KHAN

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan 

 BODY:
After fighting peripheral wars against militants for the last several years, the military is poised to open a campaign in coming days against the Taliban's main stronghold in Pakistan's tribal areas, South Waziristan, according to senior military and security officials.
 For three months, the military has been drawing up plans, holding in-depth deliberations and studying past operations in the area, where previous campaigns ended in failure and resulted in some of the military's highest levels of casualties. 
 Even so, military officials said they expected stiff resistance once again in an area that one senior military official called the ''epicenter'' of the Taliban in Pakistan. It has also become a key base for Al Qaeda. ''This is where we will be fighting the toughest of all battles,'' the official said.
 He and other officials did not want to be identified while discussing confidential preparations for the campaign. But they said the military now seemed ready to try to re-enter the area, having decided it could wait no longer. ''If we don't take the battle to them, they will bring the battle to us,'' the official said. 
 The past two operations in South Waziristan ended up with the military bogged down and suing for peace, resulting in a series of accords that ultimately strengthened the hand of the militants.
 An operation in January 2004 led to a peace agreement by that April, followed by another on Feb. 5, 2005, with Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. But with few if any enforcement mechanisms, the accords were never sturdy and allowed the militants to regroup and tighten their hold on the region. 
 In late January 2008, the military began another operation, called Zalzala, or Earthquake, with the declared goal of dislodging Mr. Mehsud. The operation did not cause even a tremor, and only 12 days later, authorities were struggling to revive the peace accord. 
 With the failure of the operation went any pretense of state authority in Waziristan, as the government in effect ceded control to emboldened militants.
 Military officials hope that things will be different this time, having now taken on militants' strongholds, each in their turn, in recent years in other areas: first in Bajaur, then in Mohmand and, most recently, in the Swat Valley. Perhaps most critical was the elimination of Mr. Mehsud, whose death in an American drone strike in August helped fracture the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban. ''The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan as a monolithic organization remains no more,'' a security official said. 
 Since June, Waziristan has been under an economic blockade, with thousands of army soldiers sitting on the fringes of the area, waiting for orders from the military high command to move in.
 Some argue that the military should have mounted an operation immediately after Mr. Mehsud's death. ''As far as we are concerned, the operation should have been launched three months ago,'' said a senior government official. ''Baitullah is dead and his group seems to be in some form of disarray. And this provides the best opportunity to go after them.'' 
 But a senior military official said that, in addition to needing to wait for the forces and resources to be available, the military wanted to see what would be the repercussions of Mr. Mehsud's death. 
 ''We thought that Baitullah's death would unravel the Mehsud militant group and galvanize the tribe to stand up to the people they have suffered from,'' the official said. ''It didn't happen.'' 
 Now there is a sense within the military establishment that the situation in South Waziristan cannot be allowed to be perpetuated. The blockade is nearly three months old, and the military, which has been conducting limited airstrikes, is running out of targets. 
 The Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, described Waziristan as an intelligence black hole. ''We have to move in,'' he said recently.
 A large number of civilians have already relocated to Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, both in North-West Frontier Province, giving the army a relatively free hand to mount an operation.
 But all agree that the battle ahead is formidable. Questions remain whether the army will be able to hold territory and sustain operations in a tough and treacherous terrain, where snows arrive in late November.
 The Mehsud militants not only have the advantage of familiarity with the area, but their numbers -- estimated at 6,000 to 7,000 -- have been thickened by foreign elements, in particular Uzbeks, who have a reputation as ferocious fighters. 
 Then there is the Haqqani network, which uses the area as a base for its operations in Afghanistan, and there is Al Qaeda, which depends heavily on the Mehsud fighting force. ''They will defend their power base and fight till the very last,'' one officer said.

HEADLINE: Matters of Finance And Safety Unsettled As Season Begins

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The National Hockey League opened its 92nd season Thursday night, but the big attraction, the Winter Olympics, will take place in February in Vancouver. That is where Canada, the host; Russia, the world champion; and Sweden, the defending Olympic champion, will lead a field packed with the N.H.L.'s best players, including Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Lidstrom, in what promises to be an enthralling two-week tournament.
 But before then, the N.H.L. faces a series of challenges, coming off one of its most successful seasons in recent years, but one of its worst off-seasons. 
 The challenges begin on the ice, where the league has faced intense scrutiny for declining to institute any rules against what hockey people call head shots, or checks to the head. 
 The issue arose again during the preseason, when Dion Phaneuf, Calgary's heavy-hitting defenseman, leveled Islanders right wing Kyle Okposo with what was technically a legal check, delivered shoulder to head. Okposo was taken off on a stretcher after lying motionless for six minutes with a concussion, a reminder of several high-profile incidents last season.
 Four seasons ago, as part of a concussion management program, the Ontario Hockey League, a prime feeder of talent to the N.H.L., imposed automatic penalties for all checks to the head, including incidental contact. Despite the success of the move in the O.H.L., and the success of the National Football League in imposing penalties for hits to the head, N.H.L. general managers refused at a meeting in June to recommend a rule against such hits. 
 ''I'm telling you there were 30 G.M.'s in that room, and there's no appetite for an automatic penalty,'' Brian Burke, the general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, said after the meeting. ''Hitting is a critical part of our game; it's distinctive to North American hockey.''
 That remains the league's view, and it is almost certain to be tested again during the regular season. According to a study by the National Academy of Neuropsychology, 759 N.H.L. players sustained concussions from 1997 to 2008.
 The disposition of the Phoenix Coyotes provides the league's biggest boardroom challenge. An embarrassed N.H.L. wound up bidding for the team in federal bankruptcy court over the summer after several buyers dropped out. It was an attempt to stop the Canadian billionaire James L. Balsillie, who had angered the league by defying its rules concerning relocation with earlier attempts to buy a team and move it to Hamilton, Ontario. 
 Balsillie's bid was thrown out in court on Wednesday, much to the league's relief. The judge allowed the N.H.L. to continue to look for a buyer for the Coyotes, but that may be difficult, considering the potential buyers who walked away from the team, which according to a court audit lost $72.1 million in 2008. 
 The Coyotes case cast a pall on the N.H.L.'s summer after the league posted the highest attendance figures and television ratings since the 1970s. That success was fueled almost entirely in hockey's traditional strongholds in Canada and the northern tier of the United States, where teams like Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago and Boston drew big followings.
 But in the Sun Belt, teams struggled, casting into question the N.H.L.'s long push to develop hockey in nontraditional cities. Phoenix, Atlanta, Florida, Tampa Bay and Nashville have ownership or other financial problems, which could be exacerbated with league revenue leveling off in the current recession.
 The league's television exposure in the United States continues to be problematic. Last season, Versus recorded a 13 percent gain in viewership for its N.H.L. telecasts, but at midnight Aug. 31 the satellite provider DirecTV dropped the network over a fee dispute. To make up for the shortfall, the league will start the season by providing three weeks of free service for its N.H.L. Center Ice package.
 Even the Olympics, seemingly a bright spot, provide a potential stumbling block for the N.H.L. 
 Despite the intense interest that the Olympic tournament generates, this may be the last time the league participates in the Games. 
 The N.H.L., locked in a simmering battle with the Russian Kontinental Hockey League over player signings and, ultimately, control of the lucrative European market, has indicated it may not take part in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. 
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and other officials have cited various reasons for their reluctance to commit to Sochi, among them: the Games disrupt the N.H.L. schedule; and an Olympic tournament played overseas does not provide much benefit for the league. 
 Burke even went so far as to suggest that hockey be moved to the Summer Games, a move that is impossible under the Olympic charter, which mandates that sports played on ice and snow belong exclusively to the Winter Games. 
 Compounding problems for the league is the players' overwhelming support for Olympic participation. In July, Ovechkin was named an official ambassador for the Sochi Games. 
 ''Nobody can say to me, You can't play for your country in the Olympic Games,'' Ovechkin told ESPN in New York last month, adding that he would go even if it meant being suspended by the Washington Capitals, his N.H.L. team.
 But in February, Ovechkin is expected to be in Vancouver for the Winter Games, along with the rest of the world's best players. If that tournament and the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs are anywhere close to as good as last season's hockey, the N.H.L. will have weathered many of the storms that confront it as the 2009-10 campaign begins.

HEADLINE: It's Close To Cancun, But Only In Miles

BYLINE: By JIM ATKINSON

DATELINE: Playa del Carmen, Mexico 

 BODY:
Forty miles down the Riviera Maya coast via Mexico 307, I was a world away from the relentless hubbub of Cancun, rolling along a narrow, winding flagstone road to the ocean through mangrove so thick that it blocked the sun in spots. 
 Over the last 15 years, as Cancun's growth has begun to max out, vacationers and retirees have looked to the Riviera Maya, the 100-mile stretch of blue-green Caribbean and bleached white sand that stretches south to Tulum. There are now a total of 35,000 hotel rooms, condominiums and timeshares on a coast that not long ago was largely fishing villages backed by scrubland and verdant jungle.
The result is a kind of anti-Cancun. That resort town, Mexico's most famous, is all about the vertical, the high density, the buzz and the next margarita. The Riviera, though, is about the horizontal (resorts can't be more than four stories), low density (developers can build on only 5 percent of their land), environmental sustainability, diving the world's second-longest barrier reef (after the Great Barrier in Australia) and climbing the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba. 
 ''It's a few miles down the highway,'' said Laura Zapata, president of the Riviera Maya branch of A.M.P.I., the Mexican association of real estate professionals. ''But it's a different universe.''
 Certainly, that's what Ara Der Sarkissian, 36, of Los Angeles, felt he was getting when two years ago he plopped down $1.3 million for a 1,500-square-foot beachfront condo at Rosewood Mayakoba, in the Mayakoba resort complex here being developed by OHL, a Spanish company. Mr. Sarkissian took a second mortgage on property he owns in Los Angeles, where he is a broker at his family's real estate firm.
 ''It's just that the beach was so beautiful,'' he said, recalling that he fell in love with the place back in 2007, when he visited while on a cruise to nearby Cozumel. ''This property can be anything you want to make of it -- formal or laid-back.'' Mr. Sarkissian said that because he stayed at the property only five to seven weeks out of the year -- Rosewood leases it the remainder of the time -- he has been able to pay off his loan and all fees to Rosewood and pocket a little profit most months. 
 Mexican economic growth forecasters expect the Riviera Maya to experience a 15 to 20 percent decline in sales of such seven-figure-and-up properties, like Banyan Tree's villas, and so appreciation of existing properties may slow as well. But it will be decelerating from a growth of 19.5 percent in 2007 -- which is why Mr. Sarkissian said he thought his property was worth $2 million. 
 Mr. Sarkissian is one of about 10,000 Americans who are property owners here; they constitute about 5 percent of the Riviera Maya's total population of 235,000. The rest are an amalgam of Canadians, Europeans, Latin Americans and Mexicans. 
 Mayakoba -- a 1,600-acre development that will eventually feature 1,000 rooms and residences under the flags of Banyan Tree, Fairmont, Viceroy and Rosewood properties -- has given the Riviera Maya a bit of a snooty reputation. But it is actually a demographically ecumenical place, one long mall of second-home possibilities that stretches from the lofty heights of Mayakoba to the more modest Playa del Carmen, where Paul Ilg, 75, and his wife, Geri, 69, of Clarkston, Mich., bought a home. The Ilgs decided to live half the year in what is Riviera's fastest-growing beach town after Mr. Ilg's retirement a decade ago from General Dynamics.
 Though neither speaks much Spanish, plays golf or scuba dives, after a vacation here in 1999 they found a two-bedroom condo in the heart of town for $79,000, which they paid cash for by taking a second mortgage on their home in Michigan. They enjoy long walks along the town's funky Fifth Avenue -- 10 blocks of nonstop restaurants, cantinas, jewelry and T-shirt shops -- and the ''sweetness'' of the town, despite the fact that its population has tripled in the time they've lived there. It doesn't hurt that Mr. Ilg estimates that his condo has appreciated to $180,000. (This kind of value is another reason that the American contingent here may be the only truly happy American homeowners I've spoken to lately.) 
 George Williams, a retired printing company owner from Seagoville, Tex., visited the region five years ago on a dive trip to Cozumel. He and his wife had always loved the beach life, and so he did some whimsical home hunting in Playa and bought a lot for $150,000 in one of its original gated communities. An airy, 4,000-square foot, $500,000 hacienda wasn't far behind. ''I wake up to the sounds of tropical birds,'' he said. ''We have our own iguana out back. That money's in a better place than it could be. I'm a happy man.''
 Mr. Williams's neighborhood has the air of an established suburb in Southern California. But for a more bohemian feel -- and prices -- the town of Puerto Morelos, about 20 miles north of Playa del Carmen, is probably the ticket. 
 ''You tell me where you can get beachfront anywhere else in the world for under $300,000,'' said Amber Pierce-Schulz, a local real estate agent, after showing me a one-bedroom, 800-square-foot condominium on the water. 
 The newest boomtown is Tulum, where the main draw is the ruins of a Mayan seaport. The Riviera can keep propagating fresh generations of condos and villas in a wide range of niches because of that endless beach -- development theoretically can extend another 50 miles south of Tulum, with the exception of lands protected by an ecological reserve, to the border with Belize. But the real secret to its success may have more to do with Cancun and less to do with that vast coastline. 
 The Riviera Maya may pose as an anti-Cancun, but it benefits a great deal from the Mexican government's emphasis on public safety and quality health care in and around its most valuable resort town. Though Mexico's nationalized health care system ranks 61st out of 190 systems rated in the world by the World Health Organization in 2000 -- the last time the group did the survey -- care there can cost less than half what it does in the United States, which was ranked 37th in the same survey.
 Public safety in Mexico is difficult to make sweeping assurances about these days. But most of the drug cartel violence that has received so much publicity has usually occurred in the nation's border towns. 
 Ultimately, a bigger problem for the Riviera Maya may be continuing to live up to its promise of delivering beauty without the excesses of Cancun. A drive through Tulum revealed the good news that, on the beach side, developments are adhering to low-rise, low-density dictates; but also the bad news that, on the inland side, where developments of ''shoe box'' housing are serving buyers seeking less expensive homes, the beginnings of a backslide can be seen. 
 It's hard to know if development on Cancun's scale is inevitable, but if that happens, it most likely won't be because of Ray Graham, 74, of Latrobe, Pa., who was relaxing at his hacienda near Bacalar -- said by some to be the next Tulum. Insects swarmed through the air, and the humidity from the nearby lagoon made it difficult to breathe, giving the setting more an aura of the Mosquito Coast than any riviera. 
 But Mr. Graham and his wife, Reba, 70, had found what they wanted. ''We like it out here,'' he said, wiping sweat from his brow and gazing at the jungle surrounding them. ''It's away from all that in Cancun. Away from everything.''

HEADLINE: After Clunkers Program, Sales Are Slow Again

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
After two frenzied months during the government's cash-for-clunkers program, new-vehicle sales in the United States retreated in September to levels seen earlier this year, automakers said Thursday.
 General Motors said its sales declined 45 percent, and Chrysler reported a 42 percent drop from September 2008.
 September was the second-worst month of the year for the auto industry, with a seasonally adjusted selling rate only slightly higher than February. 
 ''Floor traffic was lousy all month,'' Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president of United States sales, said in a conference call with reporters and analysts. ''Every brand, every region of the country -- it was a real post-clunker hangover. It was disappointing. I expected the month to be a bit stronger, but it just wasn't.''
 Sales were down 20 percent at Honda, 13 percent at Toyota and 7 percent at Nissan.
 The Ford Motor Company, which has been gaining market share both from new models and by surviving without a government rescue or bankruptcy, said its sales declined just 5 percent last month. For the entire third quarter, sales by Ford's three domestic brands rose 5 percent, the company's first quarterly increase in four years.
 ''I've never seen a roller coaster like this,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president of United States sales, service and marketing. 
 ''It was a breathtaking quarter, and it really put the Ford plan to the test. But instead of leaving us vulnerable to the peaks and valleys of the third quarter, our broad, balanced product line delivered sales and share gains from all corners.''
 The best news for the month came from Hyundai, which has been gaining momentum throughout the recession. Hyundai said its sales rose 27 percent in September.
 Total industry sales fell 23 percent from a year ago and 41 percent from August, when the cash-for-clunkers program was halted after it ran out of money.
 ''We believe the remainder of 2009 will continue to be a challenge for the U.S. automotive market,'' said Peter Fong, the head of Chrysler's sales organization. ''Credit markets have thawed slightly but still remain tight, and consumer confidence, as we saw in September, is tenuous.''
 The good news for automakers is that the market is no longer deteriorating, though it is not improving very quickly. Also, the clunkers program cleared out inventories at many dealerships, leading G.M., Ford and other manufacturers to increase production at some plants and call back thousands of laid-off workers to their assembly lines. The depleted stocks hindered sales at many dealers in September but left the automakers in a better position to compete and make profitable sales in the months ahead.
 ''Where we are at now is pretty much where we were before clunkers,'' said Jesse Toprak, the vice president of industry trends and insights at TrueCar.com, a Web site that tracks automotive sales and pricing. ''We hit the bottom -- now we can safely say because it's been a while -- back in February. But now we're struggling to jump-start the industry.''
 The surprisingly popular clunkers program resulted in nearly 700,000 sales in July and August, a welcome respite for dealers whose showrooms were nearly empty all winter and spring. The program gave credits of up to $4,500 to consumers who traded in an older, inefficient vehicle and bought a new one with a higher fuel-economy rating.
 Some of those purchases most likely would have been made in future months even without the clunkers program, but automakers say many of those who took part in the program typically buy used cars instead of new ones.
 Analysts expect sales to improve for the rest of the year, and the drastic declines at the end of 2008 mean the industry will probably begin posting positive numbers in year-over-year comparisons. A slowly improving economy suggests that demand for new vehicles will rise in the months ahead, though 2010 is not expected to be significantly better.
 ''While it's going to be a tough road here over the next 12 or 18 months, we're certainly moving in the right direction,'' said George Magliano, director of auto industry research at IHS Global Insight.
 At G.M., which is eliminating four of its eight brands as part of its postbankruptcy restructuring, sales for the four brands that will remain -- Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC -- were down 41 percent in September. Sales for the four brands being cut -- Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn -- were down 67 percent.
 On Wednesday, G.M.'s deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive fell apart when the company from which Penske planned to buy future Saturn models rejected the plan. G.M. said it planned to stop building Saturn vehicles and to wind down the brand and its 350 dealerships.
 G.M. said Saturn stores had about 12,000 vehicles in inventory, roughly enough to last four more months.

HEADLINE: Nike Denies Signing Vick To an Endorsement Deal

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
In a signal that Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick still has a long way to go before attracting major endorsements, Nike on Thursday clarified reports that it had signed a contract with him, even as it acknowledged that it had agreed to give him free products. 
 ''Nike does not have a contractual relationship with Michael Vick,'' KeJuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman, said in a statement. ''We have agreed to supply product to Michael Vick as we do a number of athletes who are not under contract with Nike.''
 The company's statement came a day after news media outlets reported that an executive at Best, the agency that represents Vick, had announced news of a deal with Nike at a sports sponsorship meeting in New York. The Sports Business Journal quoted Vick's agent, Joel Segal, saying that Vick would receive shoes, gear and apparel from Nike, while declining to discuss terms. 
 ''Mike has had a great relationship with Nike and is excited to be part of the Nike team again,'' Segal told The Sports Business Journal.
 Segal did not return calls for comment Thursday.
 Vick endorsed Nike from 2001, when he was the No. 1 overall pick in the N.F.L. draft, through 2007, after he was indicted on federal dogfighting charges. He served 18 months in prison and returned to football this season for the first time since 2006.
 Nike's denial of an endorsement deal indicates how far Vick still has to go to rebuild his reputation, said Bob Williams, the chief executive of Burns Sports and Entertainment and an expert on celebrity endorsements. 
 ''More time needs to pass,'' he said. ''You want to be sure as an advertiser that Michael Vick is going to live by the new habits that he's created since leaving prison.''
 Others questioned whether he would ever be able to attract major deals again. 
 ''I don't see at a lot of options for him, endorsement-wise,'' said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director of Baker Street Advertising and a sports marketing expert. Dorfman, who noted that Vick's performance was mediocre in his first game of the season Sunday, said advertisers were looking for proven winners in a recession. ''At this point, you could barely call him a B-level player. It just isn't worth it.''
 Williams pointed out that Nike had provided Vick with free products, which could be construed as a low-level endorsement. 
 ''Nike wants to maintain the relationship in case this is a great comeback story and he rehabilitates himself,'' Williams said.
 Dorfman and others were not so sure, saying it was more likely a sign of loyalty to one of their former stars. 
 ''He was a fairly solid member of their roster, pre-dogfighting days, and did some very good advertising for them,'' Dorfman said.

HEADLINE: Texas Governor Defends Shakeup of Commission

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Just before he was executed in 2004 for setting a fire that killed his three children, Cameron T. Willingham declared, ''I am an innocent man convicted of a crime I did not commit.'' Now his words seem to be echoing in the race for governor of Texas.
 In what some opponents say looks like a political move and Gov. Rick Perry says was ''business as usual,'' the governor replaced the head of the Texas Forensic Science Commission and two other members on Wednesday, just 48 hours before the commission was to hear testimony from an arson expert who believes that Mr. Willingham was convicted on faulty testimony, a conclusion that has been supported by other experts in the field. 
 Mr. Perry's decision to shake up the commission and put one of his political allies in charge has, at the least, delayed the inquiry into the Willingham case. While Mr. Perry says he has no political motive for the move, his opponents have called for the commission to finish its inquiry.
 ''If a mistake was made in this case, we need to know it,'' Tom Schieffer, a Fort Worth businessman and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in a statement. ''No one in public life should ever be afraid of the truth.''
 Mr. Perry's opponent in the Republican primary, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, also questioned what harm the hearing could do. ''I am for the death penalty,'' Ms. Hutchison told The Dallas Morning News, ''but always with the absolute assurance that you have the ability to be sure, with the technology that we have, that a person is guilty.'' 
 Mr. Perry denied Thursday that the changes he had made at the commission were intended to quash the investigation. At a news conference for his re-election campaign, he said, ''Those individuals' terms were up, so we're replacing them.''
 He said the commission was ''going to take a look at any new information that anybody has,'' adding that ''to make a statement now that it was not arson is a little premature.''
 The governor was in office when Mr. Willingham was executed on Feb. 17, 2004. He denied the condemned man a reprieve even after a detailed report by an arson expert said the evidence that Mr. Willingham had set the fire was flimsy and inconclusive. 
 Last month, Mr. Perry expressed confidence that Mr. Willingham was guilty and played down reports casting doubt on the original investigation, calling the authors ''supposed experts,'' while making a quotes gesture with his fingers.
 Mr. Perry, facing the primary challenge from Ms. Hutchison, has been working to shore up his support among conservatives, who usually decide the Republican primary here.
 Mr. Willingham, an unemployed auto mechanic with a history of petty crime, was convicted of setting his house in Corsicana on fire in 1991. His three small daughters died in the blaze, and he maintained right up to his death that he had tried to save them. The police doubted his story partly because his bare feet had not been burned.
 Local arson investigators testified at his trial that, judging by the charring and fracture patterns of broken glass left by the blaze, someone had poured a flammable liquid under the children's beds, along the hallway and out the front door. The jury took less than an hour to convict Mr. Willingham.
 In 2004, however, Gerald L. Hurst, an Austin scientist and fire investigator working in Mr. Willingham's behalf, reviewed the evidence and determined the investigators had relied on several outdated and discredited methods to reach their conclusions. Most of the evidence could be explained by an accidental fire, Dr. Hurst said. 
 That conclusion was confirmed six weeks ago by an independent arson expert hired by the Forensic Science Commission, which was created in 2005 to investigate mistakes in crime laboratories after scandals rocked the one in Houston. The expert, Craig L. Beyler, of Baltimore, said in his August report that ''the investigators had a poor understanding of fire science'' and that the evidence they cited did not support a finding of arson. 
 Mr. Beyler was to testify before the commission in Dallas on Friday. But the newly appointed chairman, John M. Bradley, the district attorney in Williamson County, canceled the hearing, saying he did not know enough about the inquiry. ''I felt I had been asked to take a final exam without having an opportunity to study for it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bradley said he did not know if he would continue the inquiry into the Willingham conviction that his predecessor had started. He said he wanted to consult with the lawmakers who created the commission about its mission.
 The former chairman, Sam Bassett, an Austin lawyer whom Mr. Perry had twice appointed to the commission -- and could have reappointed -- said the governor had not told him why he was replaced. Mr. Bassett said he had hoped to produce a definitive report on the case by next spring. 
 ''I hope they continue and complete the Willingham investigation,'' he said. ''It's important for the future of criminal justice in Texas to make sure good science is being used in the courtroom.''

HEADLINE: In Networks' View, Chicago Is the Most Attractive Choice

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics would probably bring in more money from a United States TV network -- and more from corporate sponsors -- than Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo or Madrid, industry executives say. The International Olympic Committee will pick a city Friday in Copenhagen, setting the stage for the negotiations that will provide the bulk of its television revenue. A Chicago win is expected to generate a three-way bidding war between NBC Universal, ESPN and Fox.
 The prospect of a domestic Olympics is so tantalizing that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, said last month that his Fox network would enter the 2014-16 Olympic TV bidding only if Chicago won. 
 Yet, in recognizing that Chicago would raise the price tag, he added, ''I don't want to call anybody a liar, but no one's ever made any money out of it'' -- contradicting NBC's claims of past profits. Murdoch might have been teasing a rival and tweaking the I.O.C., which scorned and ignored his bid for the 2000 Sydney Summer Games.
 Barry Frank, executive vice president of IMG Sports Media and a veteran Olympic rights negotiator, estimates that Chicago would generate a 10 percent higher network rights fee than Rio. ''Advertisers are sympathetic to a U.S. event,'' Frank said from Malta. ''It offers great proximity for sponsor hospitality and it would get the kind of coverage that will get on newspapers and on TV because it's so immediate.''
 John Skipper, ESPN's executive vice president for content, said, ''We rate Chicago the most attractive and most valuable, followed by Rio, with Madrid and Tokyo next.''
 Chicago offers everything a network wants. A mega-event in its domestic backyard, enabling it to show as much as possible live in prime time, a huge ratings advantage over Games in Europe or Asia.
 Still, Rio has advantages. It would be the first South American city to host an Olympics -- fitting the I.O.C.'s desire to spread its influence to a new continent -- and its location in a time zone one hour later than New York's would make showing events live in prime time as easy as it would from Chicago. 
 I.O.C. members might also view Rio as a city whose government-guaranteed Olympic budget would not force them to finance a revenue shortfall out of TV and sponsorship money as it has promised to do for Vancouver, which hosts the Winter Games in February, and might have to for Chicago.
 The price of Olympic TV rights has been on a long, nearly continuous upward spiral, thanks largely to a $5.7 billion spending spree by NBC Universal that has ensured its hold on every Summer and Winter Games from 2000 to 2012. Six years ago, NBC outbid Fox and ESPN/ABC for the rights to the 2010 Vancouver Winter and 2012 London Summer Games by agreeing to pay $820 million and $1.18 billion, respectively. 
 The I.O.C. has informally told interested networks that the 2014-16 bidding, delayed by the recession, will occur after the Vancouver Games. But the excitement of a Chicago victory could induce the I.O.C. to accelerate the schedule. 
 Of the three likely bidders, ESPN has the most financial muscle: dual revenue streams from advertising and subscriber fees, worth billions of dollars, could help it easily outbid its rivals as it did when it outspent Fox for the Bowl Championship Series rights.
 When the networks submit their bids, they will certainly calculate that the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, which is eight hours ahead of the Eastern time zone in a little-known area, will generate much lower revenue than any of the cities vying for the 2016 Summer Games.
 Neal Pilson, an industry consultant who acquired the rights to the 1998 Nagano Winter Games when he was the president of CBS Sports, said that Sochi, unlike Salt Lake City or Vancouver, is hurt by its distant, remote location from the United States, raising the cost of bringing in manpower and equipment. Nor is it attractive to sponsors.
 ''That would be balanced by the attraction of the 2016 cities,'' he said. ''You do a plus-minus analysis.''
 Chicago's appeal might also help lure more sponsorship deals, as the I.O.C. and the United States Olympic Committee build their rosters of sponsors. Of the I.O.C.'s nine global sponsors, three are signed through 2016, and two others extended their deals through 2020.
 The U.S.O.C. is still filling out its roster of 2010 and 2012 sponsors after six declined to re-up after last year's Beijing Games. The U.S.O.C. receives 20 percent of the I.O.C.'s global sponsorship revenue, and 12.75 percent of its TV revenue. That contractual formula remains a subject of heated dispute. Last spring, both parties agreed to defer discussing any changes until 2013.
 Rio could be highly attractive to sponsors with global reach who look at Brazil and South America as emerging markets, as some might have viewed Beijing last year. But Pilson said that the effect of the global recession, and the scrutiny by the media and Congress of the activities of sponsors has changed attitudes. Staying in this country means less cost and less risk.
 ''In the old days, you might have said, Why go to Chicago if you can go to Rio?'' he said. ''But in today's marketplace, it's, I'd rather go to Chicago, which is true for advertisers, sponsors and networks.''

HEADLINE: Mission Not Accomplished

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Stocks are up. Ben Bernanke says that the recession is over. And I sense a growing willingness among movers and shakers to declare ''Mission Accomplished'' when it comes to fighting the slump. It's time, I keep hearing, to shift our focus from economic stimulus to the budget deficit.
 No, it isn't. And the complacency now setting in over the state of the economy is both foolish and dangerous. 
 Yes, the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration have pulled us ''back from the brink'' -- the title of a new paper by Christina Romer, who leads the Council of Economic Advisers. She argues convincingly that expansionary policy saved us from a possible replay of the Great Depression.
 But while not having another depression is a good thing, all indications are that unless the government does much more than is currently planned to help the economy recover, the job market -- a market in which there are currently six times as many people seeking work as there are jobs on offer -- will remain terrible for years to come. 
 Indeed, the administration's own economic projection -- a projection that takes into account the extra jobs the administration says its policies will create -- is that the unemployment rate, which was below 5 percent just two years ago, will average 9.8 percent in 2010, 8.6 percent in 2011, and 7.7 percent in 2012. 
 This should not be considered an acceptable outlook. For one thing, it implies an enormous amount of suffering over the next few years. Moreover, unemployment that remains that high, that long, will cast long shadows over America's future. 
 Anyone who thinks that we're doing enough to create jobs should read a new report from John Irons of the Economic Policy Institute, which describes the ''scarring'' that's likely to result from sustained high unemployment. Among other things, Mr. Irons points out that sustained unemployment on the scale now being predicted would lead to a huge rise in child poverty -- and that there's overwhelming evidence that children who grow up in poverty are alarmingly likely to lead blighted lives.
 These human costs should be our main concern, but the dollars and cents implications are also dire. Projections by the Congressional Budget Office, for example, imply that over the period from 2010 to 2013 -- that is, not counting the losses we've already suffered -- the ''output gap,'' the difference between the amount the economy could have produced and the amount it actually produces, will be more than $2 trillion. That's trillions of dollars of productive potential going to waste.
 Wait. It gets worse. A new report from the International Monetary Fund shows that the kind of recession we've had, a recession caused by a financial crisis, often leads to long-term damage to a country's growth prospects. ''The path of output tends to be depressed substantially and persistently following banking crises.''
 The same report, however, suggests that this isn't inevitable: ''We find that a stronger short-term fiscal policy response'' -- by which they mean a temporary increase in government spending -- ''is significantly associated with smaller medium-term output losses.''
 So we should be doing much more than we are to promote economic recovery, not just because it would reduce our current pain, but also because it would improve our long-run prospects. 
 But can we afford to do more -- to provide more aid to beleaguered state governments and the unemployed, to spend more on infrastructure, to provide tax credits to employers who create jobs? Yes, we can.
 The conventional wisdom is that trying to help the economy now produces short-term gain at the expense of long-term pain. But as I've just pointed out, from the point of view of the nation as a whole that's not at all how it works. The slump is doing long-term damage to our economy and society, and mitigating that slump will lead to a better future.
 What is true is that spending more on recovery and reconstruction would worsen the government's own fiscal position. But even there, conventional wisdom greatly overstates the case. The true fiscal costs of supporting the economy are surprisingly small. 
 You see, spending money now means a stronger economy, both in the short run and in the long run. And a stronger economy means more revenues, which offset a large fraction of the upfront cost. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the offset falls short of 100 percent, so that fiscal stimulus isn't a complete free lunch. But it costs far less than you'd think from listening to what passes for informed discussion. 
 Look, I know more stimulus is a hard sell politically. But it's urgently needed. The question shouldn't be whether we can afford to do more to promote recovery. It should be whether we can afford not to. And the answer is no.

HEADLINE: Bernanke, in a Bow to Critics of Fed's Role, Supports Forming a Regulatory Group

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, told skeptical lawmakers on Thursday that the Fed should be put in charge of regulating the nation's biggest financial institutions.
 But in a nod to critics who have expressed alarm about the Fed's immense power during the financial crisis, Mr. Bernanke said responsibility for monitoring broader risks in the financial system should go to a council of regulators. 
 ''We have never supported, and the administration has never supported, a situation in which the Fed would be some kind of untrammeled super-regulator,'' he told members of the House Financial Services Committee. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed would be merely one of several players on the new council, and he endorsed the Obama administration's proposal to have the Treasury lead that council. The council, he said, would pool the expertise of individual regulatory agencies and make it easier to identify and coordinate their reaction to risks that ripple across different institutions and markets.
 This year, administration officials and some lawmakers envisioned that the Fed would take on a broader role as the primary watchdog over risk throughout the financial system.
 But while most lawmakers have praised the Fed's aggressive efforts to tame the crisis, others have attacked it for failing to prevent the problems in the first place and then amassing too much unchecked power in bailing out the financial industry.
 As a result, even some of the Fed's supporters in Congress predict that the agency's role will be more modest than they originally thought.
 ''There were some, myself included, who earlier this year thought the Federal Reserve would have a larger role than it looks like it will have,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the financial committee.
 Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee, said Republicans would prefer to strip the Fed of all its regulatory powers and leave it with just its core role of setting monetary policy.
 ''The Federal Reserve offered few warnings of the forces undermining the foundations of our markets,'' Mr. Bachus said on Thursday. ''What has changed that should make us believe the Fed will be up to the task in the future that it so manifestly could not handle in the past?'' 
 President Obama's proposal would put the Fed squarely in charge of complex financial institutions -- probably about 20 major bank holding companies and a few other giant institutions -- that could jeopardize the financial system if they failed. 
 Mr. Bernanke outlined several ways in which he would subject these institutions to tougher oversight.
 He called for imposing higher capital requirements, not just to provide more cushion against possible losses but also to penalize companies for becoming too big to fail.
 ''Enhanced requirements are needed not only to protect the stability of individual institutions and the financial system as a whole, but also to reduce the incentives for financial firms to become very large in order to be perceived as too big to fail,'' he told lawmakers.
 Mr. Bernanke said that giant financial players might be forced to adopt ''contingent'' capital -- selling bonds that would automatically convert into common stock if a company had trouble. 
 The idea of contingent capital has been gaining popularity within the Fed; officials contend that it would expose bondholders to more risk and therefore make them more reluctant to let giant banks finance their growth with debt.
 As a practical matter, most government bailouts have wiped out ordinary shareholders while partly or entirely rescuing bondholders and other creditors.
 Mr. Bernanke carefully stayed out of the battle over Mr. Obama's proposal to create a new consumer financial protection agency. That proposal would strip the Fed of its authority to regulate deceptive practices in consumer lending, an idea that Fed officials bristle at privately but do not oppose publicly.
 Mr. Bernanke conceded that the central bank had failed to prevent the explosion of no-document mortgages and other exotic practices at the heart of the mortgage bust, though he said the Fed was ''competent'' at protecting consumers and had adopted much tougher rules in recent years.
 Mr. Bernanke also said the Fed would gladly support another part of the regulatory overhaul that would reduce its power to bail out financial institutions in the event of ''unusual and exigent circumstances.''
 If Congress gave the government new power to shut down troubled financial giants, Mr. Bernanke said, he would be happy to give up the power to bail them out.
 ''No one is more sick of bailouts than I am,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Another Shoe Flies, This Time in Istanbul at I.M.F. Chief

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
A protester threw a shoe at the managing director of the International Monetary Fund at the end of his speech at a university on Thursday in the prelude to I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Istanbul. 
 The protester, Selcuk Ozbek, a student at Anadolu University, shouted, ''Get out of the university, I.M.F. thief!'' threw a white sneaker and ran toward the podium where the managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stood. But televised images showed Mr. Ozbek being quickly tackled by security guards.
 A female student then tried to unfurl a banner but was surrounded by security officials, allowing Mr. Strauss-Kahn to calmly answer a last question before leaving the hall. 
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn played down the episode. ''I was glad to meet students and hear their views,'' he said in a written statement released afterward. ''This is what the I.M.F. needs to do, even if not everyone agrees with us. One thing I learned: Turkish students are polite. They waited until the end to complain.'' 
 He filed no official complaint, and Mr. Ozbek was freed by the police later in the evening. 
 ''I think this is how global capital should be welcomed wherever it goes,'' Mr. Ozbek told NTV on a live broadcast. ''The anti-imperialist youth of any country responsible for their future should act this way.'' 
 Mr. Ozbek said his shoe was returned to him after his protest.
 Like his inspiration, Muntader al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who threw shoes in December at President George W. Bush in Baghdad, Mr. Ozbek, 24, works at a news outlet. He is a full-time editor on the politics desk at Birgun, a left-wing daily, his department confirmed.
 The hurled shoe lost speed after it hit a seated student posing a question with a microphone in hand, and so it missed the director, slow-motion television pictures showed. But while a Turkish shoe company claimed to have made Mr. Zaidi's shoe -- a statement that promptly increased its sales worldwide -- Mr. Ozbek's shoe was reported to have been made by Nike.
 Halil Guven, the dean of Bilgi University, where the event occurred, said that the university was used to protests because it often served as a site for controversial speeches and events.

HEADLINE: Caught in a Bad Current

BYLINE: By STEFAN MILKOWSKI

DATELINE: MARSHALL, Alaska 

 BODY:
Just a few years ago, king salmon played an outsize role in villages along the Yukon River. Fishing provided meaningful income, fed families throughout the year, and kept alive long-held traditions of Yup'ik Eskimos and Athabascan Indians. 
 But this year, a total ban on commercial fishing for king salmon on the river in Alaska has strained poor communities and stripped the prized Yukon fish off menus in the lower 48 states. Unprecedented restrictions on subsistence fishing have left freezers and smokehouses half-full and hastened a shift away from a tradition of spending summers at fish camps along the river.
 ''This year, fishing is not really worth it,'' said Aloysius Coffee, a commercial fisherman in Marshall who used to support his family and pay for new boats and snow machines with fishing income.
 At a kitchen table cluttered with cigarettes and store-bought food, Mr. Coffee said he fished for the less valuable chum salmon this summer but spent all his earnings on permits and gasoline. ''You got to sit there and count your checkbook, how much you're going to spend each day,'' he said. 
 The cause of the weak runs, which began several years ago, remains unclear. But managers of the small king salmon fishery suspect changes in ocean conditions are mostly to blame, and they warn that it may be years before the salmon return to the Yukon River in large numbers.
 Salmon are among the most determined of nature's creatures. Born in fresh water, the fish spend much of their lives in the ocean before fighting their way upriver to spawn and die in the streams of their birth.
 While most salmon populations in the lower 48 states have been in trouble for decades, thanks to dam-building and other habitat disruptions, populations in Alaska have generally remained healthy. The state supplies about 40 percent of the world's wild salmon, and the Marine Stewardship Council has certified Alaska's salmon fisheries as sustainable. (In the global market, sales of farmed salmon surpassed those of wild salmon in the late 1990s.)
 For decades, runs of king, or chinook, salmon -- the largest and most valuable of Alaska's five salmon species -- were generally strong and dependable on the Yukon River. But the run crashed in the late 1990s, and the annual migrations upriver have varied widely since then. ''You can't depend on it any more,'' said Steve Hayes, who manages the fishery for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
 Officials with that department and the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, which jointly manage the fishery, say variations in ocean conditions related to climate change or natural cycles are probably the main cause of the weak salmon runs. Certain runs of chinook salmon in California and Oregon have been weak as well in recent years, with ocean conditions also suspected.
 In Alaska, fishermen also blame the Bering Sea pollock fishing fleet, which scoops up tens of thousands of king salmon each year as accidental by-catch. The first hard cap on salmon by-catch is supposed to take effect in 2011, but the cap is not tough enough to satisfy Yukon River fishermen. 
 The Yukon River fishery accounts for a small fraction of the state's commercial salmon harvest. But the fish themselves are considered among the best in the world, prized for the extraordinary amount of fat they put on before migrating from the Bering Sea to spawning grounds in Alaska and Canada, a voyage of 2,000 miles in some cases. 
 Most commercial fishing is done on the Yukon River delta, where mountains disappear and the river branches into fingers on its way to the sea. Eskimos fish with aluminum skiffs and nets from villages inaccessible by road. Beaches serve as depots and gathering places.
 Kwik'Pak Fisheries, in Emmonak, population 794, is one of the few industrial facilities in the region. Forklifts cross muddy streets separating storage buildings, processing facilities and a bunkhouse for employees from surrounding villages.
 For decades, almost all commercially caught king salmon were sold to buyers in Japan. But in 2004, Kwik'Pak began marketing the fish domestically, and for a few years fish-lovers in the lower 48 could find Yukon River kings at upscale restaurants and stores.
 This year, Kwik'Pak sent just six king salmon to a single buyer in Seattle, and only a trickle of other kings made it to market. Most of those fish were caught incidentally during an opening for fall chum salmon.
 Kwik'Pak is promoting chum salmon, also known as keta, and experimenting with an oily whitefish called cisco. But harvests of those fish are limited, and the price paid to fishermen is much less than for kings.
 The company, which was formed in 2002 in part to develop local economies, now runs a store selling fishing supplies and hauls gravel in trucks that once carried fish. This summer, employees spent their time repainting the Catholic church. 
 ''We're a one-resource economy down here,'' said Jack Schultheis, the company's general manager. ''We don't have the oil fields or timber or anything else to work on. This is all we've got.''
 In the 1980s and early 1990s, commercial fishermen on the lower river made an average of $8,000 to $12,000 in gross earnings, sometimes more. Since 2000, that number has been closer to $4,000, and this year, it dropped to just over $2,000. 
 ''You gotta try to find some other work,'' said Paul Andrews, a commercial fisherman in Emmonak. ''It's really, really hard out here.''
 Like many on the Yukon delta, Mr. Andrews relies on income from fishing to sustain a subsistence lifestyle that also includes hunting for moose, seals and migratory birds.
 Arthur Heckman, who manages a small store in the village of Pilot Station, says more and more people are asking him for credit. ''Some days I have people call me up and say, 'I just want a box of crackers,' or 'I just want to buy some Pampers,' '' he said.
 The cost of living in remote villages along the river is high, and many residents rely on a mix of part-time work and government aid. Most also rely on fish. 
 Nets stretch from riverbanks, and fish wheels -- large rotating traps built on driftwood rafts -- turn in the current near eddies. Simple smokehouses rise from every village beach and fish camp. 
 King salmon, which can weigh 30 pounds or more, are cut into long strips and dried for weeks over smoking alder or poplar. The candylike strips are ubiquitous here, served always with a sturdy cracker called Pilot Bread. Salmon are also canned, frozen and salted. 
 This year, fishery managers for the first time closed all subsistence fishing on the first pulse of king salmon and cut fishing times in half on later pulses, leaving many residents with just two 18-hour periods a week to fish. 
 Zeta Cleaver, one of the only people fishing in the middle-river village of Ruby in late July, said people called her from as far away as Anchorage wanting to buy fish. She used to catch more than a dozen king salmon a day and fill her smokehouse with fish for her children and grandchildren, she said. This year she got only a few kings.
 Until recently, many residents gathered with family to fish from remote camps along the river, a holdover from a migratory lifestyle that included summer camps for fishing and winter camps for hunting and trapping.
 This year, restrictions on fishing, combined with the high cost of gas and continuing societal shifts, kept many camps empty. A reporter's 900-mile canoe trip down the Yukon and Tanana Rivers showed countless camps shuttered or abandoned. Multifamily camps that once rivaled nearby villages in population seemed more like quiet retreats from them.
 High prices for heating fuel and limited fishing income left many lower-river residents in dire straits last winter and prompted shipments of food and other aid. With this year threatening to be even worse, Alaska's governor, Sean Parnell, in August sought federal disaster relief for Yukon River residents. The request is still pending.
 In Marshall, people are bracing for a long winter. Heating oil costs more than $7 a gallon here, and a can of condensed milk sells for nearly $4. Villagers are going moose-hunting in groups to save on the cost of gasoline.
 ''The whole community is kind of hurting,'' said Mike Peters, a fisherman and heavy equipment operator. ''People really depended on the fish, and it's not there.''

HEADLINE: UNEMPLOYMENT CLIMBS TO 9.8% FOR SEPTEMBER

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After several months in which the American economy flashed tentative signs of improvement, a sobering report on the national job market released on Friday amplified worries that a lengthy period of lean times lay ahead.
 The economy shed 263,000 jobs in September, and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent in August, according to the Labor Department's monthly snapshot of the employment picture.
 Though the job market worsened, the pace of deterioration remained markedly slower than during the early months of the year, when roughly 700,000 jobs a month were disappearing. That improvement seems consistent with the widespread belief that the recession has given way to economic growth. Yet the report also buttressed fears that economic expansion would be weak and hesitant, with scarce paychecks and economic anxiety remaining prominent features of American life well into next year.
 ''This is a weak report,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ''The rate of job loss has tapered off, but we still haven't reached the point where businesses are willing to hire.'' 
 The Labor Department also made a preliminary revision in its survey of private employers that indicated the job market shrank even more during the recession. The department disclosed that in March this year the economy held 824,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, making an already bleak picture worse.
 The endurance of hard times seems likely to increase pressure on the Obama administration and Congress to consider another dose of spending aimed at stimulating the economy, even as the government grapples with deficits projected by some economists to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade.
 Despite a $787 billion stimulus package adopted early this year and aimed in part at shoring up state and local coffers, government jobs slipped by 53,000 in September.
 ''That's the budget crunch hitting,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''We're still losing jobs at a very rapid pace. We're still looking at an economy with a lot of weakness.''
 For millions of unemployed people, the latest data merely confirms something they have come to understand intimately, through the discouraging process of seeking work.
 ''There's nothing out there,'' said Jerry Lamirande, a technology systems engineer in Amarillo, Tex., who has been without a job since April 2008.
 During the technology boom of the late 1990s, Mr. Lamirande, 62, worked for I.B.M., where he drew a salary of about $130,000. After a layoff seven years ago, he has earned about $70,000 a year as a technology consultant working on contract. 
 Since the spring, he and his wife have lived on her modest salary as a public school teacher and on hardship withdrawals from his retirement account. He has searched nationwide for his next contract, willing to relocate.
 ''I've got to go where the opportunities are,'' he said. ''The problem is, there aren't many opportunities.''
 The latest jobs report lent credence to that contention. The unemployment rate continued to inch toward double digits, a level last seen in June 1983. The so-called underemployment rate (which includes people whose hours have been cut, and those working part-time for lack of full-time positions, along with the jobless) reached 17 percent, the highest level since the government began tracking it in 1994.
 More jobs were lost last month, at 263,000, than were lost in August, as the Labor Department revised the August decline to 201,000 jobs from the 216,000 it initially reported.
 Health care remained a rare bright spot, adding 19,000 jobs in September, but construction jobs slipped by 64,000, manufacturing declined by 51,000 and retail lost 39,000 jobs. 
 Most economists assume the economy expanded at an annual pace of about three percent from July through September. But debate focuses on the vigor and staying power of the recovery.
 Optimists anticipate a robust bounce-back from what now stands as the longest recession since the Great Depression. But most economists expect a sustained slog through high rates of joblessness.
 The economic improvement in recent months largely stems from businesses cutting inventories at a slower pace. As some companies begin to rebuild stocks, the impact could wash through the economy for a few more months, adding jobs and moderating the overall decline. 
 Then the underlying weakness of the economy will probably reassert itself, say experts. After years of borrowing against homes and cashing in stock to spend in excess of their incomes, many Americans are tapped out. Austerity and saving have replaced spending and investment in many households, constraining the economy.
 As many Americans transition from living on home equity loans to sustaining themselves on paychecks, weekly pay continues to effectively shrink: Over the last year, average hourly earnings for rank-and-file workers -- some 80 percent of the labor force -- have increased by 2.5 percent. But average weekly earnings have expanded by only 0.7 percent, less than the increase in the cost of living, because employers have slashed working hours.
 In September, the average workweek edged down by one-tenth of an hour, to 33 hours.
 For those out of work, the job market looks harsher now than at any point in the recession. The number of people who have been jobless for more than six months increased in September by 450,000, reaching 5.4 million.
 ''We have a truly massive crisis of long-term unemployment,'' said Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project in a statement, adding that nearly 400,000 jobless people had exhausted their unemployment benefits by the end of September. ''Today's employment report is a marching order for Congress to pass unemployment benefit extensions to all states, quickly.''
 The first signs of improvement are likely to be seen among temporary workers, say experts, as companies now hunkering down in the face of uncertain prospects take tentative steps to expand.
 But temporary help services lost 1,700 jobs in September. 
 ''Companies are extremely cautious,'' said Roy G. Krause, chief executive of Spherion, a recruiting and staffing company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
 All of which translates into continued apprehension in many households.
 ''It's terrifying,'' said Stephanie Wheeler, 56, of Elizabeth, N.J., who has drained her savings to $800 in the year since she lost her job at a data-processing company, rendering her ability to pay the rent on her apartment uncertain. 
 ''I've been here for eight years,'' she said. ''I don't know what's going to happen. I'm petrified of being set out on the street.''

HEADLINE: Worries About a Recovery Push the Markets Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks posted modest losses Friday after a disappointing monthly jobs report renewed concerns that a recovery in the troubled labor market might be a long way off.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell for a fourth day, losing 22 points a day after tumbling 203 points on Thursday.
 The latest weak economic report came from the Labor Department, which said employers cut 263,000 jobs last month. That was more than the 201,000 cut in August and worse than the 175,000 economists were expecting. The unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent, in line with forecasts. 
 ''There's been a lot of talk particularly in the last couple of months that we're seeing a turnaround in unemployment, and obviously that's not the case,'' said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago.
 Meanwhile, an unexpected drop in factory orders extended the recent string of disappointing economic readings. The Commerce Department said factory orders fell 0.8 percent in August after a 1.4 percent gain in July. Analysts had been expecting a 0.7 percent increase.
 The market's optimism has been tested this week by several indicators that have either weakened or fallen short of expectations, a disappointment after several months of hopeful signs on crucial industries like housing and manufacturing. That has led investors to question whether the 50 percent surge in stocks in the last six months can be sustained.
 With nerves running high, stocks have fallen in seven of the last eight days. The Dow Jones industrials have pulled back about 4.3 percent since coming within 82 points of the 10,000 level last week.
 ''People have had a long, hard week,'' said Bruce Shalett, managing partner at Wynston Hill Capital in New York.
 Many found the relatively calm response to the jobs report encouraging, taking it as a sign that there were still investors willing to use the dips to pick up stocks they considered cheap.
 ''Pullbacks are going to constantly be used as opportunities to get into the market,'' said Hank Smith, chief investment officer of equity at Haverford Investments in Radnor, Pa.
 The Dow fell 21.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,487.67, after being down as much as 79 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,025.21, and the Nasdaq composite fell 9.37 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,048.11.
 For the week, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 index each lost 1.8 percent, while the Nasdaq fell 2 percent.
 Two stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.4 billion shares Friday compared with 1.6 billion Thursday.
 Stocks are coming off a banner third quarter. Both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 gained 15 percent in the July-September period. It was the Dow's best quarter since 1998.
 The fourth quarter may not be as stellar. Analysts expect the market to drift over the next couple of weeks as investors await quarterly earnings reports and company forecasts on business activity. The last meaningful pullback in the market since the rally began in March came during the four weeks leading up to second-quarter reports this summer, when the major indexes lost about 7 percent.
 ''October is shaping up to be a challenging month for investors,'' said Brent McQuiston, a vice president at WealthTrust-Arizona.
 Strong earnings could help offset growing concerns about a recovery and stabilize the market, he said, but solid revenue growth is what is needed to put the market on firm footing.
 In the meantime, the market will get reports on the service sector, retail sales and wholesale trade inventories next week.
 Yields on long-term Treasuries moved off their lowest levels since the spring. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 103 13/32, and the yield rose to 3.22 percent, from 3.18 percent late Thursday.
 Crude oil fell 87 cents to settle at $69.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Ready for an Olympic Party, Chicago Loses Its Date

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Talk about short parties. 
 As word arrived that Chicago had been eliminated from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in a first round of voting, stunned silence fell over thousands of residents who had gathered in a plaza in the heart of this city's Loop, for what nearly everyone here seemed certain was to be a victory party. Some people gasped, others gave frowns of astonishment, and then, still carrying their CHICAGO 2016 signs and wearing the orange Olympics T-shirts they had just been handed, people began to leave. 
 ''It's unbelievable,'' said Janie Carter, 55, staring up at a now empty stage in Daley Plaza, where Chicago bid leaders seemed not sure what to do next. ''Everything seemed so good for us, and everything seemed to be going our way. I don't know. But we can still hold our heads up. We're still here.'' 
 For some here, there was a sense this was more than a vote on whether the Summer Games should be played here in seven years, but something akin to a referendum on this city itself. Chicago has long had a complicated sense of itself. On the one hand, Chicagoans say they feel as if their city (the nation's third largest) needs no Olympics seal to know that it has (long ago) arrived. On the other, old ''Second City'' insecurities creep in from time to time, here in the country's middle, and people here had wanted to win.
 ''We'll be O.K.; we have the Cubs, remember,'' said Beth Nielsen, 49, as she began to walk away. ''We've been through things before.''
 The decision ended what had been a four-year campaign for the Games here, and one that had already cost millions. It also would be an enormous disappointment to Mayor Richard M. Daley (this plaza was named after his father, Richard J. Daley, the city's earlier mayor-for-life), who had been the games' chief fan and who, political scientists say, had come to view the games as his crowning achievement. Some suggested that this might affect his political future -- he has held his job for 20 years -- or at least his legacy.
 Mayor Daley had long contended that the Games would help jumpstart Chicago's economy, increase the city's international standing and trade, and help improve neighborhoods and parks on the city's west and south sides, not just its center. 
 Until the announcement of Chicago's loss spread here, the mood had been one of a victory party: Future and past Olympians offered upbeat assessments over an echoing loud speaker, an enormous television screen flashed with glowing images of the skyline, and ''My Kind of Town'' boomed from speakers. 
 ''We're going to win,'' Lucy Catanese, 53, said matter-of-factly, as she stood here waiting. ''We've never had the Olympics in the Midwest, and we're ready.''
 Even the Pablo Picasso sculpture in this plaza, a familiar sight here since 1967, appeared to be anticipating: The creature was decked out with an enormous medal around its neck.
 Other such parties were taking place in some area schools, restaurants and in a South Side park that sits a few blocks from President Obama's home here; if Chicago had won, the park would have become home to an Olympic stadium. Similar parties were planned even miles and miles from here -- in suburbs like Naperville and Aurora.
 Though one would hardly sense it from here amid so much disappointment, not everyone in this city was dying to have the Olympics. A month ago, a poll by The Chicago Tribune and WGN found that Chicagoans were nearly split on the question -- 45 percent opposed to getting the Olympics, 47 percent in favor. And Chicagoans, in the thick of a national recession and watching cuts to their city and state budgets, were overwhelmingly certain (by 84 percent, according to the poll) that public funds should not go to pay for any Olympics cost overruns. 
 Earlier this week, in interviews around Chicago, some seemed ambivalent about the Olympics prospects. ''We have more important issues here like the economic crisis,'' said Jennifer Omotola, 24, who lives in Oak Park, one of Chicago's nearest suburbs, and is unemployed. ''I really don't care,'' she said, of today's announcement. 
 Still, plenty of people, especially the city's top political and business leaders, had been eagerly fighting for Chicago's efforts, which the leaders say would have cost $4.8 billion -- to be raised from donations, ticket revenue, sponsorships and other non-taxpayer sources. They had said they expected the Olympics to pay for itself; yet the bid committee had secured a large insurance policy that would have, it said, prevented the city from having to live up to the blanket promise that officials made this summer to, ultimately, cover any overruns.
 ''This city is the perfect place to host these games,'' said Blaze Bociaga, 26, as he stood in the plaza watching, an hour before the city was eliminated. Mr. Bociaga, who left his suburban home at 6:30 a.m. to get here, confessed to having had a bad dream overnight -- that Rio had won -- but that, he said, was only his anxieties talking. 
 ''This is already an international city, and people need to know that,'' he said. ''I'm happy being the Second City. Second City? Second to who?''

HEADLINE: Last Call for an Elegant Rail Station

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany 

 BODY:
The clash between builders and preservationists is as old as architecture itself, but it reached a fever pitch in the recent gilded age. And it is especially fraught in Germany, where the construction boom that began with the country's reunification sometimes seems like a convenient tool for smoothing over unpleasant historical truths.
 Few current projects better illustrate this conflict than Stuttgart 21, a plan to build an enormous new railway station, along with 37 miles of underground track, in the heart of this old industrial city. The $7 billion development, which is expected to be approved by the end of the year, is part of an ever-expanding high-speed train network that planners hope will one day link the entire continent. As one of the largest developments in Europe, it could radically transform the city center.
 But the design shows a callous disregard for architectural history. Its construction would require the partial destruction of one of the city's most recognizable landmarks: the Hauptbahnhof, Paul Bonatz's Stuttgart central rail terminal, a monument of early German Modernism built from 1914 to 1928. 
 And in a particularly perverse gesture of ''facadism'' -- a favorite tactic of bureaucrats and developers in which a few architectural elements are preserved while the rest of a structure is bulldozed -- it would leave the station's main hall and tower standing like some architectural amputee.
 Even more troubling, Stuttgart 21 joins a growing list of misguided projects that are reducing Germany's 20th-century architectural history to a fairy tale version of the truth. 
 Bonatz's most celebrated works, like a system of streamlined locks and bridges built along the Rhine in the late 1920s, have a spare elegance reminiscent of the best examples of W.P.A. architecture in America. And even some of his Nazi-era work, like the 1936 Basel Art Museum, has an undeniably human dimension. Its stone facade, with its low classical arches, remains one of the city's beloved landmarks.
 But Bonatz is not an easy architect to love. The struggle to keep his practice afloat at the height of the Nazi era led him into endless compromises -- aesthetic and moral. His studies for a gargantuan round stadium and a Munich train station -- mercifully never built -- represented the kind of grotesquely overblown classicism that Hitler adored. At the same time, his criticism of the work of Paul Troost, one of Hitler's favorite architects, irritated the Gestapo. He eventually fled to Turkey.
 Bonatz, in other words, was the kind of morally ambiguous opportunist found throughout architectural history, someone who may have ignored uncomfortable political realities when it served his interests and who fine-tuned his aesthetic to suit the values of his clients. Yet he also produced works of undeniable beauty.
 Completed several years before Hitler took power, the Stuttgart terminal may be Bonatz's most masterly architectural balancing act. Its imposing front facade, marked by a shallow arcade and towering stone pillars, is as haunting as an early de Chirico painting. Framed by stone entry halls at either end, it has a severe, stripped-down Classicism that also suggests why Bonatz was able to continue building well into the Nazi era. The two monumental wings, which extend back to frame the tracks, only add to the terminal's imposing scale.
 Yet Bonatz carefully softened this effect by placing the clock tower at the station's southeast corner. The position of the tower, which once housed private waiting rooms for the king, helps to break down the design's symmetry and gives it a human dimension. Set slightly off center from the city's historic axis, it also demonstrates a genuine sensitivity to context, locking the design into a larger urban composition without interrupting the flow of traffic.
 Stylistically, the design embodies Bonatz's quest to find a balance between Classicism and Modernism. The first of the two wings, built from 1914 to 1917, is the most traditional and conservative, with spiraling wood staircases inside and elaborate ironwork grates over the first-floor windows. The great entry hall, built at the same time, had a traditional wood beam ceiling.
 By the mid-1920s, when Bonatz was designing the second entry hall, he was using brick vaults instead of timber. The final wing, designed a few years later, was the most streamlined, its windows forming staccato horizontal bands that suggest that the architect was moving toward a more Modern aesthetic.
 The entire composition can be read as an effort to come to terms with some of the period's deepest anxieties: the struggle to keep pace with jolting technological and social changes and the related fear of losing contact with the past.
 The new station, designed by Ingenhoven Architects, lacks similar ambitions. To construct it, the German rail authority plans to destroy everything but the terminal's main halls and tower. The platforms would be buried underground, with the tracks set parallel to the old entry hall. A vast plaza would sit on top of this lower level, its surface pierced by big, eye-shaped light wells. Four new entryways, with shell-shaped glass and concrete roofs, would lead down to the platforms from the plaza's corners.
 The plan's defenders argue that it is critical to the city's economic future. It will reaffirm Stuttgart's place as a hinge between Western and Eastern Europe, as well as speed up travel south, to Athens. What's more, demolishing the old tracks and burying the platforms underground will free acres of valuable real estate in the city center -- something that could generate billions of Euros in revenue for the rail authority.
 Finally, there is the belief that large-scale infrastructure projects are just what we need in tough times. We need jobs, don't we? And aren't the best parts of the old building being saved?
 What's scary about this approach is its familiarity. Engineers, stop watches in hand, calculate the most efficient time between two points. Politicians crunch numbers, estimating that the bigger the job, the bigger the rewards. Developers begin counting the profits to be made when large swaths of public land are turned over to private interests.
 Meanwhile, those who care about cities and their history are placated with the facadist dodge. And architecture is reduced to a picture postcard -- an empty, superficial veneer.
 In the case of Stuttgart, the nuances that breathe life into the design -- the sequence of spaces leading from the city to the tracks, the conflict between tradition and modernity, will be lost. The new entry halls, however elegantly conceived, are likely to make the old hall seem like an appendage, stripping it of the function that gave it meaning.
 There were other possible options. A proposal by the architect Roland Ostertag that would have replaced the existing train shed with a barrel-shaped glass roof would have been far more elegant and economical. Moving part of the tracks underground could have been part of that scheme too. And the difference in travel time would probably have been minimal. Many opponents of the plan assert that the new design would shave just a few minutes of travel time between Stuttgart and Ulm, the next stop on the line. Replacing the tracks that run between the two cities would save much more time. When I spoke to the station's architect, he did not dispute this claim.
 But this option was never fully explored, lest it give ammunition to the project's opponents.
 The insistence on putting economics above culture has already led to the destruction of major historic monuments like the Palace of the Republic in Berlin, a landmark of the East German period. It may soon lead to the dismemberment of Tempelhof Airport, one of the few great architectural accomplishments of the early Nazi period. If it continues, it will lead to a cheapened, oversimplified view of history, one that suppresses the conflicts and contradictions that make cities vital.

HEADLINE: Cracks In The Future

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 While the U.S. has struggled with enormous problems over the past several years, there has been at least one consistent bright spot. Its system of higher education has remained the finest in the world.
 Now there are ominous cracks appearing in that cornerstone of American civilization. Exhibit A is the University of California, Berkeley, the finest public university in the world and undoubtedly one of the two or three best universities in the United States, public or private.
 More of Berkeley's undergraduates go on to get Ph.D.'s than those at any other university in the country. The school is among the nation's leaders in producing winners of the Nobel Prize. An extraordinary amount of cutting-edge research in a wide variety of critically important fields, including energy and the biological sciences, is taking place here. 
 While I was roaming the campus, talking to students, professors and administrators, word came that scientists had put together a full analysis and a fairly complete fossilized skeleton of Ardi, who is known to her closest living associates as Ardipithecus ramidus. At 4.4 million years of age, this four-foot tall, tree-climbing wonder is now the oldest known human ancestor.
 Give Berkeley credit. The school's Tim White, a paleoanthropologist, led the international team that worked for years on this project, an invaluable advance in human knowledge and understanding.
 So it's dismaying to realize that the grandeur of Berkeley (and the remarkable success of the University of California system, of which Berkeley is the flagship) is being jeopardized by shortsighted politicians and California's colossally dysfunctional budget processes.
 Berkeley is caught in a full-blown budget crisis with nothing much in the way of upside in sight. The school is trying to cope with what the chancellor, Robert Birgeneau, described as a ''severe and rapid loss in funding'' from the state, which has shortchanged Berkeley's budget nearly $150 million this year, and cut more than $800 million from the higher education system as a whole.
 This is like waving goodbye to the futures of untold numbers of students. Chancellor Birgeneau denounced the state's action as ''a completely irresponsible disinvestment in the future of its public universities.'' 
 (The chancellor was being kind. Anyone who has spent more than 10 minutes watching the chaos of California politicians trying to deal with fiscal and budgetary matters would consider ''completely irresponsible'' to be the mildest of possible characterizations.)
 Berkeley is laying off staffers, reducing faculty through attrition and cutting pay. Student fees will no doubt have to be raised, and the fear is that if the financial crisis continues unabated it will be difficult to retain and recruit the world-class scholars who do so much to make the school so special.
 Chancellor Birgeneau said he is optimistic that Berkeley will be able to maintain its greatness and continue to thrive, but he told me candidly in an interview, ''It's hard to see when we are going to get back to a situation where we can start rewarding people properly.''
 We should all care about this because Berkeley is an enormous and enormously unique national asset. As a public university it offers large numbers of outstanding students from economically difficult backgrounds the same exceptionally high-quality education that is available at the finest private universities.
 Something wonderful is going on when a school that is ranked among those at the very top in the nation and the world is also a school in which more than a third of the 25,000 undergraduates qualify for federal Pell grants, which means their family incomes are less than $45,000 a year. More than 4,000 students at Berkeley are from families where the annual income is $20,000 or less.
 More than a third are the first in their families to attend a four-year college.
 Berkeley is aggressively pursuing alternative funding sources. The danger is that as public support for the school declines, it will lose more and more of its public character. Substantially higher fees for incoming students would be the norm, and more and more students from out of state and out of the country (who can afford to pay the full freight of their education) would be recruited.
 This would most likely hurt students from middle-class families more than poorer ones. Those kids are caught between the less well-off, who are helped by a variety of financial aid programs, and the wealthy students, whose families have no problem paying for a first-class college education.
 The problems at Berkeley are particularly acute because of the state's drastic reduction of support. But colleges and universities across the country -- public and private -- are struggling because of the prolonged economic crisis and the pressure on state budgets. It will say a great deal about what kind of nation we've become if we let these most valuable assets slip into a period of decline.

HEADLINE: Boom Times at Francis Lewis High

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''To Get to This Thriving School, Follow the Crowd'' (front page, Sept. 29):
 I graduated from Francis Lewis High School in Queens in 1964, part of the school's second graduating class. Francis Lewis was overcrowded from the day it opened. During my tenure, we were on triple session.
 I had 43 students in my homeroom class. There was no playing field and no track at that time. For gym class, we ran in the hallways or under the Long Island Expressway. 
 Despite these physical conditions, I received a terrific education. This was because I had terrific, dedicated teachers. Great teachers, not lavish physical facilities, are what make a great education possible.
 I can see that the physical conditions at Francis Lewis have not changed much in 45 years. I hope that there are still great teachers there as well.
 Paul L. Joskow
 New York, Sept. 29, 2009
 The writer is president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and on leave from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a professor of economics. 
 To the Editor:
 Francis Lewis High School, where I teach, is severely overcrowded. We have classes in trailers that flood in the rain and split rooms with paper-thin walls, no windows and bowling alley shapes.
 Gym classes meet in the hallways. Tutoring often takes place on the dirty floor in any available hallway. Last semester I tried to run tutoring sessions before the Regents exam, but could not do so because no rooms were available.
 Our building is open and running almost 12 hours a day. Because of the many different schedules, it is hard for students to enjoy afterschool clubs and sports activities.
 Safety is also a major concern. There are so many people in the hallways during the change of periods that passing is dangerous. Just one little push would send a whole group flying down a staircase. I shudder to think what would happen should a real emergency arise.
 We are a good school, but we will not stay this way if our population keeps growing at this rate.
 Something must be done about it now.

 To the Editor:
 I graduated from Francis Lewis High School in 2006 with a great education, but having to deal with the number of students was utterly miserable.
 Classes that start at 7 a.m.? Classes that end after 5? Lunch for breakfast? This is conducive to learning? 
 Sometimes we were stuck in an oblong half-room with no air-conditioning in the warm months or in an outdoor trailer with no heat in the winter. 
 Walking through the hallways when the bulk of the students were in attendance was nerve-racking (and a fire hazard), especially if the sheer volume of people in the hallway made you late to class. No child left behind?
 David Gordon
 Whitestone, Queens, Sept. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I was an assistant principal at Francis Lewis High School for 24 years, so I read with great pride about how parents want to send their students to this excellent school, causing it to be severely overcrowded. 
 During my tenure, Lewis was also in great demand as it had a very strong academic program. But never was the demand as great as it is now. Clearly, this is a school with strong leadership and a wonderful teaching staff that is deeply concerned about the students' academic progress. 
 Kudos to the staff and Lewis for maintaining the school's legacy of excellence. And for those who claim that large schools don't work, take a good hard look at one of the largest and best schools in the city. Norm Sherman

HEADLINE: All the Books You'll Never Catch on a Kindle

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
If you harbor even a speck of doubt about the continuing viability of hold-in-your-hand-and-turn-the-pages print publications, check out the New York Art Book Fair this weekend. You'll find thousands of new books -- smart, weird, engrossing, beautiful -- that will never be Kindle-compatible. They'll make you feel good.
 The fair, produced by Printed Matter, a venerable local purveyor and producer of books by artists, began in Chelsea in 2006 but this year is at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens. The move meant giving up ready foot traffic for a big gain in floor space. Whether the trade will pay off remains to be seen, but for certain the fair, once a modest event and now quite a grand one, looks great.
 More than 200 exhibitors -- booksellers, independent publishers, artists, antiquarian dealers -- fill three floors of P.S. 1's cavernous premises with plenty of breathing room: some of the displays look like full-fledged gallery shows. The recession has scared off a few big trade publishers, but they've been more than adequately replaced by 60 newcomers from Japan, South Korea, Mexico and elsewhere, many of them low on cash but high on risk tolerance. 
 Not that there aren't established names. Aperture, Powerhouse Books and Princeton Architectural Press are on hand, as are European museum presses (Witte de With from Rotterdam; Musac from Leon, Spain). Rare-book dealers like Anartist, Carolina Nitsch and John McWhinnie are back in force. You can spot them a mile away: their banks of bookcases convey the woody, lived-in air of personal libraries. 
 Mr. McWhinnie is doing double duty this year as dealer and curator, having organized the 30-year survey of books and posters by Richard Prince. Immaculately installed, it makes a suave, MoMA-ish introduction to P.S. 1's largest first-floor gallery. But Mr. Prince, who is on the fair's board of advisers, is not exactly news, and what makes this fair enticing is the chance it affords to see things seldom encountered elsewhere.
 The main sources for such material are two related sections of the fair: one is Friendly Fire; the other, new this year, is Flaming Creatures. Both are devoted to young artists, collectives, shoestring galleries and other seriously indie enterprises. 
 In Friendly Fire the artist-dealer Edie Fake, for example, is selling radically cheap-looking books by solid-gold writers. Red 76, an Oregon collective, has, among other things, a freshly harvested stock of found and distressed paperbacks. This year Darin S. Klein and Friends is hawking books by the box, though very small books in very small boxes. 
 For collectors of gay material , there are several specialists to consult, most of them clustered in Flaming Creatures. The zine editor Billy Miller and the designer Jan Wandrag handle the queer classic ''Straight to Hell'' and a new zine called ''No Milk Today.'' Goteblud of San Francisco is a central supplier for all manner of vintage zines -- rave zines, punk zines, low-rider zines, bike-messenger zines -- along with Wuvable Oaf comics and customized skateboards. 
 And in the fringe areas, one-man bands get a chance to shine. Charles Clough, whose paintings from the 1980s recently appeared in ''The Pictures Generation'' at the Metropolitan Museum, has a table by himself in Friendly Fire at which he introduces new work in the form of a multimedia package. It includes an abstract painting, a facsimile print of the painting, a book of images of the picture in progress and a movie made from those images. 
 His project is so much more interesting than most of the painting on the walls in Chelsea that I can't think why someone doesn't give him a show. 
 In certain sectors of the publishing industry, multimedia is now considered to be crucial to the survival of books; the fair tests the waters with a decent helping of videos. Electronic Arts Intermix has continuous screening of artists' tapes in the P.S. 1 basement. And two veterans of alternative media, Deep Dish TV Network and Paper Tiger Television, are showing old and new documentaries in a shared first-floor space. Want a replay of recent protests against globalism in Pittsburgh? Step right this way. And while you're at it, grab a Paper Tiger sales catalog. It's a cool read. 
 For a respite from the communal hubbub, you might try a row of single-occupancy spaces on P.S. 1's second floor, though I found them a bit jumpy. In one, Gallery 360degrees from Tokyo is showing a live-wire selection of Japanese psychedelia. Next door, Peres Projects of Berlin and Los Angeles has stills from an agit-porn film by Bruce LaBruce; boxed sets of its magazine, Daddy; and loud music.
 Werkplaats Typografie, a graphic design school from the Netherlands, also has a room of its own, and needs one, as a bunch of its students are in residence and churning out product on the spot. Equally busy are the seven artist-workers in J. Morrison's ''Manpurse IV: Assembly Line'' project -- Scott Hug, Dave Ortega, Michael Magnan, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, Slava Mogutin, Dave Ulrich and Grant Worth -- who slave over silk-screening tote bags to which each adds a personal touch. 
 The fair, founded by A. A. Bronson, once part of the three-member group General Idea, is all about collaboration. A youngish New York collective called Dexter Sinister -- David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey, a Werkplaats grad -- is exhibiting its own journal and books but is also participating in The Classroom, a program of talks and performances. Its ''faculty'' is made up of fair exhibitors. To enroll, you just show up.
 You can do the same for the Contemporary Artists' Book Conference that will be in session all weekend on P.S. 1's third floor. Put together by Printed Matter and the Art Libraries Society of New York, it has an ambitious series of thematic panels. One addresses the role of digital technology in the future of cheap-to-free print publications. Another will debate whether the collecting of zines by libraries and museums contradicts, even cancels out, the basically anti-establishment zine concept. 
 And on Saturday at 4 p.m. you can catch a panel with the two-part title ''Is Print Really Dead? Artists (Still) Making Books.'' The first part is a question you may well bring to the fair. The second part is the answer you'll find there. 
 The New York Art Book Fair 2009 runs through Sunday at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; nyartbookfair.com, (718) 786-7608.

HEADLINE: Focus on Rangel, a Chairman Under Investigation

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York is increasingly in the spotlight these days and not just because he is in the thick of the health care debate as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
 Just as the health care fight heads to the floors of the House and Senate, Republicans are intensifying efforts to make Mr. Rangel a symbol of Democratic misconduct and institutional arrogance because of his belated disclosure of personal assets and other financial missteps.
 Despite some unease, Democrats say they are willing to stand by Mr. Rangel and will resist efforts to topple him from his chairmanship pending the anxiously awaited outcome of an ethics investigation that Mr. Rangel himself requested last year. 
 ''My feeling, and I think it is widely shared, is that the process should be allowed to be completed,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a longtime Democratic colleague of Mr. Rangel on the Ways and Means Committee.
 Other factors are also at work in the decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and fellow Democratic leaders to allow Mr. Rangel, the fourth-most-senior member of the House and one of the nation's best-known African-American politicians, to remain in his high-profile post for now.
 Plenty of Democrats are uncomfortable with the notion of Mr. Rangel's being replaced in the middle of the health care fight by the lawmaker next in line, Representative Pete Stark, a very liberal Californian with a sharp tongue and an occasionally abrasive manner. Trying to leapfrog Mr. Stark and devise an alternative line of succession could touch off a bitter intramural fight at a highly inconvenient moment.
 In addition, the leadership is wary of alienating the 42-member Congressional Black Caucus. Many of those votes will be needed to push through health care legislation.
 Some black caucus members were angry when Ms. Pelosi forced former Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana off the Ways and Means Committee before he was formally charged in a corruption case that ultimately landed him in jail. Any move to sideline Mr. Rangel, a founding member of the caucus, before a finding against him could spark serious resentment. 
 Mr. Rangel also has a reservoir of good will among his colleagues that is helping him fend off the Republicans.
 ''I have not heard anyone in the caucus against him,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. ''Mr. Rangel is a legend, and I think that people believe that the ethics folks will do their job, and all of us are hoping for the best.''
 But Republicans are not making it easy for Democrats.
 Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas and a former judge, said he intended to force a vote next week on a resolution requiring Mr. Rangel to step aside from the helm of the Ways and Means Committee at least until the internal investigation is finished. A similar effort by Mr. Carter was tabled on a party line vote in February, and the same result is expected this time.
 But Mr. Carter said new revelations in August that Mr. Rangel had not disclosed an additional $500,000 or more in assets required some action on the part of the House, particularly after multiple tax and financial lapses were uncovered in 2008.
 ''It all boils down to this, the public perceives -- and rightfully so -- that Mr. Rangel's indiscretions are being overlooked, and they know that theirs would not have been,'' said Mr. Carter, who said he hoped the resolution would prompt the ethics committee to finish an investigation that many think was taking too long.
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, also urged action if Mr. Rangel refused to step aside voluntarily. ''It's improper for Chairman Rangel to remain in his position with all of the influence that he has while the serious allegations remain hanging,'' Mr. Boehner said.
 Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to score political points. ''This is nothing more than a partisan stunt to distract from the G.O.P.'s lack of ideas to improve America's health care system and help our economy recover,'' Elbert Garcia, a spokesman for Mr. Rangel, said in a statement.
 Republicans do see political opportunity with the ethics troubles of Mr. Rangel, as well as investigations into whether senior Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee improperly steered projects to allies and campaign contributors. 
 They would love to serenade Democrats with the ''culture of corruption'' refrain that Democrats so successfully employed against Republicans in gaining control of the House in 2006. But Republican efforts are being diluted by misconduct in their own ranks, including the case of Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who is drawing renewed scrutiny for his efforts to cover up an affair with the wife of one of his former top aides.
 At this point, Democrats say they are not overly concerned. They believe the fact that an ethics review is under way insulates them from suggestions that they are protecting Mr. Rangel. The hard decision for Democrats might come after the ethics findings. The panel could recommend that Mr. Rangel be ousted from his chairmanship. If a censure were recommended and approved by the House, he would automatically lose his chairmanship under Democratic rules.
 But if the ethics committee delivers a mild or moderate rebuke, Democrats might have to assess, with an eye to difficult midterm elections, whether they can take the heat of having the tax panel headed by a lawmaker who erred on his own finances and taxes.

HEADLINE: 4 Madoffs Being Sued For Millions

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
For months, the luxurious life once enjoyed by Bernard L. Madoff's family was a bitter pill for the thousands of victims who lost their own wealth and comforts in his long-running Ponzi scheme.
 Now, the business dealings that paid for that luxury -- the beautiful homes, the well-tended boats, the first-class travel, the shopping -- have come under a blistering attack from Irving H. Picard, the court-appointed trustee seeking to recover assets for the victims.
 On Friday, Mr. Picard sued four members of the Madoff family for almost $200 million they received over the years, asserting that the money represented excessive paychecks, improper use of company cash and fabricated investment profits that should have alerted them to the underlying fraud. 
 The action, filed two months after a similar suit against Mr. Madoff's wife, Ruth, named his younger brother, Peter; his two sons, Mark and Andrew; and his niece, Shana.
 All four served for many years as senior executives at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, which was wholly owned by Bernard Madoff. Peter Madoff and his daughter Shana, both lawyers, were chief compliance officer and compliance director, respectively. Mark and Andrew Madoff were co-directors of trading.
 The complaint, filed in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, does not accuse these family members of actively participating in the Ponzi scheme -- lawyers for all four have repeatedly said their clients had no inkling about the fraud until Mr. Madoff confessed to his sons in December, prompting them to turn him in to federal authorities.
 Rather, the trustee's complaint says the relatives -- all licensed professionals in the securities industry -- were ''completely derelict'' in carrying out their executive duties.
 ''As a result, they either failed to detect or failed to stop the fraud,'' the trustee asserted. ''Simply put, if the family members had been doing their jobs -- honestly and faithfully -- the Madoff Ponzi scheme might never have succeeded, or continued for so long.''
 John R. Wing, a lawyer for Peter Madoff, did not respond to requests for comment.
 Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for the Madoff sons, noted that his clients had actually halted the fraud by quickly turning their father in, and had continued to cooperate fully with the investigation. The two men have ''suffered substantial economic losses as a result of their father's crimes,'' he continued, ''and we believe it is legally appropriate that these losses be taken into account.'' 
 Eric Starkman, a spokesman for Shana D. Madoff, said that Ms. Madoff ''intends to cooperate with the trustee and hopes that they can reach a satisfactory resolution.''
 Mr. Picard's earlier lawsuit against Ruth Madoff seeks almost $45 million that he claims she received from the firm improperly. There, too, he made no accusations of criminal behavior, and Mrs. Madoff's lawyers have denied that she knew anything about the long-running fraud.
 In his latest complaint, Mr. Picard details the paychecks and perquisites the four family members received over the years, claiming that the firm ''operated as if it were the family piggy bank.'' The complaint asserted that money from the firm financed family homes, cars, boats, travel, clothing, cosmetics and personal business ventures, including a hair salon and a sporting supply shop.
 The money that Mark Madoff got from the firm ''paid for all aspects of his lavish lifestyle, from the purchases of his high-end homes to the mattress and box spring he slept on, the television he watched in his home gym, and the outdoor shower in his home,'' the trustee asserted.
 All the defendants had investment accounts with Mr. Madoff and saw their reported balances wiped out when the scheme collapsed. But the complaint claims they drew out far more than they invested and profited enormously from the firm's fraudulent operations.
 Under federal and New York State bankruptcy law, the trustee can sue to retrieve money a firm paid out within six years of bankruptcy, or longer if he can prove some degree of responsibility. In this case, he is seeking a total of $198.7 million -- $141 million paid in the last six years and $57.7 million paid earlier.
 When he pleaded guilty in March, Mr. Madoff acknowledged pumping millions from customer accounts into his brokerage business by laundering it through a London affiliate. Now, the trustee reports that the Madoff firm would have been in the red for the last two years without stolen cash disguised as ''commissions.''
 These transfers amounted to approximately $103 million in 2007, or about 60 percent of the firm's revenue, and roughly $86 million in 2008, or 70 percent of revenue -- sums so significant that the defendants ''knew or should have known'' the origins of the money, the trustee said.
 The complaint details several fabricated trades in accounts maintained by Peter, Mark and Andrew -- accounts that the trustee said had never received a penny from the defendants but still reported millions in profits from nonexistent trades in shares of Microsoft, Dell and Lucent Technologies.
 The trustee is seeking more than $60 million from Peter, including more than $16 million in profits from such spurious trades; $66.9 million from Mark, including almost $30 million in compensation since 2001; and about $60.6 million from Andrew, including $31 million in salary and bonus.
 Mr. Picard also is trying to recover about $10.6 million that Shana Madoff received since 2000, including more than $6 million of what he called ''fraudulently diverted funds.''

HEADLINE: President Of Toyota Apologizes

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Tokyo, and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
 Even by Japanese standards -- where chief executives routinely make public apologies if their company is in crisis -- Akio Toyoda's comments on Friday were surprising.
 A little more than three months after assuming his post, the president of Toyota, the world's biggest automaker, recited a long list of mea culpas to astonished reporters at the Japan National Press Club. 
 He expressed grief over a fatal crash that led to a recall of 3.8 million cars, regrets about an expected second consecutive annual loss and sorrow over the decision to close the company's first American factory in California. 
 Further, Mr. Toyoda said his company was shamefully unprepared for the global economic crisis that has devastated the auto industry, and is a step away from ''capitulation to irrelevance or death.'' The company, he added, is ''grasping for salvation.''
 The words reinforced previous statements from top Toyota executives expressing their concerns that the automaker, which earned $18.8 billion only two years ago, was floundering.
 ''In the Japanese business setting, it's a serious act,'' said Ulrike Schaede, a professor of Japanese business at the University of California, San Diego.
 Professor Schaede said that the apologies were meant to send a message to company employees and car buyers that Mr. Toyoda planned a new direction for the company.
 ''If you're Mr. Toyoda and you're coming in at this point, you don't have many options of how you make a big impact,'' she said.
 Toyota expects a record loss of 450 billion yen ($5 billion) for the 2009 fiscal year that will end in March, on top of a similar loss for 2008. If the market does not improve, some analysts are forecasting the company could again lose money in 2010. 
 While it still has plenty of cash, and now outranks General Motors as the world's biggest carmaker, that is not good enough, Mr. Toyoda told journalists. 
 The company, hit by a spate of recalls in the middle of the decade, is betraying its roots as a quality automaker, he said.
 Last week, Toyota announced its biggest recall ever in the United States after a crash in August in which a California highway patrol officer and three family members were killed. 
 The accident, which Mr. Toyoda called ''extremely regrettable,'' apparently occurred when the accelerator got jammed by a floor mat. 
 ''Four precious lives have been lost. I offer my deepest condolences,'' Mr. Toyoda said. ''Customers bought our cars because they thought they were the safest. But now we have given them cause for grave concern. I can't begin to express my remorse.''
 And Mr. Toyoda did not stop there.
 It was ''agonizing'' to decide to cease production at a California plant this year, after G.M., its partner in the joint venture, decided to pull out. Mr. Toyoda, who worked at the plant in the 1990s, added, ''I know it's a big blow to the local economy.'' The Japanese people were also owed an apology, he said, because Toyota was no longer producing cars that excited them. Auto sales have fallen in recent years, partly because of a growing disinterest in cars among younger Japanese buyers.
 ''They say that young people are moving away from cars,'' he said. ''But surely it is us -- the automakers -- who have abandoned our passion for cars.''
 The appointment of Mr. Toyoda, who took over as president of Toyota in June, was seen as an attempt by Toyota to get back to basics, after a period of what some have called recklessly fast expansion overseas, and into bigger vehicles like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. 
 Toyota has doubled in size since the beginning of the decade, but its rapid manufacturing expansion has left it with too much production capacity, including a yet-to-open plant near Tupelo, Miss.
 ''Things haven't gone like they've planned and they're wrestling with two issues -- overinvesting and the exchange rate shift,'' said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 Mr. Toyoda, who spoke in August at the center's annual conference outside Traverse City, Mich., has previously talked about the company in a more visionary and less remorseful way.
 Indeed, his shift in tone may need to be taken with a grain of salt. 
 ''Sometimes, this apology business is a way to avoid taking real action or responsibility,'' said Robert Dujarric, director of the Institute of Contemporary Japanese Studies at Temple University's Japan campus.
 ''When you hear these long apologies,'' Mr. Dujarric said, ''It makes you want to say: 'Don't be sorry, just do something about it.' '' 
 Toyota already has tangled with some environmental groups, long its allies, who thought that the company should have lobbied harder this decade for higher fuel economy standards and stayed away from developing big pickup trucks.
 Professor Schaede said that Toyota might run the same risk to its reputation that Wal-Mart experienced over its global business practices. Already, Toyota's image has shifted among some buyers from positive to ambivalent, she said.
 ''There is this new bifurcation of Toyota lovers and Toyota haters,'' Professor Schaede said. 
 In an earlier time, the smaller Toyota would not have received as much attention, nor would its president have faced the need to so publicly address its problems. 
 But, said Mr. Cole, ''They're entering the modern world where they have to adjust to forces that are much, much more difficult to deal with.''

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe: Farmers To Get More Seed

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
About 680,000 farmers working small plots of land will get high-quality seed and fertilizer this year from international donors. That is about double the number of farmers helped last year. The aid, from the United States, Australia, European nations and the World Bank, among others, is valued at $74 million. The hope is that the seed and fertilizer will enable Zimbabwe to produce more grain and to feed more of its hungry millions, reducing its heavy reliance on costly food aid.

HEADLINE: Too Rich to Worry? Not in This Downturn

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
IT turns out the other half -- or at least the tiny slice who live at the top of the wealth pyramid -- are not sleeping any better than the rest of America. 
 At a closed-door meeting of advisers to family offices -- which serve families who typically are worth more than $500 million -- I learned that the super-rich are just as concerned about the future as everyone else. 
 Even though the stock market has rebounded from its March 9 low, the family office advisers said many of their wealthiest clients were bracing for more bad news and wondering how it would affect their family unity. 
 ''They are now looking at financial planning and things middle-class families live by,'' Kathryn McCarthy, a leading adviser to wealthy families, including the Rockefellers, said at the gathering this week convened by Bessemer Trust. 
 Before you start laughing up your sleeve, be advised that this is not a good thing. When the super-rich get cold feet, the rest of America gets swine flu. They are, after all, the people who might finance new companies that create jobs, make big investments to support existing companies and spread their wealth throughout the economy.
 According to a study the Family Office Exchange plans to release this month, the super-rich are most worried about what they do not know. Some 45 percent of the 108 ultrahigh-net-worth families surveyed in August ranked the economy and financial markets as their No. 1 concern. They were most concerned about government intervention in the financial markets and a commercial real estate bust.
 Historically, the super-rich have focused mostly on family dynamics, since so much of their wealth is linked together and could be endangered by a rift. But the sudden decline in wealth -- even if they still have hundreds of millions of dollars -- has prompted soul-searching. The bad news is they are not confident about the American economy. The better news is they are looking at their families in a way that the average American could learn from. 
 MORE THAN MONEY What is most interesting is that many of the super-rich are looking at the risks of their relatives. 
 One of the big problems is how differently people within a family spend, save and invest money that has been managed as a pool for many generations. When the credit markets froze and the stock market tumbled, not every cousin agreed to tighten his alligator-skin belt. That caused friction. 
 Some family members with money in individual trusts are opting to go off on their own. The bigger issue is when families have to cooperate to run the business the patriarch set up. 
 In the past, family businesses and family wealth were commingled. If the business was struggling, the patriarch would often finance shortfalls. ''Now the kids are upset about where the money is going,'' said Holly Isdale, managing director at Bessemer. ''Intrafamily dynamics are playing a bigger part in decisions.''
 If the family put in place a strict estate plan, the children may legally own a good portion of what the patriarch made. And now they have choices to make that may go against his wishes. ''These families have recognized that autopilot is not a good strategy,'' said Amelia Renkert-Thomas, a lawyer with Withers Bergman.
 The other risk to super-rich families is government action and increased regulation. They suspect it is coming but do not know how it will affect them. The result is that they are increasingly anxious about the future while still shell-shocked from the past year. 
 ''We are telling them not to make changes for the sake of making changes,'' said Theodore Beringer, managing director of the Beringer Group, a family office adviser. ''First, they need to find out what needs to be changed.''
 RETURN TO BASICS Figuring out what they need to do differently has prompted many super-rich families to ponder the same question as the rest of us: How did the boom years change us?
 The basic issue for them is deciding what they want to do as a family now that they realize they cannot do everything. ''You're worth $500 million one day and wake up the next and it's $350 million and you've pledged $100 million to the Met,'' said Rob Elliott, senior managing director at Bessemer. ''What are the family's goals? Is it philanthropy or bringing along the next generation?'' 
 Coming up with an answer has been complicated by second-guessing: should they, or could they, have done something differently? ''They're human -- they sell too soon and they buy too high,'' Mr. Beringer said. ''It used to be, 'I'm going to buy A and B.' Now it's, 'I'll buy A or B.'''
 The bigger choice is what they do as a family when members are against both A and B. If that is left unresolved, tensions can fester.
 NO MORE EASY MONEY One reason for the subprime mortgage collapse was that banks gave mortgages to homebuyers without verifying their ability to repay. The super-rich had their own version of this: the signature loan. 
 In this case, a person's net worth would be verified but not, say, the value of the building she was buying. The feeling was if someone was worth $1 billion, she would have no problem paying back a loan for a $100 million office tower. 
 This gave the super-rich access to quick financing, for both hard assets like real estate and assets like securities. ''There's a realization that we can't borrow any more to goose our returns,'' Ms. McCarthy said. 
 Now banks want loans secured by a verifiable asset, and the super-rich are not borrowing as much. This has translated into a more conservative approach over all. 
 One thing the group convened by Bessemer agreed on is that their clients were hesitant to buy commercial real estate. They fear that the value of it could collapse with greater ferocity than the housing market. 
 The logic behind this is that with everyone cutting back -- companies laying off workers, consumers watching what they buy -- there is less demand for office and retail space. If leases expire and are not renewed, building owners will have trouble making their loan payments. That, in turn, will affect the investors who bought the bonds secured by this debt. 
 Even those real estate owners who are doing well could be hurt. ''A lot of this debt is short term and it needs to be refinanced, but there is no market for that,'' Ms. Isdale said. Next year and 2011 are expected to be the worst, Ms. McCarthy said.
 So while the super-rich bought properties on the cheap in previous real estate downturns, they now may be struggling with the financing on the ones they own and wary to add more, even at discount prices.
 Instead, super-rich families are focused on having cash on hand. One of the other uses of signature loans had been to pay for a lifestyle. Until a few years ago, many banks advised wealthy families to have 100 percent of their wealth invested to take advantage of the high returns across asset classes. If they needed cash, they could borrow at a low rate. It was easy, until it was not. 
 ''They've realized they can't have everything,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ''Now they're asking, Is it worth it? That's a question everyone should be asking.''

HEADLINE: Report Cites Bloody Firefight As Lesson in Afghan Warfare

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The paratroopers of Chosen Company had plenty to worry about as they began digging in at their new outpost on the fringe of a hostile frontier village in eastern Afghanistan. 
 Intelligence reports were warning of militants massing in the area. As the paratroopers looked around, the only villagers they could see were men of fighting age idling in the bazaar. There were no women and children, and some houses looked abandoned. Through their night scopes they could see furtive figures on the surrounding mountainsides.
 A few days later, they were almost overrun by 200 insurgents. 
 That firefight, a debacle that cost nine American lives in July 2008, has become the new template for how not to win in Afghanistan. The calamity and its roots have been described in bitter, painstaking detail in an unreleased Army history, a devastating narrative that has begun to circulate in an initial form even as the military opened a formal review this week of decisions made up and down the chain of command. 
 The 248-page draft history, obtained by The New York Times, helps explain why the new commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, is pressing so hard for a full-fledged commitment to a style of counterinsurgency that rests on winning over the people of Afghanistan even more than killing militants. The military has already incorporated lessons from the battle in the new doctrine for war in Afghanistan.
 The history offers stark examples of shortcomings in the unit's preparation, the style of combat it adopted, its access to intelligence, its disdain for the locals -- in short, plenty of blame to go around. 
 Before the soldiers arrived, commanders negotiated for months with Afghan officials of dubious loyalty over where they could dig in, giving militants plenty of time to prepare for an assault. 
 Despite the suspicion that the militants were nearby, there were not enough surveillance aircraft over the lonely outpost -- a chronic shortage in Afghanistan that frustrated Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates at the time. Commanders may have been distracted from the risky operation by the bureaucratic complexities of handing over responsibility at the brigade level to replacements -- and by their urgent investigation of an episode that had enraged the local population, the killing a week earlier in an airstrike of a local medical clinic's staff as it fled nearby fighting in two pickup trucks.
 Above all, the unit and its commanders had an increasingly tense and untrusting relationship with the Afghan people.
 The history cited the ''absence of cultural awareness and understanding of the specific tribal and governance situation'' and the emphasis on combat operations over the development of the local economy and other civil affairs, a reversal of the practices of the unit that had just left the area.
 The battle of Wanat is being described as the ''Black Hawk Down'' of Afghanistan, with the 48 American soldiers and 24 Afghan soldiers outnumbered three to one in a four-hour firefight that left nine Americans dead and 27 wounded in one of the bloodiest days of the eight-year war. 
 Soldiers who survived the battle described how their automatic weapons turned white hot and jammed from nonstop firing. Mortally wounded troops continued to hand bullet belts to those still able to fire. 
 The ammunition stockpile was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, igniting a stack of 120-millimeter mortar rounds -- and the resulting fireball flung the unit's antitank missiles into the command post. One insurgent got inside the concertina wire and is believed to have killed three soldiers at close range, including the platoon commander, Lt. Jonathan P. Brostrom.
 The description of the battle at Wanat -- the heroism, the violence and the missteps that may have contributed to the deaths -- ends with a judgment that the fight was ''as remarkable as any small-unit action in American military history.''
 The author, the military historian Douglas R. Cubbison, also included a series of criticisms in his review, sponsored by the Army's Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., that laid blame on a series of decisions made before the battle. 
 The draft report criticized the ''lack of adequate preparation time'' before arriving in Afghanistan, which meant there was little training geared specifically for Afghanistan, and not even a detailed operational plan for the year of combat that lay ahead.
 Pentagon and military officials say those initial criticisms are being revised to reflect subsequent interviews with other soldiers and officers who were at Wanat or who served in higher-level command positions. After a round of revisions, the study will go through a formal peer-review process and be published. 
 The battle stands as proof that the United States is facing off against a far more sophisticated adversary in Afghanistan today, one that can fight anonymously with roadside bombs or stealthily with kidnappings -- but also can operate like a disciplined armed force using well-rehearsed small-unit tactics to challenge the American military for dominance on the conventional battlefield.
 Official judgment on whether errors were made by the unit on the ground or by any leaders up the chain of command will be determined by a new investigation opened this week by Gen. David H. Petraeus of United States Central Command at the urging of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
 The call for such an independent review came from family members of the fallen, including David P. Brostrom, father of the slain platoon commander and himself a retired Army colonel, as well as from a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia.
 The history is replete with wrong turns at every point of the unit's mission, starting with the day it was reassigned to Afghanistan from training for Iraq.
 After having served for more than a year in other hot zones of eastern Afghanistan, the platoon arrived in the village at dark on July 8, 2008, just two weeks from the day it was supposed to go home to its base in Italy.
 The men wore their adopted unit emblem -- skull patches fashioned after Marvel Comics' antihero, the Punisher. They unloaded their Humvees, packed with weapons, water and the single rucksack each had kept when the rest of his kit was shipped home. They had plenty of ammunition. 
 But at the end of an intense tour of combat, they had run out of good relations with an increasingly distrustful population.
 They named it Outpost Kahler, after a popular sergeant who had been killed by one of their own Afghan guards early that year. His last words as he moved ahead of his comrades to check whether their Afghan partners were asleep while on duty had been, ''This might be dangerous.'' (The shooting was ruled an accident, but relations between skeptical American troops and Afghan forces deteriorated.)
 Although the 173rd Airborne Brigade had been scheduled to return to Iraq from its base in Italy, the need for forces to counter a resurgence of militant violence in eastern Afghanistan prompted new orders for the brigade to switch immediately to preparations for mountain warfare -- many of the outposts were linked only by narrow, rutted trails, and some could be reached only be helicopter -- and a wholly different culture and language. ''Unfortunately, the comparatively late change of mission for the 173rd Airborne B.C.T. from Iraq to Afghanistan did not permit the brigade sufficient time to prepare any form of campaign plan,'' the history reports.
 The unit arrived at Wanat ill prepared for the hot work of building an outpost inthe mountains in July; troops were thirsty from a lack of fresh water, and their one construction vehicle ran out of gas, so the unit was unable to complete basic fortifications. The soldiers had no local currency to buy favor by investing in the village economy, the history makes clear. The soldiers also said they complained up the chain of command about the lack of air surveillance over their dangerous corner of Afghanistan, but no more was provided.
 Even as they settled into their spartan command post, the unit's commanders were insulted to learn that local leaders were meeting together in a ''shura,'' or council, to which they were not invited -- and which might even have been a session used to coordinate the assault on the Americans that began before dawn the very next morning.
 The four-hour firefight finally ended when American warplanes and attack helicopters strafed insurgent positions. The paratroopers drove back the insurgents, but ended up abandoning the village 48 hours later.

HEADLINE: Jaguars' Fortunes Become a Civic Concern in Jacksonville

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 

 BODY:
A gloom has descended over this sun-splashed city. After years of playoff appearances and packed stadiums, the hometown Jaguars have been struggling to win football games. There are tens of thousands of empty seats at home games that are blacked out on local television. Could it be that the Jaguars' critics are right and that Jacksonville does not deserve an N.F.L. team?
 This troubling possibility has caused a bout of civic angst. The local newspaper, The Florida Times-Union, has run articles asking what would happen if the team left town (municipal ruin seemed to be the conclusion). Fans talk defiantly about ditching their season-ticket plans and attending more college football games. Consumers are hunkering down even though the Jaguars have slashed prices.
 Supporting the team has turned into a rallying cry. The Jaguars' teal-colored flags flutter alongside Old Glory downtown, where companies and the city are subsidizing tickets for their employees. The mayor has exhorted residents to attend more games and to wear team jerseys to work on Fridays. The City Council is considering whether to use up to $5 million in hotel taxes to upgrade the team's stadium. 
 ''The Jaguars are a part of our fabric and it's my job to continue to prove our viability as an N.F.L. city,'' Mayor John Peyton said, explaining his amplified role as cheerleader-in-chief.
 Football teams from Detroit to Oakland have also stumbled on the field and at the gate this season, leaving fans unable to watch some of their home games on television. The recession has been a factor in those places, too.
 But ticket sales are so slow for the Jaguars that the team has warned that it is unlikely to sell out any games at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, including Sunday's game against the Tennessee Titans. Because 80 percent of the Jaguars' local revenue comes from ticket sales, having a stadium only two-thirds full raises questions about the team's long-term health.
 The Jaguars play in one of the N.F.L.'s smallest television markets and in a state that has been hit hard by the recession. Foreclosures in Jacksonville's Duval County jumped 116 percent in August compared with the same month a year ago.
 Jacksonville has a diverse economy with clusters of health care, distribution and aerospace companies, but only a few are in the Fortune 500, so the team has a short list from which to fill its luxury boxes and premium seats. The Jaguars, who have the second-cheapest tickets in the league, have been without a stadium sponsor since 2007, when their naming rights deal with Alltel expired. The franchise's value is 29th in the 32-team league, at $866 million, according to Forbes.
 The Jaguars also compete against three major college football programs with strong followings in Jacksonville. The University of Florida Gators, less than two hours away in Gainesville, won the national title in 2006 and 2008. When Tim Tebow, the team's star quarterback, who grew up in Jacksonville, sustained a concussion recently, it was front page news.
 ''We're a bunch of spoiled fans,'' said Don Eshelman, a Gators season-ticket holder who gave up his Jaguars tickets after the 2000 season. ''We can go down the road and see a winning team.''
 Gordon Cain, his friend, added, ''The Saturday-Sunday combo wears on you.''
 Fans in Jacksonville, Eshelman and Cain said, are partial to high-scoring college games. The defense-oriented style the Jaguars play is an acquired taste.
 They, like many people in Jacksonville, were excited when the Jaguars arrived 14 years ago. The team made the playoffs in four of its first five seasons. Home games were often sold out, so few games were blacked out on TV.
 ''You build a fan base of people excited to come to the stadium, but the Jaguars got people interested in watching TV,'' said Chuck Day, who wrote the book ''Jacksonville Football History.''
 Since 2000, though, the Jaguars have had only three winning seasons. In 2005, 10,000 seats were covered with tarps to make it easier for the team to sell out games and keep them on TV. But the Jaguars' five-victory season in 2008 and a 1-2 start this season have made it harder for fans to justify paying to see the team live.
 But watching on TV is more complicated. Fans can watch games on some Internet services or they can drive more than 75 miles to see the game outside the blackout zone. (Fan Web sites are filled with pleas from die-hards asking about which out-of-town bars are showing the games.) DirectTV's ''NFL Sunday Ticket'' package does not carry the games, though the N.F.L.'s ''RedZone TV'' does show snippets from Jaguars home games locally. 
 But the Jaguars' troubles extend beyond the team's record because the league's collective bargaining agreement has widened the gap between large- and small-market teams, industry experts say. The agreement raises the salary cap and floor when total team revenue rises. This rewards teams like the Dallas Cowboys with new stadiums that generate new revenue through seat licenses, extra suites and higher tickets prices. It hurts teams in smaller cities like Jacksonville, which must pay higher player salaries without the benefit of those revenue streams.
 ''Changes in N.F.L. economics that result from the new stadiums and the current C.B.A. have made Jacksonville an uncompetitive franchise, and with the economy right now, it's a double whammy,'' said Marc Ganis, president of SportsCorp, a sports consulting firm in Chicago. ''There are a handful of teams that are stretched, but Jacksonville is the most stretched.''
 The Jaguars' stadium is only 15 years old, so the best that Wayne Weaver, the team's majority owner, can hope for is to replace the scoreboard. The Jaguars are unlikely to leave Jacksonville, though. The team receives about $115 million a year from the league's television contracts, a solid cushion. Weaver does not appear to be in any financial trouble and he has rebuffed the occasional inquiries from people seeking to buy the team.
 Although some people in Los Angeles clamor for an N.F.L. team, the league prefers stability over mobility.
 ''There's no urge to move,'' said Weaver, who made his fortune in the shoe industry with the companies Nine West and Shoe Carnival. ''It's easy when you become a poster child for people to pile on. We can't survive with 45,000 people in our building. But I'm confident our economy will bounce back.''
 Weaver said the team had laid off a dozen employees but expected discounted group sales to double and had introduced half-season ticket plans. If the league expands the number of regular-season games, Weaver said, he hopes to play one or more of them in Orlando to increase the Jaguars' reach.
 The N.F.L. has let teams allocate their full-season allotment of 17,000 free tickets any way they like, including using them all on one day if it helps them sell out and avoid a blackout. But Weaver said he was so far from selling out the stadium's 67,164 seats that the change would have no impact.
 Rather, he is appealing to hometown companies to help attract a new generation of fans. CSX, a railroad company with headquarters in Jacksonville, will chip in $20 toward any ticket that its employees buy. The mayor's appeals have not hurt, either. Ultimately, though, the Jaguars cannot wait for the economy to rebound and have to win more games.
 ''I don't think there's any apathy for the Jaguars in Jacksonville,'' Weaver said Monday, a day after the team beat the Houston Texans for its first victory of the season. ''We're just going through a difficult time.''

HEADLINE: Starwood Said to Be Near Deal to Buy Assets of Corus

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
The Starwood Capital Group, the real estate investment firm run by Barry Sternlicht, is close to a deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to purchase the assets of Corus Bank, which failed under a mound of soured condominium and commercial mortgage loans, people briefed on the matter said Friday. 
 In addition to contributing capital for the purchase, Starwood plans to manage several foreclosed or soon-to-be-owned residential and office buildings seized by Corus after their borrowers defaulted. The deal could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said. 
 A private equity firm, W. L. Ross & Company, and at least two others are also contributing cash to the deal, these people added.
 It is unclear how much the group is paying for the assets, which are said to have a face value of about $5 billion. 
 A Starwood spokesman declined to comment. As part of the deal, the F.D.I.C. plans to take an equity stake in the venture and provide financing. 
 Corus was seized by the F.D.I.C. last month and its $6.6 billion in deposits were assumed by MB Financial. 
 If the deal with Starwood goes through, the company will have beaten some major real estate investors like Thomas J. Barrack of Colony Capital; Jay Sugarman of iStar Financial; the New York developer Stephen M. Ross; and Lubert-Adler, a big property investor in Philadelphia.
 In the run-up to the financial crisis, Corus barreled into hot markets like California, Florida and Nevada and kept lending as those markets boiled over. 
 Rather than diversify, it concentrated its lending bets by financing only a handful of big, risky projects. And it poured its idle cash into a small group of other banks and financial companies that were upended when the crisis struck.

HEADLINE: Retailers Say They'll Take Even Flat Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
In the retail business, it is never too early to think about Christmas. So a lot of people are thinking about it, and taking surveys to test the mood of the American consumer, and deciding that this Christmas will be as bad as last -- which is to say, one of the worst on record.
 Retailers are relieved to hear that prediction. Flat sales this holiday season would at least mean that things had stopped getting worse. 
 ''It's reflective of this 'new normal' we're in,'' said James Russo, vice president for global consumer insights at the Nielsen Company. ''Flat is good.'' 
 Over all, the retailing industry posted a sales decline of about 2 percent last Christmas season, the weakest performance since the late 1960s, when the Commerce Department began tracking holiday sales figures. Results for stores that sell clothing and luxury goods were far worse, typically declining by double digits. By contrast, several reports published in the last few days, including surveys by Nielsen and Deloitte, forecast no change in holiday sales from last year to this year. 
 While recent economic reports have been mixed, several indicators suggest the economy is beginning to improve. But the turnaround, if it is real, has yet to filter through to retail sales, which are closely tied to the unemployment rate. That rate worsened more than expected in a government report on Friday, rising to 9.8 percent.
 Analysts say that many consumers are still worried about their jobs, their stock portfolios and the value of their homes. They remain hamstrung by a tight credit market. Few experts foresee a robust recovery in consumer spending until the unemployment rate starts heading down, perhaps sometime next year.
 If a mood of thrift and penury continues into the holiday season, retailing analysts said the beneficiaries, not surprisingly, would be discount and dollar stores, warehouse clubs and Internet retailers, as shoppers across all income levels spend less and make fewer trips to stores. 
 A holiday study published by Nielsen this week found that 85 percent of households expected to spend the same or less this year than last year. 
 People are also continuing to nest in their homes. This Christmas, sales of necessities and items associated with at-home entertainment are expected to fare best: cookware and other kitchen sundries, consumer electronics, DVDs, alcohol, tobacco and bed and bath accessories. The Nielsen report said upscale retailers should consider stocking practical items because affluent households may forgo jewelry and designer bags for the likes of generators, fireplace accessories, kitchen gadgets and family games.
 As has been the case throughout the recession, higher-priced categories like jewelry, sports equipment and vacations are expected to be hurt most. Industry experts said that would probably lead merchants of those items to offer compelling discounts, some of which will pop up before Thanksgiving. 
 Indeed, Moody's Investors Service said in a recent research note that while clothing retailers had brought their inventory in line with weaker demand, the holiday season ''may be more promotional than anticipated, as consumers have learned to delay shopping in anticipation of higher markdowns.'' 
 Already, major big-box chains are jockeying for the discretionary dollars of consumers. 
 Wal-Mart said this week it would bring a $10 toy section back to all of its stores, repeating a successful strategy from last Christmas. It will offer many more toys, for a wider variety of age groups, at that price. The offers will include classic board games like Monopoly, childhood favorites like Barbie dolls and Tonka trucks, a Hot Wheels Trick Track and a Lego Bionicle Legends set. Additionally, Wal-Mart said it would match any local competitor's advertised offer on the same toy if the price fell below $10. 
 On Tuesday, Kmart published a ''Fab 15'' toy list, highlighting a layaway program that lets consumers reserve popular items early, pay over time, then pick up their purchases before the holidays arrive. 
 The stores may have good reason to begin competing for consumers' Christmas dollars before Halloween even rolls around. According to Wal-Mart's customer research, 70 percent of consumers are planning to start their holiday toy shopping before Halloween.
 Analysts closely watch discount chains because when consumers begin spending discretionary dollars after an economic downturn, they typically do so at discount and value-priced retailers first. As time goes on and the economy recovers, consumers move up to specialty retailers. Many analysts have said that if consumers spend more this holiday season at the likes of Wal-Mart and Costco, that bodes well for specialty stores come 2010 and 2011. 
 Mr. Russo said studies by Nielsen had found that consumers were indeed ''expressing a desire to move back into the discretionary categories although -- and this is really key -- at moderate levels.'' 
 In another positive sign, Ted Vaughan, a partner in the retail and consumer products practice at BDO Seidman, said, ''Retailers are starting to ramp up their inventory purchasing'' for next year, referring to a BDO Seidman survey of chief financial officers at major chains. 
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry trade group, published one of the most optimistic of the holiday reports so far, forecasting a 1 percent year-over-year sales increase in November and December for stores open at least a year.
 ''Does the retail industry need a miracle to have positive year-over-year sales growth during the 2009 holiday season?,'' the report said. ''No, but should you see Kris Kringle at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, put in a request for one anyway!''

 A 20-hour mission across the ocean to persuade the International Olympic Committee to give the Summer Games of 2016 to Chicago ended with the president's adopted hometown finishing fourth of four candidate cities.
 Although Chicago might have lost to Rio de Janeiro for reasons that had little to do with Mr. Obama, the fact that he made himself the face of its bid invariably meant that its defeat would be taken as a stinging rejection of its favorite son. 
 Losing out on the Olympics, of course, is not the sort of war-and-peace issue that defines a presidency, and the embarrassment will presumably fade in a news cycle or two. But it provides fodder for critics who are already using it as a metaphor for a president who, in their view, focuses on the wrong priorities and overestimates his capacity to persuade the world to follow his lead.
 Mr. Obama looked glum as he returned to Washington on Friday afternoon and said, ''I wish that we had come back with better news from Copenhagen.'' He portrayed the defeat as if it were little more than a lost game of pickup basketball. ''One of the things that I think is most valuable about sports is that you can play a great game and still not win,'' he said in the Rose Garden.
 Republicans excoriated Mr. Obama's decision to go in the first place, even sending out an e-mail statement while he was addressing the committee in Copenhagen with the subject line ''Wrong Priorities.'' Republicans also quickly linked the failed effort to Friday's jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate ticking up to 9.8 percent in September.
 ''Our country needs the president's undivided attention on the urgent issues facing American families today: rising unemployment, soaring health care costs, winning the war in Afghanistan and dealing with Iran's nuclear threat,'' said Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
 Some International Olympic Committee members said that the vote was not a rejection of Mr. Obama and that his presentation was formidable. Richard W. Pound, a committee member from Canada, said that the other cities wanted to knock Chicago out early because they thought it would have been more difficult to do so in the later rounds.
 ''I'm sure that a lot of the political maneuvering was based on the fact that Obama was probably going to come and was coming, so they said, 'We've got to keep Chicago out of play or we're all dead,' '' said Mr. Pound, who added, ''I think he made a lot of friends here, got a lot of respect.''
 In Chicago, the disappointment was deep but not aimed at the president. A city preparing for a victory rally -- even the famed Picasso in Daley Plaza was decorated with an enormous Olympic medal -- reacted with silence and disappointment. 
 Barry Bowlus, one of those waiting in Daley Plaza, said that at least Mr. Obama had tried. Had he not gone at all, Mr. Bowlus said, ''there would have been a lot more heck for him to pay around here.''
 Mr. Obama's decision to become the first American president to lobby the Olympic committee in person, just two weeks after saying he was too busy with health care legislation, was a gamble from the start. It was predicated on the theory that Mr. Obama's star power overseas -- ''the best brand in the world,'' as his advisers have put it -- was luminescent enough to make the difference.
 Given that Mr. Obama flew overnight and made his presentation about 3 a.m. Washington time, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said it consumed few regular work hours that would have gone to other priorities. Mr. Obama also used the opportunity to meet for 25 minutes with his commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who flew to Copenhagen from London, where he was on business. ''The biggest loss of anything on this trip was sleep,'' Mr. Gibbs said.
 How much it cost taxpayers to fly Air Force One and its backup plane, transport the armored presidential limousines across the ocean and provide security for the whirlwind trip was uncertain.
 Mr. Obama was in Copenhagen for just five hours and did not stay for the vote. He learned Chicago lost in the first round while watching a CNN transmission whose signal cut in and out as Air Force One passed over Cabot Strait between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.
 A sense of stunned bewilderment suffused Air Force One and the White House. Only after the defeat did many advisers ask questions about the byzantine politics of the Olympic committee. Valerie Jarrett, the president's senior adviser and a Chicago booster who persuaded him to make the trip while at the United Nations last week, had repeatedly compared the contest to the Iowa caucuses. 
 But officials said the administration did not independently verify Chicago's chances, relying instead on the Chicago 2016 committee assertions that the city had enough support to finish in the top two. Mr. Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Jarrett worked the phones in recent weeks without coming away with a sense of how behind Chicago really was.
 ''Most of our information came from the committee and the Chicago folks,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president. ''But I don't want to leave the impression that somehow we went on the basis of faulty information. We went because it was the right thing to do.''
 When Chicago was eliminated in the first round after receiving only 18 of 94 votes, senior Democrats began debating whether it had been wise for the president to become so invested in the bid. But with Mr. Obama flying back to Washington and out of pocket for hours, Mr. Axelrod rushed onto television to defend the effort.
 ''I don't view this as a repudiation of the president and the first lady,'' he said. ''He would do it again if he had the opportunity.''
 Still, several friends and aides to Mr. Obama said Friday's outcome had a similar feeling to the campaign's loss in the New Hampshire primary. 
 But unlike the presidential race, the quest to host the Olympic Games had no more contests to go.

HEADLINE: A Great Choice, Even if Others Were Worthy

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Parabens para o Rio.
 Congratulations to a new city, a new country and, in fact, to a new continent for the Olympic Games. The five Olympic rings make more sense now.
In recent years, the International Olympic Committee has expressed the need to represent all its constituencies, to move its quadrennial festivals around the world. 
 The I.O.C. has put its money where its press releases have been. On Friday it voted to put the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, thereby putting the Olympics in South America for the first time in what will be the 120th year of the modern Olympic movement. 
 In the cosmic scheme of things, it was the absolute right thing to do, even though three other great world cities made compelling bids -- Chicago, eliminated first, Tokyo eliminated second, and Madrid. Any of them would have been terrific, but Rio made the most sense in the spirit of the Games, often expressed, not always observed by the Eurocentric burghers who dominate the I.O.C.
 Geopolitical bloc voting could have produced the spread that saw Chicago with the low total of 18 votes after the first round, according to Harvey Schiller, a former executive director of the United States Olympic Committee, who was an observer in Copenhagen. Now the president of the International Baseball Federation, Schiller said Chicago suffered because of recent gaffes by the U.S.O.C., but he also said the desire to spread the Games around was a factor.
 Next year's World Cup, the biggest sports tournament in the world, will be held in South Africa because of the inclusive policy of the world soccer body, FIFA. In 2014 the World Cup will be held in Brazil. Welcome to the world. 
 With the push of an electronic button in Copenhagen, nearly 100 I.O.C. members supported the expression by Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, that it was the right time to correct the imbalance among world sporting hosts. Last week in New York, da Silva made the case that Brazil's growing economy, fueled by oil and aircraft factories, had made it more than the nation of the samba and the beaches and the emotional soul of soccer. 
 ''I honestly believe it is Brazil's time,'' da Silva said Friday, and a few hours later, it was. 
 Brazil's leaders have tried to combat the image of the gangs in the hillside favelas, or slums, with da Silva noting that Brazil, at least, is not the target of world terrorism. In the fierce competition for this world showcase, just about anything is fair game. 
 The biggest loss on Friday was suffered by Chicago, which had put up an impressive plan for a compact area close to Lake Michigan and its familiar skyline and its handsome downtown. 
 The Chicago City Council even voted, by 49-0, early in September, to create an insurance plan that would guarantee any losses from the 2016 Games. Losses can happen, as shown by the large deficits and empty arenas for previous hosts like Montreal, Sydney and Athens. In recent polls, Chicagoans seemed virtually divided, with many residents concerned that the Games could take away resources from schools and hospitals and the transportation system. The Olympics are hardly the economic boon its boosters like to claim. 
 When Chicago was eliminated in the first round, thousands of residents let out a mass sigh and shuffled back to work, just as happened in Paris in 2005 when that city lost to London. 
 Britain's prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, had flown all the way to Singapore to bring home the 2012 bacon. In 2007, the then-president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, made the run to Guatemala City to bring home the 2014 blinis for the Sochi region.
 This time, President Barack Obama felt impelled to make a flying visit to Copenhagen, joining his wife, Michelle, as well as Oprah Winfrey. It is a sign of the times that the president's willingness to stick up for a great American city was depicted as sordid local politics by radio and television yappers. 
 The president talked about Chicago and himself as examples of American diversity, he chatted up I.O.C. members, and maybe he never changed a single mind because of factors having nothing to do with him. 
 Some members of the I.O.C. are still smarting over the scandal at the turn of the century when officials in Salt Lake City were discovered buying off I.O.C. members. Some members still miss the shopping trips for their wives and jobs for their sons, and have not forgotten the anger of Senator John McCain at one Senate hearing in April 1999 and of representatives at a Congressional hearing in December 1999. 
 Those long memories did not help New York's clumsy candidacy for the 2012 Games, and may have hurt the vastly superior plan by Chicago this time around. The U.S.O.C., which has become as remote as North Korea, may have doomed Chicago's bid by trying to create an Olympic television network. 
 The three defeated cities will go on. 
 Chicago still has its symphony orchestra and the Art Institute and the Bears.
 Tokyo had a competent green plan for 2016, but it may have suffered for having already hosted the Games. It continues to be a fascinating city, with the Tsukiji fish market, plus the city, lit up at night like a pinball machine. 
 Madrid had a compact and thoughtful plan but probably was hurt by Barcelona's having hosted the Games in 1992. It still has Goya in the Prado and Real Madrid in the Bernabeu stadium. 
 Rio may have given the impression that it needed the Games more than the other three cities. It can surely match its competitors for image -- ''city of love and mysteries,'' in the Antonio Carlos Jobim song, ''Song of the Jet,'' which will make anybody an instant Brazilian. The I.O.C., in its burgeoning inclusiveness, is doing the same. Parabens ao Brasil. Congratulations to Brazil.

HEADLINE: On Penalties and Insurers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MASON

 BODY:
The sound you heard on Thursday night? A collective sigh of relief from many consumers, as the Senate Finance Committee scaled back penalties to be assessed against those who do not buy health insurance. 
 ''The obligation should be first and foremost on the United States government to ensure that these plans will be affordable,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.
 To judge from postings on Friday to The New York Times's new online forum, Health Care Conversations, many readers agreed with Ms. Snowe, and many said that the proposed health care legislation would not do enough to hold insurers accountable.
 ''The government should not compel people to buy insurance until it can also guarantee that the coverage is affordable, and that consumers are protected from recession and other loopholes and dirty tricks,'' wrote Jennifer, a poster from Vermont. 
 Many experts in health policy have said that universal coverage cannot be achieved without a mandate to buy insurance, backed by significant penalties for failing to do so. While some readers were unsettled by the proposed mandate, others objected to the prospect of being legally obliged to contribute to the coffers of insurance companies. 
 ''When I have confidence that I am dealing with a system that is taking 3 percent overhead (Medicare), I feel much better about that mandate than when I am dealing with a system that takes 30 percent or more (private insurance companies),'' janineada, a poster from California, said in reply to Jennifer. ''I just am not down with paying for the CEO salaries.'' MICHAEL MASON

HEADLINE: Great Year, but S.& P. Closes In on its Worst Decade

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE decade now ending could be called the Zeroes, but for the fact that stock investors only wish they had done so well.
 But it is ending with a bang. The total return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index through the end of September was almost 17 percent, and that was after adjusting for inflation. Even if the index does nothing in the final three months of the year, it will have turned in its best year since 2003. 
 The stock market has not been the best place to be. As 2009 began, the credit crisis was a dominant theme, with worries of huge corporate defaults and an inability of companies to find lenders. There have been plenty of defaults and bankruptcies, but junk bonds have managed to regain all of the ground they lost during a horrible 2008.
 The accompanying charts show the performance -- for the current decade and for the 1990s -- of the S.& P. 500 and of five Merrill Lynch indexes measuring total returns for fixed-income investments. The figures are adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
 The Merrill Lynch Master II high-yield index -- the polite name for junk bonds -- gained 45 percent in the first nine months of 2009, even after adjusting for inflation. That index, which dates back to 1986, has never experienced a full year nearly that good. The annual record, an inflation-adjusted gain of 35 percent, was recorded in 1991, another year after a major sell-off of junk bonds.
 But even with the huge gain so far this year, the junk bond index has climbed only 38 percent for the decade. It had lost money in the first nine years of the decade.
 If all junk has been good this year, bad junk has been outstanding. Merrill's index of bonds rated CCC or lower -- the very bottom of the credit pool and indicating a substantial risk of default -- has gained almost 75 percent in 2009, adjusted for inflation. That index, not shown in the graphic, had fallen 38 percent in 2008. Even with that gain, such bonds are still a little below the peak reached in 2007.
 The reverse quality relationship also applies for investment-grade bonds. Corporate bonds from companies with excellent credit -- rated AAA or AA -- have produced a total return, adjusted for inflation, of a little over 5 percent this year. Those at the lower end of investment grade -- rated A or BBB -- have returned more than 18 percent. Someone who stayed invested in Treasury securities, whether six-month Treasury bills or 10-year Treasury bonds, failed to keep up with inflation in 2009.
 The current decade appears to have locked in the dubious honor of being the worst decade ever for the S.& P. 500, which dates back to the end of 1927. The only previous decade in which the index, including dividends, failed to keep up with inflation was the 1970s, when it fell 13 percent. With three months left in the decade, the decline is 33 percent. It would take a major rally in this quarter for the market to even do as badly as it did in the 1970s.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Poor Decade Nears an End: For American investors, the decade of the Zeroes has not been a good one, despite large rallies as it nears its end. Stocks have not come close to keeping up with inflation. Bond investors did better, but not as well as in the 1990s.(Sources: Merrill Lynch

HEADLINE: Europe Has Antitrust Concerns in Airline Alliance

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The European Union's antitrust regulator said on Friday that it had raised objections to a joint venture proposed by British Airways, American Airlines and the Spanish flag carrier Iberia because of concerns it would curtail competition. 
 The European Commission began an investigation in April into whether the deal, announced in August 2008, violated European Union rules against restrictive business practices. Antitrust regulators in the United States are also conducting a review, which is expected to conclude by the end of this month.
 Rival airlines have complained that the venture would stifle competition on routes between Heathrow Airport in London and several American cities.
 British Airways, American and Iberia, already members of the global Oneworld airline alliance, have proposed a deepening of their existing partnership that would allow them to share revenue and make joint marketing and scheduling decisions on flights between the United States, Mexico, Canada and the 27-member European Union, as well as Switzerland and Norway. The proposed agreement would create a unified network of about 500 possible destinations in more than 100 countries.
 Lawyers for the three airlines will spend the next few weeks studying the European list of objections, which are understood to center around the dominant market position that a deal would give British Airways and American Airlines, in particular, on links between Heathrow and destinations like Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston and Miami.
 The industry is following the antitrust reviews on both sides of the Atlantic with great interest, especially as the latest downturn in air traffic pushes airlines to shave operating costs and seek new sources of revenue. Similar trans-Atlantic partnerships are already in operation among four members of the Star Alliance -- Lufthansa, Continental Airlines, United Air Lines and Air Canada -- and the SkyTeam members Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and its Northwest unit. 
 Authorities in the United States have granted antitrust immunity to the Star and SkyTeam deals, while the European Union is still examining those agreements.
 Virgin Atlantic, which is owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and is a rival of British Airways, has been among the most vocal critics of a British Airways-American-Iberia deal, saying that it would create a ''monster monopoly'' with the power to collude on prices and schedules out of Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic does not belong to an airline group, though it has close commercial relations with several Star Alliance members.
 British Airways and its partners, meanwhile, argue that their cooperation would expand travel options for passengers and allow for more convenient connections and lower fares.
 Paul Marston, a British Airways spokesman, said approval of the venture would also enable its partners to compete with Star and SkyTeam ''on a more equal footing.''
 The venture is the third attempt in the last decade by British Airways and American Airlines to win approval for a closer partnership. The two previous efforts, in 1997 and 2002, were abandoned after the airlines rejected as too onerous a requirement that they give up as many as 16 daily takeoff and landing slots from Heathrow.
 British Airways and its partners now argue that the so-called open skies agreement between the United States and Europe has significantly eased restrictions on access to Heathrow since it went into effect in March 2008, and that competition will continue to increase there after the global economy and air traffic recover.

HEADLINE: On a Record Pace, Mayor Spends $65 Million to His Rival's $3.8 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
To market Bounty paper towels last year, Procter & Gamble spent about $63 million. To advertise Yoplait Light yogurt, General Mills spent about $62 million.
 But these corporate giants have nothing on Michael. R. Bloomberg.
 To hold on to his job as mayor this year, he has spent $65 million of his own money, according to his latest financial disclosure report, released on Friday.
 Even for a man whose vast financial advantages have redefined New York City elections -- and smothered his lesser-financed opponents -- the amount of spending is, by any measure, staggering. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has spent about 40 percent more than he had at the same point in his 2005 campaign, and twice what he had spent by this point in his first run for office in 2001. Each of those races was, at the time, the most expensive municipal campaign in United States history.
 The mayor has spent 16 times as much as his Democratic rival, William C. Thompson Jr., who is still scrambling to raise money from donors. And at his current pace, Mr. Bloomberg is on track to easily spend more than $100 million by Election Day on Nov. 3 
 The disclosure of the figures drew expressions of outrage from Democrats and from supporters of campaign finance limits.
 ''It badly distorts the city's democracy to have one candidate spend his own money like a drunken sailor -- or more accurately, like a million drunken sailors,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonpartisan government watchdog organization. 
 He described the $65 million figure as ''grotesquely excessive.''
 But Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, defended the spending as prudent. ''We're confident that Mike Bloomberg's record of progress on job creation, crime and education will prevail over Bill Thompson's record of failure,'' she said. ''But we're not taking anything for granted.'' 
 To some political analysts, the spending suggested that the mayor's campaign remained deeply anxious about the election. Though his approval ratings continue to be solid, and he leads Mr. Thompson by at least 10 points in most polls, his support is not as ironclad as it was in 2005, when he crushed Fernando Ferrer by almost 20 percentage points. 
 And the mayor's aides watched nervously as Democratic primary voters ousted at least five City Council members this fall -- a sign that, in the middle of a deep economic downturn, the electorate is restless. 
 According to the latest filing, as of Sept. 28, the mayor had spent $22 million to saturate television channels with his commercials, $10 million on campaign mailings and $3.4 million on wages for campaign workers. 
 By comparison, Mr. Thompson has spent $305,000 on TV ads, $2,000 on campaign mailings and $529,000 on wages for workers.
 Overall, Mr. Thompson, who has been the city's comptroller since 2002, has raised $5.6 million, received almost $2.5 million in matching funds, and spent $3.8 million -- equivalent, roughly, to Vermont's annual advertising budget for tourism.
 And Mr. Thompson is still having a hard time raising money. He collected $114,000 from Sept. 1 to Sept. 28 -- a pace that was far behind the last two Democrats to lose to Mr. Bloomberg, Mark Green in 2001 and Mr. Ferrer in 2005.
 But more tellingly, some of Mr. Thompson's former donors are not opening their checkbooks. According to campaign finance data, there are more than 160 people who gave him the maximum amount allowable when he ran for comptroller in 2005 but who have not given him a penny this year.
 The list includes the former N.B.A. star Magic Johnson, the clothing designer Ralph Lauren and George Klein, the chief executive of Park Tower Group, a real estate developer.
 Even as it released its eye-popping spending, the Bloomberg campaign mocked Mr. Thompson's anemic fund-raising in an e-mail message to reporters. 
 ''Bill Thompson's fund-raising continues to lag behind previous Democratic nominees, a strong signal that he isn't generating excitement or grass-roots support for his candidacy,'' Ms. Hazelbaker wrote. 
 Carly Lindauer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Thompson's campaign, fired back in a tart statement, ''Our Republican mayor can continue to spend millions trying to rewrite his record, but that won't change the fact that under his watch unemployment is the highest it's been in 16 years, and working families are leaving because the city has become so unaffordable.''
 If the mayor's past campaigns are any guide, his spending will only accelerate. In 2005, about 45 percent of Mr. Bloomberg's spending occurred over the last 32 days of the election. If that holds true this time around, he will spend about $117 million by the end of the campaign.

HEADLINE: All You Have to Do Is Dream

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
It is the obligation of every American to have a dream. The bigger the better. 
 One of my personal dreams is that we should have a public health insurance option. To tell you the truth, this was not on my list at the beginning of 2009. But so many really irritating people have been announcing that a public option is impossible/wrong/possibly treasonous that now I yearn for it night and day.
 And if we're really going to get the economy rolling again, everybody is going to need a lot more dreams involving very large plasma TVs. Plus new cars and maybe a really snazzy espresso machine. 
 The White House had a dream of getting Chicago the Olympics. Didn't work out. At all. And some people feel it was sort of weird for Barack Obama to throw himself into the fight with such ardor. They may have a point. But if the president is going to take a flier on an improbably and possibly delusional quest, I would prefer that it involve lobbying the Olympic committee rather than, say, invading a country. 
 As a nation we seem to be overstocked on dreams involving fame and fortune, particularly the ones that come untethered to any plans for actual achievement. Every time a TV show holds auditions for a new singing or dancing or top-modeling competition, the streets are stacked with people who appear to have no particular talent or training but are confident that they can make it to the top, thanks to the critical dream factor.
 And maybe they have a point. When President Obama told the nation's schoolchildren that success requires hard work, a reality TV star named Spencer Pratt retorted that it was actually quite easy. He makes millions of dollars every year playing himself on ''The Hills'' and attending a large number of nightclub openings. This was not something Pratt had to study for.
 Sarah Palin has not been setting a very good example, either. This week her publisher announced that Palin had produced a 400-page memoir, ''Going Rogue: An American Life'' in only four months. This is exactly the kind of facility that many nonwriters who dream of best-sellerdom imagine they could summon once they got the right title and dedication page.
 First-time writers generally only achieve this kind of stupendous productivity when somebody else does the actual writing. Palin was channeled by Lynn Vincent, who has worked with a number of other conservative celebs, including William Boykin, the general who got into hot water by suggesting that his God was better than the Muslims' God. (Boykin's ''Never Surrender: A Soldier's Journey to the Crossroads of Faith and Freedom'' was widely acclaimed for the length of its subtitle.)
 In an ingenious spin on the co-author strategy, Stephenie Meyer, who wrote the ''Twilight'' novels, said that her vampire hero appeared in a dream and then dictated the first book as fast as she could type. He did not demand a percentage of the advance. This does sound like a great strategy, and I understand that millions of American women currently have a dream of having that dream. 
 Then there is Tom DeLay and ''Dancing With the Stars.''
 I promise not to bring this show up again, unless they surprise us with a guest appearance by Mitt Romney doing the hustle. 
 However, it is the perfect example of our theme since it is packed with people who had once briefly achieved stardom and now yearn to recapture lost glory by doing something for which most of them have no actual talent whatsoever. 
 ''Dancing With the Stars'' calls DeLay ''arguably the highest-ranking star we've ever had,'' which really translates into ''was once more important than Donny Osmond.''
 DeLay's dream appears to be to remake himself into a person who is famous for something other than transforming the Congressional Republican caucus from cost-cutting reformers into lobbyist-loving back-scratchers in less time than it took Sarah Palin to deliver her first chapter. He looked terrifyingly cheerful during that cha-cha last week but was far more somber in the second competition. He looked, in fact, as if the House ethics committee had just plunked itself down at the judges table.
 It turned out that he was suffering from what the announcer described as the agony of ''toe trouble'' or a ''pre-stress fracture.'' It wasn't entirely clear whether it was the stress or the fracture that was imminent, but DeLay vowed to carry on despite his suffering.
 ''I've worked too hard and even though my foot hurts, nothing's going to stop me from doing this dance tonight,'' he said grimly, in a quote that we really hope will go down in Texas political history, right under whatever Davy Crockett said before the battle of the Alamo.
 Then he almost dropped his partner on her head.
 What can I tell you, people? Dreams die hard.

HEADLINE: Can Christie Hold Lead? Devil May Be in Lack of Budget Details

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
For most of this year, Christopher J. Christie has protected a commanding lead in the race for New Jersey governor by adhering to a simple strategy: trumpeting his own record as a corruption-fighting prosecutor, battering Gov. Jon S. Corzine for raising taxes, and promising to slash state spending -- without saying precisely how. 
 As Election Day draws nearer, however, Mr. Christie finds his lead shrinking and his campaign on the defensive for its refusal to provide a detailed budget plan. 
 Mr. Christie, a Republican, has blasted Governor Corzine and his fellow Democrats for increasing public spending by $35 billion beyond the rate of inflation over the past eight years and has listed a handful of cuts he would enact, including $185 million a year by denying state health care benefits to ineligible recipients and $250 million in annual overtime costs. He would also eliminate two-thirds of the approximately 3,000 patronage positions in the executive branch. 
 But those cuts would cover only a small fraction of the $8 billion to $10 billion budget shortfall expected to greet the next governor. So Mr. Christie, who has pledged not to increase taxes, has heard criticism about his lack of specifics from across the political spectrum.
 The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal called his campaign ''empty,'' and audience members at Mr. Christie's address on Wednesday to the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, a group that leans Democratic, shouted ''Answer the question!'' when he gave an imprecise response to a request for details about budget cuts. 
 The pressure on Mr. Christie increased this week when Christopher Daggett, the independent candidate in the race, unveiled a plan to cut property taxes by extending the state sales tax on services. 
 At a debate on Thursday, that left Mr. Christie facing a barrage of questions from both opponents, as well as from the panel of journalists. When pressed to provide examples of specific programs he would cut, Mr. Christie took a swipe at the moderator, Michael Aron of NJN News, by telling him, ''You've been in Trenton a long time.'' 
 Political analysts are divided about the merits of Mr. Christie's decision to go light on the details. Many advise him to avoid doing anything that might distract voters from making the race a referendum on Mr. Corzine, who has presided over an era of rising taxes, tolls, unemployment, state debt and home foreclosures.
 In 1977, the Republican candidate for governor, Raymond H. Bateman, was leading in the polls when he was goaded into issuing a detailed budget proposal. Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, the Democrat, promptly used that plan to pummel him and win re-election.
 The state's current fiscal situation is so dire that even Mr. Christie acknowledges that the state's upcoming budget will involve painful cuts. New Jersey's entire income tax revenue, and a half-penny of sales tax revenue, are already dedicated to property tax relief. About $1.8 billion of the $29 billion budget goes to aid municipalities, so cuts would probably lead to a spike in property taxes, already among the nation's highest. 
 Since much of the remainder of the budget consists of essential services like police, prisons, school aid and pension contributions, Mr. Christie would probably have to consider a combination of drastic cuts in programs and major layoffs to close a $10 billion gap, analysts say. While he has avoided putting a price tag on the savings he might generate by laying off political appointees, budget analysts say it would be unlikely to top $200 million. 
 Mr. Christie has also proposed eliminating ''double-dip'' pensions for people with more than one government job and slashing pensions and benefits for part-time workers.
 Mr. Daggett has ridiculed Mr. Christie's suggestion that he could cut his way to a balanced budget, saying on Wednesday, ''He'd have to lay off every state worker, and some of them twice.''
 Some observers warn that Mr. Christie risks losing credibility with voters if he does not provide a more complete picture of his plan. Peter McDonough, an aide to former Gov. Christie Whitman, said Mrs. Whitman trailed Gov. Jim Florio in the 1993 gubernatorial race until she released a specific plan to cut property taxes. While Mr. Corzine and his predecessor, James E. McGreevey, were more vague about specific budget plans in their successful campaigns, Mr. McDonough said, New Jersey Democrats have more leeway because their party has a bigger base in the state.
 ''You can only play rope-a-dope if you have a big lead and the fundamentals of the race, like voter registration advantage, is in your favor,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''Besides, people are suffering economically now, so they want answers.''
 While Mr. Christie may be reluctant to fill in the blanks of his budget plan, Mr. Corzine has not been shy in predicting that it will increase taxes for middle-class families and cut them for wealthy New Jerseyans and corporations. Mr. Christie's advisers say Mr. Corzine is distorting their plan to distract the public from his own record -- specifically, his failure to deliver on his promise to increase property tax rebates 40 percent over four years. 
 While Mr. Christie promised in February to unveil a property tax reform program, his campaign now says the details he has provided so far are enough to offer voters a clear contrast without relying on slogans. ''Jon Corzine has not been specific in saying what he'll do to reverse a devastating economic decline,'' said a Christie spokeswoman. ''He's the one who has to answer to voters.''

HEADLINE: Ephemeral Comfort of Conservatism

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
After November's Republican rout, and after Republican Party identification hit a record low and the party's approval rating reached a near-record low, many liberals openly hoped that the G.O.P. and its conservative tenets would go the way of the Whigs. Au contraire. 
 A series of recent Gallup polls has actually detected an uptick in conservative sentiment across a broad range of measures. For example:
 The party identification gap between Democrats and Republicans is now the smallest it has been since 2005.
 There is a ''renewed desire'' for government to promote traditional values.
 An August report saw a marked increase in the number of people who want to decrease immigration.
 A June report found that conservatives are now the largest ideological group, outnumbering liberals 2 to 1. And another June report found that while there was no change in the number of people who thought that Republicans were too conservative, there was an uptick in those who thought that Democrats were too liberal.
 A May report found that for the first time since Gallup began asking about abortion in 1995, more Americans are now anti-abortion than supportive of abortion rights. 
 Is this a reaction to a new Democratic administration in general or to President Obama in particular? Maybe it's the manifestation of something more deeply rooted in our behavior.
 A hundred and fifty years ago, Abraham Lincoln framed conservatism thusly: ''What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?'' It was and still is. Conservatism for some is a collective mooring against the waves of change. It is a reflexive reaction to uncertainty.
 The Obama administration's response to the financial and automotive crises and its pursuit of a wide range of reforms is the epitome of new and untried. Major change has come much too quickly for far too many. The response: retreat to a cocoon of conservatism.
 Nothing illustrates this better than the health care reform debate. Fear of change and the uncertainty it brings is driving a large portion of the opposition. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey released on Tuesday found that the top three words selected by those in favor of reforms to describe their feelings were ''hopeful,'' ''optimistic'' and ''positive.'' On the other hand, the top three words used by those opposed to reforms were ''frustrated,'' ''confused'' and ''angry.'' 
 This fear and frustration put feet into the streets. Some simply protested the health care reforms, but others vented their cumulative angst. It was a conservative catharsis. 
 I believe that fear is fleeting and anger subsides. The question is: Where are we along the arc of anxiety? If it persists, it could spell real trouble for the Democrats a year from now.

HEADLINE: Nobody Likes Us? Who Cares?

BYLINE: By JOHN R. MILLER. 
John R. Miller, a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, is a former Republican representative from Washington and the former State Department ambassador at large on modern slavery.

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 IN 1926, a time of peace, Edwin James wrote in The Times Magazine: ''Of all the peoples in the world, the Americans are the least loved. That is one way of saying that the United States of America is the most unpopular nation on the face of the earth.''
 This should help put into perspective current American concerns about negative international public opinion. The United States' standing in the world has always been relatively low and that overall negative trend is unaffected by the fact that much of the world celebrated the election of President Obama, or by polls indicating that at least some Europeans are pleased with Mr. Obama's leadership. Public opinion, it seems, is driven less by current events or decisions than by a deep resentment of America's powerful status. 
 This helps explain the negativity (mostly in Western Europe) that James sensed in the 1920s. One informal survey from that time showed that just a few years after the United States helped France to fight a war with Germany, the French people called the United States their least favorite among nations, Germany included. French mobs marched on the United States Embassy and threw rocks at buses carrying American tourists. 
 Americans were bewildered. Hadn't the French always loved us, as evidenced by their giving troops and loans to help the American Revolution? And hadn't we just sent troops and loans to help the French in the war? Why were the French so angry?
 The answer is simple: Major world powers attract envy and resentment. Nations, like individuals, would much prefer to be seen as the generous benefactor rather than the dependent beneficiary -- especially of a nation that was once far less powerful. 
 Perhaps demonstrating this point, a curious change occurred in the late 1920s and '30s. As the United States retreated to a more isolationist stance, Western European public opinion seemed to change for the better. Gallup surveys in 1939 showed that, even as Americans tried to stay aloof from the war in Europe, the French and British public, both by a sizable margin, regarded the United States as their favorite foreign nation. 
 After we joined Britain and liberated France, public opinion toward the United States swung again. A Gallup survey in 1945 showed a dip in feelings toward America after liberation, with 54 percent of the French expressing disappointment with America. As for Britain, in wartime essays at the end of 1943, George Orwell wrestled with the fact that while British officials were careful to offer nothing but praise for the United States, the British public had developed a very low opinion of the Yanks. 
 One would think that at least the Marshall Plan, through which the United States offered economic aid to help rebuild Europe after World War II, would have brought some good will. But Europeans seemed to be resentful of these gifts: Secretary of State Dean Acheson was concerned at the time about growing anti-American public opinion in Western Europe.
 To be sure, opinion toward the United States today is not overwhelmingly negative, thanks to widespread approval of President Obama. A recent survey from the German Marshall Fund suggested that positive opinion of the United States had skyrocketed in Europe. Likewise, a Pew survey showed that approval of America has jumped to 75 percent in France and 69 percent in Britain. But the comparable figures were 63 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in the second year of George W. Bush's administration, and we all know where the numbers went from there. It merely may be that new American presidents tend to enjoy a honeymoon in foreign opinion. 
 Given these mixed signals, which surveys should President Obama pay attention to -- the ones that suggest approval of his leadership or the more negative appraisals? The answer is neither. His only concern should be whether favorable public opinion abroad will help him achieve America's own goals, and there is little evidence that that is the case. 
 Rather, history suggests that there is only one sure way for President Obama to ensure the popularity of the United States abroad: reduce the power of the United States or simply don't exercise it -- either militarily, economically or even diplomatically. The world simply distrusts the big guy on the block, and the only way to address this is to stop behaving like a superpower. A much better option, of course, would be to pay less attention to foreign opinion surveys and more to our own ideals and interests.

HEADLINE: Obama Meets Top Afghan Commander As He Mulls Change in War Strategy

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
President Obama held an unannounced meeting here on Friday with Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, his Afghanistan commander, to discuss a possible change in strategy and a proposed troop buildup in the eight-year-old war. 
 General McChrystal flew here from London, where he gave a speech on Thursday affirming the need for a military buildup in Afghanistan. He joined Mr. Obama in the forward cabin of Air Force One on the tarmac of the Copenhagen airport for 25 minutes after the president finished his presentation to the International Olympic Committee on behalf of Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Games.
 It was the men's first meeting in person since General McChrystal took over all American and NATO forces on the ground in June. They spoke only once after that, in a videoconference call in August, until this week, when the general joined a video conference with the president to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama spoke with the general by phone on Wednesday and suggested they meet in Copenhagen.
 General McChrystal has requested as many as 40,000 more troops for the effort in Afghanistan and issued a dire report warning that without more forces the mission there would fail. Mr. Obama already sent an additional 21,000 troops earlier this year, for a total of 68,000 by this fall, and the prospect of even more reinforcements prompted a wholesale review of his policy.
 The fact that Mr. Obama had not talked with General McChrystal since his report was submitted at the end of August generated criticism from some who thought he was too distant from his own top commander. The White House argued that the president did not want to bypass the chain of command regularly and got plenty of information through weekly meetings with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Mr. Obama met with Mr. Gates, Admiral Mullen and the rest of his national security team on Wednesday, the second of five planned meetings to chart a new course in the war in Afghanistan. While General McChrystal pushes for a buildup of forces, others, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., are advocating the opposite approach, a scaled-back presence with a new focus on hunting cells of Al Qaeda, primarily through unmanned aerial aircraft strikes and Special Operations raids.
 In his speech in London, General McChrystal bluntly said he did not think such an approach would work. The strategy General McChrystal has promoted is based on the one unveiled by Mr. Obama in March, concentrating on protecting the Afghan population, training Afghan security forces and building economic opportunity and better governance.
 But the marred Afghan elections have called into question in the minds of many Obama advisers whether that strategy can work. Though President Hamid Karzai won the preliminary count, fraud on a wide scale has put those results into question, and they remain under review.
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said the president's meeting with General McChrystal ''was very productive'' and underscored ''many of the reasons why he picked him'' to take command in Afghanistan. ''General McChrystal expects that the president and others are going to ask him questions about the assessment that he's made,'' Mr. Gibbs said.

HEADLINE: Incompetent? No, Just Not A Leader

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Some people are born to be leaders. 
 Hugh L. McColl Jr. is such a person. Starting in 1974, when he was 39, he became the president of a small southern bank called North Carolina National Bank. He then proceeded to build one of the great banking empires in American history. Buying bank after bank, he transformed his small institution into NationsBank, which became one of the biggest regional banks; then, in 1998, as the capstone of his career, he bought mighty Bank of America for $65 billion, promptly moving its headquarters from San Francisco to NationsBank's hometown of Charlotte, N.C.
 A former Marine, Mr. McColl was so insistent on creating a culture of discipline that he preferred to hire executives who had spent time in the military. As an entrepreneur, he had the charisma of, say, Sam Walton or Herb Kelleher, and instilled in his employees a powerful sense of mission. He was -- is -- blunt, funny and smart. Employees would walk through walls for him. He had the classic Southern businessman's chip on his shoulder, burning with desire to show those Northern fancy-pants that he could play the game just as well as they could, if not better. 
 You know who served as Mr. McColl's right-hand man as he built NationsBank into Bank of America, don't you? Yes, that's right: it was Kenneth D. Lewis, who this week announced -- finally! -- that he was resigning as chief executive of Bank of America in the face of an unending series of controversies, most of which revolved around Mr. Lewis's purchase last year of Merrill Lynch in the middle of the financial crisis.
 During the 1990s, Mr. Lewis was the man whose job it was to make Mr. McColl's bold acquisitions succeed. By all accounts, he was very good at it. ''McColl could never have made it work without Ken Lewis,'' said Richard X. Bove, a veteran bank analyst with Rochdale Securities. ''Most of the banks McColl bought were deeply troubled. Ken would shrink the companies, fire people, determine what had to be done to make it profitable and actually get it done.'' 
 Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, of the Yale School of Management, called Mr. Lewis ''the devoted servant of Hugh McColl.'' Tightly wound, tough-minded and ruthless when he needed to be, Mr. Lewis was the perfect Mr. Inside to Hugh McColl's Mr. Outside. 
 And then, in 2001, Mr. McColl retired, and Mr. Lewis became the boss. Unlike his legendary predecessor, however, he turned out not to be a born leader. Which goes a long way toward explaining why Mr. Lewis will soon join the likes of John A. Thain, Richard S. Fuld Jr. and Charles O. Prince III as financial chief executives who lost both their jobs and good reputations in the crisis.
 The financial crisis didn't bring down Ken Lewis so much as it exposed his flaws. He was a perfect example of Warren E. Buffett's wonderful adage that ''only when the tide goes out do you discover who's swimming naked.'' 
 It's wrong to say he was incompetent; he really does understand, on an operational level, how to run a bank. And as the chief executive of Bank of America, he was an empire builder himself, largely continuing Mr. McColl's strategy of growing through acquisitions, until Bank of America became the biggest bank in the country by assets. As long as he was riding a bull market, that strategy worked. 
 But his sphere of competence never expanded beyond that original set of skills. Even as C.E.O., said Tony Plath, a banking professor at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, ''His capability was operations. He's an inside guy.'' Mr. Lewis was uncomfortable rousing the troops, or even giving an executive a pep talk. Small talk with underlings was out of the question. He brutally fired many of the firm's most talented executives, seemingly afraid to be surrounded by potential successors. Despite the size of his company, his board had almost no one with big-time banking experience. Instead, it was made up largely of cronies. 
 Thomas K. Brown, an independent bank analyst who for years has been Mr. Lewis's loudest critic, called him ''aloof and arrogant.'' Certainly, many shareholders felt that way. It often seemed as if he cared more about creating a big bank than a profitable one. Although the stock returned negative 13 percent on his watch (Wells Fargo, by contrast, returned 53 percent between 2001 and 2009), he took home $60 million over the last three years. ''He has been hideously overpaid for hideously bad performance,'' said Nell Minow, co-founder of the Corporate Library, which monitors corporate executives and boards. 
 And at a time when many companies were dividing the jobs of chairman of the board and chief executive, Mr. Lewis declined to go along, keeping both titles. Last year, however, shareholders voted to strip him of his chairmanship, a humiliating blow.
 Even when the financial crisis hit, his response was to fall back on the only strategy he had ever known: buy more companies. Thus it was that in 2008, he bought Countrywide and Merrill Lynch -- moves that eventually caused Bank of America to need both government assistance and guarantees against loan losses. The latter purchase, in particular, was his downfall.
 One reason he bought them was that he could no longer buy a bank; Bank of America's deposit base had reached a 10 percent market share, and under federal rules, banks aren't allowed to expand beyond that mark.
 But another reason is that, despite their obvious problems, they were just sitting there, waiting to be bought. And Mr. Lewis could never resist a juicy acquisition. Indeed, less than a year before he bought Merrill Lynch, Bank of America's profits had been devoured by losses from the troubled securities held by its investment banking division. At the time, Mr. Lewis was quoted as saying, ''I've had all the fun I can stand in investment banking.'' He told analysts that he wanted the bank to become less dependent on investment banking revenue.
 Yet when bait like Merrill Lynch was dangled in front of him, he immediately bit -- and overpaid for an asset he could have had for much less had he just waited a few extra days. (Remember, this was Lehman weekend.) To long-time Lewis watchers, this was par for the course.
 You know what happened next. The huge Merrill losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. The government's insistence that Mr. Lewis go through with the merger -- or lose his job. The billions in bonuses Merrill handed out to its executives just days before the merger was completed. The lack of disclosure of any of this to Bank of America's shareholders before they voted to approve the merger. And finally, the investigations -- by Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York -- that are still a long way from winding down.
 As the controversy over Merrill Lynch has escalated, Mr. Lewis has come across as both cowardly and dissembling -- indeed, that is part of the reason it has escalated: nobody really believes his version of events. It is possible, I suppose, that he really didn't know that the Merrill losses were mounting until after the merger was approved by shareholders -- even though Bank of America had executives swarming all over the place. But is it likely?
 As for the controversy over the Merrill bonuses -- and the lack of disclosure in the merger material -- I doubt that Mr. Lewis personally knew the details of the disclosure, which the bank says were dictated by its lawyers. But Bank of America's consistent inability to explain clearly its role in the bonuses has made the bank appear that it was hiding something. This did not reflect well on Mr. Lewis either.
 When he was deposed byMr. Cuomo's investigators, he told them, in effect, that Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, had forced him to go through with the Merrill deal, despite his second thoughts. But when he was hauled up before Congress, Mr. Lewis denied that Mr. Paulson's strong-arming was the deciding factor in going through with the merger. And on, and on.
 This week I watched a replay of that Congressional hearing from June, during which Mr. Lewis was grilled mercilessly about the Merrill deal. It was painful to watch. He stuttered, grimaced, hemmed and hawed, looking like the proverbial deer in the headlights. 
 At one point, he was read an internal Federal Reserve e-mail message in which the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that Mr. Lewis had requested a letter from the government saying that it had forced him to go through with the merger. It would help defend the bank from shareholder lawsuits, Mr. Lewis told Mr. Bernanke, according to the message. 
 When asked about that request by a congressman, Mr. Lewis stammered, ''I don't remember.'' What kind of leader makes the biggest deal of his life and then wants the government to protect him from his own decisions? And what kind of leader then won't admit to making such a request?
 It may turn out that the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America was a good deal. For now, it's too early to tell. On the one hand, Merrill Lynch brokers, unhappy at Bank of America, are leaving in droves. On the other hand, Merrill's profits are propping up Bank of America, which is awash in credit card and other losses.
 A final point: I couldn't help noticing that when Mr. Lewis made his surprise announcement this week, he said he would stay on until the end of the year -- in part because there was no chosen successor. The board now has to find a new chief executive, at a very stressful time, because Mr. Lewis never groomed one himself. 
 Meanwhile, on Monday, just days before Mr. Lewis's announcement, JPMorgan Chase announced a new head of investment banking -- in a move that was clearly intended as part of a potential succession plan. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, made the move even though, at 53, he is eight years younger than Mr. Lewis, and even though he has no intention of leaving the bank in the foreseeable future. 
 ''It's my duty to the board to focus on succession,'' Mr. Dimon told one reporter. ''It's important that we have people trained and tested with experience to succeed me.''
 Isn't that what a real leader does?

HEADLINE: Still Not Tired

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
He didn't want to wear earplugs. Apparently, he wanted to enjoy the blast.
 That is what The Dallas Morning News reported about Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, the 19-year-old Jordanian accused of trying to blow up a downtown Dallas skyscraper. He was caught by an F.B.I. sting operation that culminated in his arrest nearly two weeks ago -- after Smadi parked a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, supplied by the F.B.I., in the garage of a Dallas office tower. 
 ''Inside the S.U.V. was a fake bomb, designed to appear similar to one used by Timothy McVeigh in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing,'' The News wrote. ''Authorities say Smadi thought he could detonate it with a cellphone. After parking the vehicle, he got into another vehicle with one of the agents, and they drove several blocks away. An agent offered Smadi earplugs, but he declined, 'indicating that he wanted to hear the blast,' authorities said. He then dialed the phone, thinking it would trigger the bomb. ... Instead, the agents took him into custody.'' 
 If that doesn't send a little shiver down your spine, how about this one? BBC.com reported that ''it has emerged that an Al Qaeda bomber who died last month while trying to blow up a Saudi prince in Jeddah had hidden the explosives inside his body.'' He reportedly inserted the bomb and detonator in his rectum to elude metal detectors. My God. 
 Or how about this? Two weeks ago in Denver, the F.B.I. arrested Najibullah Zazi, a 24-year-old Afghan immigrant, and indicted him on charges of planning to set off a bomb made of the same home-brewed explosives used in the 2005 London transit bombings. He allegedly learned how to do so on a training visit to Pakistan. The Times reported that Zazi ''had bought some bomb ingredients in beauty supply stores, the authorities said, after viewing instructions on his laptop on how to build such a bomb. When an employee of the Beauty Supply Warehouse asked about the volume of materials he was buying, he remembered Mr. Zazi answering, 'I have a lot of girlfriends.' ''
 These incidents are worth reflecting on. They tell us some important things. First, we may be tired of this ''war on terrorism,'' but the bad guys are not. They are getting even more ''creative.''
 Second, in this war on terrorism, there is no ''good war'' or ''bad war.'' There is one war with many fronts, including Europe and our own backyard, requiring many different tactics. It is a war within Islam, between an often too-silent Muslim mainstream and a violent, motivated, often nihilistic jihadist minority. Theirs is a war over how and whether Islam should embrace modernity. It is a war fueled by humiliation -- humiliation particularly among young Muslim males who sense that their faith community has fallen behind others, in terms of both economic opportunity and military clout. This humiliation has spawned various jihadists cults, including Al Qaeda, which believe they have the God-given right to kill infidels, their own secular leaders and less pious Muslims to purify Islam and Islamic lands and thereby restore Muslim grandeur.
 Third, the newest and maybe most active front in this war is not Afghanistan, but the ''virtual Afghanistan'' -- the loose network of thousands of jihadist Web sites, mosques and prayer groups that recruit, inspire and train young Muslims to kill without any formal orders from Al Qaeda. The young man in Dallas came to F.B.I. attention after espousing war on the U.S. on jihadist Web sites.
 Fourth, in the short run, winning this war requires effective police/intelligence action, to kill or capture the jihadists. I call that ''the war on terrorists.'' In the long run, though, winning requires partnering with Arab and Muslim societies to help them build thriving countries, integrated with the world economy, where young people don't grow up in a soil poisoned by religious extremists and choked by petro-dictators so they can never realize their aspirations. I call this ''the war on terrorism.'' It takes a long time. 
 Our operation in Afghanistan after 9/11 was, for me, only about ''the war on terrorists.'' It was about getting bin Laden. Iraq was ''the war on terrorism'' -- trying to build a decent, pluralistic, consensual government in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world. Despite all we've paid, the outcome in Iraq remains uncertain. But it was at least encouraging to see last week's decision by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to run in the next election with a nonsectarian, multireligious coalition -- a rare thing in the Arab world.
 So, what President Obama is actually considering in Afghanistan is shifting from a ''war on terrorists'' there to a ''war on terrorism,'' including nation-building. I still have serious doubts that we have a real Afghan government partner for that. But if Mr. Obama decides to send more troops, the most important thing is not the number. It is his commitment to see it through. If he seems ambivalent, no one there will stand with us and we'll have no chance. If he seems committed, maybe -- maybe -- we'll find enough allies. Remember, the bad guys are totally committed -- and they are not tired.

HEADLINE: Exclusivity for All

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
 It's hard to overstate the degree to which habits of thrift and frugality have taken on the cast of virtue in the past year. There are different ways any given person can find to express these admirable traits, at least to him- or herself. For instance, you might decide not to buy a pair of designer shoes. Alternately, you might decide to buy a pair of designer shoes that has been marked down 50 percent. Abstaining can make you feel thrifty, frugal and (these days) admirable. Buying a bargain can make you feel all that, too. Plus you get new shoes. 
 Perhaps this is why there's an interesting footnote to the much-discussed troubles of luxury brands in this time of virtuous thrift: online sellers of the discounted stuff are ''flourishing,'' The Economist pointed out recently. These e-tailers -- like RueLaLa.com, Gilt.com, HauteLook.com and others -- position themselves as more than mere sources of heavily discounted high-end goods. For starters, they aim for an image of exclusivity, with ''invitation only'' setups and a strategy of preventing their wares from showing up in search-engine results (unlike established high-end e-tailers like BlueFly.com). And they amplify those elements of bargain-focused shopping that some people find fun and exciting (like time limits and unpredictable and quickly rotating supplies). The idea is an online version of the so-called sample sales that designer brands have conducted for years. 
 Gilt.com was founded in November 2007 by Alexis Maybank (who had worked at eBay) and Alexandra Wilkis Wilson (who had a fashion background). They had the sample-sale model in mind, according to Amanda Graber, manager of marketing and communications for the company. Per standard Webby procedure, their site was a democratization play, making available to far-flung consumers the kinds of deals determined luxury-bargain seekers in New York and Los Angeles take for granted. Many high-end brands prefer to imagine their customer base as something more aristocratic and initially resisted this new venue. But Gilt's membership grew as the recession's impact on shopping habits became clear and ''everyone was more willing to listen,'' Graber says.
 Gilt.com puts up merchandise in brand-specific batches grouped under the date and time the ''sale'' ends. Markdowns are prominently featured, but the stuff is not exactly cheap. A pair of Dolce & Gabbana shorts featured in late September cost $278, which really only sounds like a bargain if juxtaposed against the astounding $750 ''retail price.'' An Alberta Ferretti dress sold out after apparently being marked down from more than $8,000 -- but those who bought it paid around $2,400. In other words, it was expensive. 
 The setup is similar at RueLaLa.com, which went online in April 2008. Its product batches are called ''boutiques'' and feature a countdown clock showing the time slipping away before each 48-hour sale ends. Ben Fischman, the founder, characterizes this as part of the ''entertainment'' and ''theater'' of the site. Lately such sites are expanding beyond apparel to resort packages, gadgets and other goods and services.
 RueLaLa and Gilt each claim about 1.5 million ''members.'' Sure, the sites are by ''invitation only,'' but they encourage you to recruit your friends, even dangling incentives in the form of discount credit, and provide an ''invitation link'' to e-mail to everyone in your address book or paste onto your blog. It's thus pretty easy to Google your way to an ''invitation.'' (Both Gilt and RueLaLa offer the invitation-less a ''waiting list''; I gave that a shot and soon received the happy news that both had accepted me as a member.) ''Exclusivity doesn't mean small; it means special,'' Fischman contends. 
 The members-only notion is an old one, notes Ellen Ruppel Shell, author of the recent book ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture,'' and pairs up well with the always-appealing bargain idea. ''Once you become a member of a club,'' she observes, ''it makes you feel special, and it lowers your guard a little bit.'' Discounting sparks similar feelings, she continues. ''You often think you're the only one in the world that could have found this. Which is why you brag about it to your friends.'' There's a trade-off on these sites, of course: the air of clock-ticking excitement isn't exactly conducive to considered decisions. ''You have to be a very savvy consumer to do your shopping this way,'' Shell cautions.
 For luxury brands seeking a discreet way to move unsold inventory -- or even to find a new outlet at a time when department stores are behaving cautiously -- the appeal is obvious. But maybe that discretion also appeals to customers who figure that open enjoyment of shopping seems a little uncouth these days. To reverse Shell's formulation, it's easy to conclude that if you're shopping this way, you must be pretty savvy -- and maybe that virtuously thrifty feeling gives you license. ''You may think, Oh, I'm going to get a great pair of shoes today,'' suggests Stacey Santo, a vice president of RueLaLa, ''and then surprise yourself by walking away with a spa treatment.''

HEADLINE: Not Letting Up In Connecticut

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
There are 34 beds for the homeless at the Beth-El Center in Milford, and lately they have all been filled. 
 Toni Dolan, the executive director, said the requests for help began increasing when the recession hit, but that was many months ago. Even now, there is no sign that they are letting up. 
 ''People come to us very fractured and very stressed,'' she said. ''We try to give them a little breather.''
 Ms. Dolan and her staff try to steer people to the benefits that are available to them from the state, including food stamps and child care. The State Department of Social Services is a very good resource, but many people don't think to call. The Beth-El Center also has a soup kitchen and case management services, and they assist with resumes, jobs and housing.
 Milford is a small city, and the people who work in social services tend to know one another. Ms. Dolan said she has heard that more church staff members are finding people on their doorsteps, and that there is an increase in requests at the Red Cross, the United Way and smaller agencies. If one agency is unable to fill a request, the staff there will call to see if another agency can. 
 Ms. Dolan has even received calls from the mayor's office, whose staff has fielded requests all year from people who walk in.
 ''They'll call and say, 'We have someone here. Can you help?' '' she said. ''We all try to work together.''

HEADLINE: Offshore Haven Considers a Heresy, Taxation

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS, Jr.

DATELINE: GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands 

 BODY:
What happens to a tax haven when it has to raise taxes? The Cayman Islands may soon find out.
 Caught in a vise of shrinking revenue and stubbornly high public spending, the Caymans averted a fiscal crisis this week by securing a $60 million overseas loan.
 But the Foreign and Commonwealth office in Britain, which oversees the Caymans and can veto foreign lending requests, has delivered an ultimatum: The rest of the $284 million the Cayman government says it needs will not be forthcoming until this offshore financial center imposes spending cuts and considers some form of direct taxation on businesses here and its 57,000 residents. 
 For a tropical paradise that has never taxed income, property, corporate earnings, retail sales or capital gains, such a suggestion borders on heresy.
 The Caymans have built their prosperity less on tourism, like most other Caribbean islands, and more on serving as a tax-free home for 9,253 hedge funds and many more banks and companies that pay small fees to establish the Caymans as their official domicile while operating mostly elsewhere around the world. 
 With the explosion of global finance, the Cayman model flourished, and fees from financial institutions, together with tourism, made up as much as half of government revenue. Duties on imported goods accounted for the other half. 
 In June, the full effect of the financial crisis touched shore with the effect of a hurricane. A drop in financial and tourism revenue transformed a projected surplus into a deficit of about $100 million -- a huge gap for an annual budget of some $800 million -- and the leader of the Cayman government, W. McKeeva Bush, warned of a fiscal crisis. 
 Mr. Bush is desperately trying to find a way out of his quandary, caught between the demands of local business leaders to keep things the way they are and insistence from London that the economic model of the Cayman Islands must change.
 ''The U.K. has to be practical,'' he said, warning that too bold a new tax program could prompt Cayman-based financial firms to leave. ''They don't want me to go belly up.''
 Perhaps not, but there is no getting around the fact that the balmy days for exotic offshore financial centers like the Caymans could be coming to an end. 
 With pressure building in Europe and the United States for a systemwide crackdown on offshore tax havens -- the Caymans prefer to call themselves a tax-neutral portal -- Britain appears determined to make an example of a place that has become a symbol of secrecy and intrigue.
 Parts of ''The Firm,'' the John Grisham thriller about offshore skullduggery, were set in the Caymans, and during his campaign, President Obama referred to Ugland House in George Town, where about 19,000 companies are registered, as ''the biggest tax scam on record.''
 It is an image Mr. Bush, 54, is fighting hard to counter. He talks of a new transparency and points to the fact that the Caymans are now on the list of tax-neutral jurisdictions approved by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and has tax information accords with 12 countries.
 A wealthy businessman who made his fortune in real estate, he credits the tax-free policy for transforming the islands. A native of the Caymans, Mr. Bush recalls growing up in poverty and walking to school through a fog of mosquitoes so thick he could barely see. As a teenager, he worked on the construction crew that put up the building for Barclays in the 1960s, one of the first financial companies to arrive.
 ''There were no cars, no electricity -- there will be no going back to living under the coconut tree,'' he said in an interview in his government office in George Town, where his desk faces a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. ''The people have prospered -- this country was built on this model.'' 
 Now, he is fighting for it. 
 For five hours one day last week, he holed up in a hotel conference room just off a silky white stretch of beach. Fifty or so of the Caymans' business leaders told him that not only would they not accept any form of direct tax, but that they would also be unwilling to increase their fees unless Mr. Bush made sharp cuts to the well-paid civil service sector.
 Forced to step out of the meeting to take a call from an increasingly impatient British government, Mr. Bush held firm. 
 ''We have not agreed to any direct taxation,'' he said, his voice worn from negotiations that now consume his 14-hour workdays. 
 But he acknowledged the pickle he is in. ''It is a question of how much pain the people of Cayman and the business community will accept,'' he said.
 He does little to hide his frustration at having to take lectures from a ''pushy'' British government, which itself faces a debt burden approaching 80 percent of its economic output, on how to run the island's finances.
 But the situation in the Caymans is indeed dire: over the last four years, its debt has doubled to $600 million as previous governments embarked on a series of expensive education projects. 
 Already, the Caymans' difficulties are taking a toll. A construction company recently stopped work on a school, saying payments had been delayed (the government claims that bills have been paid), and rumors are rife that public employees will be forced to take a pay cut.
 ''Face it, this place is broke, and it is because the model is wrong,'' said Desmond Seales, the publisher of The Cayman Net News, a local newspaper. He cites as proof the fact that the government owes him $50,000 in advertising and printing costs. 
 But Mr. Seales is a lonely voice calling for the financial sector to pull more of its own weight.
 He points to the low $3,000 annual fee that multibillion-dollar hedge funds pay to register here (even Mr. Bush calls this figure ''ridiculously low''), and proposes a tiny tax on the trillions of dollars that he says flow in and out of the island on a daily basis. 
 But wouldn't that cause wealthy people to move their money elsewhere?
 ''Where the hell they going?'' he snorted. Yes, a recent upswing in crime is a problem, ''but people can still walk around with their jewelry. That is what brings all these hedge funds and offshore partnerships. They like to visit their money.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the possibility that the Cayman Islands, a tax haven, may have to impose taxes to close a budget gap misstated the date that the leader of the Cayman government, W. McKeeva Bush, was holed up in a hotel conference room for a meeting with business leaders. It was on Sept. 24, not ''late last week'' (the week of Sept. 27).

HEADLINE: On the Tip of Creative Tongues

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
THE Tipping Point, a store in Houston that calls itself a sneaker lifestyle shop, does not just sell a collection of differently colored rubber soles, along with books, music and apparel. No, its Web site declares, the store ''curates'' its merchandise.
 Promoters at Piano's, a nightclub on the Lower East Side, announced on their Web site that they will ''curate a night of Curious burlesque.'' 
 Eric Demby, a founder of the Brooklyn Flea swap meet, does not hire vendors to serve grilled cheese sandwiches, pickles and tamales to hungry shoppers. He ''personally curates the food stands,'' according to New York magazine.
 And to think, not so long ago, curators worked at museums. 
 The word ''curate,'' lofty and once rarely spoken outside exhibition corridors or British parishes, has become a fashionable code word among the aesthetically minded, who seem to paste it onto any activity that involves culling and selecting. In more print-centric times, the term of art was ''edit'' -- as in a boutique edits its dress collections carefully. But now, among designers, disc jockeys, club promoters, bloggers and thrift-store owners, curate is code for ''I have a discerning eye and great taste.'' 
 Or more to the point, ''I belong.''
 For many who adopt the term, or bestow it on others, ''it's an innocent form of self-inflation,'' said John H. McWhorter, a linguist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ''You're implying that there is some similarity between what you do and what someone with an advanced degree who works at a museum does.'' 
 Indeed, these days, serving as a guest curator of a design blog, craft fair or department store is an honor. Last month, Scott Schuman, creator of The Sartorialist, a photo blog about street fashion, was invited to curate a pop-up shop at Barneys New York. 
 The term ''curator'' was not intended to be hyperbole, said Tom Kalenderian, the men's fashion director for Barneys. Consulting closely with the photographer, a former fashion retailer, the store stocked just the right items to help shoppers achieve the elegant, eclectic look The Sartorialist regularly features on its site.
 ''It was precisely his eye'' that made the store want to partner with him, Mr. Kalenderian said. ''It was about the right shade of blue, about the cut, about the width of a lapel.'' 
 Curtis Macdonald, a Brooklyn musician, also says that ''curate'' precisely describes his job: hiring bands for a local site. 
 ''When given to opportunity to curate an evening of music, choosing the right bands is very similar to curating a museum,'' Mr. Macdonald explained in an e-mail message. ''Since I, the 'curator,' choose personnel based on a particular aesthetic, I am able to think of creative ways of presenting music beyond the traditional 'call-up a venue and ask for a gig' way of presenting.'' 
 Indeed, invoking the word can be good for one's image and business, said Karuna Tillmon James, 30, who has a background in fine-art photography and recently opened a consignment shop selling designer clothing in Brentwood, Calif. It's name: Curate Couture.
 ''I knew that people in the know would gravitate toward it,'' Ms. James said. The name signals that hers is not just another secondhand-clothing shop, she said, ''selling stuff that was gross and old and had been crammed in trunks for years. It would have very specific pieces, selected purposefully.'' 
 Summon the word ''curate,'' she added, and ''people know you're going to get it.'' 
 Pretentious? Maybe. But it's hardly unusual for members of less pedigreed professions to adopt the vernacular of more prestigious ones, said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 For instance, he said, the term ''associate'' originally tended to connote a partner or a work colleague who shared ''a position of authority with another,'' as the Oxford English Dictionary puts it. The description has expanded to include employees at all levels of the organization, including sales and customer service associates. 
 In the case of curate, which the Oxford dictionary simply defines as ''to look after and preserve,'' its standard ''museum'' meaning dominated until the mid-'90s, when references to curating hotel libraries and CD-of-the-month clubs started to pop up in periodicals, said Jesse Sheidlower, a lexicographer with the Oxford English Dictionary.
 After 2000, nontraditional usage of the word took off. And as it continues to grow in popularity, others must adopt it, too, or face the consequences. For example, if all the rival nightclub promoters are ''curating'' parties, Mr. Sheidlower said, you don't want to be the one left ''hosting'' one. 
 On the Web, the word -- and the concept -- have taken particular hold, not a surprise given the Internet clutter. Etsy, the shopping Web site devoted to handmade and vintage goods, routinely brings in shelter magazine editors, fashion designers and design bloggers to serve as ''guest curators.'' 
 Even news-aggregator Web sites, like Tina Brown's Daily Beast, promote themselves as cultural curators.
 ''The Daily Beast doesn't aggregate,'' Ms. Brown says in a statement on the site. ''It sifts, sorts, and curates. We're as much about what's not there as what is.'' 
 In fact, curatorship of photos culled from Flickr pages, or of knitted scarves on Etsy, can be an artistic pursuit in itself, said Virginia Postrel, a cultural critic and the author of ''The Substance of Style.'' 
 ''Because there are more things to put together,'' she said, ''the juxtapositions become a big part of the interesting experience of those things. It is a creative activity in itself.'' 
 The talent for choosing among countless objects is not very different from the work of collage artists -- or top D.J.s, explained Scott Plagenhoef, the editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, the music Web site. 
 ''Certainly things like structure, flow, revelation, juxtaposition and other elements of D.J.-ing and mixing are considered an art,'' said Mr. Plagenhoef, who served as an unpaid ''curator'' for the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in England. ''Remix culture is a form of creative expression in its own right.''
 And what of actual museum curators themselves? Are they offended by the democratization of their title? 
 ''Maybe the use of 'curate' to refer to extra-museum activities is just metaphorical, akin to the way we use the word 'doctor' as a verb,'' Laura Hoptman, a senior curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, wrote in an e-mail message. ''If we doctor a script, we are only theoretically operating on it.'' 
 ''It doesn't really bother me,'' she said of the trend. ''Actually, I'm hoping its popularity will spawn a reality television show -- maybe 'Top Curator'? ''

HEADLINE: Scattered In Suburbs, And in Need

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
IT is hard enough for the unemployed and others struggling financially to figure out how to obtain social services like food stamps, counseling and utility assistance for the first time. It can be even harder in the suburbs. 
 There, many residents, including middle-class people unversed in the welfare system, have trouble making use of the shelters, government offices and nonprofit agencies that are less visible than in cities, spread out across a larger area and harder to reach using public transportation.
 So needy people are commonly sharing rides, walking and riding buses, often with small children in tow, in larger numbers than before the recession, officials said. And for advice on how to get help in the first place, they are seeking out priests, school nurses and small-town mayors, turning them into de facto social workers. 
 Several months ago, Eleanor Glabicki was determined to help her 57-year-old son, Edward, who cannot hear and, with his modest pay from a factory job, had been unable to keep up with his electric bills.''I guess the government is supposed to help,'' said Mrs. Glabicki, 78, who lives in New Britain, Conn. ''But I didn't know how to do any of that.'' 
 Desperate, she wrote her son's name on a piece of paper and went to her church, where a secretary told her that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford had a special fund for people in need. After some paperwork and a few weeks, Catholic Charities sent the electric company a check for $1,000, and her son's power was turned back on. 
 Many people, even if they have figured out where to go for help, have trouble reaching it. In Suffolk County, people regularly share rides to get to the Ministries, an organization in Coram that provides groceries, temporary shelter and counseling. 
 ''Transportation is an issue for people out here,'' said Ann Moran-Smith, the executive director. ''There is a bus nearby, but buses out here don't service every area where people live. Lately, we do see more people whose cars are in need of repair, and they do not have the money to repair the cars. So they're getting rides from friends, or walking to get here.''
 There are other challenges. Food pantries, for example, are typically open only to people who live in a particular area. A New Rochelle resident could walk into a pantry in Yonkers and be turned down. 
 A survey by the Brookings Institution in 2004 found that low-income people in suburbs are typically farther away from social service providers than people in cities. A resident in a high-poverty area in Washington, for example, would be close to an average of five job training providers and six food assistance providers. The same resident in suburban Washington, the survey said, would typically not be near even one of those providers.
 ''You have to go a lot farther than you do in a city,'' said Lawrence Levy, the executive director of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, who is planning a study on how people obtain social services in wealthy ZIP codes. 
 He added that social workers in large urban areas are often more skilled than those in the suburbs, in part because they have more experience with needy populations. But state governments do try. 
 Connecticut and New Jersey each have 2-1-1 hot lines for people seeking information on government services. On the 211 Web site for Connecticut, there is a 28-page document that was created in January, ''Where to Turn in Connecticut When You Become Unemployed,'' outlining options for welfare, food stamps, eviction prevention and legal assistance. 
 Officials from the United Way of Connecticut, which administers the state's 211 line, said more than 275,000 people have called for help in the last year, a 7.4 percent increase over the year before. The sharpest increases were in requests for food stamps and financial assistance, and for help in staving off foreclosures. 
 Employees who take calls at 211 said many people are referred to the service after confiding in doctors, neighbors or family members that they need help. 
 But others are reluctant to call the number, or are unaware that it exists.
 ''I think people don't know what's out there,'' said Christine Lidz, the clinical director at Bridges, a treatment center in Milford, Conn., for people with mental health or drug problems. 
 She treated one low-income man whose teeth were rotting, for example. ''He had no idea he could get free medical care and free dental care,'' she said. ''His teeth were falling out of his head. My heart broke for him.'' 
 Barbara Butler, the director of the Department of Human Services in Westport, Conn., said she often saw people who were referred by concerned school nurses. ''They are often the ones who know when kids and families are having problems,'' Ms. Butler said. 
 In Milford, a coastal city of 50,000 people, the mayor's office has become a clearinghouse for people who arrive unannounced, distraught and asking for help. 
 ''They come in off the street,'' said Mayor James L. Richetelli Jr., who, along with his assistant and two secretaries, counsels these visitors. ''When people don't know where to go, they will pick up the phone or just stop in.''
 One mother of two teenagers walked in recently because she was on the verge of losing her home. Mr. Richetelli sat with her for a half-hour, helped arrange food vouchers and emergency shelter, and then hugged her goodbye.
 Older people who are running out of money have come to the mayor's office for help paying for utilities or prescriptions. 
 ''Sometimes people may not even have the money to get a ride to a doctor's appointment,'' Mr. Richetelli said. ''We're seeing people who are right on the edge.'' 
 Some people must knock on several doors before they find what they need. Jeanette Diaz, a mother from West Hartford, said she had fallen behind on her mortgage and utility bills, both because of illness and because the recession had shrunk the commissions she got from her full-time job selling furniture. 
 Ms. Diaz, 47, drove to a charity center for help, but she was told she was not eligible because her income was too high. She went to another charitable group, but they said they were too low on funds to help her.
 ''I was so frustrated,'' she said. ''There I was, driving around, and I was just being led from one place to another. I was just giving up at that point.'' 
 Ms. Diaz ended up going to her parish priest, who referred her to the emergency fund run by Catholic Charities. That group paid a month of her mortgage, $1,700, and that was all she needed, she said, to get back on her feet.

HEADLINE: Happy Journey Of an Actor As Tragic Hero

BYLINE: By MONICA DRAKE

 BODY:
JOHN DOUGLAS THOMPSON was making a comfortable living as a marketing representative for a software company in Wallingford, Conn., when he invited a date to Yale Rep's production of August Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone.'' She ended up changing his life, but not in a way that he expected.
 ''She didn't show up,'' Mr. Thompson said recently at the Irish Repertory Theater, where he was rehearsing for the lead part in the Eugene O'Neill play ''The Emperor Jones,'' opening Oct. 18. Rather than focusing on the vacant seat next to him, he kept his eyes trained on the stage.
 ''It was this representation of nobility, a towering play with incredible characters; the story had a humanity to it,'' he said of the play, the second live theatrical performance he'd ever seen. By the time the curtain closed, he said, he realized, ''This represents what I want to do.'' 
 More than two decades, a Trinity Rep training program, several screen credits and countless regional theater roles later, Mr. Thompson, 46, has become a Shakespeare specialist, winning Obie and Lucille Lortel awards this year for his portrayal of Othello with Theater for a New Audience. Now he is trading the Elizabethan verse for the 20th-century argot of Brutus Jones, an African-American serving time for murder who escapes to a Caribbean island and installs himself as its ruler.
 ''What happens to a man -- or a person -- when they go off the grid?'' Mr. Thompson said of the character. ''The psychological study of what happens to him, how a person does that, why do they do that, and what are the ramifications of that behavior -- that kind of interested me.''
 That Brutus Jones's journey drew him to the role is no surprise. Mr. Thompson's life has been a series of voyages.
 Born in Bath, England, to Jamaican parents, he and his mother, father, two sisters and a brother moved to Montreal when he was a toddler and then to Rochester, where his father worked as a technician for Bausch & Lomb and his mother was a nurse. After attending a Jesuit high school, Mr. Thompson went on to LeMoyne College in Syracuse, where he studied marketing and business. He found a job at a company (soon to become Unisys) that provided computer software to financial institutions, and his path seemed clear.
 ''I didn't feel passionate about it,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''so much as, 'This is what I'm supposed to be doing?' ''
 Until he saw ''Joe Turner.'' Even though the play ignited a theretofore unknown passion, it took Mr. Thompson a few years -- and a healthy severance package from Unisys -- to muster the nerve to pursue acting as a profession. Without any training, he nailed his first audition, at 29, for the lead role in a contemporary African-American version of ''Hamlet'' in Boston. Though his early success finding work only reinforced his decision, Mr. Thompson faced long stretches of unemployment, he said. ''I ate a lot of Ramen Pride,'' he recalled, ''and pasta.''
 But he never reconsidered his mission.
 ''I was scared because it was like throwing away this career I had, going into the unknown,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But the drive for me to figure this out and discover it was more powerful than the reality of 'Well, John, you've got to get another job.' '' 
 He eventually gained enough acting jobs to settle in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
 Mr. Thompson is more cautious than his career change would suggest. His resume reveals that he has stuck close to Shakespeare, whose roles provide what he called the equivalent of ''learning to drive.'' He trained at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass., where Tina Packer, that theater's founding artistic director, said he had natural stage presence but stood out for ''a kind of searching intelligence.''
 Mr. Thompson went on to appear there on the main stage in Shakespeare as well as in contemporary works, including John Patrick Shanley's ''Dreamer Examines His Pillow'' last summer. He has also performed in modern classics like ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' on Broadway and ''Hedda Gabler'' at the New York Theater Workshop.
 But his military bearing, soaring voice and unaffected reading of 400-year-old prose all lend themselves so well to Shakespeare that directors can't be faulted for typecasting. Mr. Thompson estimated that he has been Othello four or five times -- including performances this past summer and the one before at Shakespeare & Company -- and said the decision to play Brutus Jones was not an easy one. 
 ''The Emperor Jones,'' essentially a dramatization of the inner workings of the title character's mind, has a mixed history. Its first staging, in 1920, was considered groundbreaking for its use of Charles Gilpin, an African-American, in the title role rather than a white actor in blackface. But it later was criticized for presenting a gross stereotype, so much so that the decision by the Wooster Group during the '90s to return to the conventions of the '20s and use a white actor -- albeit a woman in blackface -- was received with little outcry. 
 The producing director of the Irish Rep, Ciaran O'Reilly, said it took a long time for Mr. Thompson to commit to the project. ''He drove me crazy,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''I was like, 'How can you not do it?' ''
 Eventually, after a scholarly investigation of O'Neill's influences -- expressionism, Jung, perhaps Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness'' -- Mr. Thompson signed on. For Mr. O'Reilly, it was worth the wait. ''He's what I think is one of the great actors we have,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''He's absolutely willing to do anything and to try anything.''
 At a recent rehearsal Mr. Thompson literally threw himself into the action, falling onto the floor with thuds of varying intensity as the cast found its way through a pivotal scene. Navigating through the loose rehearsal process provided him room to roam around the mind of the playwright and the character he created.
 Later, after rehearsal, he referred to this task almost reverentially. ''It's that journey of discovery; you know what I mean,'' he said, his voice trailing off.

HEADLINE: 10 Steps to Victory in Afghanistan End Suicide Attacks

 BODY:
TO win in Afghanistan, the United States and its allies must prevent the rise of a new generation of anti-American terrorists, particularly suicide terrorists. 
 The metric for measuring this threat is not the amount of territory controlled by the Taliban or Al Qaeda, but the number of people willing to be recruited as suicide terrorists. These individuals are motivated not by the existence of a terrorist sanctuary, but by deep anger at the presence of foreign forces on land they prize. 
 This is why the number of suicide attacks in Afghanistan, overwhelmingly against military targets, has skyrocketed as United States and NATO forces have increasingly occupied the country from 2006 on. There were nine attacks in 2005, 97 in 2006, 142 in 2007, 148 in 2008 and more than 60 in the first six months of this year. 
 It is imperative to decrease the number of suicide attacks. Given the ethnic divisions of the country, our best tactic is to use political and economic means to empower local Pashtuns to feel that they have greater autonomy from both Taliban and Western domination, and less need to respond violently. 
 A similar strategy toward Sunni groups in Anbar Province reduced anti-American suicide terrorism in Iraq and is our best way forward in Afghanistan. 
 -- ROBERT A. PAPE, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and the author of ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''

NURTURESHOCK
 New Thinking About Children
 By Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman
 336 pp. Twelve. $24.99
 As if we needed yet another indicator of economic collapse, note that the men who once chronicled financial high jinks have turned to baby sling strategy and sibling rivalry. First Michael Lewis, author of ''Liar's Poker,'' hit the best-seller list with a memoir about the perils (and awww, rewards) of being a dad. Now Po Bronson, who made his name novelizing Bay Area bond trading and Silicon Valley upstarts, has come out with a book on child-rearing. 
 But not just any book! ''NurtureShock,'' with its Toffleresque title, promises to revolutionize parenthood with ''New Thinking About Children.'' According to Bronson and his co-writer, Ashley Merryman, who runs a church-based tutoring program for urban youth, ''nurture shock'' is the panic common to new parents that ''the mythical fountain of knowledge is not magically kicking in.'' It's that gut-pummeling doubt that hits the moment you bring your first child home from the hospital-- ''They let us keep this thing?'' -- and snowballs from there. Such feelings of inadequacy, the authors suggest, are justified. But, as they write with deeply felt earnestness, ''small corrections in our thinking today could alter the character of society long term, one future-citizen at a time.''
 The key, outlined in 10 deftly organized chapters, is to ignore common assumptions about children in favor of the latest social science, much of it counterintuitive. Think it's best for 10th-grade slackers to high-tail it to school at 7 a.m.? Wrong! Let them sleep in, say the prevailing studies on teenagers and sleep. Believe that reading the Berenstain Bears and other turgid ''pro-social'' stories will make your kindergartner more genial? They're actually more likely to inspire in her new ways of tormenting her little brother. 
 Based on a pair of Bronson's high-profile cover stories for New York magazine, which applied similarly brazen titles (''Learning to Lie,''''How Not to Talk to Your Kids'') to academic research of the past two decades, the book is perhaps less revolutionary about parenthood than it is revelatory about books on parenthood. That sounds weighty and abstruse, so as Bronson and Merryman might phrase it, let me ''unpack'' what I mean. 
 Ann Hulbert, author of ''Raising America,'' could easily lend a hand. As Hulbert made clear in her 2003 history of parenting advice, each generation of parents falls sway if not to a singular sanctified Dr. Spock, then to a bevy of conflicting sages. (The current generation is likely to be remembered as that of Drs. Sears and Brazelton on the child-centered side, John Rosemond on the parent-centric side, and Jenny McCarthy and Tori Spelling on the Hollywood-mommy fringe.) Whereas others may call upon medical training, paternal wisdom or been-there-done-that motherhood, Bronson and Merryman, having ''parsed through the science and reviewed the evidence,'' appeal to scientific reason -- just as, Hulbert writes, experts more than a century ago first urged the scientific and systematic study of children. 
 What comes around goes around, goes away and then comes back. In a chapter on overpraise, the authors describe laboratory studies in which children, having taken an initial test and then been praised for their intelligence, fared worse in follow-up rounds, while children who were instead commended for their effort challenged themselves further and performed better over all. Frequent and oft-undeserved rewards in the form of praise, the authors caution, deprive a child of motivation and discourage persistence. ''It's a neurobiological fact,'' they write, pointing to studies of M.R.I. scans and trained rodents. True, but far from new. Albeit without the sci-techy benefit of brain imaging, in 1964, ''Children: The Challenge,'' a popular manual of the day, warned, ''Praise, as a means of encouragement, must be used very cautiously.'' It can be ''dangerous'' if a child sees praise as a reward and ''could easily lead to discouragement,'' the author, Rudolf Dreikurs, noted.
 Still, much of the research here on the upkeep of children is interesting and worthwhile. (And what new parent has the fortitude to sift through academic journals?) Several studies, for example, demonstrate that the more children are threatened with punishment, the more they lie and the better they get at it. In one, kids who attend a traditional colonial school in western Africa, where teachers frequently slap children for misdeeds, were especially likely to lie progressively more in order to avoid the consequences. Another study found that reading ''The Boy Who Cried Wolf'' increased children's likelihood of lying, while a book on George Washington and the cherry tree decreased it dramatically. And not because kids revere Washington -- the students in the study were Canadian.
 One of the most valuable chapters looks at how white parents deal with race. For those who think it best to describe Caucasians as ''pinkish white'' and blacks as ''brown skinned'' (raise your hands, Upper West Siders), recent research delivers a strong rebuke. Pretending race doesn't exist leaves young children to form their own -- often racist -- opinions. A chapter on early childhood testing delivers similarly distressing and critical news. Bronson and Merryman do parents a service by calling attention to studies that seldom make their way into the media.
 But to judge from these pages, the authors are a bit too enthralled with their academic sources. Their penchant for describing psychological studies and research projects as if they were chemistry experiments, with phrases like ''the test of scientific analysis'' and ''the science of peer relations,'' conjure up the image of Thomas Dolby repeatedly exhorting ''Science!'' Let's face it -- even if, as the authors suggest, ''preschoolers' E.F. capability can be measured with simple computerized tests,'' chances are, this year's E.F. (''executive function'') will be tomorrow's E.Q. (''emotional intelligence''), which the authors deride as an unreliable predictor of academic achievement or adult success.
 No doubt we'll worry about that later. For now, Bronson is, above all, a brilliant packager of books about what people care about most: themselves. As he did in ''What Should I Do With My Life?,'' his 2002 best seller, Bronson has adroitly polished a fairly unoriginal subject into high-gloss pop psychology. This isn't the big news of the day, but the small, consequential news that affects our daily lives; it's the stuff of breakfast shows and private-school parenting seminars. It's ''What Should I Do With My Kids?'' And isn't that all about me, anyway?

HEADLINE: What the Bottom Line Hides

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
INVESTORS are always told to focus on a company's profit, or bottom line. And sure enough, a big reason for the recent stock market surge is a spate of better-than-expected earnings reports. 
 Nearly three-quarters of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 that have already announced quarterly results have beaten analysts' forecasts. That comes on the heels of a first quarter in which nearly two-thirds of the index companies surpassed expectations. 
 But on their own, profit upgrades may not paint an accurate portrait of the economy's health. Sometimes, the way a company generated its profit is at least as important as the earnings themselves. And on that score, the recent record isn't as impressive. 
 So far this year, nearly all of the earnings improvements have been achieved through major cost-cutting efforts. Overall selling and administrative costs among S.& P. 500 companies fell 5.7 percent in the second quarter versus the period a year earlier, according to a recent report by David J. Kostin, the chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. 
 This represents far more drastic cuts than were undertaken in the recessions of 1991 and 2001.
 Still, ''you can only cut so much,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P. ''At some point, you need to start seeing the business actually grow. You need to see increased sales'' -- sometimes called ''top line'' growth. 
 That's why Mr. Silverblatt says that revenue -- not earnings -- ''will be the most important number for investors to watch.''
 Thus far, sales have been slow to rebound. While overall S.& P. 500 earnings are still falling on a year-over-year basis, for example, the rate of decline has begun to slow, according to figures compiled by Thomson Reuters. 
 By contrast, declines in S.& P. 500 sales are picking up speed, according to S. & P. After slumping 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and nearly 17 percent in the first quarter this year, corporate revenue tumbled nearly 20 percent in the second quarter. 
 The revenue declines are even more staggering on a dollar basis. From June 2008 to June 2009, revenue of the 500 companies tumbled by a total of $1.15 trillion. ''That's more than the entire fiscal stimulus,'' Mr. Silverblatt said.
 To be sure, aggressive cutting of expenses will ultimately improve corporate profitability when revenue recovers. ''Once sales kick in, this will have a leveraged effect on earnings,'' says Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
 But Mr. Ablin does not expect a turnaround in corporate sales until at least the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2010. 
 And it could easily take more time than that. Historically, revenue is one of the last indicators to recover after an economic downturn. 
 A recent analysis by Ned Davis Research, the investment-consulting firm in Venice, Fla., found that sales typically hit a trough three months after earnings do -- or nine months after a recession ends. There is a reason for that: It is the cost-cutting that actually helps stem the slide in earnings within a recession. ''Eventually, as the economy recovers, sales take the baton and earnings growth moves more in lock step with revenue growth,'' says Ed Clissold, a senior global analyst at Ned Davis.
 Assuming that the recession has just ended, this means S.& P. 500 sales might not start to recover until next July. 
 Keep in mind that revenue doesn't always heal exactly nine months after the economy does. A full year after the 2001 recession ended, sales among companies in the S.& P. 500 -- minus the financial sector -- were still shrinking by around 6 percent.
 Moreover, in the last big downturn, at the start of this decade, revenue declined for seven consecutive quarters. If the market were in store for a similar sales drought, revenue might not start expanding again until the start of the third quarter of next year. 
 Of course, not all economic sectors will be affected equally. Goldman Sachs analysts are forecasting that three segments of the economy are likely to see a quick recovery and significant sales growth in 2010. These are energy, where sales are expected to grow 17 percent; technology, 7 percent; and materials, 6 percent.
 Those sectors also happen to be the three areas of the market that derive the highest percentage of sales overseas. In fact, all three generate at least half their revenue from foreign markets. 
 Besides looking abroad, companies are also scrambling to find other creative ways to build sales. This could be a reason for the recent uptick in merger-and-acquisition activity.
 ''You can try to increase your sales organically, which can take some time,'' Mr. Silverblatt says. ''Or you can buy sales growth.'' That seems to be the path that many companies are taking.

HEADLINE: Life's Travels For a Father And a Son

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BEN, my oldest of four children, recently left for his senior year of college. Usually he flies and there's a hurried, confused, curbside goodbye at the airport. This time was different. He was driving the 17 hours to Chicago and our goodbye, in front of the house, felt longer, sadder, more final.
 We'd given him our '98 Volvo station wagon with 168,000 miles. It's a tradition. Some families set up trusts for their children when they graduate; my parents gave me the '68 Chevy Nova with 100,000 miles on it.
 The Volvo was crammed, and Ben, an avid surfer, had lashed his longboard on the roof. It's one of the things I love about him: he's sure he'll find waves in Chicago. 
 Before giving him the car, I took it to our mechanic, Phil Kleyn. An engineer in Ukraine before emigrating, he can keep any car on the road. Phil put on two new axles, a tie rod, two used rear tires and pronounced the Volvo ready.
 ''Mikey, call me when he gets to Chicago,'' Phil said.
 ''The car's going to be all right?'' I asked.
 ''Sure, Mikey, fine, fine'' Phil said. ''Just call me -- you know.'' 
 Ben had been around all summer, but he was never around. Six days a week, he'd work nine-hour shifts as a lifeguard at our Long Island beach. Afterward, he'd stop by the house to eat enormous quantities of food (yet remain criminally skinny), then stay out way past my bedtime. If he had a day off, he'd go into New York City. If he had two days, he'd head to Boston, and five was enough to see Charleston, S.C.; Wilmington, N.C.; Washington and Philadelphia. (''We only spent an hour in Philly, Dad, but my friend showed us around and we got a pretty good feel for it.'')
 Occasionally he'd sleep 16 hours and wonder why he was tired.
 My wife and I tried getting him to go to a movie with us, but he was way too busy. Or he was certain ''Julie & Julia'' wasn't going to be his kind of film. Or he'd heard that ''500 Days of Summer'' was terrific, but the lifeguards were having their third-to-last barbecue of the summer and he really couldn't miss it.
 Starting in mid-August, I asked if, before he left, he would trim the high hedges around our house, a big job. I bought new electric clippers so he could do it right. His college is on the trimester system and he doesn't start until late September. ''Right after Labor Day, when I stop lifeguarding,'' he said.
 After Labor Day, he was going to do it the second week of September, right after his last friends went back to college.
 Two nights before he was to leave, I'm not sure if I was lucky or I made my own luck, but he actually had availability and the two of us went to the Japanese restaurant in town.
 Dinner was fun. He did all the ordering. We each had a couple of beers and I loosened up. We talked about the family, compared notes on the friends he'd brought to visit that summer, joked about the odds of the hedges ever being cut or the Volvo making it out of Pennsylvania.
 It was wonderful and surprising how quickly that feeling of closeness -- present daily until they become teenagers -- came flooding back.
 I found myself wishing the spicy tuna platter would last forever. I wanted to say something he might remember, but I have had so little success the few times I've tried meaningful talks with my kids. When I tried having the sex talk with Ben when he was in the eighth grade, he was so flustered, I realized it was too early. And when I tried again with Ben in the 10th grade, it was too late. ''Don't worry about it, Dad, I'm fine,'' he told me.
 When he was deciding where to spend his junior year of college abroad, I gave him my talk about having never mastered another language myself and always regretting it, and urged him to pick a Spanish-speaking country. After listening passively through months of follow-up e-mail messages, he finally sent his response: ''Dad, you love Spain so much, you go.'' 
 The photos he posted on Facebook of surfing Australia's east coast were lovely.
 What can a father tell an almost-grown son that might be useful? Does one generation have anything worth telling the next?
 I don't have a clue why, but I told him not to be in a rush to marry. I told him I was glad I'd waited, that a man can wait until he's 35 and still be married 50 years, which seems to be more than enough for everyone involved.
 He appeared to be listening so I told him while he's young to be with lots of women so when he did marry, he wouldn't feel as if he was missing anything. We both howled. I sounded like the twisted grandfather played by Alan Arkin in ''Little Miss Sunshine.'' 
 And I told him the truth, that when I was single I'd never had much luck having casual affairs without creating emotional messes.
 I told him the reason to marry is to have children.
 ''Are you glad you had kids?'' he asked me. We were walking back to the car by then. I told him it was the best thing I'd ever done.
 He'll be heading out into the worst economy since the Great Depression. When I ask his plans, he's vague. He's been a psychology major and has thought about eventually working in mental health. He mentions Teach for America. He's tired of hunting whitecaps on Lake Michigan and wants to live on a coast again.
 Though his grades are good, he's not applying to law, medical or business schools, as many of his friends are. I admire him for not grabbing at the surest thing. He wants to travel (he says maybe to a Spanish-speaking country this time!) and is happy to work menial jobs for a while. He'll probably be a lifeguard next summer, save his money, then go. I have a lot of confidence in his practical sense and work ethic. He got his first job when he was 12, rising at 5 a.m. to assemble the Sunday papers at the corner deli. He applied for a job as a lifeguard on his very first day of college, and has worked each year at the campus pool.
 In the brief moments when I glimpsed him flashing by this summer, I was happy to see he always had a book. He seems to be a lifelong learner, which is what I want most for my children. He seems to understand that the real learning comes after college.
 He was planning on leaving midday Friday, to get out of New York before the afternoon rush hour. He'd been up late doing his laundry and packing the Volvo the night before. He absolutely swore he'd have time to do the hedges that morning before he left.
 Friday morning it was pouring. Cats and dogs. ''Can't do the hedges in this,'' he said. I nodded. ''Sorry,'' he said. I nodded. No point in having him electrocuted. He handed me his eyeglasses. He didn't have time to get them fixed. There were photos he was having printed, that he didn't have time to pick up; medicine that he'd ordered that hadn't arrived.
 ''I'll put together a box and mail it,'' I said.
 Standing in the driveway in the rain, I told him not to push the Volvo too much, and we hugged. I should be used to it by now, but I'm always caught off guard by the prickliness of the stubble on my three sons' cheeks when we kiss goodbye.
 As I said, the boy has common sense. He broke the trip into three legs, stopping overnight to see friends in Binghamton, N.Y., and Cleveland. When he reached Chicago, he called. As promised, I called Phil at the garage.
 ''Thanks God,'' Phil said.
 ''You told me the car was safe,'' I said.
 ''Of course, of course, Mikey, everything was good, but thanks God.''

HEADLINE: Shoppers' Shifting Priorities

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
LAST year, consumers pulled back on spending and the retail sector suffered. But not all retailers are faring worse than they did a few years ago. 
 After years of steady increases, sales of luxury goods have generally declined. But in several sectors, spending hasn't paused. 
 Against a baseline of spending levels in 2003, sales in computer stores have continued to rise. Restaurant and liquor-store sales are at much higher levels, and purchases at warehouse stores are up nearly 50 percent. 
 Still, in major retail divisions like home furnishings and clothing, sales faltered in 2007 and are now below their levels of 2003.

Warehouse stores: Growth outstripped other sectors as Americans sought to save money by making purchases in bulk.

Department stores: The slow decline in sales started well before the economic slump. More customers chose boutiques and big boxes over the department-store middle ground.
 Auto dealers: After falling sharply from mid-2007, sales at dealerships have started to recover.(Source: Census Bureau's Monthly Retail Trade Survey)

HEADLINE: Big Is Beautiful

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IN a year of doom and gloom, the granite postmodern towers overlooking Central Park at 15 Central Park West at West 62nd Street have been a beacon of hope for the battered luxury real estate market in Manhattan.
 So far this year, as sales stalled across the city, owners of eight of the 201 apartments (there are also 30 staff suites) in the building have sold their units at prices 38 percent above the original closing prices of August 2007, when the building opened, city property records show. That works out to a cumulative gain of $21.9 million, judging by property records filed through the middle of last week. 
 Now, brokers say that with the larger Manhattan market no longer in free fall, interest is quickening in the building's largest and most expensive apartments with the best views. This includes the recent $37 million sale of a 5,276-square-foot four-bedroom penthouse on the 40th floor, with views of Central Park, the Hudson River and the George Washington Bridge. 
 That price makes the apartment one of the five or six most expensive condos ever traded in Manhattan -- and the third highest sale yet at 15 Central Park West, even taking into account far larger units. The price works out to more than $7,000 a square foot.
 Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, paid $42.4 million, or $6,287 a square foot, for a full-floor penthouse atop the tower facing Central Park, widely regarded as the most luxurious apartment in the building. Mr. Weill signed a contract in May 2006 and closed at the end of August 2007. 
 That doesn't mean that 15 Central Park West hasn't been the scene of some disappointments during the downturn. Gotham Makker, an investor and former portfolio manager at the Citadel Investment Group, sold a 28th-floor apartment at an $800,000 loss in August, according to property records. He bought it in spring 2008, at the peak of the Manhattan market, for $13.3 million, nearly double the original sale price of the year before.
 And the visions of $100 million apartments in the building have been dashed, at least for the time being, by the recession. Richard Wallgren, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, who represented the developers in the original sales, was needled by other brokers when an $80 million listing he posted last year at 15 Central Park West was cut to ''only'' $47 million in February, possibly the largest price cut ever.
 It turns out Mr. Wallgren was overreaching even with that price. But the apartment has sold for $37 million, according to brokers briefed on the transaction, and the chuckles have died down. The seller was identified as Amit Ben-Haim, a London investor who in 1999 made a fortune through the $400 million sale to Johnson & Johnson of an Israeli medical device company founded by his brother.
 The apartment has five and a half bathrooms, and the sale price includes a separate 1,100-square-foot ground-floor apartment for employees or a home office. Brokers say that a smaller high-floor apartment has also gone into contract recently for a price well over $20 million. 
 ''The building is uniquely positioned, better than any other building in Manhattan, to go up in price,'' said Ryan Sherman, a broker and a principal at Metropolitan Residential Partners, who recently sold two apartments there. ''Anything above the lower floors that was always desirable is continuing to rise in value.''
 Last month, Mr. Sherman represented Bruce Kaye, a real estate executive with interests in Atlantic City, in the sale of his 2,367-square-foot two-bedroom apartment on the 32nd floor for $11.7 million, or nearly $5,000 a square foot. Mr. Kaye and his wife, Deborah, bought the apartment in April 2008 for $7.8 million, and realized a gain of 50 percent in 17 months. The purchaser was an international shipping executive, brokers said.

HEADLINE: Star Marshal

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
WHEN times are tough, the tough get going: There are people to evict, judgments to collect, wages to garnish, property to seize and sell. So the worst of times can be the best of times for a group of independent contractors known as New York City marshals, who are authorized to keep a nickel of every dollar they collect. 
 The best, or worst, of the city marshals last year was Martin A. Bienstock, who earned $5.4 million, more than any other marshal, through a variety of fees and the 5 percent assessment known as poundage.
 So partly as a result of the dire economy, Mr. Bienstock was able to step up in the world. Property records show that he paid $3.16 million for a three-bedroom apartment on the 17th floor of the Lucida, a new 21-story limestone and glass condominium at Lexington Avenue and 85th Street. 
 The Lucida offers its residents filtered fresh air, and a fitness and spa center with a ''sky-lit'' indoor pool, according to a building Web site.
 Mr. Bienstock's marshal's office is in a squat two-story office building on Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens, far from his new LEED-certified nest on the Upper East Side. Mr. Bienstock and his lawyer did not return several telephone calls, and the Department of Investigation, which oversees the marshals, declined to confirm that he was the purchaser of the apartment.
 But in closing documents, Mr. Bienstock, who is 62, gave his address as 300 East 85th Street, a 37--story co-op built in the 1980s at Second Avenue, and he used that same address in making campaign contributions to city, state and federal candidates or committees, listing his occupation as city marshal. That apartment on East 85th, records show, is owned by Gregg Bienstock, who is 29, and according to the Department of Investigation, is also a city marshal who shares the Bell Boulevard office with a Martin Bienstock. 
 Last year the younger Mr. Bienstock took home $1.66 million, according to city records.
 Diane Struzzi, a spokeswoman for the Department of Investigations, declined to comment on the relationship between the two Bienstocks, but noted that city marshals are appointed by the mayor to five-year terms, upon recommendation of a review committee. 
 She said marshals pay their own expenses. They also pay a fee of 4.5 percent of their proceeds to the city.
 In addition to his city duties, the elder Mr. Bienstock has a Web site devoted to his photographs. According to the site, he has been a marshal for 32 years and began taking pictures while serving in the First Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam, as a way of ''making sense of the chaos'' around him.
 His photographs show tranquil Western landscapes and peeling and rusting scenes of the Old West. There are no images of the bustling chaos of New York City. Perhaps the view from his new 17th-story abode will inspire him.

HEADLINE: Last of the Great Cities

BYLINE: Compiled by THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
LAST OF THE GREAT CITIES
 Too bad for Chicago that Norman Mailer, who died in 2007, wasn't on the International Olympic Committee last week. Here's what he had to say about the Windy City in ''Miami and the Siege of Chicago,'' published in 1968:
 Chicago is the great American city. New York is one of the capitals of the world and Los Angeles is a constellation of plastic, San Francisco is a lady, Boston has become Urban Renewal, Philadelphia and Baltimore and Washington wink like dull diamonds in the smog of Eastern Megalopolis, and New Orleans is unremarkable past the French Quarter. Detroit is a one-trade town, Pittsburgh has lost its golden triangle, St. Louis has become the golden arch of the corporation, and nights in Kansas City close early. The oil depletion allowance makes Houston and Dallas naught but checkerboards for this sort of game. But Chicago is a great American city. Perhaps it is the last of the great American cities. 
 A DANGEROUS BEAUTY
 Larry Rohter, a reporter for The New York Times, was based for a time in Rio de Janeiro, which last week beat out Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. In advance of the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio, he offered this advice to visitors in an article in the paper's Travel section:
 Nestled between verdant mountains and an azure sea, Rio is without question a stunning site for the games, and more than $1.5 billion has gone into the preparations, including the new 45,000-seat Joao Havelange Stadium. But as hospitable as the city can be, it is not without problems for visitors, particularly when it comes to safety. 
 It is no secret that Rio is crime-ridden and quite violent, and becoming more so: the heavily-armed gangs that control the hillside squatter slums known as favelas are growing increasingly bolder in their assaults and threats, even in the city's most elite neighborhoods. 
 Brazilian authorities have sought to dampen concerns about security and the possibility of terrorism during the games with a pledge of intense patrolling of the city by units that will include both the police and the armed forces. They note that in 1992, when the United Nations sponsored a global meeting on the environment in Rio, the event went off without incident despite predictions of a crime wave ... 
 Nevertheless, wherever you are in Rio, it pays to be careful and to observe certain basic safety precautions. Do not flaunt jewelry or expensive cameras and video equipment, especially on the beach. For those who do not speak Portuguese, it is also advisable to move about in groups rather than alone, preferably with a local guide or translator.
 THE CONSEQUENCES OF ONLINE COLLEGE
 Kevin Carey examines the promise of online education in The Washington Monthly:
 The day is coming -- sooner than many people think -- when a great deal of money is going to abruptly melt out of the higher education system, just as it has in scores of other industries that traffic in information that is now far cheaper and more easily accessible than it has ever been before. Much of that money will end up in the pockets of students in the form of lower prices, a boon and a necessity in a time when higher education is the key to prosperity. Colleges will specialize where they have comparative advantage, rather than trying to be all things to all people. A lot of silly, too-expensive things -- vainglorious building projects, money-sucking sports programs, tenured professors who contribute little in the way of teaching or research -- will fade from memory, and won't be missed. 
 But other parts of those institutions will be threatened too -- vital parts that support local communities and legitimate scholarship, that make the world a more enlightened, richer place to live. Just as the world needs the foreign bureaus that newspapers are rapidly shutting down, it needs quirky small university presses, Mughal textile historians, and people who are paid to think deep, economically unproductive thoughts ... There is an unstable, treacherous future ahead for institutions that have been comfortable for a long time. Like it or not, that's the higher education world to come.
 TWILIGHT OF THE POLYMATHS
 In Intelligent Life magazine, Edward Carr explores why polymaths, or what passes for them nowadays -- say, a Richard Posner or an Umberto Eco -- aren't the Leonardo da Vinci-esque achievers of yore:
 It is not only the explosion of knowledge that puts polymaths at a disadvantage, but also the vast increase in the number of specialists and experts in every field. This is because the learning that creates would-be polymaths creates monomaths too and in overwhelming numbers. If you have a multitude who give their lives to a specialism, their combined knowledge will drown out even a gifted generalist. And while the polymath tries to take possession of a second expertise in some distant discipline, his or her first expertise is being colonized by someone else.
 WRONG LINE
 Blogging at MrMeyer.com, Dan Meyer, a high school math teacher, calculates that the grocery express lane may not be your fastest checkout option, because the number of people in line matters more than the number of items they hold: 
 [At express checkout] You attract more people holding fewer total items, but as the data shows ... when you add one person to the line, you're adding 48 extra seconds to the line length ... without even considering the items in her cart. Meanwhile, an extra item only costs you an extra 2.8 seconds. Therefore, you'd rather add 17 more items to the line than one extra person!

HEADLINE: The Jobs News Gets Worse

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
When the United States economy fell into recession at the beginning of 2008, many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, refused to believe it was happening. They pointed to the employment numbers, which showed only mild job losses for the first half of that year.
 Recessions, they said, do not come with such mild job losses. 
 They were right. Unfortunately, it was the job numbers that were wrong.
 On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics delivered its latest revelation that the jobs picture was far worse than it had previously reported. Using newly available data, the bureau now estimates that during the 12 months ended last March, the economy lost 5.6 million jobs, 824,000 more than the 4.8 million previously reported.
 It was just the latest change, although the largest. When that estimate is reflected in the published job figures early next year, it will show that there were 130.1 million civilian jobs in the economy last month. That is eight million jobs -- 5.8 percent -- below the peak reached as the recession began in December 2007.
 It now appears that during the first half of 2008, when the recession was getting under way, job losses averaged 146,000 per month. That is nearly three times the average of 49,000 jobs shown in the initial estimates.
 How did the government get it so wrong?
 The official job numbers are based on a monthly survey of employers, augmented by something called the ''birth-death model,'' which factors in jobs assumed to have been created by employers who are too new to have been included in the survey, and subtracts jobs from employers assumed to have failed and therefore not responded to the latest survey.
 Victoria Battista, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the bureau was looking at whether that model needed to be changed, as well as at other possible issues, such as changing response rates to the questionnaire sent out to employers each month. 
 The newest revision is called a ''benchmark revision.'' Such revisions are disclosed each October, and led to reductions in job totals in both 2007 and 2008. But the changes those years were tiny when compared with the changes this year.
 For the 12 months through last March, the birth-death model added 717,000 jobs to what the bureau would have reported had it relied solely on its survey. 
 While the government uses the survey of employers to estimate the number of jobs, the benchmark revisions are based on reports from states on the number of employees for whom unemployment insurance premiums are paid. Those numbers take longer to be available, but are considered to be more reliable.
 So how bad is this recession turning out to be, in terms of job losses?
 The government's data since 1939 shows only one time when there was a larger percentage decline in civilian jobs. That fall, of 10.1 percent, came at the end of World War II when defense contractors laid off workers no longer needed for the war effort -- a total of 4.3 million lost jobs. In no downturn since World War II did that many jobs vanish, until the current recession.
 The only other downturn in which as many as 5 percent of jobs disappeared was in 1949; that too was a special case. That October, national employment fell 2 percent in one month, largely because a steel strike forced many other companies to halt production and lay off workers.
 It is not clear if the economy now has hit bottom in terms of employment, even though other economic statistics make it appear that the recession has probably ended. The pace of job losses has slowed, but it is still substantial.
 In most recessions since World War II, it took about a year after employment bottomed for the economy to add enough jobs to fully reverse the decline. But that period has grown after recent downturns, perhaps because fewer people are losing jobs in manufacturing, where layoffs are likely to be reversed as consumption picks up.
 The sharpness of the decline in employment this time could indicate that employers will have to step up hiring more rapidly when the economy does rebound in order to meet rising demands from customers. Otherwise, it could be years before the United States has as many jobs as it did at the end of 2007.
 In any case, because the birth-death model is based on trends of the recent past, it is likely to err on the cautious side when things do improve, according to Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm. ''In 2011,'' he said, ''we may see a benchmark revision that adds hundreds of thousands of jobs.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: Employment Falling Faster, Recovering More Slowly: On Friday, the government announced that 824,000 more jobs were lost than it had previously reported. That brought the loss since December 2007, when the recession began, to eight million -- or 5.8 percent of all jobs. That percentage exceeds every decline since the end of World War II, when military production largely halted.(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Haver Analytics Note: Only declines of at least 1.5 percent are included.)

HEADLINE: Health Care? Not if You Can't Leave Work to Get It

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Adela Valdez made lamps in a factory at the back of a lighting store on Canal Street in Manhattan. The job paid minimum wage and no benefits. Last month, she got sick but went to work. On her third day of coughing and feeling generally crummy, she was feverish.
 ''I asked the boss for permission to go to the hospital,'' said Ms. Valdez, 39, a mother of four. ''She said, 'It's fine, go -- but you don't have a job anymore.' '' 
 Now Ms. Valdez works three days a week taking care of an elderly woman. 
 To questions of cost and coverage, add one more detail to the national debate about health care: time. In New York, time may be more important than cost. The city's empire of public hospitals finds ways to serve hundreds of thousands of people who don't have enough money or lack private insurance. But people who have no health insurance through their jobs are not likely to have paid sick days, either. By some estimates, 765,000 workers in the city do not get paid when they stay home sick.
 That would change under a bill before the City Council, known as Intro 1059, which is backed by unions and some health organizations. It would require all businesses in the city to provide paid sick time. Companies with fewer than 10 employees would have to give five days a year; larger businesses would be required to provide nine. Fines for not complying would be as much as $1,000. Business groups like the Chambers of Commerce in the five boroughs oppose the bill, arguing that the added costs might force some businesses to cut back on hiring. 
 Whatever its economic and social merits, the bill, if it becomes law, would bring the city into the workplace equivalent of the domestic dispute: intimate, furious, with the truth tied up in tangles. 
 For nearly seven years, Guillermo Barrera said, he arrived daily at 3:30 a.m. to work at the grill of a little diner in Bushwick. He peeled the potatoes and chopped the onions for the home fries. He mixed batter for the pancakes, loaded the coffee maker, brought in the bread, sliced tomatoes and diced lettuce. He worked 11 hours a day, seven days a week, and never took a vacation. 
 A few months ago, Mr. Barrera began to lose weight from a frame that was already slim, dropping 14 pounds. One Friday in September, sick as a dog, he had to leave the diner. He called his wife at 7 a.m. to pick him up. He ended up at Woodhull hospital for three days with a thyroid problem. 
 ''The boss yelled,'' Mr. Barrera recalled. ''She said, 'Don't come back. You're fired. You don't take this job seriously.' ''
 In an interview, the owner of the diner, Athena Skermo, said Mr. Barrera's account was a ''total lie.'' She said she paid her employees when they got sick. 
 ''He left me flat,'' she said. ''He was gone three days; I never heard from him. Someone told me he said, 'I'm not going to work as a grill man anymore,' because the doctor told him he got sick from the grill. I had to take someone else.''
 THERE are plenty of employers who do give their employees time off when they are sick, because it's good for business. ''You get more committed people if you stick with them when they have their crisis,'' said Freddy Castiblanco, owner of the Terraza 7 Train Cafe in Elmhurst, Queens, just down the block from the 82nd Street stop of the No. 7 train. 
 Mr. Castiblanco, who has five full-time employees, said that he had given his people time off when they were sick and that he supported the legislation to make it mandatory. 
 ''I'm at a disadvantage with other small-business owners who are not responsible,'' Mr. Castiblanco said. ''If we had a law, it would be equal.''
 There are other reasons, he said, for such a law: the costs that society has to take on when sick people go to work. Mr. Castiblanco, who was a doctor in Colombia before moving to the United States and hopes to pass qualifying tests this year to return to practicing medicine, said sick people should not be in a workplace where others might catch their ailments. ''It's a matter of public health that you don't have contagious people in the workplace,'' he said. 
 And does he provide insurance to his employees? 
 ''I tried,'' he said. ''It was $700 a month for each one. That would be more than my rent.''
 Does he have insurance for himself and his family?
 ''I can't afford it now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Theater Years in the Making, Inspired by Hepburn

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

DATELINE: OLD SAYBROOK 

 BODY:
 IT'S not as if they were serving cocktails and caviar -- just lemonade -- as some 1,500 people came on Sept. 6 to view the new Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center. The opening drew visitors from New York, Massachusetts and all over Connecticut to the elegantly restored building, which dates to 1911, when it was home to the Old Saybrook Musical and Dramatic Club. 
 Ann Nyberg, an anchor on Channel 8 and the vice president of the center's board of trustees, hustled in and delivered 30 gallons of lemonade she had just bought to replenish the 30 gallons that had been consumed in the first half-hour. ''I'll do anything for the Kate,'' Ms. Nyberg said. ''I'll buy lemonade, I'll sweep the floors, I'll even do the toilets.'' 
 The $5.7 million project involved renovating the 12,753-square-foot building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, while preserving features like the original crown moldings and sky-blue coffered ceilings, the 12-foot-tall Palladian windows and the original ticket booth.
 A new ticket sales area, a lobby and a second-floor outdoor balcony were added, along with 250 theater seats, some of which are movable to accommodate tables for cabaret dinners. The seats are red, chosen because it was the favorite color of Ms. Hepburn, who lived in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook for most of her 96 years, until her death in 2003.
 ''We've been working on this project for seven years,'' said Elaine Staplins, a trustee of the center, ''and to see it become reality, it gives me goose pimples.'' 
 A few things are yet to be done, Ms. Staplins said, like establishing a small museum in the theater dedicated to Ms. Hepburn and doing some landscaping, including planting 6,000 tulips and daffodils that will bloom next spring.
 A wide variety of entertainment is planned for the ''Kate,'' including plays, concerts, movies, comedy acts, operas and readings by famous writers.
 ''We're keeping ticket prices low, so we can be accessible to everybody,'' Ms. Nyberg said, adding that prices will typically range from $10 to $60, with some performances free.
 Next Saturday, a documentary will be shown about the making of the theater, called ''The Kate: Old Saybrook's Crown Jewel.'' On Oct. 16, several restaurants will offer a ''taste of Old Saybrook'' to benefit the theater, serving their cuisine under a tent on the green, and a '70s dance inside the theater will follow. And on Oct. 17, the center will hold a gala featuring the dance troupe Momix. 
 ''What's truly amazing is how generous people have been with their financial gifts, especially in this difficult economy,'' said Edie Gengras, the leader of fund-raising for the project. ''I've never seen anything like it, this outpouring of support.''
 Frank Sciame, a New York developer who bought Ms. Hepburn's mansion on the Long Island Sound for $6 million in 2004, was a major contributor to the board's campaign to raise $1.7 million in private donations. (The rest was covered by state grants and a local bond issue, which Old Saybrook residents approved in a referendum.)
 At a theater fund-raiser at the former Hepburn estate, Mr. Sciame gave guests a look at the sprawling rooms and explained how he had elevated the structure five feet to protect it from flooding. ''We may own it now,'' he said, ''but it's really always going to be known as the Katharine Hepburn estate, and that's great with us.''
 Ms. Hepburn, who won a record four Oscars for best actress, was a lot more private than other movie stars of her era. Among the few who knew her well was Spencer Tracy, with whom she had a long-term romance. Susie Tracy, his daughter, has been a supporter of the theater from the start, advising trustees and donating money.
 ''Katharine Hepburn was a dear friend of mine,'' Ms. Tracy said from her office in Los Angeles, ''and I know she'd be thrilled to have her name on the marquee again.''
 For Chuck Still, the theater's executive director, the thrill has just begun. Moving among the masses at the open house, he belted out a lyric from a song by the Allman Brothers Band: ''I've been tied to the whipping post.'' Later, he reclined in one of the theater chairs and said: ''How do I feel? I feel exuberant. It's like this lemonade is spiked with something.''
 The Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center is at 300 Main Street, Old Saybrook; (860) 510-0473. A calendar of events can be found at katharinehepburntheater.org. Tickets can be purchased online or at (877) 503-1286.

HEADLINE: The Guilt-Trip Casserole

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
''I DON'T need family-dinner studies to guilt-trip me,'' said Shannon Rubio, a mother of three teenage boys from Spring, Tex. ''I do it to myself.''
 But just in case, Mrs. Rubio, here is the latest, from the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University:
Teenagers who eat with their families less than three times a week are more likely to turn to alcohol, tobacco and drugs than those who dine with their families five times a week.
 Mrs. Rubio works for a human resources firm. Her husband, a tugboat mechanic, lives offshore four consecutive nights, followed by four nights off. Now that the school-season squall of sports and activities is blowing hard, Mrs. Rubio comes home every evening, piles a boy or three into the car and starts driving. Football, band, water polo, varsity swimming. 
 Dinner? ''We go to Sonic very frequently,'' she said. ''You're handing out sacks of food as quickly as you can. I hate it, but I don't know how you get around it with one parent at home.''
 Since the first CASA study in 1996 saw an association between the frequency of family dinners and rates of adolescent substance abuse, numerous other studies have pointed to the importance of the family dinner. They suggest that family dinners have a positive impact on nutrition, verbal abilities, mental health and workers' stress. The news media passionately presses the cause; it's a cornerstone of the slow-parenting movement.
 A mushrooming industry of cookbooks, advice columns and even takeout foods repackaged as ''family dinners'' beckon folks to the table. Coca-Cola, Smucker's and Stouffer's were among the sponsors for activities for the annual Family Day (Sept. 28 this year), designed to promote family dinners.
 Like breastfeeding and Baby Mozart tapes, family dinner has become a red-hot item on the good-parent scorecard, by which mothers in particular judge one another and themselves, a tinderbox for networks like Twittermoms.com. (According to the NPD Group, a market research firm, women are responsible for about 80 percent of meals in the home.) 
 So it's not surprising that many parents, especially mothers, who work night shifts or long hours, or who, like Mrs. Rubio, have teenagers running every which way to activities, are painfully aware that nightly dinners 'round the table are something other families get to do.
 Nor is it surprising that many others do veritable back flips to ensure that dinner and diners convene under the same roof, at the same time. A lawyer at a Manhattan firm rises at 4 a.m. in New Jersey to do enough work so that she can eat with her husband and three children by 8 p.m. A California writer feeds her tweens hefty snacks so they can eat supper with her husband, around 9 p.m.
 But as parents go to ever more breathless effort, or feel ever more guilt-ridden, are we becoming too literal-minded about ''family dinner''?
 Few would gainsay families eating together. The image of family members at day's end being nourished and nourishing one another, a refuge against whatever the outside world has loosed upon them, tugs at the heart. In the ideal, it's the safety zone, where tweens and teenagers, those elusive creatures, will reveal secrets.
 And some evidence suggests that parents are eating more dinners with their teenagers, though that may be as much a response to the recession as the family dinner campaign. According to NPD's 24th annual compilation of studies, ''Eating Patterns in America,'' released Thursday, 71 percent of 250 households with at least one teenager ate five dinners together a week, up from 65 percent in 2008. CASA, which interviewed 1,000 families, found that 59 percent of teenagers said they ate dinner with their families at least five times a week, a proportion that has remained steady since 2004 but up from a 1998 low of 47 percent. 
 Dr. Philip A. Cowan, a psychologist and former director of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that the alacrity with which Americans embrace equations like family dinner frequency and substance abuse speaks to their need to find ''silver bullet'' solutions to profound problems.
 BUT, he cautioned in an e-mail message, there is not a proven cause and effect that more family dinners equal less drug use. ''To say that family dinners are associated with good outcomes is not the same as saying that family dinners cause good outcomes,'' wrote Dr. Cowan, who has studied families.
 The most likely explanation for the CASA results, he added, is that families who place importance on eating together -- and can organize themselves to pull it off -- are those who are more likely to produce good outcomes for their children anyway. 
 But what's a mother to do? Deborah Perham owns a court reporting agency in Commack, N.Y. Her husband is a security director. Her son is in college and her two teenage daughters are scampering off to sports, part-time jobs and, well, life. She insists that the family eat together once a week.
 Two weeks ago, she peered at her household calendar, color-coded with everyone's activities. And there, thanks to a rare school holiday, she spied a smidgen of white.
 ''Lunch on Monday at 3 p.m.!'' she told her family. ''Put it in your BlackBerries.''
 Does that count?
 And does dinner have to be cooked? At home? What if it lasts only 10 minutes?
 Um, TV?
 O.K., what about ''60 Minutes''?
 ''I don't think we really know what a good family dinner is,'' said Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies family meals and adolescents and is the author of ''I'm, Like, So Fat!'' Just do something, she suggested. ''And yes, lunch counts.'' 
 Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, said, ''We need to figure out when we can be together and not focus on the magic number.''
 And guess what? Watching TV while eating may not be the end of civilization as we know it. In a 2009 study of 806 teenage girls, Professor Neumark-Sztainer concluded that watching television during dinner had little impact on substance abuse rates. What mattered was that the family ate together. (''Though I'm not a proponent of watching TV at dinner,'' she added.)
 And for those who think family dinners should include thoughtful exchanges and revelations? Tell that to a 14-year-old. Amy Middleman, an adolescent medicine specialist at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, said that the dinner table may be the last place a teenager chooses to drop a humdinger. ''There's too much time to see your parents' reaction and their over-reaction,'' she said. ''That's why they prefer to drop them just as they're getting out of the car.''
 Dr. Middleman herself has three children, ages 5, 9 and 11. Her schoolteacher husband usually gives them a late snack and helps prepare dinner, so that they all sit down by 8 p.m. She believes in the family dinner. She counsels patients with eating disorders to eat with their families. And yet she is not certain that the fundamental element of ''family dinner'' is even food itself.
 ''The family dinner research may be telling us that that some of the more important elements may be about slowing down, organizing our lives with a little bit less harried time,'' she said. ''There just needs to be some element of structure and reconnection during the day. And I don't know that it has to be 'meaningful.' It could be a drive, a walk, a regular conversation.'' 
 To separate from the family in a healthy way, Dr. Middleman said, a teenager ''has to have some level of reassurance that when theycome back, what they left will still be there. And so whatever it takes to make that clear is probably what we're getting at with 'family dinners.' ''
 By that measure, Mrs. Rubio, laughing with her tumult of teenagers as they gobble from paper bags in the parking lot of the Sonic, is doing a pretty good job.
 And families for whom the gold standard of five weekly dinners will always be a mirage just do what they can. Erica Shrader, a divorced mother of four, commutes about an hour from Virginia to her job as a database administrator in Washington, D.C. She gets home around 7 p.m. ''We can only do about three meals a week together,'' she said describing the exhaustion, laundry, silliness and homework that converge when she walks through the door.
 The rest? ''Do it yourself. Leftovers. Cereal and a banana,'' she said. ''By the time I'm home, they've already eaten and I can grab a kid, make a run to Target. Then you get the one-on-one time. I think there are different ways to get to the same place.''
 A Manhattan lawyer with a frenzied bankruptcy practice and two young children also has found her own way to the same place, but declined to give her name, fearing social embarrassment. ''I don't know why dinner has to be the meaningful thing,'' she said. ''Having my kid eat four snacks so she can wait for a 15-minute dinner with us and go to bed right away doesn't work. What's important to me is creating dedicated time with my kids that clients don't infringe on.''
 For her, that's from 6:30 to 8:30 a.m., when they eat breakfast and walk to school. 
 During the work week, Carol Lapidus, an accounting-firm partner from Tenafly, N.J., wakes at 5:30 a.m. and never gets home before 8 p.m. She and her husband, who works in commercial real estate, rarely have dinner with their children, a daughter now in college, and a son, 15. 
 ''But there's never a lack of talking,'' she said. ''In this house? Are you kidding?'' She is ready to go to sleep by 10 p.m. ''My son comes in every night, sits on the bed, talks about his day, kisses me goodnight and tucks me in.''
 Even Joseph A. Califano Jr., the founder and chairman of CASA, said that ''family dinner'' could be read as a surrogate term for parental engagement.
 ''I spent four years working for Lyndon Johnson as chief domestic aide,'' Mr. Califano said, ''and I wasn't home for dinner much. My wife had dinner with the kids. But I spent every moment with them on Saturdays and Sundays. You have to try.''
 Desiree de Monye, a county Web support worker, is usually home in Vancouver, Wash., with her daughters, 18 and 16, by 6 p.m. They never dine together.
 AROUND 9 p.m., the older daughter will rustle up something -- the other night it was Campbell's chicken soup and cheesy, herbed biscuits -- and each will grab a plate and eat in her own room, Ms. de Monye scrapbooking and the girls doing homework or texting. ''Dinner is refueling,'' Ms. de Monye said. ''It's another chore.''
 But when the three watch television, they pause shows, she said, to do ''a yakkety-yak.'' On weekends, they often rent movies. During the week, she usually drives them to school. Her office is close enough that her daughters frequently visit. At lunchtime, the girls call to chat.
 The 16-year-old will ask, ''How's your day, Mommy?''
 ''If I say, 'fine,' '' Ms. de Monye said, ''she'll say: 'No, Mom, I don't want to hear a one-word answer. I want you to tell me what project you're working on.' ''
 Ms. de Monye laughed. ''She wants me to spill it. So I do.''

HEADLINE: The Family Farm, Also Battling the Downturn

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The recession has made its presence known on the family farm. Lower demand has pushed crop and livestock prices down, causing farmers' incomes to fall. 
 Net farm income is projected to be $54 billion in 2009, a drop of 38 percent from the estimate for 2008, according to the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture. And the income of the average family farm household is expected to be about $76,000, off 5.2 percent from 2008. 
 Most of the two million or so family farms in the United States are modest in size and don't generate enough income for the farmers to support themselves. In fact, ''the average family farm is forecast to receive 7.6 percent of its household income from farm sources, with the rest from earned and unearned off-farm income,'' the research service says.
 That is why the overall financial situation of a vast majority of farmers will depend on the money they are able to raise off the farm, not on it.

HEADLINE: Where the Hotel Is the Hub

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 THE Sunset Tower Hotel, once a dilapidated dump but now a power-broker capital in Hollywood, recently hired a detective. After all, a crime had been committed -- at least in the eyes of its owner, Jeff Klein.
 When US Weekly reported in August that Renee Zellweger and her new beau had guzzled Champagne in a Sunset Tower suite, Mr. Klein had a meltdown. The detective was hired and, soon, a room-service waiter was fired.
 ''He claimed he only told his mother,'' Mr. Klein says. ''I didn't care. Gone!''
 A New York society brat turned serious hotelier and restaurateur, Mr. Klein, 39, bought the Sunset Tower in 2004 and has transformed it partly by throwing out the handbook of how entertainment industry haunts are managed, especially in Los Angeles. A ban on media leaks about boldface business deals or celebrity frolicking is strictly enforced. Mr. Klein is also very careful about curating a clientele. Celebrities deemed out of place, including the rapper Sean Combs and Britney Spears, have been -- gasp -- turned away. 
 Hollywood hotels have long played a role in how the gears of show business grind. They are where the moguls show off (Harvey Weinstein conducting multiple meetings simultaneously at the Peninsula), where publicists monitor interviews (the bar at the Four Seasons) and where pretty young things are discovered poolside (the plucking of Robert Evans decades ago from obscurity at the Beverly Hills Hotel).
 ''Hotels have the whole gamut of elements that people use to send signals in this business,'' says Peter Guber, the former chairman of Sony Pictures, who is now a producer. ''You don't want to be seen unless nobody is looking -- then you want to be seen.'' 
 These deal-making hotbeds exist partly because the business culture of entertainment is transient: Most of the money to make movies comes from somewhere else, and hotels are neutral meeting spots. Or maybe Hollywood hotels became integral for another very simple reason. ''It's a casual place,'' says Mr. Evans, who parlayed his tan into a long career as a producer of films like ''Chinatown.'' If you could do a deal by the pool, he asks, ''wouldn't you?''
 But the polarity of hotel power is shifting here. Out: the snarly parking valet, the too-cool-to-notice-you hostess and the tipsy-hipster pool scene. That is all so pre-recession. In: old-Hollywood glamour, and an intense focus on privacy and service that warrants the price. Mr. Klein's Sunset Strip hotel and its restaurant, Tower Bar, are popping against this understated backdrop.
 ''The Sunset Tower has made it impossible for me to ever stay anywhere else in Los Angeles again,'' says Lauren Zalaznick, an NBC Universal president who is considered a cultural barometer. ''Nice is the new mean.''
 The Creative Artists Agency now holds an ultra-exclusive Golden Globes event at Mr. Klein's hotel, and certain agents use the lounge and bar as a second office. (''They take nothing and no one for granted,'' says Bryan Lourd, a Creative Artists partner.) Vanity Fair held its lavish Oscar party there in February and will be back next year. The art gallery that Larry Gagosian runs recently wined and dined clients on the terrace. 
 At the same time, other Hollywood hotels that cater to show-business types are wheezing amid the travel slump. The flashy SLS Hotel, with its Philippe Starck design and cotton candy machine, has posted monthly occupancy levels of about 65 percent -- not horrible, but disappointing given its recent $130 million renovation. 
 Similarly, the Hollywood Roosevelt is struggling to maintain its initial buzz now that the pool party has died down. 
 One of Mr. Klein's rivals, the Hotel Bel-Air -- the grande dame of business-deal breakfasts -- closed on Wednesday for a two-year renovation. His closest competition is the Chateau Marmont, famous as the place where John Belushi overdosed in 1982. The hotel, owned since 1990 by Andre Balazs, is still packed, with the crowd leaning toward music and fashion. Celebrities like the director Sofia Coppola and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been spotted there recently, but it has suffered a string of tabloid humiliations that has soured some of moviedom's A-list. Lindsay Lohan has been a regular. 
 How has Mr. Klein done it? The Hollywood crowd recites the attention to detail and the privacy, but his New York connections have helped. The designer Tom Ford, for example, insisted that Mr. Klein hire what has become one of the Sunset Tower's secret weapons: a Macedonian maitre d' named Dimitri Dimitrov, who formerly worked at a caviar bar, knows the producer pecking order, and is careful not to seat rivals next to one another.
 ''I was kind of annoyed actually -- I don't tell Tom Ford how to hire models -- but I put my pride away and listened,'' says Mr. Klein. ''He was right.''
 Catering to celebrities, including movie moguls, has long been a high-wire act. The mood could shift with one errant paparazzo. Mr. Klein attracts the big titles and the big stars in part by being blunt about the kind of clientele he is not looking for: what he calls celebrity ''trash.'' 
 In one incident that made Page Six of The New York Post, Mr. Klein blew up when he discovered that Ms. Spears had tried to book three rooms.
 ''She can't come here with all my chic guests; she'll ruin the place,'' he was overheard yelling in the lobby. He refused to let Mr. Combs attend a Creative Artists event. (News reports quoted Mr. Combs as yelling ''I'll spend the rest of my life hunting you down,'' but Mr. Klein says the rapper later called to apologize, and is not banned from the hotel. Representatives for Mr. Combs did not respond to requests for comment.) 
 Would Ms. Lohan receive a reservation? Mr. Klein shuddered and made a sour face, adding that he believes the hotel, to some degree, self-selects its clientele.
 ''C-list television actors walk into the hotel and see what it is -- a classy place -- and leave,'' he says. ''They don't understand it. They say, 'Eww, let's go to the Chateau.' And I'm truly fine with that.''
 THE Sunset Tower, perched on the Sunset Strip, has oscillated between a well-heeled apartment building and a hotel -- of various names -- since opening in 1929. It was not an immediate hit in its latest form. People didn't quite know how to take its quiet elegance. And by the way, who was this bubbly but neurotic New Yorker running it?
 ''It was really hard for me because I was ignoring a lot of advice,'' says Mr. Klein. ''Everyone told me I had to get a D.J. for the lobby. It had to be trendy. They told me I didn't understand L.A.''
 As Mr. Klein likes to say, the property has ''good bones.'' Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Ross, Howard Hughes and Bugsy Siegel have all called it home at various times. Legend has it that John Wayne kept a cow on his balcony.
 But by the 1980s, the 15-story building had fallen into disrepair. Mr. Klein and a business partner, the developer Peter Krulewitch, bought it for $18.5 million and spent about $15 million redecorating. Mr. Klein, who opened the 64-room City Club hotel in Manhattan in 2001, was obsessive about details. The cocktail napkins had to be quilted. The walnut paneling in the restaurant had to perfectly match that Architectural Digest picture of Mr. Siegel's room in the 1940s. And Mr. Klein spent $60,000 to replace window handles in the guest rooms.
 ''I almost had a coronary -- window knobs?'' Mr. Krulewitch says.
 Still, the results were uneven. A 2006 review of the hotel in The New York Times was devastating, complaining about slow room service, inattentiveness at the restaurant (at least for regular folk) and a lack of warm water. ''Would Sinatra put up with the half-baked details?'' the review concluded.
 The review stung, but Mr. Klein soldiered forward, making changes big and small. He overhauled room service. He discovered the importance of speedy parking, replacing the original contractor with one that sharply reduced his valet profits but was lightning fast. ''It's like creating a play or an artwork,'' he says. ''All of the details blend together to create an experience.''
 Mr. Klein says the hotel is profitable, but he would not back that up with numbers. He acknowledges that it is struggling a bit in the recession; room rates are down and occupancy is about 75 percent, he says. Still, the power-broker scene in the lobby and restaurant has clicked in recent months.
 He won't talk about his clientele, but all you need to do is book a table at Tower Bar and look around. Regular customers include Brad Grey, the chairman of Paramount Pictures; Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation; and Brian Grazer, the Oscar-winning producer. Celebrity devotees include Jennifer Aniston, Sean Penn and Johnny Depp. Thrown in for good measure: Nancy Reagan and assorted British royals.
 The clubby vibe, as described by the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer A. Scott Berg, is ''extremely friendly without ever being overly familiar.''
 Even young Hollywood -- James Franco, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Pine -- is flocking to the Tower, which has a decidedly old-school feel: There's a bass player in the lobby. And where did Andy Samberg stay in August when he hosted the MTV Movie Awards? Not the Chateau Marmont. (Mr. Samberg is loyal to the Sunset Tower in part because his gig on ''Saturday Night Live'' started after Lorne Michaels, the show's creator, discovered him through a party there.)
 Mr. Klein, who recently reopened the Monkey Bar in Manhattan with Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, and another partner, is suddenly very popular around dinner time. As he tried to relax at home the other night, he received five frantic calls on his cellphone from a media titan (whom he wouldn't name) who didn't like his table. A displeased Mr. Klein finally had a manager reseat him.
 Does he feel pressure to give free meals and rooms to the A-list, as is the practice at some rival hotels? ''Oh, honey,'' he says with a big, braying laugh, ''I don't comp anything.''
 If one moment marked the hotel's official arrival, it was the Vanity Fair party in February, before Mr. Klein and Mr. Carter moved forward with the Monkey Bar. Mr. Carter had become friendly with Mr. Klein after dining at the hotel. ''I thought it had the requisite coziness and glamour,'' says Mr. Carter. 
 Inside the party, Mr. Klein was sweating in a tuxedo next to a mirrored column. Waiters served In-N-Out burgers to the megawatt crowd while the disco tune ''Ring My Bell'' thundered from speakers overhead.
 ''I'm exhausted,'' he said between air kisses at about midnight. ''Is it too early to loosen my bow tie?''
 Just then, Kate Winslet, holding the Academy Award she had just received, approached from behind. Mr. Klein was in her way. She tapped him on the arm with her Oscar, and he jumped aside. ''Thank you, darling!'' Ms. Winslet shouted over her shoulder.
 HAVING conquered Hollywood, Mr. Klein is now trying to move into another echelon: the one inhabited by Mr. Balazs and Ian Schrager, who is credited with setting off the boutique hotel craze in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere.
 Mr. Klein regrets making snipes about his competition, such as the comment about C-list actors preferring the Chateau Marmont to the Tower. ''It was completely wrong of me to say such a stupid thing and make such silly jokes,'' he says. ''The real truth is that I am jealous of Andre and I only wish I had the same level of success.''
 Mr. Klein's goal is to take advantage of the travel slump and snap up properties on the cheap. With Mr. Krulewitch's help, he is working to put together a $100 million fund and has been looking at opportunities in Palm Springs, Miami and London. 
 It will be difficult. The hotel real estate market is still sorting itself out and many owners are unwilling to accept valuations that reflect the sour state of travel. And what is working for Sunset Tower -- hyper-attention to detail -- will be hard to replicate as Mr. Klein stretches himself further.
 Mr. Klein, who graduated from Tulane University with a degree in 15th-century French literature, is also driven by a desire to be seen as a serious businessman. He is proud that his company is not overextended; some hoteliers are in trouble because their boom-time financing is coming due during this slump. But being seen as a hotel mogul would be a way to erase some of the frivolity of his past.
 For example, there was that teddy-bear company he started before opening the City Club -- people could send a bear holding a little horn to somebody for a birthday -- that ultimately failed. And while his society upbringing on the Upper East Side of Manhattan has helped his career, his pedigree has caused some to see him as a spoiled rich kid. 
 Some of his other pursuits don't exactly invoke Bill Gates. He has been known to throw lavish personal parties, including an infamous one a decade ago that involved Carmen Miranda impersonators, and to wear outlandish fashions (like the turban he once donned for a society gala).
 THE continued success of the Sunset Tower, of course, plays the lead role in Mr. Klein's makeover. He knows this, and continues to obsess over everything from the look of menus to the placement of stationery in guest rooms. Recently, he was preoccupied with the addition of a hot dog to the lunch menu, an idea he got from Nora Ephron.
 Ms. Ephron, the writer and movie director, mentioned to him that one of her favorite things about Los Angeles was Nate'n Al, a deli that serves a great wiener. ''I immediately called our chef, but she balked,'' says Mr. Klein. Undeterred, he drove to the deli and bought a dozen to try.
 Naming the new menu item was an ordeal, as is often the case when Mr. Klein gets excited. Menus were printed, for hundreds of dollars, that listed the item as ''Nate'n Al's Footlong Hot Dog.'' He took one look and ordered them reprinted. Mr. Klein thought that just ''Hot Dog'' was funnier. 
 ''The chef was not very happy about my attention to a hot dog, but I didn't care,'' he says. ''By the way, it's the best seller.''

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Baltimore

BYLINE: By JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

 BODY:
IF you watch HBO's police drama ''The Wire,'' you might think that Baltimore is filled with drug dealers and crime ringleaders. But in truth, the city has attracted a different breed of misfits: artists. Lured by cheap rents and warehouse spaces, artists and photographers have flocked there to claim the city as their own. Once rough neighborhoods like Hampden and Highlandtown have been taken over in recent years by studios, galleries and performance spaces. Crab joints and sports bars now share the cobblestone streets with fancy cafes and tapas restaurants. But against this backdrop, there are still the beehive hairdos and wacky museums that give so-called Charm City its nickname.
 Friday
 4 p.m. 1)INTO THE WOODS 
 Though you wouldn't guess it as you enter Baltimore on Interstate 95, which passes port terminals and factories spewing smoke, the center of the city conceals a wooded, stream-filled oasis, the Jones Falls Trail (www.jonesfalls.org). Once heavily polluted itself, the 58-square-mile watershed has been restored over the past decade and now features a green biking and hiking trail, which parallels the Jones Fall River and meanders through some of the old mills that once powered Baltimore's economy. It is a rustic and historical look at a sometimes gritty city.
 7 p.m. 2)NOT JUST CRABS
 In a town known for crab cakes and fried fish sandwiches, Woodberry Kitchen (2010 Clipper Park Road; 410-464-8000; www.woodberrykitchen.com) stands out for its refined local cooking. Set in the Clipper Mill complex, an old foundry that is now home to artists' studios, galleries and homes, Woodberry serves nouveau American comfort food using seasonal and local ingredients, like Chesapeake soft-shell crabs served with a spicy tartar sauce, and brick-oven roasted chicken with a sweet cider glaze, on top of a Spanish-style tortilla. Dinner for two, about $80.
 10 p.m. 3)VERY OFF BROADWAY
 True to its countercultural roots, Baltimore mostly eschews touring Broadway shows for offbeat theater. Perhaps the strangest are staged by the Creative Alliance at the Patterson (3134 Eastern Avenue; 410-276-1651; www.creativealliance.org), whose stage feels like an old vaudeville house. One night, you might catch burlesque artists stripping down to their pasties; another night, a documentary on Baltimore's decaying schools. The adjacent gallery often features the works of local painters and photographers.
 Saturday
 9 a.m. 4)UNDERGROUND CAFE
 Tucked into a basement of an apartment house in the row house neighborhood of Charles Village, near the main campus of Johns Hopkins, Carma's Cafe (32nd and Saint Paul Streets; 410-243-5200; www.carmascafe.com) is easy to miss. But neighbors flock to it for buttery cherry-almond scones, desserts like fried cheesecake (could a dessert be richer?), frittatas and salads, and innovative coffee drinks like the zamboni, a drinkable version of a snowball. Breakfast for two, about $20.
 11 a.m. 5)SISTER ACT
 A short walk from Carma's, the Baltimore Museum of Art (10 Art Museum Drive; 443-573-1700; www.artbma.org) has a surprisingly large endowment of post-Impressionist art. The Cone sisters, socialites who lived in Baltimore in the early 20th century, had the foresight to buy thousands of paintings by master artists including Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse. They willed the pieces to the museum, whenever ''the status of appreciation of modern art in Baltimore should improve.'' Apparently, it did. Today, the Cone Collection is the heart of the museum, including Matisse's ''Blue Nude'' and Gauguin's ''Woman of the Mango.'' When you're done inside, grab a snack at Gertrude's, the museum's restaurant, and sit at a table in the nearby sculpture garden.
 1 p.m. 6)CALL IT FELL'S
 Tourists flock to the Inner Harbor, home to the aquarium and countless chain restaurants. For the local version, walk a few blocks farther to historic Fell's Point, a cobblestoned waterfront area of patisseries, bars and galleries -- and, unlike the Inner Harbor, a real neighborhood with brick row houses that have become a Baltimore icon. Start at the open-air plaza at the bottom of Broadway, where skateboarders mix with musicians and with couples snuggling on benches. Walk east, along Thames Street, looking over the water. Stop to inhale French pastry at Bonaparte Breads (903 South Ann Street; 410-342-4000), before heading on toward Canton, the next waterfront neighborhood, full of restored warehouses turned into shops and condos.
 4 p.m. 7)T-SHIRTS MEET BEEHIVES
 In recent years, the neighborhood of Hampden has gone from working-class to artsy. Packed with galleries and used-clothing stores, Hampden's main drag, 36th Street, is where you'll see 20-somethings in stylishly rumpled vintage jeans sharing cigarettes with ''Hons,'' the nickname for women who wear classic beehive hairdos. For obscure self-published art books and zines, browse through Atomic Books (3620 Falls Road; 410-662-4444; www.atomicbooks.com). Then, head to In Watermelon Sugar (3555 Chestnut Avenue; 410-662-9090), where you'll find decidedly un-Ikea furniture. You might finish up at Mina's (815 West 36th Street; 410-732-4258; www.minasgalleryandboutique.com) for vintage wear, poetry readings and Baltimore-based artists.
 7:30 p.m. 8)PETIT FOURS
 Every city needs a neighborhood restaurant that feels like a social club. In Baltimore, that would be Petit Louis (4800 Roland Avenue; 410-366-9393; www.petitlouis.com), a cozy French bistro in the swank residential neighborhood of Roland Park. It has the air of a private party, with a host greeting diners by name, and the kitchen serving up classic bistro dishes like grilled salmon with asparagus, and eggplant napoleon stuffed with chevre. Don't miss the pommes frites, crispy and sinfully fatty. Dinner for two, about $80.
 10 p.m. 9)BREW CREW
 There may be tons of bars in Baltimore, but calling the Brewer's Art (1106 North Charles Street; 410-547-6925; www.thebrewersart.com) a bar is like calling crabs just another shellfish. Housed in a classic town house, the pub takes its beers very seriously, pouring everything from Trappist ales from Belgium to local microbrews like Clipper City Pale Ale. The crowd seems just as serious -- artists and designers, older couples coming from the symphony and occasional college students looking out of place among the adults.
 Sunday
 11 a.m. 10)YOUNG ARTISTS
 Everyone's got to start somewhere, and for many of Baltimore's top artists, that push came from the Maryland Institute College of Art (1300 Mount Royal Avenue; 410-669 9200; www.mica.edu). The college, situated in the stately Bolton Hill neighborhood, regularly showcases the work of its promising students and faculty, which is to say the art can be hit or miss. But, like a treasure hunt, that's part of the fun. If you're hungry, grab a bite at b (1501 Bolton Street; 410-383-8600; www.b-bistro.com), a simple bistro opened by a brother of Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan.
 2 p.m. 11)ANTIQUE CITY
 For unique antiques, skip the ho-hum stores in Baltimore and head west to Ellicott City (www.ellicottcity.net), an 18th-century mill town about 25 minutes by car from downtown. Its historic Main Street is lined with Rockwell-esque stores that have become an antiques hub. For four floors of pop collectibles and crafts, check out Taylor's Antiques Mall (8197 Main Street; 410-465-4444; www.taylorsantiquemall.com). Out of Our Past Antiques (8111 Main Street; 410-480-2970; www.outofourpastantiques.com) carries stately wooden pieces. Don't forget to bargain -- the store owners may turn on the Southern charm, but, if necessary, they will haggle like a street dealer. 
 THE BASICS
 Thurgood Marshall BWI Airport has flights from all over the country. From New York City, it makes more sense to drive or take a train. The drive from New York is about three and a half hours, and all Amtrak East Coast trains stop at Penn Station in Baltimore. If you don't drive to Baltimore, be sure to rent a car there. For up-to-date event listings, try the local free weekly, the City Paper (www.citypaper.com). 
 Upscale hotels in Baltimore are clustered downtown, near the central business district and the Inner Harbor waterfront. 
 The 757-room Hilton Baltimore (401 West Pratt Street; 443-573-8700; www.baltimore.hilton.com) opened in 2008 and sits only blocks from the water. Rooms in mid-October start at $165. For a more local option, stay at the Admiral Fell Inn (888 South Broadway; 866-583-4162; www.harbormagic.com), a cluster of red brick buildings dating from the late 18th century, in the heart of the historic Fell's Point waterfront. The 80 rooms resemble a colonial home and start at $170.

HEADLINE: After Chicago's Loss, Critics Assail U.S.O.C.

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS, RICHARD SANDOMIR and JULIET MACUR; Juliet Macur reported from Copenhagen, and Katie Thomas and Richard Sandomir from New York.

 BODY:
This article was reported byKatie Thomas,Richard Sandomir and Juliet Macur, and written by Ms. Thomas. 
 For weeks, the United States Olympic Committee and the national sports governing bodies it oversees had settled into an uncomfortable truce. Despite a year of upheaval and conflict, the parties had agreed to set aside their differences in solidarity for Chicago's bid to win the 2016 Summer Games.
 The truce ended as quickly as Chicago was dispatched from the race won by Rio de Janeiro. In surprisingly frank terms, a number of influential people in American Olympic sports questioned the performance of the U.S.O.C.'s new management team and said its two top executives were ill-equipped to navigate the insular world of international sports.
 Chicago's last-place finish in the I.O.C. voting on Friday in Copenhagen was the latest blow in a year marked by the departure of major sponsors, layoffs at U.S.O.C. headquarters, controversy over the salary of the acting chief executive, and the failed plan for an Olympic television network. 
 ''Before we think about putting forth another Olympic city for a Games possibility, we've got to deal with some outstanding issues that are not going to go away,'' said Mike Plant, who serves on the U.S.O.C.'s 10-member board and traveled to Copenhagen as part of the Chicago delegation. ''I think that certainly there will be some dialogue that's going to take place in the next couple of weeks -- or certainly in short order.''
 Asked what should happen next to return the U.S.O.C. to prominence in international circles, James Ravannack, the president of USA Wrestling, said: ''Resignations. It's an absolute embarrassment. I don't know what else to tell you. Where is the leadership?''
 Patrick G. Ryan, the bid leader for Chicago, said his staff's relationship with the U.S.O.C. could not have been better. He said regional bloc voting, not the U.S.O.C., caused the bid's downfall. 
 ''I think people look for an excuse when something happens,'' he said. ''They look to finger-point, and now the finger-pointing is at the U.S.O.C. It's a simple thing to do the day after.''
 Since the end of the Beijing Olympics, most of the top positions at the U.S.O.C. have changed hands. Last October, Larry Probst, the chairman of the video-game publisher Electronic Arts, replaced Peter Ueberroth as the committee's chairman. In March, Probst and the board removed the chief executive, Jim Scherr, and appointed a board member, Stephanie A. Streeter. The executives in charge of sport performance, marketing and human resources were also replaced.
 The turnover angered many leaders of the national governing bodies of Olympic sports, who chafed at the corporate backgrounds of Probst and Streeter and their lack of Olympic experience. The relationship further soured when it was revealed that the board had approved an annual salary of $560,000 for Streeter -- a 30 percent increase over Scherr's -- months after 54 employees were laid off.
 Probst has said the board will begin a search this month to replace Streeter, whose term as acting chief executive runs through next year's Paralympics. She has not said whether she will apply for the permanent position.
 Probst and Streeter, who were in Copenhagen, were contacted through their representatives, but did not return calls.
 Skip Gilbert, the chairman of the Association of Chief Executives for Sport, which includes 45 Olympic sport bodies in the United States, said his members had been waiting for the vote on Chicago before voicing concern over the U.S.O.C.'s management.
 ''Now's the time that we're going to build some consensus as to what do we think is the next move in order to right the ship,'' Gilbert said. One item high on the agenda, he said, is whether to recommend a change in leadership.
 Several leaders in Olympic sports praised the Chicago bid as the best that an American city had put forward in decades. But Chicago's elimination in the first round exposed the U.S.O.C.'s lack of influence. Steve Penny, the president of USA Gymnastics, likened the Games to a crown jewel.
 ''You've got to know that the people you're going to be giving your crown jewels to are the most trustworthy partners that you could ever ask for,'' he said. ''And unfortunately, when you don't have stability in your leadership, how can you build trust?''
 Some wondered whether Probst and Streeter hurt Chicago's chances when they failed to show up to a meeting of I.O.C. members in Lausanne, Switzerland, where host cities were invited to make presentations. 
 ''You look back at it and think that it might have been a better decision for them to go,'' said James Easton, an I.O.C. member who is on the U.S.O.C. board.
 Members of the U.S.O.C.'s international relations division have flown more than a million miles on outreach missions on behalf of the Chicago bid, a U.S.O.C. spokeswoman said. 
 Denis Oswald, a Swiss I.O.C. member and frequent U.S.O.C. critic, said he and his colleagues took note of the tumult in American Olympic circles. ''We had been dealing with some people, and suddenly we heard one has disappeared and one was nearly fired, and you had to start with totally new people,'' Oswald said. 
 Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports, which invested billions of dollars for the North American media rights to the Games, said that other unresolved problems probably played a role in Chicago's loss. Many I.O.C. members feel the United States receives an inordinate share of revenue. The United States receives 20 percent of global sponsorship money and 12.75 percent of the TV money, an arrangement that will be renegotiated in 2013.
 ''Any U.S. bid city will be in a difficult place until the U.S.O.C. works out a new relationship with the I.O.C. in terms of the revenue cut the U.S. gets,'' he said.
 Others questioned the U.S.O.C.'s timing with its announcement in July that it intended to create an Olympic television network. The I.O.C. quickly repudiated the move. Probst and Streeter later delayed plans for the network. 
 ''It was really bad timing to bring it up,'' said Bill Martin, the University of Michigan athletic director and former acting president of the U.S.O.C. ''No question about it. You just don't do it prior to a vote of this nature.'' 
 Suggesting possible chief executives for the organization, Ebersol did not name Streeter. He recommended Dennis Swanson, the president of station operations at Fox Television Stations, and Harvey Schiller, a former U.S.O.C. chief executive now with the International Baseball Federation.
 ''Someone has to reach out to a major figure familiar to the Olympic world, so you go in with strength,'' Ebersol said. 
 Anita DeFrantz, a member of the I.O.C. who also serves on the U.S.O.C. board, said it would be foolish to make leadership decisions based on the whims of her international colleagues.
 ''What the people within the I.O.C. were calling for was people that they knew,'' she said. ''It didn't matter what their backgrounds were.'' 
 Some American leaders were more measured in their assessment of the performance of Streeter and Probst. Easton, an American I.O.C. member, said he hopes Streeter stays.
 ''I hope people give her some time to know the system,'' he said of Streeter, the former chief executive of the Banta Corporation, a printing and supply company. ''She's a very intelligent and talented woman who is very accomplished in business.''
 Doug Logan, the chief executive of USA Track and Field, said it was disrespectful to suggest resignations. Still, he acknowledged that the U.S.O.C. was going through a difficult period. The U.S.O.C. has lost several major sponsors because of the recession, although it has attracted new ones.
 Without Chicago as a host city, signing sponsors will be more difficult, Logan said. 
 DeFrantz said criticism of the U.S.O.C. missed the larger point: that Rio de Janeiro was destined to win. ''It was all about going to a different part of the world,'' she said. ''Had Chicago won, everyone would be celebrating the wisdom of what we had done.''

HEADLINE: Adventures In Wonderland

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON. 
ERIC WILSON is a reporter for the Styles section of The Times.

 BODY:
I AM not a camper by nature. Truth be told, I abandoned scouting at age 12, after the sophomore rank of Webelos, because I suffered from an intense childhood phobia of khaki uniforms, convinced they would portend a future career in package delivery. I only stuck with it as long as I did because, in my day, Webelos wore super-chic navy ensembles with a fleur-de-lis patch that always reminded me of a half-peeled banana. Vanity denied me a suitable education in outdoor living skills and all the attendant patches that go with them.
 This, I am sorry to say, is what went through my head late one afternoon in August, during my first camping trip in more than two decades, when I thought I was done for and someone would find my rotting corpse halfway up the side of Mount Rainier in Washington. 
 Camping, everyone keeps saying, became more popular in the recession because, as Nicholas D. Kristof wrote in The New York Times in August, it's ''the cheapest of vacations.'' With extra time off on my hands, I was determined to discover if just anyone could get back to nature and still be happy about it. And by ''just anyone,'' I meant me, a soft, indoorsy chronicler of the fashion world, whose idealized vision of the great outdoors falls closer in line with the spring 2010 collection of the gay-or-Italian-leaning label DSquared, which included a stone-chiseled model wearing only boxer briefs, hiking boots and a sleeping bag as a cape.
 But where was I? Oh yes, almost dying.
 It was an ambitious return to nature, I will admit. Along with my travel companions -- Rosemary Feitelberg, one of my closest friends who had been enlisted in this adventure because Chris Smith, her boyfriend, is sturdy and rugged and mine would have nothing to do with a vacation that was limited to only one outfit change -- I had planned an eight-day hike (we ended up taking nine) along the Wonderland Trail, a 93-mile loop of moderate difficulty that sits like a necklace around the base of Rainier. The trail actually encircles the mountain, tracing the contours and ridges of the great volcano on a path that is nearly always vertical, either going uphill or down. Bette Filley in her 40-year-old guide, ''Discovering the Wonders of the Wonderland Trail,'' said the trek was ''like walking the crimped edge of an immense pie crust.''
 Only about 250 people hike the entire trail each summer, during a roughly two-month peak season from late July to mid-September. Hundreds more tackle smaller portions, but to make it the entire way around requires hikers to pursue one of three plans of attack: Carry everything they might need on their backs; strategically deposit caches of food and clean socks at scattered ranger stations along the trail; or eat light.
 We had chosen the second option and, on the morning we set out, dropped off two supersize bags of dehydrated food at the Mount Rainier National Park hiker center at Longmire, near the southwest entrance to the park, where we also picked up the requisite permit for backwoods camping. A team of cordial rangers helped us complete our itinerary by choosing where we would set up our tents each night among the 21 campsites situated at intervals of three to seven miles along the trail. Some sites can be reserved months in advance and some are distributed first-come first served, but most designated reserved sites are fully booked a few weeks after the park service begins accepting applications each year, in mid-March. We cobbled together a feasible route from what was left over, beginning on the opposite corner of the trail, at the White River entrance in the northeast and making our way clockwise around the mountain. It was 10:30 a.m. when we took our first steps on the Wonderland Trail.
 THE first mile or so was exactly as you might imagine: a broad, well-shaded path that meandered through tall cypress trees, the sound of our boots tempered by a carpet of soft needles, our bodies slowly becoming accustomed to the weight of our packs. The trail traces the base of Goat Island Mountain, ascending from an elevation of 4,000 feet at a fairly even pace, with a thundering waterfall on one side, and we were lulled into a sense that our hiking experience would be a breeze. A brief note on my ensemble: I wore a turtle-green short-sleeve safari shirt and khaki -- yes, I know -- zip-off shorts from Patagonia, tied together with a 20-year-old Banana Republic cowboys-and-Indians printed handkerchief with a red campfire accent that perfectly matched my latest acquisition, a flaming-red L. L. Bean hiking pack that, when stuffed to the gills, weighed about 45 pounds. 
 Before you judge, please consider that we were carrying only the bare essentials: tents, sleeping bags and air mattresses, a water filter and bladder, sun block and bug spray, bear spray, a knife that would have made Rambo jealous, a compass and map, a flashlight, a stove, toiletries and food. We were prepared with gear for every emergency detailed in the guidebooks, including ski caps and gloves for hypothermia, though none of the warnings mentioned anything about a heat wave. The temperature in Seattle on our arrival was 103 degrees, and it only seemed to be hotter on the mountain.
 It was early afternoon when we passed the tree line and stepped into one of the most idyllic stretches of the trail, up a steep incline through fields of wildflowers capped by an inspiring view of Rainier's bald head due west. In the direct sun, I began to struggle under the weight of the pack and the altitude, now 5,500 feet, requiring more frequent breaks as we climbed. We saw other hikers, mostly climbers who had scaled Fryingpan Glacier in the early morning and were now making their way back down to their cars. They seemed to share a look in their eyes that could be described as euphoria mixed with horror. One man told us that the heat was so intense that his climb had become unsafe. He realized this when a rabbit-size rock, loosened by the melting ice, went whizzing by his head.
 The final approach toward Summerland, the first campsite we would encounter after hiking seven miles, is Mount Rainier's version of San Francisco's Lombard Street. Here the trail has so many dizzying switchbacks zigzagging up the mountainside, covered in incredibly beautiful knee-high lupine, that it invites a sense of dementia and the temporary impulse to yell out ''Riiii-cco-la'' to the hikers who are ahead of you and those behind. It took nearly half an hour to climb to the top, where I unbuckled my pack and promptly plopped down on the ground next to a prostrate group of women in their late 50s who looked as if they, too, were ready to call it a day. A sad-looking coyote was sipping water on the other side of a creek. When Chris told the women our plan was to continue to the next site, called Indian Bar, some 4.5 miles farther, they gave us a dubious look. ''That's where we came from,'' one said. ''And it took us all day.''
 It was after 3 p.m. A cheap thermometer I had attached to the back of my pack said the temperature was 110 degrees. I assumed it was broken. (It was not. We later learned from the park rangers that the temperature that day in Ashford, a town just outside the southwest entrance to the park, had reached 103, so it wasn't that far off.) In some places, the trail beyond Summerland is barely a foot wide and marked with boulders, and the terrain is suddenly moonlike in its sparseness. We began to see patches of snow, which was concerning because, while picking up supplies at the REI store in Tacoma, we were told that an experienced hiker had taken a bad fall the week before and that another had been forced to turn back because of the ice.
 Although we had reached the highest point of the Wonderland Trail, at 6,900 feet, only once did we feel the relief of a breeze cooled by the kiss of a glacier. When we came upon an eerily blue lake, bluer than the Mediterranean, clear-looking enough to be a mirage or a mirror, I could not resist a quick dip, and so I ran headlong into the water as Chris and Rosemary were still taking off their shoes. As I broke through the still surface of water, the sensation I felt was that I would not be coming back up. My legs and arms felt disconnected from my body, collectively numb, but I could sense every hair on my head stand up in unison, and then, in the same millisecond, a piercing stab through my chest. I jerked my head up and gasped. It had not occurred to me that a lake halfway up the highest summit in the Cascade Range (14,410 feet) and one of the highest points in the lower 48 states, and not a mile from the edge of a glacier (ironically named Fryingpan) might be, well, as cold as ice. My feet touched bottom, and I sloshed out of the water, frightened by the intensity of the pain, but surely invigorated.
 There was still snow in front of us, first little ribbons that were easy to cross, then wide slicks of ice that required careful attention and that we dig in deep with our poles and heels. I tried to dig with my heels, as Chris suggested, only to clip off little chips of ice that flew up into my eyes. The worst moment came when the trail, going uphill, suddenly disappeared into a steep wall of ice that was 100 feet wide and extended beyond the horizon. There were no footprints of prior travelers, nor any direction as to which way led to the other side. It was after 6 p.m. by then, too late to make it back to Summerland. Well, this is it, I thought.
 If it had not been for Chris, an experienced skier, we would have had to make camp alongside the trail that night. With his boots and poles, he dug a path that Rosemary and I could gingerly cross, and he carried our packs for us, one at a time. As he crossed the peak for the third time, I felt a terrible regret for having talked them into an adventure that was far more dangerous than I had believed, and, as we walked on in silence, I suspected they felt a bit hoodwinked. It was dusk when we reached the camp, just before 8 p.m. We barely had time to set up our tents before nightfall. I had no appetite, but we boiled water for a couple of freeze-dried meals, if only to have two fewer things to carry.
 THE second day was less dramatic. We dawdled in the morning. I spent awhile thinking of things I could jettison to lighten my pack. I squeezed half a tube of toothpaste into the john (actually a wooden box on top of a hill at Indian Bar that some say has the best view in the park), along with the contents, but not the wrappers, of a package of tuna jerky and some nondairy creamer, arguing that they were biodegradable.
 Heading south over a series of eight ridges, we were relieved to find that the terrain became less demanding and more alpine. Stunning panoramas of 100-foot silver firs, Alaska cedars and mountain hemlock ringed by countless blue mountain peaks in the distance induced the most divine sense of vertigo. My joy, however, was still tempered by nausea from heat and altitude sickness. Our destination, Maple Creek, was not much farther, about three miles on terrain that is as flat as it gets on the Wonderland Trail. We walked leisurely and arrived with daylight to spare, laughing off the previous day's misery. Only we wished we hadn't. The campsite, it turned out, was infested with biting black flies and swarms of mosquitoes. We had to wear black mosquito netting on our heads, three unmerry widows who spent the evening inside our tents.
 Our third day was planned as a 12-mile hike across the park's southern border, passing alongside Reflection Lakes, a popular photo opportunity from which Rainier looks like a snow-capped pyramid. Returning to Longmire, we would collect the remainder of our food, though we had barely touched what was already in our packs.
 Our fourth day, on the west side, we planned to hike 20 miles. The remaining four days, we reasoned, would be a cake walk, averaging 10 miles each, crossing the north side and then back to our car. But it was hot again, and the trail had narrowed to a foot-wide sandy path along a 100-foot-high incline, with a mattress of sharp rocks below. The dense vegetation along the riverbank was being baked around us, making the trail feel and smell like a greenhouse. I was becoming delirious, trembling at moments, unable to breathe and fixated on my arms, which were now covered in dozens of welts from the mosquito bites and a butterfly shaped bruise from pulling my pack on and off.
 ''Look at me,'' I said. ''I'm a junkie!''
 The itching was becoming worse. When we took a break to cool off in a small lake, I noticed that a heat rash had spread across my torso like an outbreak of measles. It was at this point, one third of the way around the mountain, that I had had enough, and -- citing Fran Lebowitz's essay on camping in which she wrote, ''I am not the type who wants to go back to the land; I am the type who wants to go back to the hotel'' -- we quit. It was simply too hot to go on safely, and we happened to be as close as we were ever going to be to a hotel, an enormous lodge called the Paradise Inn, which looks like the hotel in ''The Shining.'' We were lucky to get two rooms.
 The thing was, in spite of myself, I was really beginning to enjoy camping. The variety of Rainier's vistas -- the fields of yellow glacier lilies, pink mountain heather and tall beargrass, which looks like alien jellyfish -- and its sounds -- chirping birds and boulders bouncing down streams -- were all becoming addictive. After a night of rest, we decided to try again, only this time seeing the Wonderland Trail only as far as we could stand to walk away from our car. (The only problem was that ours was still 40 miles away at White River; Chris paid a hotel employee to give us a lift back there for $50.) The first post-hotel night, we pitched our tents next to the car, in one of the few drive-in campsites where fires are permitted, then roasted marshmallows, had a six pack of Corona and watched the stars.
 THE rest of the trip was, in fact, wonderful. Although most of the trail is situated far from roads, there are two access points in the northwest corner, in addition to White River on the west side and the main entrance at Longmire on the southeast. From Longmire, where our food cache remained untouched, we hiked north 10 miles, across dew-covered hills to Tahoma Creek, which is crossed on a bouncy wooden plank bridge of the kind you find in Indiana Jones movies, then hiked back to the car. We could not see Rainier from the west, alas, as a heavy mist had settled in the area that day, close to a whiteout, finally bringing an end to the heat wave.
 After driving to the northwest entrance of the park, we set up camp at Ipsut Creek, a spooky rundown site that had been damaged by heavy flooding but had plenty of availability on short notice. From there, we spent a day hiking the trail south toward Mowich Lake and back. The next day, we headed east toward Mystic Lake. We covered 14 to 20 miles each of the last three days -- a lot easier when you're unencumbered of a tent on your back.
 All told, we hiked 82 miles, the highlight being the final, broad stretch on the north side, where, in a matter of hours, you can walk alongside the colossal gray whale of the Carbon Glacier, then through an alpine field where marmots, which look like a backcountry cousin of the Shih Tzu, pop up their heads to issue a mating call that sounds like the shriek of an eagle. The sandy trail changes from purple to olive to an earthy brown, reflecting the pumice deposits of eons of volcanic eruptions around the Cascades.
 It was there, high atop Desolate Ridge, that I came face to face with Mount Rainier from the north, which is a humbling perspective as you take in all its grand dimensions, the stony outcrops and melting snowfields that form waterfalls hundreds of feet high, a different mountain, it seemed, than the one seen from the other side.
 It was enough to make you appreciate why anyone would spend a week walking around in a circle.
 GETTING THERE CAN BE PART OF THE CHALLENGE
 HOW TO GET THERE
 Many airlines offer daily nonstop flights to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, including Delta, JetBlue and American. In August, when I went, the best fare was around $300 on JetBlue out of Kennedy Airport in New York.
 Getting to the Wonderland Trail inside Mount Rainier National Park, about 85 miles south of the Seattle area, is not easy. A handful of shuttle services stopped taking hikers a few years ago because of rising fuel and insurance prices, and Gray Line, which has daily bus tours, says on its Web site that it will not transport multiday hikers.
 STITA, a taxi service, quoted a price of $300 to get to the park but couldn't guarantee a cab would be available when we wanted to return. Unless you have a friend in the area willing to act as a chauffeur, there's really no option but to rent a car and let it sit idly in a parking lot while you hike. During the summer, a 10-day rental with Avis or Hertz, without a corporate rate, was about $1,100.
 WHERE TO STAY
 Likewise, plotting your tour around the 93-mile trail is a logistical nightmare, especially if you wait until the last minute and want to go at the height of wildflower season in August. Designated campsites that require advance reservations become available in mid-March for the 2010 season. It's best to first study a map (National Geographic's waterproof version for $11.95 at wwwtrailsillustrated.com is ideal), and then plan 2, 3 or 10 possible itineraries before faxing an application to the National Park Service, following the directions at www.nps.gov/mora. The one-time reservations service fee is $20.
 Many hikers start at the Wilderness Information Center at Longmire (360-569-2211), near the southwest park entrance, and go clockwise, but you might have luck starting at other points. Depending on road conditions, you can start at Mowich Lake in the northwest or White River on the east side of the park. Park rangers might be able to help you figure something out. Some sites are better than others. Mowich and Mystic Lakes are among the prettiest and, if you are cold-blooded, you can swim. Dick Creek, a tiny camp on the north side, overlooks Carbon Glacier, which is spectacular, but noisy. Try to avoid Ipsut Creek, a former drive-in camp in the northwest that looks as if it might harbor a machete-wielding serial killer in a hockey mask.
 Before your hike, consider a night at the Paradise Inn (in Paradise; generally open mid-May to mid-October) or the National Park Inn (in Longmire, open year-round), both within the park confines, where singles without a private bathroom start at $104 and $111, respectively (360-569-2275; www.mountrainierguestservices.com). If you're heading straight back to the airport when you're done hiking, splurge on a night at the Hilton Seattle Airport (206-244-4800; www1.hilton.com; starting at $139), which has an enormous Jacuzzi by the pool that would be perfect for your bound-to-be-aching body. 
 WHAT TO EAT
 If you are going to hike the entire trail, it is advisable to cache food in plastic containers at ranger stations around the mountain as directed by the National Park Service. Rangers stress that visitors should plan well for this hike and be careful to avoid hauling too much unnecessary weight. But you should still carry some extra supplies as a precaution, though not so much as to share with the park's animal population. There are bear poles at each campsite where food should be placed each night. A water filter and bladder for your pack are essential for daily consumption and cooking.
 Here's what worked for us: We tried the entire dehydrated dinner range offered by the Backpacker's Pantry brand and found a winner in the pesto salmon pasta ($13.50). A jar of peanut butter goes a long way for protein, and the surprise hit was miso soup -- made from tiny, weightless mix packets that you can get from any Japanese deli.
 Here's what didn't: Coffee and creamer (too much effort), gummy bears (not ironic), fish-based jerky (stinky) and dried fruits (delicious and healthy, but far too heavy).

HEADLINE: A Smarter (and Cost-Efficient) Way to Fight Crime

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University, is also co-director of the Paduano Seminar in business ethics at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 BODY:
LAW enforcement policy in the United States rests implicitly on the ''rational actor'' model of traditional economics, which holds that people take only those actions whose benefits exceed their costs.
 This model says that crime will be deterred if the expected punishment is strong enough -- a prediction that has not been borne out in practice. Although long sentences are now common and the incarceration rate is five times what it was during most of the 20th century, the crime rate is still two and a half times the average of 1950-62.
 Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, says there is a better way. In a new book, ''When Brute Force Fails,'' he argues that instead of making punishments more severe, the authorities should increase the odds that lawbreakers will be apprehended and punished quickly. 
 First, a few background points: 
 Most crimes in the United States are committed by long-term repeat offenders, a majority of whom are eventually caught. One of every 100 adults in the United States is now behind bars; many are serving lengthy sentences. The crimes they committed clearly did not ''pay'' in any objective sense of the term. 
 Why, then, did they commit them? The short answer is that most criminals are not the dispassionate rational actors who populate standard economic models. They are more like impulsive children, blinded by the temptation of immediate reward and largely untroubled by the possibility of delayed or uncertain punishment. 
 The evidence suggests that when hardened criminals are reasonably sure that they will be caught and punished swiftly, even mild sanctions deter them. But not even the prospect of severe punishment is effective if offenders think they can get away with their crimes. 
 One way to make apprehension and punishment more likely is to spend substantially more money on law enforcement. In a time of chronic budget shortfalls, however, that won't happen. 
 But Mr. Kleiman suggests that smarter enforcement strategies can make existing budgets go further. The important step, he says, is to view enforcement as a dynamic game in which strategically chosen deterrence policies become self-reinforcing. If offense rates fall enough, a tipping point is reached. And once that happens, even modest enforcement resources can hold offenders in check.
 Consider violent crimes committed by drug gangs. In many cities, such gangs are too numerous for police to watch them all closely. Knowing that they are unlikely to be caught and punished, members can violate the law with impunity. In such situations, Mr. Kleiman argues, the police can gain considerable leverage just by publicizing an enforcement priority list.
 It is an ingenious idea that borrows from game theory and the economics of signaling behavior. 
 To see how it works, suppose that all drug violence in a city is committed by members of one of six hypothetical gangs -- the Reds, Whites, Blues, Browns, Blacks and Greens -- and that the authorities have enough staffing to arrest and prosecute offenders in only one gang at any one time. Mr. Kleiman proposes that the police publicly announce that their first priority henceforth will be offenders in one specific gang -- say, the Reds (perhaps because its members committed the most serious crimes in the past).
 This simple step quickly persuades members of that gang that further offenses will result in swift and sure punishment. And that is enough to deter them. 
 With the Reds out of action, the police can shift their focus to the Whites. They, too, quickly learn that violent offenses result in swift and certain punishment. So they quiet down as well, freeing the police to focus on the Blues, and so on. 
 But why don't the Reds, seeing that the police have moved on, start committing violent offenses again? The reason is that they always remain atop the enforcement priority list. If they start offending again, police attention will again quickly focus entirely on them.
 After a few rounds, Mr. Kleiman argues, the Reds will get the point. In like manner, one gang after another is pacified, even though the police have no more resources than before.
 Considerable evidence supports Mr. Kleiman's emphasis on the efficacy of immediate sanctions. Experimenters have found, for example, that even long-term alcoholics become much less likely to drink when they are required to receive a mild electric shock before drinking. Many of these same people were not deterred by their drinking's devastating, but delayed, consequences for their careers and marriages. 
 Several notable law enforcement successes, like a crackdown on gang homicide in Boston and strategic drug market disruptions in High Point, N.C., and Hempstead, N.Y., provide further testimony to the effectiveness of focused deterrence.
 When crime rates are high, spreading existing law enforcement resources equally among all potential offenders guarantees that any specific offense is unlikely to be punished. That leads to a vicious cycle of further increases in crime and further strains on law enforcement. Mr. Kleiman's proposal to publicly announce a strategic priority enforcement list would create positive feedback loops that would break this cycle. 
 Potential applications of dynamic deterrence extend well beyond street crime. For example, it could help rein in corporate scofflaws who now feel free to violate environmental and safety regulations because they know that regulators are stretched thin.
 The strategy won't work in all situations. But when the circumstances are right, it's a revolutionary idea.

HEADLINE: Condo Amenities for Renters

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: BAYONNE 

 BODY:
 ERICA BAUMWOLL, who began work as a teacher in New York City three years ago, spent the first year of her career living with two roommates in a cramped third-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side.
 Then she bolted to Hoboken. She still had two roommates, but ''way more space,'' said Ms. Baumwoll, 25. She was paying more than the $1,400 per month that she had paid in Manhattan, however, and she could never find a parking space. 
 So last summer she came up with another solution: moving with her boyfriend, Tal Arman, 25, into a spacious two-bedroom two-bath place in a new building. She now has access to a resort-style pool, free garage parking, and a 9,000-square-foot clubhouse that offers a fitness studio, a basketball half-court, a business center, a media lounge and a game room. Her half of the rent is $1,400. 
 Yes, there was a catch: location. The couple's new home is here on a peninsula jutting into the Hudson, out of the urban thick of things.
 Ms. Baumwoll's commute to Manhattan is now about 45 minutes, via shuttle bus to the light rail station, connecting to the PATH train in Hoboken. Mr. Arman's commute takes about the same length of time, though he drives to work in Dover. ''It is worth it,'' they both say of the trade-offs that came with deciding to be among the first renters at the first building at the Alexan CityView, part of a 544-unit complex being built on a former military base.
 ''We could never have afforded this in New York or Hoboken,'' Ms. Baumwoll said, ''even if we could have found something this nice and new.''
 This is precisely the way many renters are thinking and prioritizing now, says Jacqueline Urgo, the president of the Marketing Directors Inc., comparing the trend at the Alexan with her company's experiences leasing several other new rental buildings in northern New Jersey. 
 ''Renters today are starting to look more and more like condo buyers with their priorities, and the way they explore all their options,'' said Ms. Urgo, whose company is also directing sales at four or five sites. ''They don't just identify a location and look within the four square blocks. They are looking all over the state for the best values, more so than they ever have.''
 ''I see a lot of people not wanting to stretch themselves financially so much as they have in the past,'' she added. ''They want the cushion of values offered further out from the city, and the amenities they are able to garner.''
 At the Alexan, which opened in June, a one-bedroom can be had for less than $1,500 a month, with a month's free rent prorated across a lease of at least 14 months. Apartments range from studios to three-bedrooms. Of the 165 units in the first building, 120 are occupied. 
 In Springfield, a Union County community near Summit and Short Hills, every apartment but one has been leased at the new 93-unit Skyline Ridge building, which opened in April. That building, similarly, offers Manhattan skyline views, nearby train stations, good highway access and relatively low prices.
 In Saddle Brook, a small suburban town in Bergen County, a new 158-unit midrise complex with ''condo quality'' finishes and luxury common space is also close to fully leased after an April opening, Ms. Urgo noted.
 At that complex, called 140 Mayhill, rates are set to be about half what they would be in Manhattan, and 25 to 30 percent below those in Hoboken, said Jonathan Moore, a vice president at the Value Companies, the developer. Also, a month's free rent was offered with a 14-month lease, and various other perks were initially offered to attract residents.
 But, Mr. Moore said, the rental ''concessions'' were phased out after the pace of leasing gained momentum. ''It started to feed on itself,'' he said. ''People discovered us -- this suburban enclave eight miles from the city, surrounded by all major highways, train station with parking five minutes away, bus stop 1,000 feet from the building -- and we started to get strong referrals, people moving in and bringing their friends.''
 As at the Alexan, whose developer is Trammel Crow Residential, and Skyline Ridge, built by Garden Homes, the majority of renters are under 40, although there is a mix of ages, Mr. Moore said.
 With the economy still so shaky, all of the developers said they recognized that renters were searching beyond ''the usual suspects,'' as Mr. Moore put it -- in other words, beyond glittering and trendy apartments in Hoboken and Jersey City.
 Ms. Baumwoll said that although she and her boyfriend had started out looking for a place in Hoboken, ''we couldn't afford any nice ones.'' She described the reasonably priced places as having ''problems -- no dishwasher, smelled bad, floor caving in.'' 
 Another new renter at the Alexan, the Rev. Mary Anne Glover, who is an interim regional minister for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said she had made an intensive six-month search of rental buildings in the New York and New Jersey area to find the best price and amenity package.
 Like Ms. Baumwoll, she started out in Manhattan, after moving from North Carolina two years ago. ''I had to pay $400 a month for a parking space,'' said Ms. Glover, whose position requires frequent travel.
 When she realized she would be staying in the area for several years, she looked for an apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ''They wanted $1,900 for a studio, no A.C., no ceiling fan, no parking,'' she said. It was at that point that she started haunting online sites like rent.com, making visits to new buildings, picking up brochures and calculating prices per square foot.
 ''When I found this place,'' she said, ''all the little perks -- they even get the trash at your door -- I knew I had done my homework, and discovered the best situation at the best price.''

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Libraries Are Lifelines for Needy

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Thousands of unemployed people in New Jersey have used the state's public library system to look for jobs online, polish resumes with word processing software, research new careers and ask Web-savvy librarians for help with all of the above. But many library visitors are also quietly looking for help finding mortgage assistance, food stamps and subsidized child care, but are too embarrassed to describe their situation to the librarians. 
 ''If you lose your job, you're willing to ask for help,'' said Kathleen Moeller-Peiffer, the associate state librarian for library development. ''But when it comes to help with food and insurance and housing, that's not necessarily something you want to share.''
 So in an effort to steer visitors to a central resource, the state library staff in March created a Web site, gethelp.njlibraries
 .org, that provides links to state agencies and nonprofits, and information on jobs, food assistance, military benefits, utility assistance and even free tax preparation for people with low incomes, disabilities or difficulty speaking English. Librarians throughout the state system have been trained in using the Web site and directing people to it. 
 ''It has really cut down on the frustration,'' Ms. Moeller-Peiffer said. ''The Web site is a way for people to get the help they need without us needing to ask them about all of the particulars. And we're helping them by pulling the information together, so they don't have to go from place to place to place.''

HEADLINE: The New Gender Gap

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
Lisa Belkin is a contributing writer and the author of the Motherlode blog. She last wrote for the magazine about women and philanthropy.

 BODY:
 At first blush, the history of women in the workplace seems a trajectory of success. From the assumption that they would be secretaries to the expectation that they can be C.E.O.'s, they have crashed through ceilings (though not enough of them), made workplaces more flexible (not completely, but significantly) and transformed the face of work. They have gone from holding 34.9 percent of all jobs 40 years ago to 49.8 percent today. They are on track to hold more than half of them any moment now; it might have happened while you were reading this.
 Under other circumstances, that would be cause for celebration. But women have gained this latest bit of ground mostly because men have lost it -- 78 percent of the jobs lost during this recession were held by men. So not only is it unseemly to rejoice over a larger share of a smaller pie, it is also unsettling to face the fact that so much of the history of women in the workplace (both their leaps forward and their slips back) is a reaction to what was happening to men. 
 That was the case in the 1930s, when working women were dismissed so that they didn't take jobs from able-bodied males with families to support. During the 1940s women were invited back in, a replacement work force when the men went to war. By the 1950s and into the '60s women lost their higher-paying blue-collar jobs and took lower-paying ones in the expanding retail and service sectors or returned home; in the 1970s the most ambitious among them rebelled -- a period when women truly commandeered the train and drove it forward, often sacrificing dreams of children to get ahead. By the 1980s mothers worked because of the growing feeling that households needed two incomes, and the realization dawned that the workplace was designed to fit the life of a man with a wife at home rather than a woman juggling work and family.
 The next two decades brought adaptations -- words like ''telecommuting'' and ''flextime'' entered the vocabulary -- and because times were good, companies saw the benefits of going along. Also because times were good, some women who could leave did, opting out of a system that fit women only marginally better than before.
 Now they seem to be returning. Women will soon be the majority of workers because some are opting back in, and many others, who never left, are more likely to find and keep their jobs than men. Once again, the reasons for this are not a function of the clout of women but of the predicament of men and less a sign of how far women have come than of how far they have left to go.
 ''The things that traditionally hold women back in the work force are working in their favor now,'' says Heidi Hartmann, a labor economist and president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, ''but those obstacles remain.'' 
 Primarily, women are still cheaper. They earn 77 cents to every dollar earned by a man, and in a flailing economy employers see that as an attractive quality. Women who are returning to the work force after several years at home raising children are particularly cheap. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist and the founder of the Center for Work-Life Policy, has estimated that the penalty is 10 percent of income for every two years out of the job market, a loss that is never recouped. From the hiring side of the table, that may be a good bargain.
 In addition, women are concentrated in lower-paying industries, like health care and education, where there have been fewer layoffs, rather than in higher-paying realms, like finance, construction and manufacturing, which have contracted. Why this is true has long been an economic chicken-and-egg question -- are these professions less lucrative and prestigious because they are predominantly held by women, or are they predominantly held by women because men are less likely to take them given their lower pay and status? But whatever the cause, the end result is that the ''female'' professions have not suffered as much this past year. 
 Women also benefit from some employers' presumptions that they will settle. When choosing among overqualified applicants for a position, employers often seem more comfortable hiring a woman for a step-down job. Ellen Galinsky, president and co-founder of the Families and Work Institute, says women might be seen as less resentful about taking a job with less money and authority, and they might also be less likely to bolt if something better comes along. Especially ''if a woman is coming back to work and has had difficulty finding a job, the assumption is she is going to be more grateful than the man,'' she says.
 The point that the increase of women in the workplace is not somehow a victory for women is driven home by the fact that the most successful and highly paid women are losing their jobs at the same rates as successful and highly paid men.
 There is also the fact that equality in the workplace has not translated into equality in the home, where women still do decidedly more of the work, on average, than men. That may change as more men are domesticated by unemployment, or it may become an additional burden of this new economy, because there is a different kind of tension in a home where a man is out of a job. 
 Adding to that tension is the fact that the scaffolding that women have struggled to build to help manage their lives over the years is eroding. The most recent numbers from the Society for Human Resource Management show that families are getting less help from their employers -- in the form of flexible work options and other work-life benefits -- at a time when workers arguably need them most. 
 Cataclysms are often classrooms. What we are learning from this one is that women have not reached parity, no matter what next month's jobs data say. It is not good news when women surpass men because women are worth less. Perversely, real progress might come when we reach the place where a financial wallop means women lose as much ground as men.

CITY BOY
 My Life in New York During the 1960s and '70s
 By Edmund White
 297 pp. Bloomsbury. $26
 In the early 1980s, when I was in college, Edmund White's work was a revelation to me. I lay around my Barnard dorm room listening to Nina Simone records and reading his first novel, ''Forgetting Elena,'' which takes place in a highly mythopoeticized version of Fire Island and nominally concerns a man with amnesia. Radically and unabashedly lyrical, polymorphously sexual, phantasmagoric, finely wrought and peculiar, ''Forgetting Elena'' showed me that beauty could be a gun. Its excess was its ars poetica, an invitation and an argument about appetite, possibility and the uses of pleasure. His second novel, ''Nocturnes for the King of Naples,'' opened with the most gorgeous evocation I have ever read of the 1970s gay male nighttown at New York's old rotting piers, a twisted, rusting, metallic ruin of anonymous sex and unexpectedly sublime tableaus. I wanted to go there -- not to the piers, where girls wouldn't have been welcome anyway, but to the mind-set that apprehended the world that way, as an abundant, carnal and glittering place, populated by fearless, libidinal aesthetes. Let's just say it was a long way from suburban high school dances and ''Hotel California.'' 
 After these first two novels, which seem to take place in elaborately embroidered floating worlds not quite our own, White turned toward the more autobiographical novels and straight-up memoirs that made his name. From his third novel, ''A Boy's Own Story,'' forward, White has told again and again, with variations, the story of being Ed White: the closeted, yearning, treacherous Midwestern boy; the art-struck, out, exuberantly promiscuous young man; the successful, sophisticated writer losing half his world to AIDS; the arts elder, looking back on all yesterday's parties. Along the way, it can also fairly be said that White helped to invent the discourse of modern homosexuality as the co-writer of ''The Joy of Gay Sex'' in 1977 and the writer of ''States of Desire: Travels in Gay America'' in 1980, which mapped the brave new post-Stonewall world of the late '70s. The love of outrageous beauty, and the outrageous love of beauty, that he brought to the early novels he also brought to his take on modern gay life, especially gay male life: far from apologetic, pathological or half-truthful, White's joy in gayness was almost Nietzschean, brash and even ruthless. No more weeping by your Judy Garland records; this was rock 'n' roll, leathery and muscular and raw. In his autobiographical novel ''The Farewell Symphony,'' White writes of gay men of that period, ''Everyone had to be unambiguous, as glowing as a peacock's tail and as towering as a stag's antlers.'' And so, for a time, they were.
 ''City Boy,'' the latest installment of White's memoirs, takes up once again his life in New York in the '60s and '70s, the years before he was famous, when he was fashioning himself out of an awkward mix of desire, poverty, thwarted ambition, well-connected friends and sheer perseverance. He was often, as he writes, ''the youngest, least known person in the room,'' a condition that persisted until he was 42, with the publication of ''A Boy's Own Story'' in 1982, blurbed by his idol Susan Sontag (she later retracted the blurb in a fury). After that success, he left New York to live in Paris for many years.
 ''In the 1970s in New York,'' he begins, as if it were a fairy tale, ''everyone slept till noon,'' a statement that immediately makes one think: Who is ''everyone''? But it is, ironically, the strength of this moving chronicle that White can't quite make that sort of sweeping gesture stick. That peacock's tail, those stag's antlers -- they're here, to be sure, but so are vulnerability, doubt, failure and long years toiling at the sort of cruddy day jobs that most literary writers know all too well. White himself didn't sleep till noon; he had to show up at the office before then. In ''City Boy,'' White is as amusing and raucous as ever, but he also lets the mask slip. The prose tends toward the straightforward; sex is mentioned but rarely described in detail; and if White is sometimes slightly cranky about, say, the state of literature today or certain eminent artistic closet cases (Jasper Johns, Sontag, Cy Twombly, Elizabeth Bishop et al.), he is also more openly tender and affectionate. His losses and struggles, as a consequence, seem less sculpted, but more real. ''City Boy'' is a memoir not so much of desire, inspiration or even treachery as it is of work.
 It's a relief. One can't glitter in antlers all the time, and sometimes the spirit gum holding on that peacock's tail just won't stick. White describes himself in those years as a lonely, absurdly ambitious (''I wanted my prose to be un-American, not of any era, unidentifiable because it was original''), ''self-hating,'' somewhat sexist (''I didn't think of women as horny but as needy''), pseudo-Marxist, insecure transplant from the Midwest who spent long hours pumping up at the Sheridan Square gym when he wasn't at his job at Time-Life Books, ''wasting time.'' More than once, he fell in love with a man who didn't return his love, whereupon White moved in with the elusive beloved so that he could spend his time weeping over his roommate. ''I was a free agent,'' White writes, with what one can only imagine is a wry smile; freedom at one point meaning that ''now I was 30 and unemployed and living in a roach trap.''
 The New York of that time was ''a broken city,'' crime-ridden and nearly bankrupt. ''Forgetting Elena,'' the book whose otherworldly beauty took my head off, took White three years to write and was rejected by more than 20 publishers, and when it was finally published, it was often reviewed as a mystery. By 30, he already felt he was too old for the scene in the back rooms and piers, though he apparently managed to drag himself there nonetheless. At 19, I was too young to understand that what White was writing was as much a dream to him as it was to me. I thought he must live like that, this fabulous Edmund White person. Now, I see his invention as the mortal gift it is, dreamed up in a roach trap by an office worker, and all the more precious for that.
 What got White through were his friends. The lovers come and go, but over all ''City Boy'' is a chain of deep friendships and lifelong conversations. The eminent poet and translator Richard Howard; David Kalstone, an English professor at Rutgers; Marilyn Schaefer, model for the ''Maria'' in much of White's fiction and a wildly smart, free-thinking, bisexual painter; the poet James Merrill; Richard Sennett, a legendary sociology professor and bon vivant; Sontag, until White savaged her in his novel ''Caracole''; and many others. For gay New Yorkers in the '70s, according to White, friendship had ''the starring role.'' He writes, ''We could say strategic things to lovers and seductive things to tricks, but a friend deserved the truth.'' Many of these friends, of course, are now dead. ''AIDS killed off most of my circle,'' White writes, succinctly. The New York that he left in 1982 was about to become a graveyard. ''City Boy,'' plain-spoken and knowing, is a survivor's tale, a missive from one of those antlered boys of that era to the others who are gone: this is who we were, this is how it was, this was our city. Some stories don't need to be embellished to glow.

 BODY:
WHILE a wave of foreclosures is sweeping the country, foreclosure auctions are still relatively rare events in the Manhattan residential market. But they are on the increase. 
 When they happen, brownstone neighbors worried about abandonment and condominium boards worried about common charges puzzle over what they say about the troubled economy. 
 But foreclosures here can say as much about inattention and laxity in the mortgage system as they do about individual failings or tragedy.
 Last month, a ninth-floor apartment facing Broadway at 89th Street was put up for auction at the New York County Courthouse. It had no bidders at the minimum price of $1.67 million, and title was transferred to the bank, JPMorgan Chase. 
 At first glance, it would seem that the 1,837-square-foot seven-room apartment was a bargain. It has 10 1/2-foot ceilings, a formal living room, a dining room and three bedrooms. The price works out to about $910 per square foot, a bargain for the neighborhood even in these tough times.
 But it turns out that the apartment is not what it seems. Apartment 9D has been occupied by tenants protected by state rent regulations since the building was converted to a condo in 1986. The fact that these tenants can't be evicted undermines the value of the apartments. 
 Records show that Mustafa Baskoy paid $1.66 million for the apartment in July 2007, when the housing market seemed as if it might go up forever, with a $1.5 million mortgage from Washington Mutual, the failed bank taken over by JPMorgan. 
 Mr. Baskoy bought the apartment from someone who had bought it earlier in the day for $840,000. On that same eventful day, Mr. Baskoy also paid $2.45 million for a second, smaller place in the building, now also at risk of foreclosure.
 Two months later, he received a $375,000 home equity loan on the larger apartment from Wells Fargo, and soon after that, he stopped paying his mortgage and common charge. 
 Now Mr. Baskoy has disappeared, leaving an unpaid tab of more than $20,000 in common charges, according to court filings as of January 2009. 
 Ronald J. Gold, a lawyer who represents the condo board, sees the Baskoy transactions as a good illustration of runaway lending. ''How this guy was able to get his mortgage and get his secondary financing and then buy a second apartment is a mystery, '' Mr. Gold said.

HEADLINE: Man of 4,000 Rooms

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Sam Chang, the hotel king of New York, surveyed a portion of his domain from West 39th Street, a gritty block south of the Port Authority, from where he can see not one, not two, but a half-dozen of his hotel sites on a single block. ''They ought to name this block for me,'' he said.
 Mr. Chang, 49, a compact man with a brush cut, then marched through the lobby of his Hampton Inn, one of three hotels he shoehorned into a single 32-story building. On the 20th floor, he opened a door to a secret of his success: Two beds, a desk and bureaus somehow sat comfortably in a room the size of a Park Avenue closet: 250 square feet, about $200 a night. 
 ''It's small compared to a regular hotel,'' Mr. Chang conceded. ''But as long as you customize the furniture, you don't feel it.'' 
 In a city known for the glamour of its landmark hotels -- like the gilded Waldorf-Astoria or the storied Plaza -- and the anonymity of its flophouses, Mr. Chang has built an empire of beds for a heretofore ignored class: the budget traveler. And no one has ever built more hotels in the city than Mr. Chang, who has created 37 and has 22 more in the works.
 Over the past decade, his limited-service Comfort Inns, Holiday Inn Expresses and Hilton Gardens have helped change the commercial cityscape along with Red Lobster and Applebee's. ''I've got a lot of records in New York,'' he said, then recited them.
 Narrowest hotel: Hotel Reserve, 51 Nassau Street, 18 feet across.
 First ''three pack'' (three hotels in one building): Hampton Inn, Candlewood Suites and Holiday Inn Express, on 39th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, which opened this summer.
 First Asian-American to build a high-rise hotel in Manhattan: the 24-story Hilton Garden Inn, at 119 West 28th Street, in 2006.
 ''People just don't recognize it,'' he said.
 Investors, real estate brokers and hotel chains love Mr. Chang. Community groups, some elected officials and the hotel and construction unions, not so much. Critics contend he has built his empire barely within city codes and are vowing to stop his freewheeling, nonunion operations in manufacturing districts like the garment center of Manhattan.
 ''Sam is a guy where, if you sign a deal with him, it better be signed in blood,'' said Steve McInnis, political director of the New York City District Council of Carpenters. ''He's definitely on our watch list.''
 A year ago, Mr. Chang, a high school dropout turned mogul, predicted he would retire in 2010. But in a concession to hard times, he said he had pushed his retirement date to 2013 and dumped his bodyguard, though not his Rolex or his 2.5-carat diamond ring. 
 In 2006, Mr. Chang told Fortune magazine that he had $200 million in cash. Today, he dodges the question of his wealth. After creating 4,344 rooms in the city at a torrid pace since 1998, Mr. Chang has slowed with the economy. Room rates and property values are down sharply, making it difficult to sell the hotels at all, never mind getting buyers to pay twice what he paid to build them, as he did during the boom. 
 And some of the 4,000 rooms Mr. Chang has under development, including projects in the Bronx and on the Bowery, are stalled; the Buildings Department has issued a stop-work order on an 11-story hotel near Union Square for failure to maintain safety equipment and safeguard people and property on the site; and he has a second ''three-pack'' under construction on Staten Island, where the market has nosedived.
 Mr. Chang, who has taken two trips to bankruptcy court in the past, said he would not make it a trifecta. ''I'm more conservative now on debt,'' he said. ''We have operating hotels producing a cash flow. I'm just going to slow down and continue to do what I'm good at.''
 For a long time -- let's call it the Pre-Chang Period -- the hotel market in New York operated on some widely embraced tenets. Given the high cost of land, developers focused on building luxury hotels like the Four Seasons or the Mandarin Oriental. Their target guest: the business executive on an expense account. Travelers unwilling to pay hundreds of dollars a night were left to choose from worn tourist hotels like the Carter and the Milford Plaza, or lodgings in New Jersey.
 Mr. Chang's innovation was to bring the limited-service brands that line the highways of Middle America, like Holiday Inn Express or Hilton Garden Inn, to its commercial capital. These hotels did not have restaurants or room service -- usually just a breakfast bar with make-your-own waffles -- but they had clean rooms and international reservations systems, and could command respectable rates from $100 to $220 a night. The surprising little secret: they had a higher profit margin than their upscale brethren. 
 The chains were so eager to get into New York City that Mr. Chang was able to persuade them to set aside their cookie-cutter standards, designing custom furniture to fill 200-square-foot rooms in Manhattan instead of their typical 350 square feet.
 ''It's a bit spartan,'' said Carole Lincoln, a visitor from England who spent some time last month in a $147-a-night room at Mr. Chang's Holiday Inn Express on 39th Street. ''But it's what I expected for the price. It's clean and it's centrally located.'' 
 To hedge the risk of buying more than $150 million in properties, Mr. Chang brought in partners, like Hersha Hospitality Trust, Magna Hospitality Group and Gemini Real Estate Advisors, who sometimes financed and frequently bought the hotels before or shortly after completion. He managed to control development costs in part by becoming partners in a construction company. And he searched for inexpensive parcels on narrow midblock sites that were zoned for manufacturing, not residential or commercial towers, but had a loophole allowing hotels.
 ''It seems like a simple formula,'' said Thomas McConnell, senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage that has worked with Mr. Chang on several deals, ''but he was the only one who did it, and did it without much of an organization.''
 Mr. Chang, it turns out, is an organization all by himself, a hard-bargaining dealmaker who acts swiftly and carries most of the details in his head, sharing little information about his partners with anyone. With little effort, he can rattle off the number of hotels, the number of rooms in each and how much he paid for a particular parcel of land.
 ''Three words describe Sam Chang,'' Mr. Chang likes to say. ''Working. Working. Working.''
 He defied the accepted wisdom by building 17 hotels on the once-industrial West Side of Manhattan between 24th and 44th Streets, often making a decision on the spot about whether to snatch up an available property. He named his company the McSam Hotel Group. 
 ''He'd buy without due diligence,'' said Alan P. Miller, senior director of Eastern Consolidated, a real estate brokerage firm, who has worked with Mr. Chang. ''He pays all cash. Gambler or not, he's an expert hotel builder.''
 With Mr. Chang, everything is for sale. For years, he has bought and sold a succession of increasingly larger houses on Long Island.
 Since 2006, home has been a six-bedroom, $3 million estate with a private lake on 18 acres in secluded Centre Island, where Billy Joel is a neighbor. That house is now on the market.
 In the garage is Mr. Chang's 2006 birthday present to himself: a Maybach, a limited-edition, $500,000 German sedan. He likes to describe how the rear seats can slide into a horizontal position, like the first-class seats on a jet. There is also a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes.
 Mr. Chang throws an annualNew Year's Eve party in Flushing for 200 real estate, construction and financing executives. He is, by his estimation, a ''good drinker'' who prefers Johnny Walker Blue, a rare Scotch that sells for $220 a bottle.
 The expensive jewelry, the fancy liquor and the big houses and cars are a form of revenge, said his friend Michael Kang, an architect who designed some of Mr. Chang's hotels in Queens. When Mr. Chang moved to New York in 1996, he was broke and many people in the Chinese community looked down on him, Mr. Kang said. ''They said he was a nobody.'' 
 Born in Taiwan, Shan Leong Chang moved to Japan with his family when he was a child. He left school at 17 because, he said, he did not want to waste time. ''I tell everybody I went to homemade college,'' he said.
 He came to the United States in 1977 to help his parents run the 11-room Richards Motel in downtown Los Angeles. By the early 1980s, he had moved to Baltimore, where he operated a succession of Chinese restaurants before buying his first hotel, in Hagerstown, Md., with financing from Taiwanese investors and his cousins. Straining under debt during the recession in 1990, Mr. Chang tumbled into bankruptcy court, where he lost five hotels. 
 He quickly bounced back, assembling a dozen hotels between Boston and Washington. After a dispute with his cousins, Mr. Chang went to Natchez, Miss., in an ill-fated bid to open a riverboat casino. When he filed for bankruptcy a second time, in 1996, he had $300 in his pocket and $27.7 million in debts, according to court records.
 ''He fell in love with every deal that came across his desk,'' said Alan M. Grochal, a Baltimore lawyer who worked for Mr. Chang at the time. ''A lot of dead-dog losers. He had an incredible amount of debt arising out of many, many deals.'' 
 Within months, Mr. Chang was back in business, now in New York, where he struggled to build a Howard Johnson's in Flushing and what became a Comfort Inn at Kennedy Airport. He was rapidly running out of money when he met a wealthy Chinatown garment factory owner, John Lam, who became his financial partner for seven years. 
 Mr. Lam ultimately split off and created his own company, and is now a rival. Mr. Chang now owns 31 hotels around the country, including 12 of the 37 he has built in New York. Another two are in Anchorage, Alaska, a stopover on his frequent trips to China. ''I figured if I have to stop in Alaska,'' he said, ''I should own some hotels there.''
 Mr. Chang's hotels have been popular with budget travelers, but not with New York City community boards or the construction and hotel workers' unions. Since December 2006, his construction company, Tritel, has accumulated 207 serious building violations, 47 of which are still unresolved. Community Board 7 in the Bronx often found him unresponsive when work on a hotel near Fordham University weakened the foundation of an adjoining home, flooding the basement. 
 ''Their whole approach to the community was very dismissive,'' said Gregory Faulkner, chairman of the community board.
 Some construction unions clashed with Mr. Chang in 2006, while he was building three hotels on the West Side with nonunion contractors. After a pitched battle on the street, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo opened an investigation into claims that one of Mr. Chang's subcontractors was paying immigrant workers substandard wages and using a two-tiered system that offered higher pay for young Irish workers than for Brazilians from Newark. 
 Mr. Chang later worked out an agreement with the carpenters' union to use union contractors on his larger projects, but that appears to be unraveling.
 The Hotel Trades Council, which represents workers at most large hotels in Manhattan, sees Mr. Chang as a direct threat. The union recently persuaded the Bloomberg administration to create a special permit requiring City Council approval to develop hotels in manufacturing districts.
 ''What this city can't afford is an oversupply of limited-service hotels in manufacturing zones, which will inevitably squeeze out the remaining industrial jobs in the city,'' said Neal Kwatra, political director of the trades council.
 Asked about the safety, community and union complaints, Mr. Chang played down the criticism, and said it was difficult to avoid citations while building in New York, particularly given the current crackdown on safety. He said his companies worked quickly to fix problems, whether with the Buildings Department or community boards. 
 ''There have been issues with various constituencies,'' acknowledged Mr. Chang's main architect, Gene Kaufman. ''All have been worked out satisfactorily for both sides.''
 In any event, hotel operators are caught between slumping business travel and a glut of more than 10,000 new hotel rooms that have opened in New York City over the past few years.
 Room rates and revenues at both budget and luxury hotels have dropped 30 percent, according to the hotel consulting firm Lodging Advisors, which estimates that that translates into a 60 percent cut in profits. The hotel occupancy rate in Manhattan dropped to 76 percent this year from 84 percent a year ago, according to PKF Consulting, though July occupancy was 84 percent, the same level as in July 2008.
 ''I think it's going to be a struggle for Sam to achieve the rates and occupancy that he had projected when he conceived of these projects,'' said Jeff Davis, executive vice president of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, a real estate management and investment firm.
 In a sign of stress, Mr. Chang has not been paying the interest-only loans for four projects financed by Hersha Hospitality Trust. Hersha acknowledged in a conference call with hotel analysts in August that it decided to add the unpaid payments to the principal on the loan.
 William T. Obeid, chief executive of Gemini Real Estate Advisors, which has bought three hotels from Mr. Chang, also was upbeat about Mr. Chang's future.
 ''He's an incredible survivor, an incredible fighter,'' Mr. Obeid said. ''He is not going to let these projects just fall by the wayside. There's value, maybe not as much as there was 18 months ago, but he'll figure out the situation.''

HEADLINE: The Cost Of Saving These Whales

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AMID all the talk about systemic risk regulators, consumer protection and other fixes to our fractured financial system, there is a troubling silence on what may be the single most important reform: how to rid ourselves of banks that are so big and interconnected that their very existence threatens the world. 
 Too big to fail is too hard to kill, it seems. 
 During the credit bust, our leaders embraced the too-big-to-fail policy, reluctantly bailing out large institutions to save the system from collapse, they said. Yet even as the crisis has abated, these policy makers have shown little interest in cutting financial monsters down to size. This is especially disturbing given that some institutions have grown even larger as a result of the mess. 
 It is perverse, of course, to reward big banks' mistakes with bailouts financed by beleaguered taxpayers. But the too-big-to-fail doctrine benefits the banks in other ways as well: the implication that an institution will not be allowed to fall gives it significant cost advantages over smaller, perhaps more responsible competitors. 
 Quantifying these advantages is difficult, though. While bailouts have numbers attached to them, hidden benefits, again subsidized by the taxpayer, are harder to assess. The result is that taxpayers may mistakenly believe that when a bailout recipient repays a loan, subsidies received by the institution have stopped.
 Because our government wouldn't dream of calculating the hidden costs associated with the bailout binge -- taxpayers might become even angrier than they already are -- it is gratifying that the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal research group in Washington, has taken a stab at the task. 
 Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the center, and Travis McArthur, a research intern, analyzed banks' costs of money to compare the interest rate that smaller banks pay to attract deposits and borrow funds with the rate paid by behemoths perceived as too big to fail. 
 Using data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr. Baker's study found that the spread between the average cost at smaller banks and at larger institutions widened significantly after March 2008, when the United States government brokered the Bear Stearns rescue. 
 From the beginning of 2000 through the fourth quarter of 2007, the cost of funds for small institutions averaged 0.29 percentage point more than that of banks with $100 billion or more in assets. But from late 2008 through June 2009, when bailouts for large institutions became expected, this spread widened to an average of 0.78 percentage point. 
 At that level, Mr. Baker calculated, the total taxpayer subsidy for the 18 large bank holding companies was $34.1 billion a year. 
 Mr. Baker is the first to note that the expanding gap may not be attributable solely to the too-big-to-fail policy. Banks' cost of money has risen during other times of economic uncertainty, like the recession of 2001. After that downturn, the cost-of-funds spread between small and large banks rose to 0.69 percentage point. 
 Given that increase, Mr. Baker said, one could calculate a more conservative assessment of the too-big-to-fail subsidy. Using the difference between the spread during the last recession and the current figure, which is 0.09 percentage point, the annual subsidy for the large banks reached $6.3 billion. 
 Mr. Baker says it is important to continue measuring this difference in costs to see whether the subsidy disappears or whether it is a continuing transfer of income. If the spread vanishes, it could indicate that rock-bottom interest rates and excessive market turbulence were responsible for the wide gap.
 ''Recognizing that you can't have a definitive answer to this, it is important to understand there is real money at stake,'' he said. ''There is a subsidy here, and we either have to say we are going to break up the banks and get rid of the subsidy, or if we don't do that, then we have to be confident that we have put in enough regulation to offset the subsidy.''
 Such offsets could include higher capital requirements for large institutions or restrictions on assets that banks are allowed to hold, Mr. Baker said. You can be sure that financial institutions would object strenuously to any such changes -- after all, they have little to lose when their own failure isn't an option.
 If Mr. Baker is correct about the estimated size of the subsidy, the costs of too-big-to-fail are substantial when compared with other government programs. At $34.1 billion a year, the subsidy is more than twice the grant given under Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, a $16.5 billion program that helps recipients move from welfare to work. A $6.3 billion subsidy would be roughly what the government spent in 2008 on the Global Health and Child Survival program, an initiative aimed at preventing malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis. 
 The subsidy also looms large when compared with bank profits. Mr. Baker's estimate of $34.1 billion would be equal to almost 50 percent of projected profits this year at the 18 largest institutions. The $6.3 billion estimate would amount to 9.1 percent of expected earnings. 
 In specific cases, the subsidies may even exceed a bank's profits. For example, Mr. Baker's assessment of the benefit provided to Capital One ranges from 31 percent of profits to a possible 166 percent. He calculates that the subsidy to Regions Bank ranges from 17 percent of its earnings to 92 percent. 
 ''This should concern policy makers,'' Mr. Baker noted, ''since it would imply that a substantial portion of the profits of the largest banks is essentially a redistribution from taxpayers to the banks, rather than the outcome of market transactions.''
 FORCING policy leaders to dismantle too-big-to-fail banks will not be easy. These institutions want to maintain the status quo, and they wield enormous power. 
 Still, taxpayers have a right to know the extent to which those institutions are benefiting from the backstops that are in place. The analysis provided by Mr. Baker and his colleagues is an important step in this direction. Too-big-to-fail is already an extremely costly policy; the longer it is allowed to persist, the heavier this taxpayer burden will become.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KELLY, RICHARD J

 BODY:
KELLY--Richard J. (Dick). May 4, 1934 September 26, 2009. Born in Yonkers, NY. Dick attended Jamaica High School in Queens, NY. He was a graduate of CUNY Queens College earning a B.S. degree in Accounting and Economics. 
Dick earned his Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license and was the youngest professional to be named Partner at KPMG (Hurdman and Cran-ston at the time). Dick rose to become managing partner of the KPMG Stamford, CT office. After retirement at age 55 he was recruited by KPMG to be managing partner again, but this time for a start-up office in St. Maarten. After just 18 months the office had established itself on the island and Dick was told "you did such a good job building this practice we don't need you anymore." He then joined the Rotary Club and started his own practice for 4++ years along with a senior partner. Dick was also a prolific writer. He authored "The Advertising Budget," a standard reference work of The Association of National Advertisers which was translated into four languages and was an international business book best seller. Dick served as a consulting editor for the national accounting magazines "CPA" and "The Journal of Accountancy." He was a member of several professional and social organizations including a founding member of The Wild Geese, an organization that promotes Irish American heritage. While living in Croton-on-Hudson, NY, he was very active in community affairs. He became a Village Trustee, member of the Croton Council Knights of Columbus, parishioner of Holy Name of Mary Church, was an umpire, coach and six-year member of the Croton Little League Board of Directors. But it was his position as Little League sports columnist of the two local newspapers he was most proud. For three years he wrote a weekly newspaper column on Little League happenings in Croton. "There's one thing I'm quite proud of in writing those columns," he said. "Every year by using a little imagination, I was able to work in the name of every player in the league. It really meant something for those kids to see their names in print." His main interests were his extended family, friends, The Brooklyn Dodgers (and subsequently NY Mets), golf, reading, particularly history and politics, crossword puzzles, traveling and organic gardening. He is predeceased by a brother and a sister. He is survived by Elaine, his wife of 53 years, his oldest son Richard and wife Nancy, his second son Christopher, three grandchildren Megan, Laura, Brendan, a brother Ed and sisters Jeanne and Peggy. There will be a small private service and the family will receive friends at a later date.

HEADLINE: New Script for India on Climate Change

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
When the United Nations convened its summit meeting on climate change last month, China and the United States, the two most important countries at the negotiating table, hewed to mostly familiar scripts, making promises without making too many specific commitments. Less familiar was the script followed by the third most important country at the table, India.
 India's public stance on climate change is usually predictable -- predictably obstinate and unwilling to compromise, at least according to many industrialized nations. But at the United Nations, India's delegation toned down its usual criticisms of the industrialized world, presented new plans to reduce India's emissions and sought to reposition the country, in the words of the environment minister, as a ''deal maker,'' not a ''deal breaker.''
 The shift comes as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is pushing India to adopt a more internationalist posture on issues like climate change and trade as he seeks to expand India's global stature at a time when declining American influence is altering the geopolitical balance of power. 
 Mr. Singh's government has concluded that addressing climate change is intertwined with addressing domestic priorities like pollution, energy security and even national security. 
 Moreover, analysts say, India's rigid, hard-line posture has backfired; the country has been typecast as intransigent, even as its putative ally on the issue, China, a far bigger source of emissions, has succeeded in creating the impression that the Chinese are more active and engaged.
 ''We cannot compromise our basic national position on protecting our prospects for growth, but we can see things that can be done,'' said Nitin Desai, a member of the prime minister's special advisory council on climate change. ''The signal that I get is that India is not going to be a spoiler at Copenhagen. If a reasonable deal can be worked out, they will be there.''
 With less than three months before final talks commence in Copenhagen, many analysts are deeply pessimistic that a comprehensive deal can be reached. But others are already discussing Plan B's that might give credit for domestic programs, like one proposed by India, instead of creating a global set of binding limits like those in the existing, but faltering, Kyoto Protocol. 
 India's close alliance with China -- they are co-leaders of the bloc of developing nations -- has been rooted in their shared interest in protecting economic growth and has created the impression that the two countries share a similar emissions profile, but, in fact, they do not. China is a far bigger polluter. India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, said India had one-fifth of China's emissions, measured either in total or per capita amounts. Over all, China accounts for roughly 23 percent of all global emissions, while India accounts for less than 5 percent. 
 Those disparities are why some analysts say the relationship is subtly shifting. China has now overtaken the United States as the biggest emitter in the world and is under pressure to assume responsibilities more in line with industrialized countries. 
 India is worried that it could face similar expectations, based on its population size and potential for future growth, even though its levels of economic development and emissions lag far behind those of China.
 David G. Victor, an energy analyst who has studied India's situation, predicted that the Indian and Chinese positions could gradually separate. 
 As demands on developing countries increase, Mr. Victor predicted, their bloc will fragment. Low-per-capita emission countries, possibly led by India, may try to differentiate themselves from countries like Mexico, Brazil and China, which have more advanced economies and higher emissions.
 ''The Indians need to be very careful that they are seen as a different kind of country,'' said Mr. Victor, who also teaches at the University of California, San Diego.
 Mr. Ramesh, India's environment minister, said China and India were closely coordinating their positions on the negotiations, but he also conceded that China was winning the public relations battle. 
 ''China has raced way ahead of us, both in terms of emissions and in conveying the impression they are doing a lot on climate change,'' he said in an interview in New Delhi before he left for the United Nations summit meeting. 
 Mr. Ramesh said India's basic demands for signing an international accord were unchanged: that industrialized nations agree to significant emissions reductions by 2020 and also provide financial and technical assistance to the developing world. India also remains opposed to accepting any mandatory caps on emissions. 
 But regardless of the fate of the agreement, he said, India was moving forward anyway. His ministry would soon submit legislation to the Indian Parliament that would tighten fuel efficiency standards, set voluntary targets to improve energy efficiency, push ahead with solar power and expand the use of clean-coal technology in power plants. 
 ''I want to be aggressive, because, frankly, we are a country that is climate dependent,'' he said, alluding to the vulnerability of India to rising sea waters and potentially disruptive annual monsoons. ''We don't like to think about it, but we are vulnerable.''
 He added: ''Our prime minister's clear message to me was, 'India has to be part of the solution. We may not have caused the problem, but we have to be part of the solution.' '' 
 At the United Nations, Mr. Ramesh focused on practical issues like expanding forest cover, extending a treaty program encouraging investment in clean technologies and expanding technological cooperation. 
 ''I think a lot of people welcomed that as a positive contribution,'' said Michael A. Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It showed engagement on substance rather than rhetoric.''
 For years, Indian negotiators defined climate change through the geopolitics of economic justice and national sovereignty, arguing that the industrialized world had a historical responsibility to bear the brunt of any global response while equating mandatory caps on emissions as being tantamount to capping India's economic growth. 
 These arguments are still deeply felt in India and continue to shape the domestic political debate; Mr. Singh was sharply criticized by some members of Parliament after he agreed with other leaders last summer in Italy that nations should prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit from its current level. 
 His critics called the deal a trap to limit India's development.
 Mr. Ramesh said part of his job was to build a new domestic political consensus about how India could constructively address climate change without damaging its national interests because ''without a solid domestic consensus, or even a domestic constituency, we cannot even think about engaging internationally.''
 ''And this is also true of the United States,'' he added. ''It's true of all democracies.''

HEADLINE: Dancing Into the Evening, Brazil Celebrates Its Arrival on the World Stage

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Mery Galanternick contributed reporting.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
Carnaval came four months early to Brazil this year. 
 Tens of thousands of Rio's samba-loving residents poured out onto Copacabana Beach where they danced into the evening in flip-flops and green-and-yellow bikinis to celebrate their city's selection as the site of the 2016 Olympics.
 There was pride and the feeling that something powerful had just happened to the country. The International Olympic Committee's decision to entrust the games to Brazil -- the first in South America -- confirmed this country's arrival onto the world stage with a defining moment that to many here promised even greater prosperity in the decade to come.
 ''My Brazil is solid,'' said Celso de Nascimento, an electrical technician, who danced shirtless with his wife in the hot afternoon sun. ''We have it all.'' 
 Noting that Rio beat out Chicago for the honor, he said, ''We aren't the United States, but we are getting there, and we will get there.''
 The decision was also a seminal achievement for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a former auto plant worker with a fourth-grade education who has helped make Brazil the economic and political leader of South America. 
 ''Brazil went from a second-class country to a first-class country, and today we began to receive the respect we deserve,'' Mr. da Silva said from Copenhagen after the vote on Friday, pulling out a handkerchief several times during the ceremony to dab cheeks wet with tears. ''I could die now and it already would have been worth it.''
 The Olympic glow seemed to reinforce the perception that Mr. da Silva was born under the luckiest of stars. Brazil rode a commodity and consumer-spending boom the past half-decade as the government tamed inflation, expanded the economy and narrowed a wide inequality gap. In just the past two years Brazil has discovered huge troves of deep-sea oil. 
 With the soccer World Cup coming to Brazil in 2014 -- the final match is to be played at Rio's Maracana Stadium -- the country is set to be a showcase for two of the world's greatest sporting events. 
 When he was elected in 2002, Mr. da Silva's background as a union leader and a leftist unnerved international financial markets and the Bush administration. But he adopted a pragmatic approach that calmed foreign investors and solidified Brazil's economy. His charisma and popularity, both in and out of his country, helped him eclipse Venezuela's Hugo Chavez as the region's most influential leader. 
 While Mr. Chavez has been largely shunned by the United States, Mr. da Silva has rubbed shoulders with an admiring President Obama, negotiated military deals with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and become an important player in global climate discussions. Two weeks ago he was feted in New York at a dinner attended by American Congress members and the chief executive of Exxon.
 ''The Olympics are a crowning achievement in the efforts that Brazil has made to participate actively in world affairs,'' said Amaury de Souza, a political analyst in Rio. For Mr. da Silva, the Olympics have been part of an ''obsession'' with being remembered as a great president, Mr. de Souza said, of Mr. da Silva's overcoming his humble beginnings.
 Mr. da Silva, a sports fan, threw himself into the Olympic bid process, traveling to London and Beijing to visit Olympic facilities and meet with committee delegates, and ensuring that Rio's bid had financial guarantees at the federal level. Since 2003, he has increased spending on sports programs in the country to $773 million from $209 million, the Sports Ministry said.
 In Denmark on Friday Mr. da Silva's speech in support of the bid seemed to win votes abroad and at home.
 ''I had hoped that we could win, but after the speech by Lula I had no doubt whatsoever,'' said Daniel Martins, 46, a lawyer who ambled by on his bicycle to take in the party in Copacabana. ''We are so moved, so proud to be Brazilians today, to be Cariocas,'' he said, using the name for Rio residents. 
 Still, amid the celebration, the realization began to dawn that the hard work was just beginning. Rio's $11 billion budget for urban infrastructure projects for the Olympics was three times larger than the bid of any other finalist, and its history of overpromising projects for the 2007 Pan-American Games left a bad taste in the mouths of many here. 
 Organizers will have to build more hotel rooms and complete a ring road to relieve congestion to the airport. A high-speed train from Rio to Sao Paulo is expected to be completed in time for the World Cup. 
 Some argued that Brazil was not ready to host the Games, and that the money could be better spent relieving poverty and further developing sports programs in a country where most professional athletes earn very little. 
 ''Having an Olympics here now is an insult to Brazil's underprivileged, including to the athletes,'' said Alberto Murray Neto, a lawyer in Sao Paulo and former Brazilian Olympic committee member who opposed Rio's bid.
 There is also a palpable dread that many Brazilians express privately that Rio will embarrass the country, that it will not be able to improve the choking traffic and that the city's urban blight and rampant drug-fueled violence will be laid bare for all the world to see.
 ''They are going to make the city pretty'' for the event, said Helen Andrade, who works the front counter at a luncheonette here. ''But just like they did with the Pan-Am games, they will throw a lot of spiffy-looking policemen at the situation and when it's over, one day later there won't be anything.''
 Still, ''the Olympics gives us the perfect pretext to push ahead, in reforming the cities, in making more and more decisive efforts in reducing poverty,'' said Mr. de Souza, the political analyst. ''This is an ongoing battle. But what we won today will be an essential driver in our efforts to improve the country.''
 On Copacabana Beach, the Cariocas bouncing a giant green beach ball emblazoned with the words ''this is Rio's time'' harbored no doubts or reservations. Couples kissed passionately between sips of beer. The drum corps Salgueiro, the samba school champion of the 2009 Carnaval, whipped the crowd into a frenzy. 
 ''This is the moment for Rio, for South America,'' said Paulo Cesar, 30, as three tipsy friends chanted ''Bra-zil!'' behind him. 
 ''The moment is now.''

HEADLINE: Recession, You Look Familiar

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
AFTER the financial markets melted down last year, there was some great political theater in Washington. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, told the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee that he couldn't believe what had happened. ''We are in the once-in-a-century credit tsunami,'' he said.
 Richard S. Fuld Jr., the last chief executive of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, lamented that he, too, had been blindsided. No one, he assured the committee, ''was prepared for this one.'' 
 Such performances were gripping, in their way. But they may take on a level of absurdity after reading ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly'' (Princeton University Press) by two economics professors, Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard.
 The authors use copious amounts of data -- well, actually, numbing amounts -- to make the compelling case that any well-informed person should have seen the Great Recession coming. The essence of their book is that while financial crises come in different varieties, they are not mysteriously born of undersea earthquakes, but frequently occurring events that can be spotted and even controlled if politicians and regulators know what to look for. 
 ''Our basis message is simple: We have been here before,'' the authors write. ''No matter how different the latest financial frenzy or crisis always appears, there are usually remarkable similarities with past experience from other countries and from history. Recognizing these analogies and precedents is an essential step toward improving our global financial system, both to reduce the risk of future crises and to better handle catastrophes when they happen.''
 These academics have found the same disturbing patterns in economic data from more than 66 countries: A nation's political leaders loosen regulations governing the financial system. Banks use the new freedom to borrow money and earn juicy returns. Soon, these sovereign states are awash with money from foreign investors. But beware these torrents of outside wealth. They are accompanied by bubbles in stocks, commodities and real estate. 
 Often, policy makers and business leaders step forward and say that nobody should be fearful. Yes, bubbles have burst before -- but now, they say, investors are safe because the old dangers no longer lurk. 
 As the authors note, this was said about Latin America and Africa in the 1970s, Asia in the 1990s and, of course, the United States in the last decade. 
 Bubbles, however, inevitably go splat. And what happens next isn't pretty. Countries like Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria defaulted on debt in the 1980s. In the late '90s, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff note, ''Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, among others, were forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for gigantic bailout packages, but even this was not enough to stave off deep recessions and huge currency depreciations.'' 
 And, of course, we all know what happened in the United States. The authors point out that Mr. Greenspan and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, ''argued vigorously that the Federal Reserve should not pay excessive attention to housing prices, except to the extent that they might affect the central bank's primary goals of growth and price stability.'' Famous last words.
 Some of the book's findings are obvious. Bubbles are dangerous? Gee, you don't say. But others are revelatory. Americans have every reason to be ashamed of the real estate boom. Many of us believed that we had earned the instant wealth we accrued as housing prices spiked. But people worldwide suffered when this easy money disappeared.
 It turns out that the United States isn't the only nation where a banking crisis was preceded or accompanied by a real estate bubble. The authors found that over the last 100 years, this has happened in tandem with 21 major banking crises. No wonder they suggest the International Monetary Fund keep a close eye on property values.
 ''This Time Is Different'' seems unlikely to be a best seller. The authors have chosen to present their findings rather dryly, with numbers and tables, instead of enlivening them with colorful observations and anecdotes that might seduce non-academics into digesting such complex subject matter. 
 ''We trust that our visual, quantitative history of financial crises is no less compelling than the earlier narrative approach,'' the authors write.
 They devote far too many pages to legalistic definitions and charts that are barely distinguishable from the ones of the page before. A little more color would have helped immensely.
 Still, you have to admire them for being so dogged. They say up front that they hope to influence economy policy, and they may succeed. They make a predictable call for more oversight and advocate the creation of a new ''international financial regulatory institution'' to look for danger signs like rising property values so it can prod countries to dampen their overheated economies before they blow up.
 That last proposal may be wishful thinking. But it is not too much to ask officials at existing regulatory agencies to do a better job. They, of all people, should read this book. It may be a bit too much for average readers, but everything they need to spot the next recession is in there.

HEADLINE: Will Books Be Napsterized?

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
YOU can buy ''The Lost Symbol,'' by Dan Brown, as an e-book for $9.99 at Amazon.com. 
 Or you can don a pirate's cap and snatch a free copy from another online user at RapidShare, Megaupload, Hotfile and other file-storage sites. 
 Until now, few readers have preferred e-books to printed or audible versions, so the public availability of free-for-the-taking copies did not much matter. But e-books won't stay on the periphery of book publishing much longer. E-book hardware is on the verge of going mainstream. More dedicated e-readers are coming, with ever larger screens. So, too, are computer tablets that can serve as giant e-readers, and hardware that will not be very hard at all: a thin display flexible enough to roll up into a tube.
 With the new devices in hand, will book buyers avert their eyes from the free copies only a few clicks away that have been uploaded without the copyright holder's permission? Mindful of what happened to the music industry at a similar transitional juncture, book publishers are about to discover whether their industry is different enough to be spared a similarly dismal fate. 
 The book industry has not received cheery news for a while. Publishers and authors alike have relied upon sales of general-interest hardcover books as the foundation of the business. The Association of American Publishers estimated that these hardcover sales in the United States declined 13 percent in 2008, versus the previous year. This year, these sales were down 15.5 percent through July, versus the same period of 2008. Total e-book sales, though up considerably this year, remained small, at $81.5 million, or 1.6 percent of total book sales through July.
 ''We are seeing lots of online piracy activities across all kinds of books -- pretty much every category is turning up,'' said Ed McCoyd, an executive director at the association. ''What happens when 20 to 30 percent of book readers use digital as the primary mode of reading books? Piracy's a big concern.''
 Adam Rothberg, vice president for corporate communications at Simon & Schuster, said: ''Everybody in the industry considers piracy a significant issue, but it's been difficult to quantify the magnitude of the problem. We know people post things but we don't know how many people take them.''
 We do know that people have been helping themselves to digital music without paying. When the music industry was ''Napsterized'' by free file-sharing, it suffered a blow from which it hasn't recovered. Since music sales peaked in 1999, the value of the industry's inflation-adjusted sales in the United States, even including sales from Apple's highly successful iTunes Music Store, has dropped by more than half, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. 
 A report earlier this year by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, based on multiple studies in 16 countries covering three years, estimated that 95 percent of music downloads ''are unauthorized, with no payment to artists and producers.''
 Free file-sharing of e-books will most likely come to be associated with RapidShare, a file-hosting company based in Switzerland. It says its customers have uploaded onto its servers more than 10 petabytes of files -- that's more than 10 million gigabytes -- and can handle up to three million users simultaneously. Anyone can upload, and anyone can download; for light users, the service is free. RapidShare does not list the files -- a user must know the impossible-to-guess U.R.L. in order to download one. 
 But anyone who wants to make a file widely available simply publishes the U.R.L. and a description somewhere online, like a blog or a discussion forum, and Google and other search engines notice. No passwords protect the files.
 ''As far as we can tell, RapidShare is the largest host site of pirated material,'' Mr. McCoyd said. ''Some publishers are saying half of all infringements are linked to it.''
 When I asked Katharina Scheid, a spokeswoman for RapidShare, if the company had a general sense of what kinds of material were most often placed on its servers -- music? videos? other kinds of content? -- she said she could not say because ''for us, everything is just a file, no matter what.''
 At my request, Attributor, a company based in Redwood City, Calif., that offers publishers antipiracy services, did a search last week to see how many e-book copies of ''The Lost Symbol'' were available free on the Web. After verifying that each file claiming to be the book actually was, Attributor reported that 166 copies of the e-book were available on 11 sites. RapidShare accounted for 102. 
 Ms. Scheid said her company complied with publishers' take-down requests. But the request must refer to a particular file and use the specific U.R.L.; it's left to the publishers to find all instances of a given book title on RapidShare's servers. (I can report that RapidShare acted promptly in September when my publisher, Simon & Schuster, asked it to remove an audiobook version of one of my own books and provided the U.R.L. for the one file.) According to Ms. Scheid, the company gets requests to remove about 1 to 2 percent of the files that are uploaded daily.
 To protect users' privacy, however, she said RapidShare does not attempt to block the uploading of infringing material in the first place: ''We don't do content filtering; we don't look into uploaded files.'' Once a file is removed, the company tries to keep perfectly identical files from being uploaded again, but she listed various ways that determined users can alter the files just enough to effectively circumvent these measures. (My book reappeared on RapidShare a few days after it was taken down.) Hotfile and Megaupload did not respond to requests for comment.
 RapidShare and fellow online storage services say that their services help users share large files easily or store personal data without having to carry around a memory stick. On the F.A.Q.'s page of its Web site, Megaupload depicts its customers as the most ordinary of citizens: ''Students, professional business people, moms, dads, doctors, plumbers, insurance salesmen, mortgage brokers, you name it.''
 Publishers and authors are about the only groups that go unmentioned. Ms. Scheid, of RapidShare, has advice for them if they are unhappy that her company's users are distributing e-books without paying the copyright holders: Learn from the band Nine Inch Nails. It marketed itself ''by giving away most of their content for free.''
 I will forward the suggestion along, as soon as authors can pack arenas full and pirated e-books can serve as concert fliers.

HEADLINE: The Bronx Is No Longer Burning

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
Maybe it's the fate of the South Bronx to ever remain a theatrical backdrop. Back when it was the showcase for urban devastation in the '70s, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and other politicians trekked there to perform photo ops amid the cadaverous tenements of Charlotte Street. I recall the sting of Howard Cosell, the sportscaster, who called after I took exception in print to his cadenced ''the-Bronx-is-burning'' performance -- sociology shtick ad-libbed when the TV blimp above a desultory World Series Yankee game zoomed its camera elsewhere, cueing up the latest burning building. 
 Decades into impressive patches of urban renewal, the borough is the stage for a fresh production -- a bittersweet travelogue by the poet Claudia Rankine. The innovative Foundry Theater is packing its audience into a bus and hauling it through the borough as the passengers' headsets resound with a Whitmanesque accounting of life beyond the windows. 
 The opening curtain recently was delayed by a traffic jam at Yankee Stadium that seemed scripted for the visceral work, titled ''The Provenance of Beauty.'' There were lyrical riffs as the bus rolled passed the docked city prison barge filled with miscreants, a giant waste treatment plant and wholesale food mega marts. The Bronx's proud produce of hip-hop, splendidly graffitied walls and throbbing Latino culture flash past.
 One villain in the drama is Robert Moses, who severed the borough's heart with a highway and scraped away neighborhoods to plant public housing projects. But the latest villain turns out to be gentrification. The monologue is wary as a Greek chorus at signs the South Bronx is devolving into a scene for smug young gentry. There's an elegy for the working poor who survived the worst times only to be driven away. ''SoBro,'' the soundtrack sighs at the idea of the South Bronx winding up a mere SoHo clone.

HEADLINE: The 17th Hamptons Film Festival

BYLINE: By KARIN LIPSON

 BODY:
 MIDWAY into the coming Hamptons International Film Festival, which runs Oct. 8 to 12, audiences will once again see Michael Douglas in snark mode as a success-driven loner whose cynicism is expressed in glossy bon mots. 
 They won't be revisiting Gordon ''Greed is good'' Gekko in the 1987 movie ''Wall Street,'' or in its sequel, which is in production. They'll be viewing ''Solitary Man,'' a new film in which Mr. Douglas plays a Gekko-like former magnate whose business has gone belly up and who must make some serious adjustments to his life.
 With its star appeal and timely theme of financial upheaval, ''Solitary Man'' is the centerpiece film of the 17th annual Hamptons festival, which has been making some adjustments of its own in response to a weak economy. 
 For one thing, the film showcase will run a week earlier than in recent years, to take advantage of the long Columbus Day weekend. Increased attendance, and ticket revenues, became especially important after corporate sponsorship declined last year, said Stuart Match Suna, the festival's board chairman. ''It's a very tough time,'' though corporate interest and sponsorship have picked up recently, he said. 
 The number of films will remain at around 100 features and shorts, but ''there's a little bit more star wattage than last year,'' said David Nugent, the director of programming. 
 The wattage doesn't get much higher than George Clooney, who appears in two films at the festival. In ''Up in the Air,'' directed and co-written by Jason Reitman, he is a corporate downsizing consultant (he fires people) whose frequent-flier life is suddenly threatened; Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick also star in this comic drama, which will screen Oct. 10. In ''The Men Who Stare at Goats,'' directed by Grant Heslov, Mr. Clooney stars with Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in a comedy about a secret United States military unit that aims to use psychic powers to defeat enemies. ''Goats'' is scheduled for Oct. 11 and 12.
 Other key movies also have name performers. Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon star in the opening-night film, ''The Greatest,'' written and directed by Shana Feste, which explores how the family and pregnant girlfriend (Carey Mulligan) of a teenager killed in a car crash cope with his death. 
 The closing feature, in its United States premiere, will be ''The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.'' The fantastical adventure, directed by Terry Gilliam, has already drawn wide attention as the last movie that Heath Ledger worked on. Ledger died during production, but Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law play other elements of Ledger's role. 
 ''Solitary Man,'' for which the centerpiece category was created to give it more prominence, will also have its United States premiere, on Oct. 10. (It will screen Oct. 11 and 12 as well.) The film -- featuring Ms. Sarandon, Mary-Louise Parker, Danny DeVito, Jenna Fischer and Jesse Eisenberg -- was conceived before the recession, said its co-directors, Brian Koppelman and David Levien. (Mr. Koppelman is also the screenwriter.) 
 The Michael Douglas character represents those supposed masters of the universe whom Mr. Koppelman and Mr. Levien, boyhood best friends, first observed while growing up on Long Island (Mr. Koppelman in Roslyn Harbor, Mr. Levien in Great Neck). They were ''either people that our dads knew or the parents of kids we knew,'' men who were eventually ''revealed to have feet of clay,'' Mr. Koppelman said. 
 A far broader field of flawed moguls and semi-moguls also figure into their fictional ''solitary man,'' the creative partners said. As for that slick Gekko-ish quality: certain ''men of that age almost fashion themselves after characters Michael has played,'' Mr. Levien said.
 Long Island's East End will be on view in ''Paper Man,'' shot in Montauk and starring Jeff Daniels as a blocked writer who holes up in a Hamptons cottage and Ryan Reynolds as his imaginary superhero-friend. 
 ''Paper Man'' is among a clutch of features and shorts under the festival's ''View From Long Island'' heading. As a regional festival, Mr. Nugent said, ''we love the idea of having films that were shot on Long Island or are by Long Island filmmakers or are about Long Island.'' 
 The festival's international component includes a group of Israeli movies, chosen to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the city of Tel Aviv, and a special focus on Scandinavian films, including ''Millennium: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' based on the similarly titled bestseller by the Swedish novelist Stieg Larsson. 
 In contrast to this contemporary thriller, ''The Young Victoria'' (director: Jean-Marc Vallee) is a costume drama about Britain's queen, centering not on the matron of her later years, but on the youthful new monarch, portrayed by Emily Blunt; Rupert Friend plays Albert, the love of Victoria's long life. 
 Another historical drama, though of a completely different sort, is ''City of Life and Death'' by the Chinese director Lu Chuan, a harrowing black-and-white fictionalization of the 1937 Japanese invasion of Nanjing. 
 If ''incredible but true'' were a festival category, it would certainly include ''The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector,'' a documentary by Vikram Jayanti about the celebrated, volatile ''wall of sound'' music producer, who was convicted of murder last April. (The film ends with an earlier mistrial.) 
 But films alone do not a festival make: Special events include the presentation of the annual ''outstanding achievement in acting'' award to Sharon Stone. Ms. Stone has also been designated as mentor to a group of rising young actors at the festival, and will be a prominent figure there. 
 Visitors may also rub elbows with the likes of Mr. Brosnan, Ms. Kendrick, Luke Wilson, Bryce Dallas Howard, Steve Buscemi, Ethan Hawke, Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin, among others. 
 ''We're having more stars out this year than I can say we had last year,'' perhaps because of the three-day weekend, said Karen Arikian, the festival's executive director. Whatever the reason, she is hardly against the film-festival sport of celebrity-sighting. ''A little bit of red carpet, a little bit of glamour, never hurts,'' she said. 
 The Hamptons International Film Festival runs at various East End locations, Oct. 8 through 12. Information: hamptonsfilmfest.org.

HEADLINE: The Distance Between 'We Must' and 'We Can'

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB

 BODY:
Over the next few weeks, Barack Obama must make the most difficult decision of his presidency to date: whether or not to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan, as his commanding general there, Stanley McChrystal, has reportedly proposed.
 This summer, Mr. Obama described the effort in Afghanistan as ''a war of necessity.'' In such a war, you do whatever you need to do to win. But now, as criticism mounts from those who argue that the war in Afghanistan cannot, in fact, be won with more troops and a better strategy, the President is having second thoughts.
 A war of necessity is presumably one that is ''fundamental to the defense of our people,'' as Mr. Obama has said about Afghanistan. But if such a war is unwinnable, then perhaps you must reconsider your sense of its necessity and choose a more modest policy instead. 
 The conservative pundit George Will suggested as much in a recent column in which he argued for a reduced, rather than enhanced, American presence in Afghanistan. Mr. Will cited the testimony of George Kennan, the diplomat and scholar, to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Vietnam in 1966: ''Our country should not be asked, and should not ask of itself, to shoulder the main burden of determining the political realities in any other country. ... This is not only not our business, but I don't think we can do it successfully.''
 Mr. Kennan's astringent counsel has become piercingly relevant today, as Americans discover, time and again, their inability to shape the world as they would wish. Indeed, George W. Bush's tenure looks in retrospect like an inadvertent proof of the wisdom of restraint, for his ambitious policy to transform the Middle East through regime change and democracy promotion largely ended in failure. The irony is that Mr. Obama, who as a candidate reassured conservative critics that he had read and absorbed the wisdom of Reinhold Niebuhr, Mr. Kennan and other ''realists,'' is now himself accused of ignoring the limits of American power, like Mr. Bush or Lyndon Johnson, in his pursuit of victory in an unwinnable war. 
 The idea that American foreign policy must be founded upon a prudent recognition of the country's capacities and limits, rather than its hopes and wishes, gained currency after World War II, possibly the last unequivocally necessary war in American history. At the war's end, of course, the global pre-eminence of the United States was beyond question. But Mr. Kennan, Mr. Niebuhr, Hans Morgenthau and others tried to imbue their sometimes-grandiose fellow-citizens with a rueful awareness of the intransigence of things. 
 ''The problems of this world are deeper, more involved, and more stubborn than many of us realize,'' Mr. Kennan said in a 1949 speech to the Academy of Political Science. ''It is imperative, therefore, that we economize with our limited resources and that we apply them where we feel that we will do the most good.''
 The realists won that debate. Mr. Kennan argued that a policy of confrontation with Stalin's Russia, advocated by the more fervent anti-Communists, would be neither effective nor necessary; the Soviets, rather, could be checked by ''intelligent long-range policies'' designed to counter -- to contain -- their ambitions. Of course he lost in Vietnam, where the nation-building dreams of a generation of cold war liberals came to grief. The neoconservatives who came to power with George W. Bush were just as dismissive of the cautionary sprit of realism as the liberals of an earlier generation had been, and thought of themselves as conservative heirs of the idealistic tradition of Woodrow Wilson. 
 Now, as Americans debate whether or not to double down in Afghanistan, it's striking how opinion is divided not according to left and right, or hawk and dove, but rather by the difference between the Wilsonian ''what we must do'' and the Kennanite ''what we can do.''
 Stephen Holmes, a left-leaning law professor at New York University, recently wrote a critique of General McChrystal's plan that almost exactly echoed Will/Kennan: ''Turning an illegitimate government into a legitimate one is simply beyond the capacities of foreigners, however wealthy or militarily unmatched.''
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a hawkish Democrat, has reportedly urged the president to devote less of the country's energies to Afghanistan in order to apply them where they will do the most good -- Pakistan. On the other hand, advocates of the proposed new strategy, like Peter Bergen, an expert on Islamic terrorism, invoke America's ''obligation'' to the Afghan people and the strategic catastrophe that would come of ceding the country to the Taliban. One side reasons from the means, the other from the ends.
 In the real world, of course, the distinction between these two very different dispositions is a fluid one. After all, in a true war of necessity, like World War II, a state and a people summon the capacity to do what must be done, no matter how difficult. So the objective question at the heart of the current debate is whether the battle for Afghanistan represents such a war, or whether -- like those for Vietnam or Iraq -- the problem that it presents can be solved by less bloody and costly means. 
 Americans broadly agree that their government must at all costs prevent major attacks on American soil by Al Qaeda. But there the consensus ends, and their questions begin: Do we need to sustain the rickety Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai in order to achieve that objective? If so, will a combination of overwhelming military force and an accompanying civilian surge not only repel the Taliban but make Afghanistan self-sustaining over the long term? 
 The leaked McChrystal plan argues both that we must and that we can, and that a more modest effort ''will likely result in failure.'' Critics like the military analyst Andrew Bacevich insist, by contrast, that we cannot and that we need not -- that Americans can contain the threat of jihad through such measures as enhanced homeland defense. Others have argued for a middle course involving a smaller troop increase and less nation-building.
 George Kennan was right about the cold war. But the question now is whether ''containment'' is also the right metaphor for Afghanistan, and for the threat of Islamic extremism. Containment (Mr. Kennan also used the imagery of chess and the pruning and pinning of trees) is a metaphor of geographical contiguity. Soviet ambitions could be checked here, conceded there. America's adversary was not, Mr. Kennan insisted, a global force called Communism; it was Russia, an expansionist but conservative power. By that logic, the United States could lose in Vietnam with no lasting harm to itself. 
 But Al Qaeda, and jihadism generally, is a global force that seeks control of territory chiefly as a means to carry out its global strategy. It has no borders at which to be checked; its success or failure is measured in ideological rather than territorial terms -- like Communism without Russia. Mr. Kennan often suggested that America's own example of democratic prosperity was one of its most powerful weapons during the cold war; and plainly that is so today as well. That is one weapon with which the threat of Islamic extremism must be challenged; but it is only one.
 The question boils down to this: How grave a price would Americans pay if Afghanistan were lost to the Taliban? Would this be a disaster, or merely, as with Vietnam, a terrible misfortune for which the United States could compensate through a contemporary version of Mr. Kennan's ''intelligent long-range policies''? If the latter, then how can Americans justify the immense cost in money and manpower, and the inevitable loss of life, attendant upon General McChrystal's plan? How can they gamble so much on the corrupt, enfeebled and barely legitimate government of President Karzai? Why insist on seeking to do that which in all probability can not be done? 
 But what if it's the former? What if the fall of Kabul would constitute not only an American abandonment of the Afghan people, but a major strategic and psychological triumph for Al Qaeda, and a recruiting tool of unparalleled value? Then the Kennanite calculus would no longer apply, and the fact that nobody can be completely confident that General McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy will work would not be reason enough to forsake it.
 In that case -- and perhaps only in that case -- Afghanistan really would be a war of necessity.

HEADLINE: Second City Absorbs Its Latest Defeat

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
People who live here felt that the place had been on an exhilarating roll lately. First there was Barack Obama, Chicago's Barack Obama, capturing the presidency right here in Grant Park, the city's front yard. Next, or so everyone thought, Chicago was to be picked to host the 2016 Summer Games, more proof that everyone else had at last come to recognize this place as world class. 
 But after an effort here that lasted almost four years, cost tens of millions of donated dollars and seemed lately to swallow up the attention of city leaders, Chicago was the first of the four finalists eliminated in Olympic committee voting. While many here seemed crestfallen and frustrated, some Chicagoans -- within minutes of the news on Friday -- also spoke quietly of all things happening for a reason, of the possibility of another Olympic bid in the future, of Chicago needing to ''get up again and dust itself off.'' 
 This is a city that knows something about losing. Consider that the Chicago Cubs, whose games are always joyously packed, last won the World Series more than a century ago. And if the recent, heady rise had been viewed by some as evidence that their city was finally getting its due appreciation, perhaps a loss was also not so hard to swallow for a place -- dubbed the Second City decades ago by a writer from The New Yorker -- that has taken a few bumps before.
 Barry Bowlus, a lifelong Chicagoan, likened the Olympic defeat to the city's fire of 1871, which, while enormously devastating at the time, also made way for the re-creation of Chicago. ''We'll rise from the ashes this time, too,'' Mr. Bowlus said. 
 ''I like our status as Second City,'' he added. ''It's more humble. That's where we should be.''
 In fact, the city (the nation's third most populous, behind New York and Los Angeles) had made failed bids for the Olympics before, even being awarded the Games in 1904 only for them to be held, ultimately, in St. Louis. (St. Louis, the host of a world's fair that same year, apparently worried that two international events in the Midwest would dilute the fair's draw and pressed Olympic organizers to move it.) Even then, said Peter Alter, a curator at the Chicago History Museum, ''Chicago moved on from that without a problem, without really noticing.''
 Perhaps the highest stakes this time, political analysts said, are for Mayor Richard M. Daley, who has run this city for 20 years and who, some said, had come to view the Olympics as a ''crowning achievement.'' Mayor Daley, 67, was perhaps the loudest, most adamant cheerleader for Chicago's hosting the Games.
 But speaking to reporters in Copenhagen on Friday, Mr. Daley seemed to echo his city's reserve. ''I'm disappointed, but you go on with your life,'' Mr. Daley said, according to The Chicago Tribune. 
 Dick Simpson, a political scientist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said, ''It is a major defeat for him, but he will bounce back.''
 Others were less certain. Even before the decision, Mr. Daley found himself facing some of his worst approval ratings -- 35 percent, according to a Chicago Tribune/WGN poll -- in part because of problems with the city's parking meter system, which Mr. Daley had pushed to privatize. 
 ''I think there is a widespread sense that he has been there long enough, that he's lost his edge,'' said Andy Shaw, the executive director of the Better Government Association, an independent watchdog group here. Mr. Shaw was skeptical that a city known for its grubby political deal-making could have hosted the Olympics without new embarrassments. ''The only good thing about Chicago losing the bid so unceremoniously,'' he said, ''is that now there won't be any scandals related to the Olympics build-up.'' 
 Still, few people say they can suggest a well-known alternative who they believe could compete with Mr. Daley in 2011, and some seemed to think his popularity might now grow, a result of a scorned city rallying around its chief defender.
 After Friday's decision, questions loomed here over what exactly will come of the complex bid committee operation, a private nonprofit entity that has raised millions of dollars to pursue the Games. There are also questions, among city preservationists, about what will happen to a former hospital campus that the city agreed to buy for $86 million and was to be developed into an Olympic village (and eventually permanent housing).
 There were also those who had a simpler question: What now? Supporters of a Chicago Olympics had often suggested that the Games (though they would cost $4.8 billion to put on) would help pull the city out of the economic angst that had struck it, like much of the country.
 ''Mayor Daley has been telling this city that this is the only economic recovery plan,'' said Bob Quellos, who co-founded No Games Chicago, a group that had opposed the Games and held protests outside City Hall as recently as last week. ''So what is the city's plan now? What is the economic plan?''
 But other residents, like Beth Nielsen, were already pondering thoughts of some future Olympics, a new brand, it seemed, of ''wait till next year.'' 
 ''We'll be O.K.; we have the Cubs, remember,'' Ms. Nielsen said. ''We've been through things before.''

HEADLINE: The Firing of Immigrants at a Factory

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama throughout his presidential campaign, but I was concerned about his plans for the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country. He said something about bringing them out of the shadows by creating a path to citizenship, but gave no details.
 Now I learn from your Sept. 30 front-page article ''Immigrant Crackdown Leads to 1,800 Pink Slips'' that the firings of 1,800 employees at the American Apparel factory in Los Angeles ''have become a showcase for the Obama administration's effort to reduce illegal immigration.'' 
 The administration seems to have no concern for the hardships that will result for the children and elderly relatives supported by the wages earned by these hard-working, taxpaying immigrants, who, by the way, will be forced to return to the shadows.
 Joan Potter Mount Kisco, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am a manager of one of the busiest movie theaters in the Silicon Valley. When I hear that there are some jobs that Americans won't do, I look at the former engineers, machinists and other skilled workers whom I have cleaning up auditoriums and restrooms, every one of them screened to make sure they are here legally, and realize there is absolutely no truth to it.
 While reading your article about the firing of illegal immigrants, I did not feel that this was the loss of 1,800 jobs at American Apparel, but rather the opening of 1,800 potential jobs for people who are here legally.
 If we really need more immigrants working for us in our country, then we should be working toward liberalizing immigration, not endorsing illegal immigration.
 Edward K. Smallwood San Jose, Calif., Sept. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 It is ironic that the same issue of The Times had two radically different articles about immigration. One was about a museum that pays tribute to the courage and spirit of Chinese immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (''Immigration Stories, From Shadows to Spotlight''). These immigrants overcame virulent racial prejudice in order to establish themselves as Americans who, together with their descendants, have made great contributions to this country's heritage.
 The other article described 1,800 of today's foreign-born workers who have been forced to leave their jobs with a leading American manufacturing company by government policies designed to appeal to popular feeling against Hispanic and Asian immigrants.
 Like their Chinese predecessors, many of today's hardest-working and most productive immigrants have been forced to improvise ways of getting around harsh laws intended to slam the gates to America shut against them.
 It is easy to condemn them as ''illegal.'' But in many ways they are the true inheritors of the American dream.
 Roger Algase New York, Sept. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The dismissals at American Apparel highlight the wrongheadedness of the fight against illegal immigration. This is an employer who has chosen to manufacture its goods in America, in an industry where manufacturing is usually done using cheap labor in another country.
 The message this action sends is that you are better off legally hiring a worker in Mexico, for a fraction of the cost and with no benefit to the American economy, than paying a work force, legal or not, a reasonable wage here. The money that was paid to these workers was not only spent here but taxed here as well.
 Why is it all right to send billions of dollars to workers in other countries, but it is not all right to sustain a very small percentage of necessary employees in this country who may not be citizens but are a vital part of our economy?

HEADLINE: After More Job Losses, Democrats Move to Extend Benefits

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the wake of further job losses in September, President Obama on Saturday called the new figures ''sobering'' and said that he was working with his economic advisers ''to explore additional options to promote job creation.'' 
 Mr. Obama suggested that a health care overhaul would help revive the economy and create jobs. The president's remarks, in his weekly radio and Internet address, came as the White House and Congressional Democrats considered steps to help the unemployed, including extending enhanced unemployment benefits past December, continuing a tax credit for workers who have been laid off and extending a tax credit for first-time home buyers.
 The jobless numbers, released by the Labor Department on Friday, showed that the unemployment rate for September had risen to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent and that 263,000 jobs were lost last month.
 The House on Friday approved legislation that would provide 13 more weeks of benefits to states with unemployment rates of 8.5 percent or higher. Democratic leaders in the Senate are pushing a measure that would also provide aid to states that do not meet the threshold.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, is promoting legislation that would provide four more weeks of unemployment coverage to all states, while states over the 8.5 percent threshold would get 12 more weeks. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview with The Atlantic online that the administration should ''continue to support people who are in need, whether it's unemployment insurance, or the Cobra program,'' which provides health insurance for the unemployed.
 In his address, Mr. Obama said there had been progress compared with last winter, when the job market was ''losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month.'' But the president described the report as a reminder that a recovery would be long and halting.
 The president is in something of a crosscurrent. Republicans are arguing that the job figures show that his stimulus package is not working, while some Democrats are arguing that Mr. Obama's stimulus package was too small and that he needed to press for more spending. Mr. Obama's aides made clear that he had no intention of doing that for now. 
 Mr. Obama said that the cost of health care was among the things that were strangling the economy. ''Rising health care costs are undermining our businesses, exploding our deficits and costing our nation more jobs with each passing month,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Health Overhaul Is Drawing Close To Floor Debate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the Senate Finance Committee set to approve its health care bill this week, Democrats are tantalizingly close to bringing legislation that would make sweeping changes in the nation's health care system to the floor of both houses of Congress. 
 Party leaders still face immense political and policy challenges as they combine rival proposals -- two bills in the Senate and three in the House. But the broad contours of the legislation are in place: millions of uninsured Americans would get subsidized health benefits, and the government would move to slow the growth of health spending. 
 Senior Democrats said they were increasingly confident that a bill would pass this year. ''I am Scandinavian, and we don't like to overstate anything,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and an architect of the Finance Committee bill. ''But I have a solid feeling about the direction of events.''
 President Obama, in his weekly address on Saturday, noted Friday's dismal unemployment numbers and said the health care overhaul would bolster small businesses and create jobs. 
 Mr. Obama called the overhaul ''a critical step in rebuilding our economy'' and said he was working with his economic advisers ''to explore additional options to promote job creation.''
 Step by difficult step, the legislative process is lurching forward. Proponents say they see some momentum -- more than they saw in Congress 15 years ago, when President Bill Clinton's plan for universal health coverage collapsed.
 As Senate Democrats try to secure the 60 votes needed to overcome a possible Republican filibuster, intricate details and big hurdles stand in their way. Republicans have said they will fight the legislation at every turn. 
 The policy challenges are also daunting. In the space of one year, the Democrats are trying to restructure one-sixth of the economy, writing a bill that will affect almost every American, every business and every doctor and hospital in the country. 
 Three House committees approved health care bills in July, as did the Senate health panel. After hearing from constituents in August -- some furious, some pleading for change -- many Democrats returned to the Capitol determined to plow ahead. They were also emboldened by Mr. Obama's speech to Congress on Sept. 9 that cast the legislation as a moral and political imperative. 
 The Finance Committee is expected to approve its bill this week, after receiving cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. And while the panel made numerous changes over seven days of public debate, the core components of its more centrist proposal, developed in months of bipartisan talks, are still intact. 
 After the committee votes, a new, potentially more perilous phase will begin as party leaders put together the final proposals they will take to the floor of the Senate and the House. 
 These are some of the huge issues that remain:
 The major House and Senate bills would require most Americans to carry insurance. This individual mandate could touch off an angry public reaction, especially if the penalties for violations are taxes collected by the Internal Revenue Service. Many lawmakers want to minimize the penalties.
 Whether the government should require employers to provide health benefits to their employees, or pay a penalty, is still an open question. Liberal Democrats say yes. Moderate Democrats are unsure. Republicans are generally opposed.
 Lawmakers have not decided how to pay for the legislation, expected to cost about $900 billion over 10 years, though they insist that it will not add to the deficit. The House has proposed a surtax on high-income people, while the Senate proposed an excise tax on high-cost insurance plans.
 Democrats are divided over whether to create a government insurance company to compete with private insurers. The more liberal House will probably not pass a health care bill without such a public insurance option, while the Senate appears unlikely to pass one with it.
 Lawmakers are looking for ways to provide more generous subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy insurance. Many Democrats and some Republicans, like Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, insist that insurance must be affordable if people are required to buy it.
 While Congressional leaders say they want to curb the explosive growth of health costs, it is unclear whether the final bill will make a serious effort to do so. Every proposal meets resistance from health care providers who fear a loss of income, even as they stand to gain millions of paying customers if nearly everyone has insurance.
 Mr. Conrad said that even some Republicans seemed to recognize the likelihood that Congress would pass major health care legislation this year. ''I thought there was an air of resignation that settled over our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,'' he said. 
 But Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, predicted that opposition would grow. ''It would be very difficult for a bill like the Finance Committee bill to pass the Senate,'' he said. ''There is nothing inevitable about such a bill. There is nothing predictable about the Senate floor.'' 
 Republicans are not waiting for the finished product and have unleashed a barrage of criticism. In addition to expanding government and raising taxes, they say, the Democratic plans will hurt older Americans by cutting Medicare, intrude on personal freedom by forcing people to buy insurance and impose new costs on states by expanding Medicaid. 
 Democrats said that once the Finance Committee acts this week, they will be closer than ever to carrying out a major overhaul of the health care system -- a goal that has eluded presidents and Congress for more than a half-century.

HEADLINE: Syrian Visits Washington As Part of Regional Detente

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
While the Obama administration pursued its high-stakes diplomatic gambit with Iranlast week in Switzerland, it was quietly working on another fraught relationship, welcoming to Washington the highest-ranking official from Syria to visit in five years.
 ''We came with a spirit of constructive engagement,'' the official, Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad, said in an interview on Thursday at the Syrian Embassy in Washington. ''We know we differ on issues, but the dialogue has started.''
 Mr. Mekdad praised President Obama for his readiness to plunge into the Middle East thicket, and for what he said was a more balanced approach to the region than that of President George W. Bush, whom he accused of encouraging extremist elements with his unstinting support of Israel. 
 ''We think the tarnished image of the United States under President Bush is now getting better,'' he said. ''President Obama believes in dialogue for solving international problems, which we welcome.''
 Since shortly after taking office, Mr. Obama has sought to thaw relations with Syria, long chilled by its support for Islamic militant groups and American suspicions of its involvement in the 2005 assassination of the Lebanese political leader Rafik Hariri. 
 In June, the United States decided to return an ambassador there after a four-year hiatus. The administration sent its Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell, to Damascus twice last summer. In July, the administration loosened some economic sanctions against Syria, but it still classifies it as one of four state sponsors of terrorism, along with Iran, Cuba and Sudan.
 Mr. Obama's goal is to draw Syria away from its main ally in the region, Iran, and to diminish its support for the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 Mr. Mekdad's talks with administration officials in Washington last week did not produce any specific breakthroughs, according to an American official. Still, both sides said the talks were more candid than previous encounters. 
 Mr. Mekdad met with Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state; Jeffrey D. Feltman, an assistant secretary of state; and Daniel Shapiro, a senior director at the National Security Council.
 The detente underscores the important role the administration believes that Syria -- a neighbor of Iraq, a friend of Iran, and an antagonist of Israel -- could play in the Middle East. The timing of Mr. Mekdad's visit the same week as the Iran talks was noteworthy, analysts said, because it could keep both countries, which have close but complicated ties, off balance.
 ''The Iranians are nervous that the Syrians are going to make a deal with the U.S., just as the Syrians are nervous that the Iranians are going to have their own deal,'' said Martin S. Indyk, the director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Middle East negotiator.
 The administration, Mr. Indyk said, has set in motion three mutually reinforcing initiatives in the region: the overtures to Iran and Syria, and a renewed effort to break the deadlock between Israelis and Palestinians. The negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians are going slowly, but the efforts to reach out to Iran and Syria have picked up momentum.
 Syria, Mr. Mekdad said, would welcome direct negotiations with Israel, brokered by the United States or Europe. But the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has not evinced any interest in that.
 These days, Syria's greatest tensions are with Iraq, which has accused it of complicity in two huge truck bombings in Baghdad last August. Mr. Mekdad said the Iraqis produced no ''concrete evidence'' of Syrian involvement, and he noted that the Syrian police had jailed more than 2,000 people for illegally crossing its border with Iraq.
 Experts noted that the United States had been notably silent about Iraq's allegation.
 ''There is a vital interest for Iraq to cooperate with Syria,'' Mr. Mekdad said. ''We are committed to helping Iraq become more secure. We want to get past this episode today, before tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Voters Like Mayor, but Not His Path to 3rd Run

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's re-election campaign can generate reams of statistics on how quickly the city repaired potholes in each neighborhood. It can produce memos on climate change and public health, and even translate fliers into Creole.
 Just don't ask about term limits.
 Rosemary DeStefano found that out on her doorstep in the Bronx the other day when a Bloomberg volunteer showed up, asking for her vote.
 When she complained about how the mayor had the law changed to stay in office, the volunteer recited details of his economic plan. When she persisted, he extolled Mr. Bloomberg's promise to create 400,000 jobs.
 ''They missed the whole point,'' she said. 
 With four weeks remaining until Election Day, little seems uncertain in the contest between the colossally advantaged incumbent, Mr. Bloomberg, and his lesser-known rival, William C. Thompson Jr.
 But interviews with both campaigns and dozens of voters reveal that anger over a single issue still simmers, seemingly immune to a flood of television commercials and glossy brochures.That bedevils Bloomberg advisers and gives hope to his underfunded challenger.
 Disenchantment over the change in the law helped topple four veteran City Council members this fall, the greatest repudiation of incumbents in a generation, and has catapulted two local lawmakers who opposed the measure into citywide office.
 ''The Bloomberg campaign can't convince voters to not be upset about this. It won't work,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at City University who has informally advised the Bloomberg campaign.
 ''If you ask New Yorkers what they did not like over the last eight years,'' he added, ''term limits is the major negative.'' 
 Mr. Thompson is building his entire campaign around the topic, adopting the slogan ''Eight Is Enough,'' accusing the mayor of breaking his word and preparing commercials that portray him as a power-hungry mogul who plays by his own rules. 
 Mr. Thompson's campaign aides have told undecided voters to express their outrage over term limits by supporting him, whether they like him or not. And Mr. Thompson will make it a major line of attack during two debates and turn it into a rallying cry in the days leading up to Election Day, the anniversary of the term limits change, which Mr. Bloomberg signed into law on Nov. 3, 2008. ''It will be a big theme,'' said Eduardo Castell, Mr. Thompson's campaign manager.
 The mayor's political advisers privately acknowledge the public anger, but since they cannot reverse Mr. Bloomberg's actions, they are looking for ways to deflect attention from it.
 They have created a new round of commercials that play up Mr. Bloomberg's middle-class roots, to soften his image as an imperious billionaire who defied the will of the voters.
 They are leveling frequent attacks at Mr. Thompson's record, as president of the Board of Education and comptroller, to send the message that, even if voters are still resentful about term limits, they would be foolhardy to choose an untested leader. 
 If voters insist on talking about term limits, volunteers are instructed to tell them the mayor ''is not guaranteed'' a third term and has given them ''more choice'' by changing the rules. 
 ''Bill Thompson wants to make this election about one issue,'' said the mayor's campaign manager, Bradley Tusk. ''And given his track record that's understandable. But the performance of the mayor has an enormous impact on people's lives, and because of that, voters choose their mayor based on very real tangible issues.''
 No one is predicting that resentment over term limits will, by itself, be enough to cost the mayor the election. But in interviews, political analysts and pollsters said that unease over the issue helps account for a stubborn anomaly in New Yorkers' feelings about the mayor. Polls consistently show that a large majority (roughly 70 percent) approve of his performance, but that a significantly smaller number (50 percent) plan to vote for him in November. 
 The 50 percent figure has not budged in months, even though the Bloomberg campaign has spent about $65 million to promote the mayor's record. ''Term limits has a lot to do with that,'' said Geoff Garin, Mr. Thompson's pollster. ''It has put a ceiling on good will toward the mayor.''
 Marilyn Arthold, 64, who lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, said she liked the mayor but was considering voting against him because of how he changed term limits. 
 ''He did it the wrong way,'' she said. 
 Her neighbor, Anna May, who would give only her first and middle name, agreed: ''I didn't go to college, but I know right from wrong. This was wrong.'' She said she would vote for Mr. Thompson.
 Those involved in the mayor's campaign said the issue has unexpected staying power, a year after City Hall introduced the legislation allowing officials to serve three consecutive terms, not two. 
 ''It comes up a lot with voters,'' said one campaign staff member. In the fall of 2008, when Mr. Bloomberg and his aides fought to change the rule, they made two predictions: that voters would be distracted by the presidential election, and that any anger over the move would recede by Election Day 2009. 
 They may have been overoptimistic, pollsters and analysts said. 
 ''The anger in the electorate remains an inconvenient truth for the Bloomberg campaign,'' said Bruce N. Gyory, a political consultant. 
 New York voters approved a referendum limiting council members and officials elected citywide to two four-year terms in 1993, and then ratified that vote in a second referendum in 1996. Mr. Bloomberg, in overturning the law, rewrote it through legislation that was approved by the City Council; critics and good-government groups said any change should have gone before the voters.
 Mr. Bloomberg was previously outspoken in his opposition to changing term limits, saying any effort to do so would be a ''disgrace.'' 
 Just how much it will hurt him on Election Day remains an open question, however. Many voters who intensely opposed the change said they planned to vote for him, citing his skills as a manager and a weak opponent. 
 ''If it were anyone else, I would probably be against him,'' said Carlo Dioguardi, who lives in Battery Park City and voted in favor of term limits. ''I don't think anyone else can do the job he's done.''
 As for those who are less forgiving?
 The campaign's strategy of changing the topic occasionally backfires. A few days after Ms. DeStefano's confrontation with a Bloomberg campaign volunteer in the Bronx, a handwritten letter from a campaign volunteer arrived, ticking off the mayor's plans to improve the economy in the borough. Ms. DeStefano, a 75-year-old Republican, tore it up. 
 ''I didn't ask about jobs,'' she said. ''I asked about term limits.''

HEADLINE: My Space

BYLINE: By ALIX BROWNE

 BODY:
Among the myriad projects in which the architect Annabelle Selldorf has recently been engaged -- a new gallery for Barbara Gladstone, a municipal recycling plant in Brooklyn, Abercrombie & Fitch's Tokyo flagship -- are two residential buildings in Chelsea. ''They are both nice buildings with nice floor plans,'' Selldorf says somewhat modestly of 520 West Chelsea and 200 11th Avenue, a project that has gotten a lot of attention in particular for its drive-in elevator and private parking garages on every floor. ''I almost considered moving into one of them myself.'' But for Selldorf, the few universals in architectural design -- space, proportion, light -- are always tempered by context and use. And in her own case that meant that at the end of day, a nice floor plan wasn't enough to lure her away from her current neighborhood, with its proximity to the Union Square Greenmarket and, no less significant, to her office. Ironically, it's living 11 blocks from work that allows Selldorf, who puts in long hours and travels constantly, to be able to spend any time at home at all. 
 So instead of moving, last year she bought the apartment next door to hers and conducted a full-scale renovation, combining the two and increasing her space by a third. The two-bedroom apartment, which she moved back into over the summer, is not intended to be a calling card for her architectural practice -- though there is certainly plenty of Selldorf in the details. ''It's a big statement,'' she concedes, ''except that it's a statement only for me. It's my own private Idaho.''
 The generous proportions of the rooms are classic Selldorf. What was previously her kitchen is now the bathtub annex of a palatial master bathroom, and what was once the second apartment's living room is now her kitchen. ''The thing that interests me the most in my own work is proportion,'' she says, adding that it is both logical and intuitive. ''Typically, what I do is make clear rooms.''
 In terms of decor, the apartment is an exercise in the elegance of restraint: ''I have more space now and a lot less stuff,'' says Selldorf, who likes to think of herself as precise and neat but not obsessive. Indeed, the mix of pieces, amassed over a lifetime, points to a comfortable fluency between styles that range from Ming dynasty to Modernist. In the kitchen, a glass-topped dining table with a sinuous wooden base designed by her father, the architect Herbert Selldorf, is flanked by sinewy metal chairs that are a reproduction of a design by her mother, the interior designer Dorrit Selldorf, as well as a sofa of Selldorf's own design. She originally conceived the cast metal light fixtures for the Neue Galerie in 1999, and they're now part of Vica, the Selldorf Architects' interiors collection. A Chinese armoire and an oversize Venini standing lamp (''hijacked'' from her parents) make the room feel more like the living room it once was than a space for the preparation and consumption of food.
 The actual living room, with its wall of windows, is another mix of Selldorf (father, mother and daughter alike) and Ming. It is anchored at one end by a handsome desk that Selldorf designed, cluttered with nothing more than a laptop. ''I love sitting behind the desk and having this big room in front of me -- and, of course, having Le Corbusier looking over me,'' she says, pointing to a black and white photograph of the master hanging above. 
 While Selldorf may often take her work home, she insisted on not bringing her home to the office and hired Lauren Wegel, a former employee, to do the drawings for her. 
 ''I'm an excellent client,'' she insists, describing herself as focused and decisive but willing to change course when and if the case arises. ''The truth is I've done so many residential spaces, it's a little bit humbling.'' (Many of these spaces can be seen in a monograph about her work, to be published by the Monacelli Press this fall.) ''Do I really want to spend time thinking about my client's closet?'' she asks, her answer implicit in her tone. ''Is that interesting? It isn't, but it's part of the job.'' 
 More humbling, perhaps, is the experience of writing the checks. ''Doing something someone else is paying for is about half as painful,'' she says, laughing. But what at a glance appears to be the apartment's most extravagant gesture -- the white-and-gray striped marble floors that run almost entirely throughout -- was in fact an economical decision. When she priced it out, the stone tile came in slightly cheaper than the wood she had intended to use. ''I love that it feels very calm,'' Selldorf says of the cumulative effect. ''People think that warm equals wood, but I think that it has to do with the balance. For me there is nothing nicer than walking barefoot in the apartment and to have the sensual experience of the space.'' ALIX BROWNE

HEADLINE: For 90 Minutes, a Break From a Political Crisis in Honduras

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN; Blake Schmidt contributed reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

 BODY:
While Honduras finds itself increasingly isolated after its president was deposed in a coup d'etat, the poor Central American nation is gaining respect in another area of consuming international interest -- soccer.
 A home victory against the United States on Saturday would virtually assure Honduras of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1982.
 Barring a dramatic incident, the country's 7.8 million residents will -- for two hours at least -- be largely focused not on the continuing political crisis but on perhaps the most anticipated sporting event ever held in Honduras.
 ''I can guarantee if we qualify for the World Cup, we would be the happiest country on the continent,'' Alfredo Hawit, the secretary of the Honduran federation, said in a telephone interview, speaking through an interpreter. 
 Saturday's match will be played in San Pedro Sula, an economic center about 100 miles from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. Tegucigalpa is where the country's ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, secretly returned last month and remains secluded in the Brazilian embassy, locked in a standoff with the interim president, Roberto Micheletti.
 Security concerns raised questions about whether the match would be switched to a neutral country. Honduras resisted a change, saying there had been no trouble at World Cup qualifying matches there last summer. It accused the United States of petitioning FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to move the game. The United States soccer federation denied the charge.
 ''We've never raised the possibility of playing anywhere but San Pedro Sula,'' said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States federation.
 The game is equally crucial for the Americans, who would qualify for the 2010 World Cup, to be held in South Africa, with a victory in Honduras. A heavy security presence is expected at the 45,000-seat Estadio Olimpico Metropolitano. Inside, the atmosphere figures to be tense and celebratory, given the collision of international politics and sport.
 The United States government has criticized the June coup, suspending $30 million in aid to Honduras and revoking visas of members of the de facto government and their supporters. At the same time, the United States has been accused of sending mixed messages about the crisis. From a soccer standpoint, the Americans stand in the way of Honduras's second trip ever to the World Cup.
 Three teams from the North American, Central American and Caribbean region will qualify for the World Cup. A fourth team will enter a playoff against the fifth-place team from South America. With two matches remaining in the final round of qualifying, the United States is first in the regional standings. Honduras is third.
 ''The soccer team is the soul of the country,'' said Roger Espinoza, a Honduran midfielder who plays for the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer. ''When it wins, the whole country is happy, no matter what is going on with the president. If we don't win, you don't want to be there as a player. Soccer is life there.''
 Soccer is so important that if the Honduran national team had been prevented from playing qualifying matches until the political conflict was settled, ''this whole episode would have been resolved long ago,'' said Hector Perla, an assistant professor of Latin American and Latino studies at the University of California-Santa Cruz who has followed the situation closely.
 When Honduras played in the regional Gold Cup tournament in the United States in July, nightly curfews were lifted so fans could gather to watch the matches, Espinoza said.
 A curfew was also lifted last Wednesday so that Real Espana, a team in the Honduran professional league, could play an important regional tournament match against a club from Guatemala in San Pedro Sula. This might have been an attempt by Micheletti, the interim president and a self-proclaimed soccer fanatic, to show FIFA that crowd control would not be an issue during the match against the United States, said Salvador Nasralla, a Honduran sportscaster.
 In two years of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, Honduras is 8-0 at home. Coach Reinaldo Rueda, a Colombian, has brought discipline on and off the field to a team that likes to possess the ball and attack before friendly crowds. Seven Honduran players play in top European leagues in England and Italy. Another four play in M.L.S.
 ''Sometimes, I believe that for a country and its people that are under a very critical situation, La H, as we call the national team, is the only satisfaction and emotional escape that Hondurans have,'' Mario Gutierrez Pacheco, the publisher of the English-language newspaper Honduras This Week, said in an e-mail message.
 Yet soccer rarely strays far from politics in Central America. Forty years ago, a conflict involving land reform and immigration between Honduras and El Salvador erupted into the so-called Soccer War, a four-day skirmish fueled by riots during World Cup qualifying matches between the countries.
 And not even soccer escaped restrictions on civil liberties imposed after the recent Honduran coup. Dressed in his pajamas, Zelaya was ousted by the Honduran Army on June 28 over concerns that he would try to extend his term beyond constitutional limits. Honduran elections are scheduled for Nov. 29.
 By the time Honduras reached the semifinals of the Gold Cup in late July in Chicago, losing by 2-0 to the United States, its players appeared emotionally spent, worried about their families back home.
 After Zelaya secretly returned to Tegucigalpa on Sept. 21, play in the Honduran soccer league was suspended the next weekend. Because the airports were closed, Honduran club teams scheduled to play tournament matches in Mexico City and Washington had to travel out of the country by land to catch flights.
 Ramon Maradiaga, the coach of Real Espana, told reporters in Mexico City that curfews had made training uncertain and teams in the Honduran domestic league were under financial strain. One of Real Espana's opponents recently failed to show up for a match over monetary issues, he said.
 A letter to President Obama signed by Perla and other American academics said that some arrested Honduran demonstrators had been held at stadiums. And the usual excitement over the national soccer team appears tempered by the political crisis, said Paolo Carozza, a law professor at Notre Dame who visited Honduras over the summer as a member of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
 ''I'm sure it would be an unbelievable point of pride and enthusiasm and rallying in the streets at any other time,'' Carozza said. ''Unfortunately, now, rallying in the streets is reserved for politics and violence.''
 Micheletti may attempt to use a victory over the United States, and qualifying for the World Cup, to build nationalism and lighten the mood of protestors demanding Zelaya's return, said Jose de la Paz Herrera, a Honduran legislator who coached the 1982 World Cup team.
 Privately, Micheletti might have preferred that Saturday's game were moved elsewhere, thus avoiding a large public gathering and the chance for protests, said Mark Sawyer, a political scientist at U.C.L.A. But it would have been politically risky to say this publicly, especially if the game had been moved and Honduras were to lose.
 ''It's a precarious moment,'' Sawyer said of Saturday's match.
 But it is also a moment to temporarily forget the crisis, Herrera, the former coach, said.
 ''Soccer unites us,'' he said. ''We have an inferiority complex, and soccer makes us feel like we're the best.''

PERSON: Reinhard Mohn 

HEADLINE: Reinhard Mohn, Heir Who Pushed to Expand Bertelsmann, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Reinhard Mohn, the entrepreneur who transformed Bertelsmann from a provincial, war-shattered German publisher into a global media giant, died this weekend, the company said Sunday. He was 88 years old. 
 Mr. Mohn died on Saturday, said Andreas Grafemeyer, a Bertelsmann spokesman. 
 In a world that celebrates tough-minded businessmen and their achievements, Mr. Mohn represented a type that Germans hold in particular affection: the kind-hearted capitalist who proved that profit and humanity were not mutually exclusive. He was, employees liked to say, a frequent presence in the company cafeteria, eating lunch alongside everyone else.
 A restless entrepreneur who gave his managers the freedom to follow their own instincts, Mr. Mohn built Bertelsmann from a publisher of literature for Nazi soldiers -- a role that would come back to haunt it -- into a book-club business that sold directly to readers.
 By the 1960s, he was setting up affiliates outside Germany as a prelude to a global expansion. By 2003, Bertelsmann owned a large American publisher, Random House, myriad media services businesses, and RTL, one of Europe's largest broadcasters. The company had sales of $23.5 billion in 2008.
 ''With his death, Germany and the world has lost a prominent personality who exerted a decisive influence on postwar economy and society,'' said Gunter Thielen, the chairman of Bertelsmann.
 An officer in Hitler's Wehrmacht, Mr. Mohn was briefly a prisoner of war in the hands of the United States Army before returning to help run his family's publishing business in Gutersloh, a sleepy town in northeastern Germany. The company, C. Bertelsmann Verlag, was in ruins after the war.
 According to company accounts, when he took over in 1946, he repeated what became a management mantra: ''You have to persuade people.'' In other words, ordering them was not enough.
 As Bertelsmann grew, Mr. Mohn allowed the managers of individual business units to run things as they saw fit, an approach that makes the company less a well-oiled machine than a loose alliance of affiliated businesses. He later said the experience of rigidly authoritarian Nazi Germany, and his own stint in the military, convinced him that the top-down approach had serious shortcomings.
 In the postwar years, Mr. Mohn was known as having few sympathies for the Nazi regime. One chief executive of Bertelsmann, Thomas Middelhoff, even repeated the company lore, during a 1998 speech in New York, that it was shut down in 1944 for printing banned books.
 That later proved false. A commission of historians appointed by the company with Mr. Mohn's approval established in 2002 that Bertelsmann had extensive dealings with the Nazi regime, and that Jewish slave labor was probably used in some of its plants. Heinrich Mohn, Mr. Mohn's father, belonged to a group that donated money to the Nazi squadron SS.
 By that time, Mr. Mohn, who actively ran Bertelsmann from 1947 to 1981, was close to withdrawing as the active manager of the Mohn family interests, which controlled Bertelsmann through a foundation set up in 1977. After 2003, his second wife, Liz Mohn, took the helm. Though increasingly infirm, Mr. Mohn frequently spent time at Bertelsmann's headquarters.
 He is survived by Mrs. Mohn and six children.

They came in pinstripes and clutched BlackBerrys that surprised them by going off the same way they did back home.

''Don't worry,'' one of them said he told his wife. ''It's no picnic here, but it's not as bad as I thought.''
 It did not appear that a single new deal was signed last week at a two-day investment conference in Haiti, the poorest nation in the hemisphere. But the simple fact that hundreds of potential investors showed up to network and discuss possible projects created hope in a country that has been long shunned as too unsafe to visit, never mind invest in. 
 Haiti is used to well-meaning foreigners, most of them relief workers, peacekeepers and missionaries. But this was a new group: profit-minded people assessing Haiti based on its bottom line -- and in the midst of an economic crisis, no less.
 In one conference room, a group of businessmen in dark suits was discussing how brassieres could be made at low cost and high profit here. One room over, mangos were the topic at hand. Investors insisted that money-making opportunities were everywhere in Haiti.
 ''The investment climate is much warmer than the temperature in this room,'' said Gilles Rivard, the Canadian ambassador to Haiti.
 There were big names, too. Gap, Levi Strauss and American Eagle Outfitters were here, all interested in the potential of American trade legislation that wipes out duties on apparel assembled in Haiti. Citibank and Scotiabank were on hand to discuss loans. 
 Former President Bill Clinton, the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, gave his stamp of approval as he visited last week, declaring the country as safe as it has been in years and pledging to help investors navigate Haiti's notorious red tape.
 ''We're coming out of the paradigm of humanitarian help and brotherly love and moving to the creation of wealth and business,'' said Patrick Delatour, the minister of tourism.
 That Haiti needs the attention cannot be overstated. Unemployment hovers at around 70 percent, experts say, and over half of the population lives in extreme poverty. Violence broke out in June as students demanded an increase in the minimum wage to $5 from $1.75 -- which were daily rates, not hourly ones. Haiti's extremely low labor costs, comparable to those in Bangladesh, make it so appealing.
 Still, investing in Haiti, those who operate in the country say, is not for the faint of heart. Water and power are off as much as they are on. The government, despite its overtures to investors, can tie up deliveries at the ports. Bribes are common. So are street protests. With 19 political parties jockeying for power, a deep rich-poor divide and legislative and presidential elections looming in the next two years, United Nations soldiers are an essential element in keeping the country from becoming unhinged.
 Haiti, so used to suffering, is caught in a paradox. Jobs are an essential element to quelling the country's social tensions. But companies require stability before they will create any jobs.
 ''There's no opportunity here,'' said Albert Hygens, 27, an unemployed college graduate. ''I'm always looking for work. I look all day long. Nobody calls me back. They won't even listen to me.''
 At last week's conference, it was obvious from the sales pitches that this was no typical business gathering.
 ''Don't be afraid,'' Maxime D. Charles, the head of Haiti's banking association, told investors.
 ''Not everything is roses,'' warned Fabricio Opertti, a loan program coordinator at the Inter-American Bank who helped organize the event.
 ''Major security issues have been addressed, but there does seem to be a fragile state,'' said Mark D'sa, a production manager for Gap.
 The State Department in July downgraded its travel warning for Haiti, which no longer advises Americans to avoid nonessential travel to the country. Whether that means Haiti is safe remains a matter of interpretation.
 The State Department's only other travel warning in this hemisphere is for Colombia, where terrorists and drug traffickers are the threat. Even as Mr. Clinton noted the improvements in Haiti's stability, soldiers supplemented the Secret Service.
 Part of the task at hand, organizers of the conference said, is improving Haiti's reputation. ''You don't change reputations overnight in countries or human beings,'' said Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, who said he, as a Colombian, knew how long it took to change perceptions of a troubled place.
 The Haitian economy has been reeling from a number of setbacks over many years. 
 Just last year, a string of hurricanes cost the country $1 billion in damages, or 15 percent of its gross domestic product. 
 The number of assembly jobs in the capital, which exceeded 100,000 before economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in the early 1990s, now hovers around 20,000.
 ''I hated it,'' Mr. Clinton said of the economic sanctions he enforced during his presidency. ''But when you have people being burned to death with tires around their necks, that's important, too. We had to bring an end to that.''
 As for the conference, Haitian officials hoped all the talk would result in signatures, joint ventures, profits and jobs. ''We don't want this to be just talk,'' said Michele Duvivier Pierre-Louis, Haiti's prime minister. ''We want concrete proposals. By the end of the year, we want to feel the effects of this meeting.''
 To the restless population, who struggle to get by and doubt their leaders care much, she said simply, ''Patience.''

PERSON: Shoichi Nakagawa 

HEADLINE: Shoichi Nakagawa, 56, Former Japanese Finance Minister

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Shoichi Nakagawa, the former Japanese finance minister who resigned after his erratic behavior at an international meeting in February, was found dead in his home on Sunday.
 The Tokyo police said the cause of his death was being investigated. 
 A Tokyo native with a sharp tongue, Mr. Nakagawa, 56, was an outspoken conservative and a heavyweight in the recently ousted Liberal Democratic Party.
 He served in important ministerial posts in agriculture, trade and finance, and was a close associate of Taro Aso, the former prime minister.
 But after his resignation as finance minister in February, Mr. Nakagawa also lost his Parliament seat in August in landmark elections that handed power to an opposition party.
 A staunch critic of China, Mr. Nakagawa frequently warned of its rising military might. He was a voice for the Japanese right and a loyal supporter of Yasukuni, a contentious Tokyo shrine that honors war dead, including executed war criminals. He denied that the Japanese imperial army forced women into sexual slavery in the 1930s and '40s.
 After graduating from the University of Tokyo, Mr. Nakagawa worked at the Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the forerunners of the Mizuho Financial Group. He was elected to the lower house of Parliament in 1983, winning the Hokkaido constituency his father had held.
 Mr. Nakagawa's father, Ichiro Nakagawa, who served in Parliament for two decades, had committed suicide that year at a hotel in Hokkaido, when he was 57.
 Mr. Nakagawa is survived by his wife, Ikuko; a son; and a daughter.
 Appointed finance minister by Mr. Aso in September 2008, Mr. Nakagawa sought to revive a Japanese economy that had shrunk at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter as factory production fell and unemployment rose.
 Mr. Nakagawa urged coordinated policy actions by the United States and Europe to control the growing global financial crisis.
 He also left his mark in international finance early this year, agreeing to provide up to $100 billion from Japan's huge foreign currency reserves to be used in a crisis fund by the International Monetary Fund.
 Ultimately, it was Mr. Nakagawa's widely known struggle with alcohol that led to his undoing, despite repeated public promises that he would curb his drinking.
 At a meeting with journalists at a Group of 7 gathering in Rome in February, Mr. Nakagawa slurred his speech, gave incoherent responses and appeared to fall asleep at some points.
 His behavior provoked a storm of ridicule in domestic and foreign news outlets, leading to his resignation the same week.
 Mr. Nakagawa said he had sipped wine that day, though he attributed his behavior to fatigue and a strong dose of cold medicine he had consumed before the meeting. 
 ''I have decided that it is better for my country that I withdraw,'' he said at the time.
 Mr. Aso, the former prime minister, said Sunday: ''I'm in a state of shock right now, which I cannot put it into words. I offer my deepest condolences.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Bronx Food Banks
 See Longer Lines
 Food pantries across the city are seeing longer lines, and those in the Bronx, the poorest urban county in the nation, are no exception. 
 The median household income in the Bronx in 2008 was $35,033, and nearly 28 percent of the borough's residents were living in poverty, according to census data.
 At the food pantry at St. Francis of Assisi Church in the Morris Heights neighborhood, Ines Gonzalez, the coordinator, said more people were seeking help and more of them were unemployed or illegal immigrants. Every month, the pantry serves, on average, more than 2,000 children, 2,300 adults and 400 elderly people. 
 Like most food pantries, it serves a person or a family once a month to ensure it can help as many as possible. But Ms. Gonzalez said she does not like turning people away, and tries to accommodate anyone facing particularly dire circumstances.
 ''Some people say they don't have enough for their children; they need it,'' she said. ''And they are crying, and we have to help them. They tell you a lot of stories. We don't ask any questions.'' 
 In a recent survey by the Food Bank of New York City, which included data from the 1,000 food-assistance programs in its network, 90 percent of the organizations that responded said they had seen an increase in the number of people seeking help. 
 About half of all New Yorkers had difficulty paying for food in 2008 and sought help from community groups or the city, the survey said.
 But the news in the Bronx isn't all bad. Robert Doar, commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration, said poverty in the borough declined by 1.5 percent from 2006 to 2008. And while the recession has pounded New York's financial sector, Mr. Doar said, many residents who get food stamps and other assistance from the city -- people who overwhelmingly work in health care, retail and tourism -- have not been hit as hard.
 At Soundview Presbyterian Church in Soundview, Ethelyn Wiltshire, the assistant director of the food pantry there, works with a staff of 10 volunteers who every other Monday put together 150 bags of groceries filled mostly with canned vegetables and juices, dry beans, grits, oatmeal and the occasional box of Rice Krispies.
 Ms. Wiltshire said the demand in her largely black and Hispanic neighborhood has climbed steadily since the pantry opened 12 years ago, and volunteers almost always pack extra bags. ''People are afraid they won't have enough,'' she said. NICOLE COLLINS and EMILY S. RUEB NEW YORK

HEADLINE: Report on Bailouts Says Treasury Misled Public

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The inspector general who oversees the government's bailout of the banking system is criticizing the Treasury Department for some misleading public statements last fall and raising the possibility that it had unfairly disbursed money to the biggest banks. 
 A Treasury official made incorrect statements about the health of the nation's biggest banks even as the government was doling out billions of dollars in aid, according to a report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be released on Monday by the special inspector general, Neil M. Barofksy. 
 The report also provides new insight into the way the Treasury allocated billions of dollars to nine of Wall Street's largest players. The report says that Bank of America appeared to qualify for more aid earlier, under the government plan. That assertion adds another element of intrigue to continuing investigations of the bank's merger with Merrill Lynch and the role that regulators played in the deal, even as Merrill's condition deteriorated.
 The bailout formula called for banks to get an amount equal to as much as 3 percent of their risk-weighted assets, with aid capped at $25 billion for each institution, according to the report. By size, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America could have qualified for more, and the first two received $25 billion.
 But Bank of America was given only $15 billion in October, since Merrill Lynch was earmarked for $10 billion. The two companies agreed to a merger, though their deal had not yet been approved by regulators or shareholders. 
 Bank of America ultimately received Merrill's $10 billion in January -- as well as $20 billion in additional bailout funds -- but if the bank had not been involved in the Merrill deal, it would probably have received $25 billion at the outset, as did Citigroup and JPMorgan.
 Another company in the process of a merger was not treated the same. Wells Fargo was acquiring Wachovia, and it received both companies' money at the start, according to the inspector general.
 Mr. Barofsky's office also says that regulators were wrong to tell the public last year that the earliest bailout recipients were all healthy. 
 Former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., for instance, said on Oct. 14 that the banks were ''healthy,'' and that they accepted the money for ''the good of the U.S. economy.'' The banks, he said, would be better able to increase their lending to consumers and businesses.
 In truth, regulators were concerned about the health of several banks that received that first bailout, the inspector general writes. 
 The inspector general said government officials need to be more careful when describing their actions and rationale. In a letter included with the report, the Federal Reserve concurred with Mr. Barofsky's concern about the statements made last year, but the Treasury Department said that any review of announcements last year ''must be considered in light of the unprecedented circumstances in which they were made.''

HEADLINE: African Wealth and African Style at a Glamorous Juncture

BYLINE: By ROBB YOUNG

 BODY:
Sub-Saharan Africa does not bring to mind an image of a woman with perfectly manicured nails flipping through glossy magazines in search of the latest handbag or celebrity haircut. Yet such women are there, and in far greater numbers than the news media's portrayal of Africa might suggest. 
 In the wealthy neighborhoods of Lagos, Nigeria; Nairobi, Kenya; Luanda, Angola; Dakar, Senegal; and the like, ladies of leisure, successful businesswomen and middle-income housewives make up an attractive demographic that, in the past, relied on international fashion magazines for style and beauty information.
But in the last few years, while Conde Nast, Hearst and Hachette Filipacchi were expanding throughout Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, a handful of African publishers were busy staking claims to this publishing territory. A result has been a series of new glossies, like Arise, HauTe, Helm and True Love, that put an African spin on fashion. 
 ''Honestly, upwardly mobile African readers are crying out for this magazine,'' said Helen Jennings, editor of Arise, a monthly style publication started late last year by the Nigerian media tycoon Nduka Obaigbena, who also owns the country's leading newspaper, ThisDay. ''Because the local magazines aren't as high-end or progressive, and no other international titles speak directly to an African readership, Arise has really caused a stir.'' 
 Among magazines in English-speaking Africa, Arise alone packages both pan-African and global content, producing a blend that Ms. Jennings calls ''afropolitan.''
 With a reported circulation of about 60,000 and averaging about 140 pages a month, the magazine is distributed in seven other African countries and around Europe and North America. In its no-expense-spared fashion shoots, clothes by African designers are paired with global brands like Yves Saint Laurent, Loewe and Ralph Lauren using popular black international models like Oluchi Onweagba and Rahma Mohamed. 
 Interviews with prominent black celebrities, like the singer-songwriters Akon and V. V. Brown, appeal to global advertisers. Tommy Hilfiger, Juicy Couture, Graff, L'Oreal and Lacoste are all represented in the magazine's pages. And their prestige has helped pull in ads from fashion brands based in Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. 
 But Arise's embrace of glamour and celebrity is tempered by a nod to the underground and an appreciation of irreverent reporting. A recent issue included a saucy expose of African WAGs (the British acronym for wives and girlfriends of soccer players) that appeared alongside quirky items about Ugandan skateboarders, a multimedia prodigy from Ivory Coast and the leather-wearing biker subculture that grew up in Soweto after apartheid. 
 African publishing has progressed in recent decades, but some major obstacles to success still exist, including isolation from important business partners and underdeveloped distribution networks. 
 Several of the African magazines have opened editorial headquarters in Europe or the United States to be closer to brand samples, top models, talent agencies, photo facilities and printing companies of a higher standard than most in Africa. 
 Arise, for example, operates out of London, and Helm, an Ethiopian quarterly edited by Rahewa Yemane, is based in Washington. Although these locations help editors produce quality content, they also drive up prices, as the finished magazines must be shipped to African newsstands. (The cover price for Arise in global distribution is about $8.)
 While a financier's deep pockets can be all that is needed to start a magazine, several factors, including market size, literacy and wealth, are needed to sustain it. Most of sub-Saharan Africa's statistics in these categories are poor, but they sometimes belie the real potential. 
 Literacy rates are low in many sub-Saharan countries, but parts of the population with enough disposable income to afford magazines have much better literacy rates than the national averages. Nigeria's rate is higher than 70 percent, and Kenya's is above 80 percent; both have become regional centers for publishing. 
 Africa's pockets of wealth also are often buried in gloomy macrostatistics. 
 ''In most sub-Saharan African countries, only 5 percent to 10 percent of the population is at the top of the income pyramid,'' said Sakina Balde, an analyst for Africa and the Middle East at the market research firm Euromonitor International. ''While this might seem insignificant, in highly populated countries like Nigeria, for example, it represents a large number of individuals.'' 
 According to 2008 data, 110,200 households in Nigeria had an annual disposable income of more than $75,000. And last year the country's 150 million residents spent $750.4 million on newspapers, magazines, books and stationery. 
 ''Nigeria and Angola are both oil producers, and many people made a fortune in the oil industry or through various businesses,'' Ms. Balde said. ''High- and middle-income earners in these countries have an insatiable desire for luxury products, and this is not waning with the economic slowdown.'' 
 The continent's wealth, though disproportionately concentrated, already is being spent by affluent Africans who shop in cities like London, Paris, Johannesburg and Dubai for luxury goods. Several luxury retailers and stores in London, for example, already count Nigerians among their top five spenders, trailing only Chinese, Russians, Americans and Arabs from the Persian Gulf. And in Lagos, new boutiques like Temple Muse and Leila Fowler are catering to the elite locally by stocking both international and African designer labels. 
 ''Some established designers like Deola Sagoe and the like have even been able to open flagship stores for their clients,'' said Wadami Amolegbe, chief editor of HauTe, an independently published Nigerian fashion quarterly, and its sibling site Fashionafrica.com, which serves as a pan-African designer directory. 
 Though Ms. Amolegbe says HauTe began as just a ''pet project'' after she returned to Lagos from New York three years ago, she said its combination of in-depth designer interviews and catwalk reports had been embraced by a loyal readership who are clued into international style and supportive of African labels, as well as understand that ''fashion is more than just following trends.'' She declined to disclose the magazine's circulation; there is no central circulation audit service in Africa. 
 The emergence of niche publications like HauTe and Helm does not presume that a fashion magazine sector in Africa will be big business just yet. 
 Apart from South Africa, where editions of Elle, Marie Claire, Glamour and Cosmopolitan have been around for the better part of a decade, major international publishers continue to shy away from Africa. 
 A Kenyan Cosmopolitan was tested in 2005, said Julia Raphaely, managing director of Associated Magazines, the Hearst partner in South Africa. But the company discontinued it, she said, ''to focus our energy and efforts on our brands in this market.'' 
 Still, ''certain African countries are starting to become interesting for international publishers,'' according to Christine Scott, general manager of the International Federation of the Periodical Press, based in London. 
 While Asia and Eastern Europe remain the most popular destination for the expansion of fashion magazine brands, several industry executives agreed that the current global downturn and the changing media landscape worldwide might make a wide open market like sub-Saharan Africa attractive after all.

HEADLINE: Study Says Reporting On Economy Was Narrow

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A study to be released Monday of financial news coverage this year found that government, Wall Street and a small handful of story lines got the bulk of the attention while much less was paid to the economic troubles of ordinary people. 
 The study, by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, also found that when the stock market rebounded from its lows and pitched battles in Washington ended, the news media turned their attention away from economic coverage.
 Reviewing almost 10,000 reports from Feb. 1 to Aug. 31 in newspapers, on news Web sites, on the radio and on network broadcast and cable television, Pew found that almost 40 percent of economic news reports dealt with the trials of the banking and auto industries, and the federal stimulus bill passed in February.
 Unemployment and the housing crisis accounted for 12 percent. And, the study said, ''stories that tried to explicitly examine the broader impact of the economic downturn on the lives of ordinary Americans filled 5 percent of the economic coverage.''
 Three-quarters of the reports originated from Washington or New York, and a similar number were based on the actions of government and business leaders.
 In February and March, the economy was the subject of nearly half of all news coverage, driven mostly by the stimulus bill and the uses of bank bailout money. After those fights died down, financial news coverage fell by more than half.
 Mark Jurkowitz, associate director of the Pew project, said it was easier for the national news media to cover Washington ''than to fan out around the country and measure the impact on real lives.''
 ''There's plenty of reason to understand why a lot of this is a Washington and New York story,'' he said. ''But we're talking about something that affected almost every American in some way.''
 Newspapers did more financial reporting than other media, and covered a much broader range of economic topics about a wider range of people, and they were far more likely to dig up items on their own, the study said.
 Researchers at Cornell and Stanford, along with Pew and Facebook, also combed through 1.6 million Web sites to see what phrases about the economy were repeated most. Nine of the top 20 came from President Obama, like the statement Feb. 24 that ''the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation.''

HEADLINE: As Property Taxes Become a Real Burden, Can Backlash Be Far Off?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The list from census data isn't all that surprising, but there it is.
 Westchester County, No. 1. Nassau, No. 2. Hunterdon and Bergen in New Jersey, Nos. 3 and 4, respectively.
 And so it goes. Of the 10 counties in the country with the highest median property taxes, every one is in New York or New Jersey.
 Or, to look at another table in the Census Bureau's American Community Survey for 2008, of the 10 counties with the highest real estate taxes as a percentage of home value, all 10 are in New York. Or, to try one more, of the states with the highest median real estate taxes overall, New Jersey is No. 1, Connecticut is No. 2 and New York is No. 4 (tax-averse New Hampshire, which does not have a general sales tax or a personal income tax, sneaks in at No. 3). 
 This, as anyone who breathes oxygen knows, is a high-tax region. But as Richard Nathan packed up his office on Friday after 45 years of studying or participating in state, local and federal tax and budget policies, he wondered if we had finally reached a breaking point.
 ''I'm a little surprised there hasn't been more heat and more agitation about tax caps and tax burdens in the way there has been in other parts of the country,'' said Dr. Nathan, who retired as co-director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany. ''I keep thinking, 'When is this dog going to bark?' And the numbers make you think it's going to be soon. It just feels different right now.''
 You can hear some pretty distinct yips in the New Jersey governor's race, where the property tax burden could help the Republicans win their first statewide race this decade (or perhaps not, if the Republican candidate, Christopher J. Christie, looks like he doesn't have answers either). But whether there's anything more than resigned gnashing of teeth by suburban swing voters in all three states will say a lot about the future of local politics and particularly the fate of Democrats in what are supposed to be the bluest of blue states. 
 Property taxes are high around here in large part, of course, because property values are high. But there are several reasons why property taxes are higher here than in other costly parts of the country. Unlike California and Massachusetts, there are few, if any, longstanding brakes in place that kept property taxes down (and, in California, led to disastrous revenue shortages). Public employees unions are powerful and politically feared. And we've come to expect good services -- top-rated schools, nearby police in little boutique towns -- and have been willing to pay for them.
 The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, whose ''Fix Albany'' mantra got him nowhere when he ran for governor against Eliot Spitzer in 2006 but looks pretty smart in retrospect, says that property taxes are inseparable from dysfunction in state government. He cites several reasons why property taxes are so high: unreasonable state mandates piled on local governments; income tax dollars inequitably distributed back to local governments; far too many local governments -- more than 10,500 in New York -- that need to be consolidated or eliminated; fraud and waste; and economic stagnation producing no expansion in the property tax base. You could throw in crippling Medicaid costs and unsustainable pension costs. 
 ''It's the No. 1 issue,'' he said. ''People have reached their breaking point. But we still have a long way to go in connecting the dots between dysfunction in state government and high property taxes.'' 
 Still, breaking point or not, who knows where this goes? A Proposition 13-style temper tantrum? Painful cuts -- meaning teachers and police? Throw out the bums -- most likely Democrats, who could be fat targets in an antitax backlash? Lots of grumbling but living with an increasingly unaffordable status quo? 
 Gerald Prante, an economist with the Tax Foundation in Washington, said at least people feel they get something tangible from their local taxes and can tolerate them if they believe they're getting what they paid for. ''If I told you I spent $40,000 on a car, it doesn't tell you much unless you know what kind of car,'' he said. ''If it's a Lamborghini, it was probably a good deal. If it was a Saturn, it's not such a good deal.'' Thus, for all the angst, the fact that most local school budgets still routinely pass indicates we might be more likely to grumble than to cut close to home.
 The problem is that many suburbanites who bought the luxury car a few years back now can barely afford the Saturn. The New Jersey race will provide some signals. Whether Republicans regain control of the Nassau County Legislature might provide some more. But the status quo can't last, and if there's a huge backlash, Democrats have the most to fear politically.
 ''The longer we wait, the harder the reckoning is going to be,'' Dr. Nathan said.

HEADLINE: Parents Face Extra Costs as College Tuition Savings Funds Struggle to Stay Afloat

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

 BODY:
In the last two decades, more than a million families around the country have invested in state funds that pledged to cover the cost of attending their state's public colleges and universities, regardless of how much tuition increased.
 But in the last year, the stock market slump and rising college costs have combined to drive all but two of the nation's 18 such funds, known as prepaid college savings plans, into the red, jeopardizing those pledges.
 Even with stock market gains since March, the losses have forced some programs, like Pennsylvania's and Washington's, to impose new and higher fees that could amount to thousands of dollars a year in additional costs to parents. 
 Others, like South Carolina's, have developed doomsday scenarios, capping how much a family would get if the program shut down completely. West Virginia had to pump $8 million into its prepaid program to help restore its financial health because its fund lost 25 percent of its value in the last year. And Alabama closed its program to new enrollees because the fund lost almost half of its assets -- more than $300 million -- in the stock market in the last year, and the state might have to put its own money in to keep it solvent. 
 ''I think ultimately more and more of these plans are going to close down to new investments,'' said Mark Kantrowitz, the founder and publisher of FinAid.org, a financial aid Web site. 
 ''Every time there's a significant market downturn, there's two main ways states make up for the losses: close to new participants to cut off the losses,'' Mr. Kantrowitz said, ''or raise fees. And raising fees makes it less attractive to new participants.''
 The funds were first proposed 23 years ago in Michigan as a fail-safe investment tool. They were quickly adopted by other states after 1996, when Congress allowed them to be tax-deferred under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2001, Congress expanded that to make all qualified educational disbursements tax-free. As a result, the 529 prepaid funds -- not to be confused with 529 college savings plans that do not promise a specific return -- grew into financial powerhouses, even though 7 of the 18 funds have closed to new investments over the years.
 All 18 state prepaid plans differ slightly, but most sell contracts or tuition credits that establish how much someone will pay in now to receive a certain return in the future based on projected in-state public university tuition. 
 If, in the end, students decide not to go to a state school, they can use the money at other schools, though the amount is likely to fall short of the full cost of tuition.
 Between them, the 18 state funds serve nearly 1.6 million families and hold $23.8 billion in assets, ranging from Tennessee's small $80 million fund serving 9,700 families to Florida's massive $8.7 billion fund that serves about 850,000 families.
 ''The reason they're popular is simply because the states bear the risk, not the individual,'' said Jackie Williams, who was executive director of the Ohio Tuition Trust Authority for 10 years, until June.
 The trust oversees Ohio's $590 million prepaid fund, which was closed to new enrollees in 2003 after the state began allowing public universities to raise their tuition as high as they wanted. That resulted in double-digit increases, which, combined with a tough stock market, threw the fund out of balance.
 Not every state fully guarantees its prepaid funds. Only five states offer a ''full faith and credit'' of the state guarantee, and seven are required by law to consider helping the funds out if need be. The other five states -- Alabama, Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- and Texas's new prepaid fund have no guarantee, though officials say they doubt that the states would ever let the funds become insolvent and would step in if need be.
 All of the funds but Florida's and Colorado's now have an actuarial deficit, meaning they do not have enough money to pay all of their future college tuition obligations. Most are only about 80 percent to 90 percent funded. But many are worse off, like the Illinois fund, which is about 75 percent funded, and South Carolina and Alabama's funds, which are both about 66 percent funded.
 Carol M. Perdue was troubled by a letter she got from Alabama's treasurer this summer that said the state's prepaid program had lost about 50 percent of its assets in the stock market. She is suing to force the state to put money into the fund to make up for the losses.
 ''At first I was kind of scared,'' said Ms. Perdue, 40, an insurance agent in Phenix City who has about $30,000 in the program for her two daughters. ''And then I felt almost cheated, like I was sold a bill of goods that wasn't there.''
 Even Florida's program could be in for tough times. The state has stayed out of trouble because it has 90 percent of its assets in fixed income investments, unlike other funds with 50 percent to 70 percent of their assets in the stock market, and it has enjoyed very low tuition increases.
 But the Florida Legislature for the first time has allowed public universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent a year for the next five years, which is much greater than the 6.5 percent average the fund has counted on in the last two decades.
 ''You can't keep up with 15 percent tuition inflation with fixed income,'' said Andrew A. Davis, executive director of the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which oversees that state's prepaid fund. ''They'll have to change something.''
 Despite all this bad news, investors continue to see the funds as an attractive option, particularly in a tough economy, for one simple reason.
 ''Even with all the problems, no one has ever lost money in the process,'' said Joseph F. Hurley, founder of Savingforcollege.com, which specializes in dissecting the different 108 college savings and prepaid plans.
 Ganesh Seshadri has invested $200,000 in Pennsylvania's fund, which has lost about 25 percent of its value. He is philosophical about the fund's losses, which have not affected his investment, though he has stopped investing in it because of the increased fees and costs imposed recently.
 ''If I get back the return they promised, it will be a good investment, because all of my other investments tanked,'' said Mr. Seshadri, 55, a hospital computer analyst in Murrysville, Pa. He has children at Northwestern University and Carnegie Mellon, and one in high school.
 Many states, aware of the allure of prepaid funds, are now keeping an eye on Texas, which opened a fund in the last year after closing another one in 2003 to new enrollments. The new fund shifts the burden of the guarantee from the state to the public university system. If the fund runs short, the universities agree to cover the difference between what is available and how much tuition is in the future.
 ''It's an interesting idea, but the money has to come from somewhere,'' Mr. Kantrowitz said. ''Saying you'll pay anyway is sweeping it under the rug. But it will be interesting to see if it works.''
 Texans apparently think it will. Since last September, amid the financial meltdown, about 13,000 families invested a total of $95 million in the fund.

HEADLINE: Profits for Buyout Firms As Company Debt Soared

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
For most of the 133 years since its founding in a small city in Wisconsin, the Simmons Bedding Company enjoyed an illustrious history. 
 Presidents have slumbered on its mattresses aboard Air Force One. Dignitaries have slept on them in the Lincoln Bedroom. Its advertisements have featured Henry Ford and H. G. Wells. Eleanor Roosevelt extolled the virtues of the Simmons Beautyrest mattress, and the brand was immortalized on Broadway in Cole Porter's song ''Anything Goes.''
 Its recent history has been notable, too, but for a different reason. 
 Simmons says it will soon file for bankruptcy protection, as part of an agreement by its current owners to sell the company -- the seventh time it has been sold in a little more than two decades -- all after being owned for short periods by a parade of different investment groups, known as private equity firms, which try to buy undervalued companies, mostly with borrowed money. 
 For many of the company's investors, the sale will be a disaster. Its bondholders alone stand to lose more than $575 million. The company's downfall has also devastated employees like Noble Rogers, who worked for 22 years at Simmons, most of that time at a factory outside Atlanta. He is one of 1,000 employees -- more than one-quarter of the work force -- laid off last year.
 But Thomas H. Lee Partners of Boston has not only escaped unscathed, it has made a profit. The investment firm, which bought Simmons in 2003, has pocketed around $77 million in profit, even as the company's fortunes have declined. THL collected hundreds of millions of dollars from the company in the form of special dividends. It also paid itself millions more in fees, first for buying the company, then for helping run it. Last year, the firm even gave itself a small raise. 
 Wall Street investment banks also cashed in. They collected millions for helping to arrange the takeovers and for selling the bonds that made those deals possible. All told, the various private equity owners have made around $750 million in profits from Simmons over the years.
 How so many people could make so much money on a company that has been driven into bankruptcy is a tale of these financial times and an example of a growing phenomenon in corporate America.
 Every step along the way, the buyers put Simmons deeper into debt. The financiers borrowed more and more money to pay ever higher prices for the company, enabling each previous owner to cash out profitably. 
 But the load weighed down an otherwise healthy company. Today, Simmons owes $1.3 billion, compared with just $164 million in 1991, when it began to become a Wall Street version of ''Flip This House.'' 
 In many ways, what private equity firms did at Simmons, and scores of other companies like it, mimicked the subprime mortgage boom. Fueled by easy money, not only from banks but also endowments and pension funds, buyout kings like THL upended the old order on Wall Street. It was, they said, the Golden Age of private equity -- nothing less than a new era of capitalism. 
 These private investors were able to buy companies like Simmons with borrowed money and put down relatively little of their own cash. Then, not long after, they often borrowed even more money, using the company's assets as collateral -- just like home buyers who took out home equity loans on top of their first mortgages. For the financiers, the rewards were enormous. 
 Twice after buying Simmons, THL borrowed more. It used $375 million of that money to pay itself a dividend, thus recouping all of the cash it put down, and then some. 
 A result: THL was guaranteed a profit regardless of how Simmons performed. It did not matter that the company was left owing far more than it was worth, just as many people profited from the mortgage business while many homeowners found themselves underwater.
 Investors who bought that debt are getting virtually nothing in the new deal.
 ''From my experience, none of the private equity firms were building a brand for the future,'' said Robert Hellyer, Simmons's former president, who worked for several of the private equity buyers before being asked to leave the company in 2005. ''Plus, the mind-set was, since the money was practically free, why not leverage the company to the maximum?''
 Just as with the housing market, the good times ended when the economy fell into recession and the credit markets froze. Simmons is now groaning under a huge amount of debt at a time when its sales are slowing. And this time there is no escaping by finding yet another buyer willing to shoulder its entire burden. 
 Simmons is one of hundreds of companies swept up by private equity firms in the early part of this decade, during the greatest burst of corporate takeovers the world has ever seen. Many of these deals, cut in good times, left little or no margin for error -- let alone for the Great Recession. 
 A disproportionate number of the companies that were acquired during that frenzy are now struggling with the enormous debts. More than half the roughly 220 companies that have defaulted on their debt in some form this year were either owned at one time or are still controlled by private equity firms, according to analysts at Standard & Poor's. Among them are household names like Harrah's Entertainment and Six Flags, the theme park operator. 
 Executives at THL counter that Simmons was the victim of hard economic times, not mismanagement or too much debt. As proof, executives point to Simmons's 40 percent growth in sales and its 26 percent climb in operating income from 2003 through 2007 as well as its 13 consecutive quarters of market share gains against competitors through March 2009. 
 Simmons's woes, said Scott A. Schoen, a co-president of the firm who sat on Simmons's board, are entirely caused by the ''unprecedented and unforeseeable'' downturn that has shaken the entire bedding industry. 
 ''We think the work we had done had positioned the company for us to reap the financial rewards that this economic cycle has taken away,'' said Mr. Schoen, gazing across a conference table at THL's headquarters overlooking Boston Harbor.
 Still, he acknowledged, ''We are clearly disappointed in the outcome of this investment. Make no bones about it.'' 
 Built Over Generations
 Like other emerging industrialists of the 19th century, Zalmon G. Simmons, of Kenosha, Wis., had his hand in numerous businesses -- the local bank, a telegraph company, a railroad and a cheese-box factory. He was even, for a time, the mayor of Kenosha.
 Around 1876, Mr. Simmons came across a new machine that could mass-produce woven wire mattresses. The Simmons bedding company was born.
 From its humble beginnings on the banks of Lake Michigan, Simmons grew to become one of the country's largest manufacturers of mattresses. Along the way, it even sprinkled a little Hollywood pixie dust on the ho-hum mattress business, hiring Dorothy Lamour and Maureen O'Hara to plug its products.
 Until the 1970s, Simmons largely prospered. Then the troubles started, and the company was soon buried deep inside two enormous conglomerates, Gulf & Western and the Wickes Corporation, for a number of years.
 But in the mid-1980s, Simmons caught the attention of a new type of investor. The businesses that stormed corporate America in recent years under the banner of private equity were not always called private equity firms. In the 1980s, they were known as leveraged buyout shops. Their strategy is essentially unchanged, however: they try to buy undervalued companies, using mostly borrowed money, fix them up and sell them for a fast profit. 
 Because they pile debt onto the companies they buy, the firms free up their own cash, allowing them to make additional investments and increase their potential profits.
 Simmons's first trip through the revolving door of private equity came in 1986. Like the latest trip, it was not a pleasant one for employees, but the buyers did just fine. 
 William E. Simon, a private equity pioneer and a Treasury secretary under President Richard M. Nixon, was the man with the golden touch. In 1986, his investment firm, Wesray Capital, and a handful of Simmons's top managers acquired the company for $120 million, the bulk of which was borrowed. After selling several businesses to pay back some of the money it had borrowed, Wesray cashed out in 1989. It sold Simmons to the company's employee stock ownership plan for $241 million -- twice what it paid just three years earlier. 
 The deal was a fiasco for the employees. As part of the buyout, Simmons stopped contributing to its pension plan, since the stock ownership plan shares were meant to pay for the employees' retirements. But then the bottom fell out of the housing market and Simmons, with its large debt, stumbled. Its pensions crumbled as the value of the stock plan shares plunged.
 A succession of private equity buyers came and went. Merrill Lynch Capital Partners bought Simmons in 1991 for $32 million for a 60 percent stake in the company and the assumption of its debt. Merrill sold it to Investcorp, an investment group based in Bahrain, for $265 million in 1996. Two years later, Investcorp sold the company to Fenway Partners for $513 million. 
 During Fenway's tenure, Simmons released one of the industry's biggest innovations: the no-flip mattress. Profits soared. But after five years, Fenway executives decided to cash out. By the fall of 2003, Simmons was back on the block.
 Teddy Bear at the Gate
 A longtime figure in investment circles, Thomas H. Lee vaulted into the big leagues of private equity with what is regarded as one of the legendary deals of all time. After founding Thomas H. Lee Partners in 1974, he grabbed headlines in 1994 when he sold Snapple, the iced tea maker, for $1.7 billion to Quaker Oats. He bought the company two years earlier for around $130 million. 
 But while other captains of the buyout craze -- like Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts -- chased giant companies in hostile deals, Mr. Lee focused largely on midsize companies and steered clear of deals where he was not welcome. The research firm Hoover's describes Thomas H. Lee Partners as ''the teddy bear at the gate.''
 Mr. Lee, scion of the family that founded the Shoe Corporation of America, left his namesake firm in 2006 to start another investment company. During his 30-year tenure at THL, his firm invested in a series of big names: Ghirardelli Chocolate, Petco Animal Supplies and General Nutrition Companies, among others. And by 2003, as the buyout boom began to build, his firm had Simmons in its cross hairs. 
 The Deal
 The fall of 2003 was little more than a blur of meetings and presentations for Robert Hellyer, the former Simmons president who is among the fourth generation of his family involved in the mattress industry. In eight weeks, the company was shown to 20 private equity suitors in the corporate version of speed dating.
 The list of potential buyers was quickly whittled to three and finally to THL, whose $1.1 billion bid for the company consisted of $327 million in new equity from the firm and more than $745 million in bonds and bank loans that had to be raised from investors.
 ''They were good guys; very smart guys,'' Mr. Hellyer said. ''Their thesis was to buy a good business with good management and let them get better.''
 What THL wanted from the deal was a return of two to three times its initial investment. 
 From the get-go, the lofty price the firm paid for Simmons and the amount of debt raised red flags on Wall Street.
 The ''higher debt burden will limit the company's ability to respond to unexpected negative business developments, including economic or competitive threats or internal missteps,'' analysts at Moody's Investors Service warned at the time.
 But nobody, it seems, was listening. Six months after acquiring Simmons, THL set in motion plans to take the company public. And by December 2004, THL found a way to get part of its initial investment back. Simmons issued debt that required the company to pay a hefty 10 percent annual interest rate. The proceeds were used to pay THL a dividend of $137 million. With the company's debt climbing, Simmons executives had to aim high with new products -- and pray they were right.
 In late 2004, Simmons unveiled the HealthSmart mattress in a blitz of marketing. 
 It gave away 250 beds to the audience of ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'' It began a $15 million advertising campaign. It put coupons for free HealthSmart beds in celebrity souvenir bags during New York's Fashion Week.
 A mattress line aimed at combating dust mites, mold and germs, the HealthSmart featured a zip-off top that could be washed or dry cleaned. But in the rush to get the product to market, Simmons did not go through its normal research and testings, Mr. Hellyer says. 
 HealthSmart was a flop. Consumers did not like the mattress -- they thought the zip-on cover was troublesome. Sales at the company slid nearly 8 percent in the first quarter from the previous year. 
 ''Panic ensued. Thomas H. Lee came in and pulled the national advertising right away,'' said a former Simmons employee involved with HealthSmart who declined to be named because he is still involved with the mattress industry. 
 THL shelved its plans to take Simmons public, and the company shook up its sales division. By the third quarter of 2005, Simmons had ''one of the best quarters in the company's entire history up to that point,'' a spokesman for THL said in an e-mail message. The numbers tell a slightly different story: Net sales declined 4.8 percent in that quarter from a year earlier, and operating income fell to $25.1 million, from $25.5 million in the third quarter of 2004. Later, spokesmen for THL and Simmons clarified the statement by saying that after excluding a one-time reorganization expense, an adjusted earnings figure for the quarter was the 10th best in the company's history.
 Executives at THL say they moved quickly to put Simmons back on track. 
 ''More than a dozen THL professionals have devoted literally thousands of man-hours to Simmons, including making over 115 visits to company headquarters and site facilities around the country,'' the firm said in a statement.
 The results, it argued, speak for themselves. In the following years, Simmons's sales and profits climbed, and the company introduced several new products, including the successful premium-price Beautyrest Black line of mattresses.
 By early 2007, at the very top of the credit market bubble, THL took a bit more out of Simmons. It created a holding company that it used to issue $300 million more in debt, which paid an additional $238 million dividend to the private equity firm. With that, THL had recouped its entire $327 million equity investment in Simmons and booked a profit of around $48 million. (It made an additional $28.5 million in various fees over the years.) 
 THL was hardly alone in undertaking this sort of financial engineering, known as a dividend recapitalization. From 2003 to 2007, 188 companies controlled by private equity firms issued more than $75 billion in debt that was used to pay dividends to the buyout firms.
 Asked whether the 2007 dividend was too much for Simmons, Mr. Schoen of THL defended the deal.
 ''That debt financing, which clearly spelled out to the market the use of the proceeds, was extremely well received. The securities were heavily oversubscribed,'' Mr. Schoen said. ''Not only did we think it was appropriate, but the market did as well,'' he added. 
 As the economy soured in late 2007, so did Simmons's sales. The company slashed costs and cut jobs throughout 2008. But last fall, unable to meet the terms of its bank loans and debt dating back to the 2003 acquisition itself, Simmons stopped making interest payments to its bondholders. THL began talking to the banks and bondholders about how to lighten Simmons's debt load, and put the company up for sale.
 The Impact on Employees
 From the start, Noble Rogers loved working at Simmons. 
 ''There were picnics, March of Dimes walks, Christmas parties, and we always had Halloween parties. It was a really family-oriented company,'' Mr. Rogers, 50, recalled. ''I told my wife that this was a great place for me to work. A great place for me to retire, to make a living at.''
 For a long time, it was. For 22 years, Mr. Rogers worked at Simmons, the bulk of those years at a factory in Mableton, outside Atlanta. After operating the coiler machine for the company's Beautyrest mattress, he moved into maintenance and kept all of the plant's machinery humming.
 Over the years, as Simmons passed from one private equity firm to another, and as Mr. Rogers became president of the local union at the plant, he saw little difference on the plant floor. Then, in the spring of 2008, when the slowing economy had begun to hurt sales, Simmons laid off the night shift at the Mableton plant. And on Sept. 18 that year, it gathered employees in the cafeteria to say that the plant was closing.
 ''So many people were hurt because they thought this was a great company to work for and they planned on spending the rest of their lives here. Their families were here. They bought houses and cars here,'' Mr. Rogers recalled. ''After this happened, people were really struggling.''
 Between the closings and other cuts, Simmons let go of more than a quarter of its work force last year, said its chief financial officer, William S. Creekmuir.
 Mr. Rogers, who received his union-negotiated severance package of two months' pay, said he and other union representatives had tried to get a little more for workers, particularly those who would have been eligible for retirement. Simmons had a long history of giving retiring employees a bonus of $20 for each year worked and a free mattress set, Mr. Rogers said.
 ''They wouldn't give us anything,'' he said.
 In the months after he lost his job, Mr. Rogers nearly lost his home to foreclosure and struggled to pay his family's bills. Mr. Rogers, who eventually landed a job at an air filter company and picked up part-time work doing maintenance at an apartment complex, said Simmons bore little resemblance to the company he once loved.
 ''They stopped the picnics. They stopped the Christmas parties. They stopped the retirement parties,'' he recalled. ''That showed you the type of people I was working for. I just didn't realize it until the hard times came like they did.''
 For now, the Golden Age of private equity is over, the financiers say. In a speech to an industry gathering last spring. Mr. Schoen said that bankers and bondholders were reluctant to lend more money to the buyout kings. 
 ''We're in a brave new world,'' he said. ''We can't go back to where we were, at least not in this investment cycle, and probably not in my career.'' 
 But some private equity investors are searching for profits in the detritus of the buyout bust. Simmons hopes to emerge from bankruptcy in the hands of two new private equity firms. One is Ares Management, which owns the mattress giant Serta. Under the plan, Simmons's debt would be more than halved, to $450 million, in part reflecting the losses suffered by its existing bondholders. 
 Simmons and its remaining employees face an uncertain future. Some in the industry predict Ares will eventually merge at least part of Simmons with Serta, jeopardizing more jobs. 
 ''Simmons has been a cash cow. It's made a lot of people a lot of money,'' said David Perry, executive editor of Furniture/Today. ''But there's a growing question in the industry of how many more times can this be repeated. How much more juice can be squeezed out of the orange?''

HEADLINE: Of Layoffs, Bankruptcy And Bonuses

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; http://twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
Let's say that a group of corporate executives uses scads of debt to take over a struggling company, sells off some profitable assets, lays off thousands of employees while achieving miserable results. And then, less than a year after saddling the company with $8 billion in debt, they opt for bankruptcy. 
 You'd expect them to walk the plank, or at the very least, spend a good stretch of time in the naughty corner. But you wouldn't expect the top 700 managers to collect $66 million in bonuses.
But that's just what might happen at the Tribune Company. A week ago Friday, lawyers for the company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun, and owns other newspapers and television stations, were in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware suggesting that the proposed 2009 bonuses were critical for the health and survival of the company. 
 Under questioning, Chandler Bigelow III, the chief financial officer, said the bonuses would help ''incentivize our key managers to battle all of the intense challenges that unfortunately our local media businesses are facing,'' according to The Associated Press.
 The unsecured creditors of the Tribune Company filed a letter in support of the incentives, and its senior lenders support the plan as well. But both the company's union and the trustee appointed to oversee the bankruptcy raised objections, arguing that the bonuses would be the highest ever paid -- even as the company has its lowest cash flow in 10 years.
 ''It is sort of along the same lines as the Bank of America and A.I.G. bonuses, except it is not taxpayer money,'' said Cet Parks, executive director of the Baltimore-Washington Newspaper Guild, in an interview. ''At the same time they are asking employees to make sacrifices, they want to reap the rewards of all these cuts they have been making.''
 As it turns out, Sam Zell, the real estate mogul known as the grave dancer for his willingness to take on distressed assets, seems more like a grave digger. There is litany of infamies surrounding Mr. Zell's ill-advised employee stock ownership plan in 2007 to take over the Tribune: its original creditors are currently investigating whether the sale qualified as a so-called fraudulent conveyance; cash flow fell to $789 million last year, from $1.5 billion in 2006; the costs associated with bankruptcy are now more than $7 million a month; and about 2,000 people lost their jobs in 2008 alone. 
 But the bonuses at issue in the court in Delaware offer a nice window into the entitlement and tone-deafness that has prevailed at the company better than any of those other big numbers.
 The proposed bonuses come in two gilded packages. The annual management incentive program would pay more than $45 million to about 720 managers along a sliding scale based on achieving certain targets. About $11.6 million would go to 70 core managers and other personnel, with $9.3 million reserved for just 23 employees in a pay-for-performance arrangement. 
 If all of the maximum performance standards were met, about $66 million would be paid out, far more than bonuses paid in the past, at a time when total revenue declined by $800 million. 
 At a hearing on the bonuses, a union accountant testified that if the maximum incentives were paid, they would eat up 15.5 percent of operating cash flow. 
 The bonus plan, which is an effort to replace awards of equity given to managers in the past, was announced in February, just about the time that the company was issuing memos about wage freezes and ''shared sacrifice.'' At a hearing in May on the previous year's bonuses, which the bankruptcy judge granted, Mr. Bigelow said, ''I will tell you that not being rewarded for hard work and hard effort is demotivating.''
 Steve Lopez, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times, knows the feeling.
 ''We've got empty desks throughout the newsroom. Working journalists used to sit at them and serve up good stuff daily. Then there's the issue of our bankruptcy,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, adding, ''Yeah, I'd have to say the brain trust was tone-deaf, to say the least, in handing out bonuses to the big dogs.''
 In their motion in support of the plan, the Tribune's lawyers said, ''the debtors' need to maintain these incentives for 2009 remains as strong as ever, as its key personnel are still being called upon to surmount significant industry and macroeconomic challenges while at the same time working diligently toward a successful reorganization.'' 
 A company spokesman added that in spite of opposition from the unions and the trustee, ''both our senior lender steering committee and the unsecured creditors committee support this plan as in the best interests of the future of the company.''
 Joseph J. McMahon Jr., the acting trustee for the Tribune bankruptcy, does not agree and filed an objection to the plan on Aug. 4, writing that the threshold for such payments was high, and he cited relevant case law requiring that the bonuses had to be ''essential to retention of the person because the individual has a bona fide job offer from another business at the same or greater rate of compensation.''
 He had questions about the targets at the basis of the payments, saying ''the debtors do not give any factual and/or historical context to back up their characterization of that performance target as 'real.' '' Union lawyers called the targets that would enact the payments ''a layup,'' while Mr. Bigelow rejected claims that the target was set too low. ''The plan was developed in good faith, with integrity,'' he said.
 All this requires what we in the journalism business call a to-be-sure moment. A company spokesman reminded me that with the coming $740 million sale of the Cubs, the company will have $1.5 billion in cash on hand, so while the company may be bankrupt, it's not broke. And let's stipulate that many of the men and women at the Tribune are working hard to lift it out of bankruptcy, keep its newspapers intact and serve their communities. They are not traders in obscure financial instruments that tipped over the markets and are now lining up at the trough. 
 But at a bankrupt company in a declining industry with negative performance, is it really time for the bankruptcy court to open up the wallet? 
 The chief judge, Kevin J. Carey, who is presiding over the bankruptcy case, said that a company fighting for its life needed top-tier talent, but also said, ''in a troubled industry as this one, the argument could be made that bonuses should not be paid, or certainly not of this magnitude.'' He will make a decision soon, perhaps in the coming weeks. 
 But regardless of whether the bonuses have been earned or not, James Warren, a former managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, wonders how necessary they are.
 ''Without denying that many of these folks are toiling hard and diligently, the basic arguments underlying this request are laughable and beg at least one simple question,'' he said. ''How many of those that are being enriched by the bonuses have been contacted by headhunting firms seeking their talents? After what has happened there and what is going on in the broader economy, where are they going to go?''

HEADLINE: In Quiet Mayoral Race, a Union Emerges as a Voice Against Bloomberg

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
It's a brutal caricature of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, cast as a Brobdingnagian monster stomping over buildings and hurling a subway car at a screaming citizenry. The caption: ''I don't need NYC. NYC needs ME!''
 The ''Bloomzilla'' image, created by Transport Workers Union Local 100, is one of the more incendiary attacks yet in a sleepy mayoral race. It has surfaced at parades and press conferences, on a poster outside the mayor's Upper East Side town house and on a postcard in the hands of Gov. David A. Paterson. 
 Meanwhile, on the radio, a commercial sponsored by the union urges listeners to ''show the M.T.A. bosses and Mike Bloomberg that we're tired of their lies.''
 And outside the Metropolitan Transportation Authority last Tuesday, a union rally -- ostensibly to demand money for workers -- morphed into a de facto campaign event for Mr. Bloomberg's challenger, William C. Thompson Jr., whose keynote speech was met with thunderous applause. As he spoke, a woman hurled punches at a giant-size blowup of the mayor. 
 Four weeks before Election Day, Mr. Thompson remains a tepid presence on the campaign trail, rarely channeling a sense of populist resentment. So his supporters are starting to do it for him. 
 Traditionally considered a narrowly focused agitator that gets attention for threatening a subway strike, the Transport Workers Union has taken on the feel of a political action group in recent days, passing out anti-Bloomberg placards that blame the mayor for everything from high unemployment to holding back rent reform.
 ''We don't do anything halfway,'' said Ed Watt, Local 100's secretary-treasurer and a nonvoting member of the transportation authority's board.
 It is a timeworn political strategy to have others do your dirty work, and aides to Mr. Thompson say they are happy to have the added help, acknowledging that the union has the freedom to take an edgier stance. 
 ''The T.W.U.'s doing what they think is appropriate in their struggles for the mayor, and we're engaged in our campaign with the mayor,'' said Eduardo Castell, Mr. Thompson's campaign manager, adding, ''There are different approaches to it.''
 Local 100 has endorsed Mr. Thompson in the mayor's race. In 2005, it endorsed Fernando Ferrer, Mr. Bloomberg's opponent, but played a less visible role in that race. 
 Still, while its attacks range beyond transit matters, Local 100's fire-and-brimstone rhetoric is by no means selfless.
 The union is incensed that the transportation authority has not implemented an arbitration ruling granting big raises to transit workers -- and labor leaders blame City Hall for the holdup. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has spoken out aggressively against the raises, arguing that the strapped transportation authority should not be forced to pay higher labor costs amid a fiscal crisis. In August, one of the mayor's board members at the authority (where he controls 4 of 14 votes) urged transportation officials to ''consider all avenues of appeal that are legally available.''
 Union officials angrily pointed out that Mr. Bloomberg gave generous raises to city employees last year, setting a precedent that was later cited by the arbitration panel as a reason for its ruling. And Roger Toussaint, Local 100's president, said Mr. Bloomberg privately supported the raises before publicly denouncing them. (Aides to the mayor have disputed this account.)
 ''If the mayor is going to lie about what happened here, how is he going to tell the truth about anything else?'' Mr. Watt said. ''We believe that Bloomberg is not the right man for this upcoming crisis.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign dismissed the union attacks, saying the transit workers did not have the funding or manpower to affect voters' opinions. And City Hall officials have said the mayor never supported a labor contract that the authority could not afford. 
 Both Mr. Thompson's and Mr. Bloomberg's camps noted the long history of animosity between Local 100 and the mayor. During the 2005 transit strike, Mr. Bloomberg referred to the strike and its leaders as ''thuggish,'' drawing criticism from some who said the language was inappropriate for a union dominated by minority workers. Union officials invoked the incident at last week's rally. 
 While both Mr. Thompson and Mr. Bloomberg have received endorsements from other big labor groups, none of those unions have been nearly as visible in their political efforts as Local 100 has been. Some say that is because bad blood is already in place between City Hall and the Transport Workers Union. 
 ''The relationship publicly is already so poor with Bloomberg that there's less worry about alienating a future mayor,'' said Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College who studies New York labor issues.
 Leaders of other city unions said they were still in the process of organizing their members for campaign work, including calling and visiting constituents at their homes. 
 An inquiry to the Bloomberg camp prompted phone calls from half a dozen city labor leaders, all expressing full support for the mayor. But most acknowledged that they sympathized with the Transport Workers Union's grievances. ''I can understand their anger,'' said George Miranda, president of Teamsters Joint Council 16. ''They're caught between a rock and a hard place.'' 
 The Transport Workers Union plans to recruit members for a leafleting and canvassing effort on behalf of Mr. Thompson. And a ''Day of Outrage'' is scheduled for Oct. 14, although details were unavailable. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson may continue to benefit from the transit workers' discontent. Late last week, the home page of the transit workers' Web site called Mr. Bloomberg a ''bully'' and declared, ''It's time for Mike to take a hike.'' Mr. Thompson's home pagefeatured a soft-focus photograph of the candidate. The caption: ''Bill Delivers Speech on Education.''

HEADLINE: All the President's Meddling

BYLINE: By SUSAN DUNN. 
Susan Dunn, the author of the forthcoming ''Roosevelt's Gamble: How F.D.R. Fought to Change the Democratic Party,'' is a professor at Williams College.

DATELINE: Williamstown, Mass. 

 BODY:
 ''PRESIDENT OBAMA is not only president of the country, but head of the Democratic Party,'' said Doug Sosnik, the political director in the Clinton White House, commenting on President Obama's aggressive move to quash the election hopes of New York's deeply unpopular governor, David Paterson, and to pick favorites in gubernatorial and Senate primaries in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. But history shows that a White House push to intervene in state races is fraught with danger. 
 In 1938, in the middle of his second term, Franklin D. Roosevelt found himself stuck. Two years earlier, every state in the union -- except Maine and Vermont -- had joined in a collective vote of confidence in Roosevelt and the New Deal. But that overwhelming mandate proved to be anything but shatterproof. 
 Even though Democrats held staggering majorities in both chambers of Congress, that huge Democratic majority was deceptive. Conservative Democrats -- senators like Millard Tydings of Maryland, Walter George of Georgia and Ellison Smith of South Carolina -- allied themselves with Republicans to obstruct and vote down key New Deal bills. Yet when Roosevelt ran for re-election in 1936, none of those Democrats had had the courage to criticize him. On the contrary, they gave lip service to the New Deal -- and then, insisting that they were only voting their consciences, proceeded to knife it. 
 Concerned about his progressive agenda as well as about the next presidential election in 1940, Roosevelt decided to intervene in state primaries -- tantamount to the November election in the one-party Democratic South -- and support challengers to the conservative incumbents. 
 In a fireside chat in June 1938, he carefully explained that as president, he would not intervene in Democratic primaries. But, as the head of the Democratic Party, he said, it was his right and duty to support liberal candidates who stood by the New Deal. In addition, he believed that the nation should have two effective and responsible political parties, one liberal, the other conservative, each ideologically consistent and united. Newspapers branded his tactic a ''purge'' -- and the inflammatory label stuck. 
 Roosevelt spent the summer of 1938 zigzagging across the country, holding rallies, speaking out against some incumbents and campaigning for others. On the top of his hit list was Millard Tydings. ''Take Tydings's hide off and rub salt in it,'' Roosevelt once snapped. Tydings had opposed nearly every New Deal measure -- even on Social Security, which was approved by all but six senators, he demurred, voting only ''present.'' Yet, aware of the president's extraordinary popularity among his constituents, Tydings improbably insisted that he embraced the ''bone and sinew'' of the New Deal. 
 But in Maryland as in other states in which the president spoke out against the incumbents, the purge failed. It succeeded in only one race, against John O'Connor, a New Yorker who was the reactionary chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee.
 In the end, the purge was one of the few glaring political missteps in Roosevelt's long career, and afterward he had to struggle to make amends and repair relations with the men he had tried to oust. As it turned out, many of the Democratic conservatives -- especially those from the South -- whom Roosevelt had sought to banish were staunch internationalists who would soon become his loyal allies as he battled isolationists over America's role in World War II. 
 Will President Obama and his White House team learn the lessons of the purge of 1938? Franklin Roosevelt's political vision of party realignment was compelling; and yet the purge was hastily contrived and its execution amateurish. 
 The president and his White House advisers underestimated not only the power of incumbents and their political machines but also their longstanding relationships with their constituents and the influence of local newspapers. They also underestimated the resentment prompted by their interference in local elections. And they overestimated the control that the national Democratic Party had over local party organizations. 
 The purge would have worked only after extensive preparation at the grass roots. But the White House was parsimonious with its economic assistance to the liberal challengers, who were themselves weak candidates and relatively inexperienced. The president had simply neglected to deal with the core problem of nurturing new political talent.
 Temperamentally, Roosevelt was more comfortable exploiting his charm, magnetism and political dexterity for short-term ploys rather than for long-term, coherent political planning. He would have had to dedicate his time, energy and resources to providing direction and support to grass-roots liberal Democrats and to stimulating the growth of liberal groups within the party. His efforts failed because instead of using his personal popularity to build his party so that it could outlast him, he concentrated only on nudging out a few bad apples. 
 It is not yet clear how extensive President Obama's plans are for intervening in party primaries. Nor is it yet clear if his criteria for picking favorites are based on ideology, as Roosevelt's were, or if the White House is simply focused on choosing the most popular candidates and winning a few more elections. So far, the president's support for Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and his desire to dump Governor Paterson would seem to indicate that his approach is purely pragmatic. But in either case, by meddling in state and local politics, he risks fueling the same indignation that Roosevelt did in 1938.
 With the cautionary tale of Roosevelt's failed purge in mind, the White House may be able to develop a more organized and coherent blueprint than that of Roosevelt and his team, one that transfers the president's personal popularity to the party by building strength at the local level; developing a persuasive, enduring party message; and nurturing new political talent like Barack Obama himself. More critical than the short-term tactic of picking favorites in a few primary races is a longer-term strategy of party-building so that Democrats can thrive even without their charismatic leader and so that the hundreds of thousands of first-time voters, who were spurred to cast ballots in the historic 2008 election, will return to the polls. 
 So, President Obama, purge at your peril.

LENGTH: 883 words

HEADLINE: A Senate Democrat With a Central Role

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The room did not go eerily quiet when she spoke. And other senators did not hang on her every word. In fact, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, may have gotten the most notice when colleagues paused last Wednesday to sing ''Happy Birthday'' to her.
 But Mrs. Lincoln -- and not a certain Republican senator from Maine -- may have been the most important person on the dais during the Senate Finance Committee's seven-day debate over health care legislation. 
 More than anyone else on the committee, Mrs. Lincoln represented the fiscally conservative, centrist Democrats who could decide the fate of the health care bill and who are a main focus of the White House and party leaders as the action shifts to the Senate floor. 
 For President Obama and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, a close look at how Mrs. Lincoln voted in the committee proceedings could offer a road map for unifying Senate Democrats and rustling up the 60 votes needed to advance the bill.
 Looking at the Votes
 If they listened carefully, these were some pointers: forget a government-run health plan, or public option; tread carefully on provisions that could look like unfair tax increases; and reassure the public that the bill is not a giveaway to insurance companies.
 For Senate Republicans and their leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mrs. Lincoln's votes could similarly provide a schematic exposing vulnerabilities in the Democratic plan -- political pressure points that if exploited might bring the bill down. 
 Mrs. Lincoln, who is in her second term, is up for re-election next year in a state that Senator John McCain of Arizona won by 20 points in last year's presidential race. At a time when her party's liberals seem ascendant, Mrs. Lincoln faces a potential primary challenge not from the left, but from the right. 
 Simply put, she has a lot on the line. And if she can vote in favor of the health care bill, presumably so can other centrist Democrats, including Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and her fellow Arkansan, Senator Mark Pryor.
 Mrs. Lincoln, in an interview Sunday, said that Arkansans were most concerned about the economy and that her support for the health care bill both in this week's final committee vote and on the Senate floor would hinge on it not increasing the federal deficit and helping to control health care costs over the long-term.
 ''The fiscal responsibility of this bill is very critical,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Lincoln's first vote in the committee debate was a warning shot: she was the only Democrat to support an amendment by Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, demanding that the bill be translated into legalese before a final vote, a departure from the panel's longstanding practice of acting on detailed, plain-English summaries of bills. 
 For Republicans, complaining about the prospect of voting on an ''unfinished'' bill was a way to accuse Democrats of rushing. For Mrs. Lincoln, it was a way to remind colleagues and constituents that her vote could not be taken for granted. 
 More important, Mrs. Lincoln was one of three Democrats to vote against the public option. 
 ''I am opposed to a fully government-funded and government-run option,'' she said afterward. ''We have got a great private marketplace now that works, we just need to make it more affordable.
 ''And the way we do that is by providing more choices and creating greater competition and making sure that those who are uninsured, whether they are uninsured because the small marketplace or the individual marketplace is too expensive for them, then we need to make it reasonable in terms of its affordability.'' 
 Choice and affordability. Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell, are you taking notes? 
 Taking Sides
 Mrs. Lincoln was most outspoken in proposing an amendment to cap at $500,000 the amount of an executive's salary that private insurers can claim as a tax-deductible business expense, as a way to limit how much insurers profit from the requirement in the bill that all Americans obtain health insurance. 
 Notably, Mrs. Lincoln did not oppose the requirement or ''mandate'' to obtain coverage. 
 ''This is a fair policy change that is aimed at reassuring American consumers and taxpayers that health insurance executives aren't receiving a personal windfall,'' Mrs. Lincoln said, ''while at the same time profiting from a government mandate.'' 
 Mrs. Lincoln also worked closely with that certain Maine Republican, Olympia J. Snowe, on provisions in the bill to protect small businesses. 
 At another crucial point in the debate, Mrs. Lincoln voted in favor of Republican amendments saying that no tax or fee in the bill apply to families earning less than $250,000. The amendments failed, but the tax issue will resurface in floor debate. 
 But perhaps most noteworthy was that Mrs. Lincoln sided with the Democrats on the vast majority of votes. In public comments she insists that the health care system needs big changes, but she said it was still too soon to know how she would vote on the floor.
 ''Each of my votes is really based on what's best for Arkansas,'' she said in the interview. ''People in Arkansas are very independent-minded,'' she said. ''They are very fiscally responsible.''

HEADLINE: A Billion Here, a Billion There

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Past the initial schadenfreude, it's hard to figure out what to think about the shrinking of the nation's 400 most gilded fortunes. It is reassuring that the super-rich can lose money too -- $300 billion in the last year, according to Forbes, bringing their total down to $1.27 trillion. It's about the same percentage that was lost by Americans' private pensions, whose assets dropped by about $1.1 trillion, nearly 19 percent. 
 It can hardly hurt as much. Warren Buffett lost $10 billion but still has $40 billion. Kirk Kerkorian has $3 billion left, after losing $8.2 billion. Citigroup founder Sanford Weill dropped off the billionaires list, but still has many millions. 
 Every year as I get worked up over Forbes's latest billionaire review, I try to convince myself that accumulation of wealth at the top can serve a social function. I tell myself that inequality of income is a standard feature of capitalism, pushing the best and brightest into the most profitable jobs. It encourages people to study hard and work hard, or at least to become a banker. Big financial rewards push people to excel, and thus the economy to grow.
 But $1.27 trillion? That's a decade of health care reform in one of the more expensive versions. This isn't garden-variety inequality -- this is a winner-take-all deal that can destroy incentives for everyone except those in the upper crust.
 Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard, sensibly points out that one could generate incentives to excel for less: ''I don't think the added incentive of earning $100 million over $50 million is very different than the incentive of making $10 million over $5 million,'' he told me once. 
 Maybe the jolt of billion-plus losses can spur plutocrats to change. Ralph Nader just wrote a novel called ''Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!'' in which Mr. Buffett (already a major philanthropist), Ross Perot and a few other billionaires go to Maui to ''redirect'' society onto the right path. Warren Beatty gets to run California. Wal-Mart workers unionize. Corporate greed is brought to heel. 
 There is no sign of such enlightenment on Wall Street. Financial markets are back up; bankers are scouring the horizon for new opportunity. The hottest new incomprehensible financial object is the ''re-remic,'' bundles of distressed mortgages repackaged in a way that banks and insurers can minimize how much cash they must set aside in case the investments go south, again. Amid all this it's hard to see how our oligarchs could be persuaded to restrain their appetites. 
 Perhaps I'm being too pessimistic. We could promise that Mr. Nader wouldn't have a say in the outcome. That would seem like a reasonable incentive.

HEADLINE: World Bank and I.M.F. Begin to Eclipse Group of 7

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
The world's top financial officials did not bury the Group of 7 at their meetings in Istanbul this weekend. But a few pronounced some last rites.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, criticized the ''decisions, no follow-up, boring communiques, and then the next meeting six months later'' in summing up the widespread view that the Group of 7 club of the big industrialized nations had outlived its usefulness.
 ''Making declarations is just not enough if you want to change the reality,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said. 
 At the weekend meetings in Istanbul of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the move toward a more multilateral world was in full swing.
 The Group of 7, meeting on the fringes, began what may be an extended fade to black. And major members of the I.M.F., while still certain to clash over the details, broadly endorsed changes to I.M.F. rules that will water down the ironclad control that the industrialized world has held on the organization for the last half century.
 ''A more representative, responsive and accountable governance structure is essential to strengthening the I.M.F.'s legitimacy,'' the American Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said in a statement.
 Coming only weeks after officials at a summit meeting in Pittsburgh of the top industrialized and emerging economies blessed the Group of 20 as the globe's top decision-making body for economic governance, the Group of 7 offered what may be one of its last statements.
 And it even made clear that the Group of 7's existence now only made sense in conjunction with the Group of 20, a body that includes China, Brazil, India and other major emerging economies.
 Every major policy decision facing the world, whether it be exit strategies from the extraordinary steps taken to prevent the economy's collapse or new regulations for the financial system, will be made ''with other members of the G-20,'' the G-7 wrote.
 Officials from G-7 countries, who did not specifically mention the forum's fate in their statement, were quick to emphasize that the lines of communications among its members had to remain open.
 ''The G-7's existence is fully justified,'' said Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, The Associated Press reported. ''It's still important for us to talk on issues of economy and finance.''
 But they also hinted that formal statements, once a potent tool for managing currency markets but now more general in nature, would soon end. Other officials made clear that the frequency of the meetings -- at least twice a year for finance ministers and central bank chiefs -- was bound to diminish.
 Less consensus emerged on how countries would restructure the I.M.F., which has 186 members, to mirror the tectonic shifts in the world economy.
 Traditionally, a European has been at the helm of the I.M.F., which is based in Washington, while the World Bank has been run by an American, a practice that has been much criticized. Members are considering changes to its quotas, the complicated system that governs how much countries contributed to the I.M.F., and what share of votes they have.
 ''We recognize that the distribution of quota shares should reflect the relative weights of the fund's members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of the strong growth in dynamic emerging market and developing countries,'' I.M.F. members said in a statement issued Sunday.
 I.M.F. members endorsed a general plan to transfer 5 percent of the I.M.F.'s quotas away from the industrialized world to emerging market economies, and directed senior officials to work out the details by January 2011.
 That leaves ample room for friction between I.M.F. members that stand to gain in influence and those losing it, as well as within the community of advanced countries. European countries, including France and Germany, are already quietly maneuvering to preserve their own leverage, possibly at the expense of their neighbors.
 Also, the I.M.F. did not address one of the most contentious issues, that of the effective United States veto at the organization. With a 17 percent voting share in a body that requires 85 percent for major decisions, the United States can block any significant move.

HEADLINE: Inequality as Usual

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Not long ago, liberals were insisting that income inequality was America's most serious economic problem.
 Now there are more immediate crises: A 9.8 percent unemployment rate, a yawning budget deficit. But the inequality issue hasn't gone away. 
 The latest census figures show the gap between the wealthiest Americans and everybody else widening -- rather than shrinking, as some economists expected -- during the crash of 2008. An August report from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch suggested that middle-income Americans, buried in real-estate debt, will have to wait much longer than the rich to see their finances rebound. 
 This landscape will put liberalism to the test. Since Ronald Reagan was elected nearly 30 years ago, Democratic politicians have promised that their program could reverse the steady post-1970s growth of income inequality without sacrificing America's economic dynamism. 
 But having promised win-win, they may deliver lose-lose. In the short run, Barack Obama could preside over an America that's more economically stagnant and more stratified.
 There's only so much that politicians can do about broad socioeconomic trends. The rise of a more unequal America is a vexingly complicated issue, whose roots may wind too deep for public policy to reach.
 Liberals, though, have spent decades telling a more simplistic story, in which conservatives bear all the blame for stagnating middle-class wages and skyrocketing upper-class wealth. So it's fair to say that if a period of Democratic dominance doesn't close the gap between the rich and the rest of us, it will represent a significant policy failure for contemporary liberalism.
 It's also fair to point out some reasons failure is a likely outcome.
 For one thing, the lazy liberal's cure for income inequality -- soaking the wealthy with higher tax rates and cutting taxes for everybody else -- simply isn't going to happen. 
 In part, this is because the Democrats have become as much the party of the rich as the Republicans, and parties rarely overtax their own contributors. (That's why the plan to pay for health-care reform with a ''surtax'' on high earners found so many skeptics within the Democratic caucus.)
 But it's also because soaking the rich only makes a difference on the margins. The federal income tax is already quite progressive, and our corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the West. To really create a more egalitarian America, we have to address trends that run deeper than the tax code. But many of these are issues that the Democrats are either unwilling or ill equipped to tackle.
 For instance, inequality is driven in part by low-skilled immigration: it nudges wages downward for native workers, and the immigrants themselves are taking longer to achieve upward mobility than earlier generations did. 
 But today's Democrats, bent on consolidating the Hispanic vote, aren't likely to seek a lower immigration rate, or a better-educated pool of immigrants. The kind of ''comprehensive'' immigration reform that liberals support would probably increase low-skilled migration to the United States.
 Inequality is also driven by the collapse of the two-parent household, which disproportionately affects the poor and working class, depriving them of the social capital they need to rise. 
 But today's Democratic Party increasingly represents ''unmarried America'' -- the single, the childless, the divorced. This makes it an unlikely vehicle for policies that discriminate, whether through tax code or the welfare state, in favor of the traditional nuclear family.
 Inequality is perpetuated by our failing education system -- and especially by the bloated cartel responsible for educating the nation's poorest children. (If you want to understand inequality in America, start with last spring's Los Angeles Times series on what it takes to fire a lousy teacher in the Angeleno school system.) 
 But today's Democrats, the heroic efforts of some liberals notwithstanding, remain the party of the education bureaucracy, resistant to all but the most incremental efforts to bring choice and competition to our public schools.
 There is, however, one way that a Democrat majority can plausibly bring down inequality: Just let government keep growing. 
 This is the lesson of Western Europe, where the public sector is larger and the income distribution much more egalitarian. The European experience suggests that specific policy interventions -- the shape of the tax code, the design of the education system -- may matter less in the long run than the sheer size of the state. If you funnel enough of a nation's gross domestic product through a bureaucracy, the gap between the upper class and everybody else usually compresses.
 But economic growth often compresses along with it. This is already the logic of our current fiscal trajectory: ever-larger government, and ever-slower growth.
 That combination could eventually create the more egalitarian America that Democrats have long promised to deliver. The question is whether Americans will thank them for it.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P Campaign Message in a Word: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
For President Obama and his party, last week brought another stiff dose of pain: the announcement of 263,000 more jobs lost, while unemployment ticked up to 9.8 percent.
 And by all indications, Democrats must endure that form of political torture for at least several more months. Whatever the fate of health care legislation, persistently high unemployment has made ''Where are the jobs?'' the most potent Republican campaign argument as next year's midterm elections come into view.
 Publicly, White House aides and Congressional leaders have responded with incessant attempts to highlight benefits from the $787 billion economic stimulus package they enacted earlier this year. Privately, Mr. Obama's economic advisers are sifting options for a new package of tax cuts and other job creation measures to be unveiled in next year's State of the Union address -- or earlier if pressure for action becomes irresistible. 
 Republicans entered the age of Obama with hope in the traditional pattern of midterm election losses by a president's party. But now unemployment trends have heightened their confidence that their political luck has turned more sharply and rapidly than most Republicans had expected.
 ''It is the Democrats' turn to go through the historical meat grinder,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican strategist who says he sees his party on track to gain 15 to 25 House seats. ''So far they don't have much to brag about, and the political clock is ticking.''
 Pointing to Good News
 Democrats girded for the last week's bad news in typical fashion. Two days before the Labor Department's jobs report, Mr. Obama appeared at the National Institutes of Health in suburban Maryland with the local Democratic congressman, Chris Van Hollen, to promote the award of $5 billion in stimulus money to finance biomedical research.
 That research will spur high-quality employment, the president said, rebutting adversaries' portrayal of the stimulus package as larded with wasteful projects. ''It's not just about creating make-work jobs, it's about creating jobs that will make a lasting difference for our future,'' he said.
 Mr. Van Hollen, who leads the Democrats' midterm election effort as chairman of the party's House campaign committee, sees two critical factors in withstanding the Republican jobs assault. One is Democrats' ability to point to signs of economic recovery, like improving real estate, credit and stock markets; the other is avoiding premature declarations of ''mission accomplished'' on the economy.
 ''Most of our guys have gone home and talked to their constituents about how this is going to be a long, tough recovery,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''The main test is, did the economy turn around, and who was on your side?''
 Obama advisers also count on voters' memories of the unpopular Bush administration and of the badly wounded economy they inherited. But Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton discovered that economic recovery programs Americans ultimately judged successful did not protect their parties in midterm elections.
 '' 'It could have been worse' is of little utility in politics,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's top political adviser, acknowledged. 
 Moreover, even Mr. Obama's economic team now concedes that unemployment, which they once hoped to keep from exceeding 8 percent, will get worse through the end of the year. One outside economist, Mark Zandi, predicts the economy will shed 750,000 more jobs over the next six months, with unemployment peaking at 10.5 percent in June.
 Republicans say the trends will only magnify voters' doubts about the effectiveness of the administration's anti-recession policies. ''For a lot of people, the 'whether it's working or not' is filtered through jobs,'' said a Republican pollster, Bill McInturff. 
 All in the Timing
 Those doubts help explain why Mr. Obama said in a recent interview that he was strongly inclined against a second infusion of economic stimulus money. But Democrats are considering other steps in addition to the extension of unemployment benefits now moving through Congress.
 Mr. Zandi recommends that the administration extend existing measures, like a tax credit for homebuyers and accelerated depreciation for businesses. Yet even if those steps succeed economically, the political question is how quickly they could help Democratic candidates.
 The prototype for bad timing was in Reagan's second year in office, when Republicans lost 26 seats in the midterm elections weeks after unemployment topped 10 percent. If unemployment begins declining by next summer, Mr. Van Hollen reasoned, voters will see Mr. Obama's strategy as successful. 
 But Mr. McInturff said voters' attitudes about the economy tend to harden by summer of an election year. ''They are running out of the window between now and 2010'' to change them, he said.

HEADLINE: Assessing Those Who Grade the Tests

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a veteran scorer of standardized tests in all subject areas for grades 3 through 12, I have found that the system is not nearly as capricious as Todd Farley contends (''Reading Incomprehension,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 28).
 In my experience, all readers hold college degrees and receive specific training in objective criteria for awarding points. Essays are routinely reviewed by two readers, and when a significant point spread exists between two scorers, the response gets a third reading. 
 From my vantage point, I would say the real folly of standardized testing lies not in the scoring, but in the inordinate amount of time and money devoted to testing rather than teaching.
 Cory Goger Worthington, Ohio, Sept. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I was glad to see an editorial exhorting Education Secretary Arne Duncan to resist political pressure in the allocations of the Race to the Top funds (''Mr. Duncan and That $4.3 Billion,'' Sept. 28). 
 But I was concerned that student performance, often a code word for standardized test scores, was emphasized in eligibility for the funds. Ironically, on the next page, an Op-Ed article by Todd Farley pointed out the significant problems in the scoring process for these very tests.
 Leaving aside the important arguments about whether or not these tests are even valid, Mr. Farley's essay points to the fact that student performance (and thus teacher and school performance) is not being reliably measured by standardized tests.
 I am worried that we will repeat the mistakes of No Child Left Behind by again pegging our evaluations of schools and teachers to these inaccurate tools.
 Jeremy Glazer Miami Beach, Sept. 29, 2009
 The writer is a former high school teacher.
 To the Editor:
 Todd Farley argues that the main problem with open-ended standardized scoring is not so much the test itself but using untrained scorers. But as a teacher with a master's degree in writing who has scored standardized essays, I have found that the main problem indeed lies with the test itself.
 In order to come up with a score, I have had to make snap judgments under time pressure about how the essay conforms to the rubric, which the testing company sets up to have a rigid, narrow set of values. As a scorer, I myself am valued if my responses conform to my peers', and at risk of being fired if I deviate too much from the group.
 I have seen essays that are quirky, creative, bold, shocking or disturbing earn a lower score than safe, mediocre essays that conform to the established criteria. I remember a student response in rhymed couplets in the style of Pope that received a score of 4 out of 6 -- rhyming and satire are not part of the scoring matrix.
 The sad truth is that when we reduce something so complex as writing to a standardized scoring tool, we send the clear message that we value connect-the-dots thinking, conformity and mediocrity.
 Diana Lambert Cherry Hill N.J., Sept. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As a college freshman, I have recently dealt with the standardized testing process, and I am not surprised by Todd Farley's statements.
 I have always had a problem with evaluations of my performance and aptitude based on my writing. There is no standard way of teaching what writing should be. With every new year and every new teacher I have been taught a different way to write, and each teacher grades based on what his or her perception of good writing is, which is never uniform.
 I believe that not even the ''professionals who have made a commitment to education'' can accurately score writing on standardized tests because each of their perceptions of good writing is different.
 Josh Robichaud Fairfield, Conn., Sept. 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While Todd Farley is no doubt correct that the people who score standardized tests are a problem, they are certainly not the only problem. Studies of standardized tests performed and published over the last three decades have shown that the results of standardized tests bear little or no correlation to the future academic abilities of the students who take those tests. More than anything else, the tests measure inequality in education based on social, racial and economic status. And as a recent study shows, standardized tests are used in order to maintain that inequality and support the stereotype of ''minority failure.''
 The problem here isn't the scorers per se, but the fact that tests that do nothing but maintain the status quo and funnel money to test companies are still in use.

HEADLINE: New Court Term May Give Hints To Views on Regulating Business

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The new Supreme Court term that begins Monday will be dominated by cases concerning corporations, compensation and the financial markets that could signal the justices' attitude toward regulatory constraints at a time of extraordinary government intervention in the economy. 
 The justices' decisions will be closely watched at a time when, constitutional scholars say, Obama administration initiatives are generating fundamental questions about the structure and limits of government power that will, in short order, reach the court.
 ''There will be major ways in which these interventions will produce legal and constitutional issues,'' said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal appeals court judge who is now director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center.
 The term will provide important hints, said Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at New York University, to ''how much the worst economic crisis since the Depression is going to shape the court's general stance toward markets and economic regulation.'' 
 Professor Pildes pointed to two cases in particular, one concerning the constitutionality of a regulatory board created in the wake of the Enron accounting scandal, the other about what role the courts should play in setting the compensation of advisers to mutual funds. 
 The decisions in those cases, he said, are likely to signal whether the court has become ''more receptive to regulatory constraints on the market'' in the wake of the financial crisis.
 The new term comes at a time of rapid change at the court. While the Rehnquist court welcomed no new justices in its final 11 years, ending with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's death in 2005, there have already been three versions of the Roberts court in its first four years. And there may be more changes come summer, if talk of the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens turns out to be correct. 
 The court's newest addition, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, arrived in August, replacing Justice David H. Souter. While most Supreme Court specialists expect her to vote much as Justice Souter did, there are at least two areas in which she may veer away from his approach. 
 One is criminal law. The other is corporate law, a field in which the expertise she gained on the federal appeals court in New York, with its heavy business docket, will play a major role.
 The Obama administration, meanwhile, took office in the middle of the last term and its lawyers made only minor adjustments in pending cases. They will be freer to chart their own course now. One result, Professor McConnell said, will be an inevitable clash, one echoing confrontations with other ambitious presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
 ''Every time in American history when you see a consequential administration,'' he said, ''you see a heightened tension between it and the court.'' 
 By the time the justices left for their summer break in June, a majority of the cases they had agreed to hear -- 24 of 45 -- concerned business issues, according to a tally by the National Chamber Litigation Center of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The corresponding numbers last year were 16 of 42.
 The nature of the cases has changed, too. In recent terms, the business docket was studded with cases about employment discrimination, federal pre-emption of injury suits and the environment. With the exception of a single employment case, all of those categories are missing.
 In their stead, important questions about bankruptcy, corporate compensation, patents, antitrust and government oversight of the financial system will confront the justices. 
 Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, No. 08-861, for instance, concerns an issue that has engaged the court since the New Deal: at what point does the lack of presidential control over independent agencies violate separation-of-powers principles? 
 The case arose from the last big financial crisis, the accounting scandals at Enron, Worldcom and other companies. In response, in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Congress created an independent board to oversee accounting firms. The board's members are appointed and may be removed for cause by the Securities and Exchange Commission, itself an independent agency, meaning the accounting board is doubly insulated from both political pressure and presidential oversight. 
 The Supreme Court's ruling in the case, said Professor Pildes, who submitted a brief supporting the board to the appeals court, could affect ''how much flexibility Congress will have to design new administrative structures to avoid future financial crises.''
 In Jones v. Harris Associates, No. 08-586, the Supreme Court will decide what role the courts should play in regulating the compensation paid to investment advisers for mutual funds. In affirming dismissal of the case, a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said the issue was a variation on the much-discussed question of whether the markets could be trusted to set executive compensation. 
 ''Publicly traded corporations use the same basic procedures as mutual funds,'' Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook wrote for the panel. Though he dissented from the full court's decision not to rehear the case, Judge Richard A. Posner agreed that ''executive compensation in large, publicly traded firms often is excessive because of the feeble incentives of boards of directors to police compensation.''
 A case re-argued in September and technically part of last year's docket, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, No. 08-205, is another example of the court's more intensive focus on the limits of government regulation of businesses. The question in the case, which centers on the documentary ''Hillary: The Movie,'' is whether the government may ban political speech by corporations that concerns candidates during campaign season.
 Another case about free speech rights, Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz v. United States, No. 08-1119, arises from a 2005 federal law that appears to bar lawyers from advising their clients to take on more debt if they are considering bankruptcy, a practice that can be abusive. But there are perfectly lawful reasons to take on such debt, like refinancing a mortgage to pay down credit card debt. The Justice Department is urging the court to narrow the law.
 The case that has most transfixed the business community is Bilski v. Doll, No. 08-964, a patent dispute that addresses the consequential question of whether intangible business methods may be patented. A federal appeals court last year rejected Bernard L. Bilski's attempt to patent a method of hedging risks in commodities trading, ruling that only processes tied to a particular machine or capable of transforming an object into something different can be patented. 
 A broad ruling could affect many aspects of the economy, notably computer software. 
 ''Bilski seems to have the makings of a landmark decision in patent law,'' said Pamela Harris, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University.

HEADLINE: The Blank Slate, Revived

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The high-tech industry has been working itself into paroxysms of excitement lately over an idea that is not exactly new: tablet computers.
 Quietly, several high-tech companies are lining up to deliver versions of these keyboard-free, touch-screen portable machines in the next few months. Industry watchers have their eye on Apple in particular to sell such a device by early next year.
 Tablets have been around in various forms for two decades, thus far delivering little other than memorable failure. Nonetheless, the new batch of devices has gripped the imagination of tech executives, bloggers and gadget hounds, who are projecting their wildest dreams onto these literal blank slates. 
 In these visions, tablets will save the newspaper and book publishing industries, present another way to watch television and movies, play video games, and offer a visually rich way to enjoy the Web and the expanding world of mobile applications. 
 ''Desktops, laptops -- we already know how those work,'' said Brian Lam, editorial director of the popular gadget site Gizmodo, which reports and hypothesizes almost daily about these devices. Tablets, he said, ''are one of the last few mysteries left.''
 Tablet computers were first conceived as a way to supplant plain old paper, in the same way that PCs replaced the typewriter. 
 In 1993, Apple's Newton MessagePad, with its expansive screen and stylus pen, became known less for its innovative features than for being lampooned in ''Doonesbury,'' which ridiculed the device for its flawed handwriting recognition. Steven P. Jobs killed the Newton when he returned to Apple in 1997.
 Then in 2001, at Comdex, the industry trade show, Bill Gates introduced new Windows software for tablets with a bold prediction: within five years, he said, tablets ''will be the most popular form of PC sold in America.'' It didn't happen, of course. Tablets running Windows sell only a few hundred thousand units a year, mostly in business fields like health care and financial services.
 There were basic problems with these early tablets: they cost too much and did not do enough. 
 ''Software engineers got ahead of the hardware capabilities,'' said Paul Jackson, a consumer product analyst at Forrester Research. ''But we may be finally getting to the point where the dreams and aspirations of those designers are actually meeting capable and reasonably priced technology.''
 You can thank Moore's Law and the immutable advance of technology for that. Integrated microchips now combine wireless connectivity and support for features like multimedia, GPS functions and rich graphics. They are also more energy-efficient. 
 At the same time, the iPhone and its imitators have demonstrated that new tactile touch screens work and that people are comfortable with them, in a way they never got accustomed to using earlier tablets and stylus pens.
 ''We darn well should be about ready to take advantage of this stuff. It's time,'' said Bill Buxton, a researcher at Microsoft who has been working on multitouch systems for 20 years, and has a comprehensive collection of tablets and touch screens he keeps in his office in Toronto.
 The drumbeat of tablet product introductions has already begun. In June, Archos, a French consumer electronics company, began selling a small touch-screen tablet running Google's Android software. Later this month, it will introduce another tablet that runs on Microsoft's Windows 7, which has built-in support for touch screens. 
 ''A road warrior doesn't want to take a big clamshell netbook with him,'' said Frederic Bala, vice president for marketing at Archos.
 The industry blog TechCrunch has also commissioned its own Web tablet, called the CrunchPad, which it has said it will start selling later this year.
 Despite its past bruises in the tablet business, Microsoft appears ready to try again. In September, images of a booklike Microsoft device called Courier, with two 7-inch color screens, surfaced on Gizmodo. 
 In an interview, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, would not discuss that product in particular, but said the company devises such prototypes all the time, so it can take them to its hardware partners. Still, rumors of a Microsoft tablet computer sparked interest. ''I got an e-mail from some customer who said, 'I want that,' '' Mr. Ballmer said.
 Apple's rumored tablet is the most highly anticipated of the lot. Analysts expect Apple to introduce it early next year -- a sort of expanded, souped-up version of the iPod Touch, priced at around $700. 
 Last week, Apple rehired the original chief marketer of its old Newton, Michael Tchao, who was working at Nike. Mr. Tchao's former Apple colleagues believe he will help market this new device. 
 Colin Smith, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment on the company's recruitment or product plans. But Apple's tablet will most likely have little in common with the Newton, which was essentially a personal digital assistant. The new crop of tablets is being viewed as more flexible -- gadgets that combine elements of the iPhone, e-book readers like the Kindle and laptops.
 Apple has been working on such a Swiss Army knife tablet since at least 2003, according to several former employees. One prototype, developed in 2003, used PowerPC microchips made by I.B.M., which were so power-hungry that they quickly drained the battery. 
 ''It couldn't be built. The battery life wasn't long enough, the graphics performance was not enough to do anything and the components themselves cost more than $500,'' said Joshua A. Strickland, a former Apple engineer whose name is on several of the company's patents for multitouch technology.
 Another former Apple executive who was there at the time said the tablets kept getting shelved at Apple because Mr. Jobs, whose incisive critiques are often memorable, asked, in essence, what they were good for besides surfing the Web in the bathroom.
 The success of the iPhone may have partially helped to answer that question. As of last month, developers had created 85,000 applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch -- video games, social networking software, restaurant finders and more. Analysts believe that all those programs will immediately work on the new tablet while developers begin to tailor new software for the larger screen.
 Despite the preponderance of apps, there is still the persistent question of whether regular people will really find a use for tablet computers. Smaller cellphones are increasingly multipurpose and fit nicely in a jacket pocket. And low-end laptops are inexpensive, run a full-fledged operating system and offer the luxury of a keyboard.
 ''I can imagine something like the iPhone with a much bigger screen being a gorgeous device with great capacity, but I don't know where I would fit that into my life,'' said a former Apple executive, who declined to be named because of Apple's secrecy policies, but who anticipates an Apple tablet next year. ''Those are the debates that have been happening inside Apple for quite some time.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Foresees a Rise in Unemployment

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve board, said on Sunday that the latest job report showing the nation's unemployment at 9.8 percent was ''pretty awful'' and said he expected the figure to climb even higher. 
 ''My own suspicion is that we're going to penetrate the 10 percent barrier and stay there for a while before we start down,'' he said in an appearance on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC.
 He said he was particularly concerned about data in the employment report, released Friday, indicating that an increasing number of Americans have been unemployed for more than six months. That number increased in September by 450,000, reaching 5.4 million, according to the report from the Labor Department. 
 Prolonged unemployment means ''the economy loses skills,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''And people who are out of work for very protracted periods of time lose their skills eventually.''
 He went on: ''And remember that what makes an economy great is a combination of the capital assets of the economy and the people who run it. And if you erode the human skills that are involved there, there is a real and in one sense an irretrievable loss.''
 The ''silver lining'' to the jobs report, he said, is that after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year and a plunge in stock markets, businesses laid off too many people in anticipation of a drastic slowdown in the economy. Some of those jobs will have to be restored.
 ''At some point we're going to start to see an improvement in employment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs More Penalties on Iran, but Black Market Shows It Can Adapt

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE and MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama has vowed to keep the pressure on Iran over its nuclear program after last week's meeting in Geneva, and his advisers said the United States was intensively recruiting other nations to join in a harsher economic embargo against Tehran should diplomacy fail.
 But as the focus on sanctions intensifies, a review of the United States' experiences in enforcing its own longstanding restrictions on trade with Iran suggests it would be difficult to truly quarantine the Iranian economy.
 Black market networks have sprouted up all over the globe to circumvent the sanctions. A typical embargo-busting scheme was detailed in a plea agreement filed in federal court here on Sept. 24, the day before Mr. Obama and European allies announced the existence of a previously undisclosed Iranian nuclear enrichment facility near Qum.
 In the court filings, a Dutch aviation services company and its owner admitted that they had illegally funneled American aircraft and electronics components to Iran from 2005 to 2007. Under the scheme, Iranian customers secretly placed orders with the company, which served as a front, buying the parts and having them shipped to the Netherlands, Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates. The materials were then quietly repackaged and shipped on to the real buyers in Iran. 
 The Dutch company was eventually caught. But the ease with which it had operated until then illustrates a key hurdle facing the United States: even if diplomatic challenges can be overcome to persuade countries with significant economic ties to Iran, like China, to approve sanctions, it is virtually impossible to make an embargo airtight.
 ''The Iranians have a lot of experience at this point in evading sanctions,'' said Michael Jacobson, an intelligence and sanctions specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''They are adaptable, learn from mistakes, see where the United States cracks down and move elsewhere. And on the part of businesses, there is a lot of willful blindness.''
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged last week that existing economic sanctions against Iran were ''leaky.'' But several senior administration officials said the latest revelations of Iran's secret nuclear efforts had generated unprecedented solidarity behind new measures to apply pressure to Tehran.
 On Thursday, Iranian officials met in Geneva with representatives from the United States and other world powers. At that session, the Iranians pledged to give nuclear inspectors access to its clandestine enrichment facility and to ship most of its openly declared uranium outside the country to be further enriched by France or Russia.
 While viewed as progress, the meeting drew further attention among diplomats to the role of possible new sanctions. To hold Iran to its pledges, and to prevent it from dragging its feet on the larger objections to its nuclear program, officials said Iran would need to feel a credible threat of punitive measures.
 ''If you don't put yourself in a position where you can act on the pressure track, you'll be less likely to have the engagement track work,'' said a high-ranking administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ''The key is for the Iranians to see both sides of this.''
 To that end, he said, the United States is refusing to take any measures off the table, even an embargo of gasoline and other refined fuel. European countries fear such measures would inflict misery on the Iranian people by creating shortages that would make them angry at the West and drive them into the arms of an unpopular government.
 ''We're not going to be in the business of pre-emptively excluding anything,'' the American official said. ''The key is not what ought to have an impact on them, but what in their eyes will have the most impact on them.''
 For several months, officials said, the administration has been talking with other countries about a list of potential sanctions against Iran. Congress is weighing legislation to expand financial sanctions, while the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, is pushing a bill that would levy sanctions on foreign companies that export gasoline to Iran.
 Existing sanctions have had some practical consequences. In Tehran, the power goes out regularly, a result of a shortage of electricity generators, which are on the list of prohibited goods because of their potential for military use. That did not happen even a decade ago. 
 Still, the experience of the United States in policing its own unilateral economic sanctions -- which were imposed after the 1979 hostage crisis and expanded several times since then -- shows that restrictions are more likely to drive up prices of banned foreign goods than to stop them totally from flowing into Iran. The world is full of rogue nations and smugglers skilled at hiding illicit goods in the vast stream of global trade, and other nations may not be as willing as the United States to police sanctions rigorously.
 The guilty plea by the Dutch avionics company late last month was just the latest in a string of indictments against several hundred such defendants since 2007, when the Bush administration significantly increased efforts to enforce the United States' own trade restrictions with nations like Iran.
 In separate cases over the past few months alone, prosecutors have accused defendants of illegally routing fighter jet parts to Iran through Colombia, electronic components through Malaysia and helicopter parts through Singapore. The list goes on, with accused intermediaries based in places including Ireland and Hong Kong.
 Financial sanctions have also been violated. In January, the London bank Lloyds TSB agreed to pay $350 million in fines for hiding the involvement of entities in countries including Iran on wire transfers with United States banks over a 12-year period. In 2006, regulators fined the Dutch bank ABN Amro for similar sanctions-busting dealings from 1997 to 2004.
 Such enforcement, administration officials say, has persuaded other major European banks that it is not worth the risk of doing business with Iran. But rather than being cut off from access to letters of credit and insurance, Iran has instead turned to smaller financial institutions that are based in Asia and have no business dealings in the United States.
 That kind of displacement, said Mr. Jacobson, the sanctions expert, shows that even strict sanctions, enforced with broad international support, would be unlikely to entirely seal off a country as large and complex as Iran. But, he said, the restrictions have a comparatively modest but nevertheless real benefit: they increase the cost and difficulty for Iranian elites of doing business, providing an incentive for the country's leaders to negotiate.
 ''While it's unrealistic to expect that you can isolate Iran from the international economy,'' he said, ''the narrower and more realistic goal of raising their cost of doing business may change their leaders' calculations.''

HEADLINE: Corzine's Wall Street Resume Loses Value for Voters

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
When Gov. Jon S. Corzine crossed from the gilded halls of Goldman Sachs to the gritty trenches of New Jersey politics, his Wall Street pedigree was an incalculable advantage that served as the very basis for his candidacy.
 Opponents would raise questions about his inexperience, business dealings and liberal political positions. But with the world in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom, voters were so intrigued by the fortune Mr. Corzine had amassed that many were willing to gamble that his Midas touch might revitalize New Jersey's finances, too. 
 Today, New Jersey's economy is reeling, Goldman Sachs's luster has dulled and Mr. Corzine's greatest asset has become a political liability as he struggles to keep his job in November's election. 
 Goldman has been particularly vilified in the minds of many people as a Wall Street behemoth that leveraged the influence of its lobbyists and former executives to curry political favor and that used government bailout payments to boost its profits. A recent article in Rolling Stone magazine branded Goldman ''a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.'' 
 ''Goldman right now, to its detriment, is equated with Wall Street and Washington walking hand in hand, and there's a widespread suspicion that it's a conspiratorial relationship,'' said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian and the author of ''Collateral Damaged.'' ''There's a sense that because of its power and connections, when the economy finally clears up, Goldman will benefit from that before the rest of the country.''
 Mr. Corzine's Republican challenger, Christopher J. Christie, has used the governor's Goldman Sachs years to tie him to a variety of unsavory financial schemes, at one point releasing an Internet ad featuring a clip of Gordon Gekko, the villain in the film ''Wall Street,'' who famously declared, ''Greed is good.'' 
 And surveys show that voters' confidence in Mr. Corzine's ability to lead the economy, once his strong suit, has plummeted. So as he runs for re-election Mr. Corzine is far more eager to talk about the lawsuit his administration filed against Lehman Brothers or his work as a United States senator on a corporate ethics bill, than his years as chief executive and a chairman of a mighty investment house. His campaign advisers point out that it's been nine years -- an eternity in politics -- since he left Wall Street and four years since he sold the last of his stock in Goldman Sachs; they say they are confident that voters will judge him by his actions as an elected official rather than his past as a bond trader.
 ''In 2000, Jon Corzine's resume was all Wall Street related,'' said his spokesman, Sean Darcy, ''but today, he is known as one of the architects of a new school-funding formula based on the education needs of students statewide and universal health care for children, covering an additional 90,000 children across New Jersey to date.''
 Still, Mr. Corzine's political career has been undeniably shaped and fueled by the fortune he built on Wall Street. In all his races, he has vastly outspent rivals, using more than $100 million of his own money to finance campaigns for senator and governor. This year he is planning to spend more than $35 million -- about $25 million from his own portfolio -- on his re-election bid. Mr. Christie is accepting public financing, which places a limit of under $11 million.
 Mr. Corzine's deep pockets have allowed him to cast an imposing political shadow. When he ran successfully for Senate in 2000 -- promoting universal and government-financed health care, preschool instruction and public college tuition -- some voters were swayed by the notion that Mr. Corzine's Wall Street alchemy might help him find a way to pay for his expensive proposals. 
 ''It was an era of prosperity, and he was successful as a Wall Street titan,'' said Walter Fields, who worked on the campaign of Mr. Corzine's opponent in the 2000 Senate race, former Gov. Jim Florio. ''Average people were doing well and thought he could help them do better.'' 
 Mr. Corzine was elected governor in 2005 on a promise to use his financial expertise, and he tapped former colleagues from Goldman Sachs to serve in key positions, including state treasurer, chief of staff and head of the office of economic growth. Mr. Corzine and his economic team have won praise for eliminating budget gimmicks used by previous administrations to conceal spending and for becoming one of the first states to roll out a stimulus program following last fall's economic collapse. 
 But one of Mr. Corzine's biggest setbacks -- his attempt to raise billions by selling and then leasing the New Jersey Turnpike -- failed, in part, analysts say, because he tried to pitch it using an inscrutable and uninspiring Wall Street term: asset securitization. 
 With New Jersey's unemployment rolls higher than they have been in decades and many voters skeptical about the financial services industry's role in the economic collapse, Mr. Christie has been aggressively reminding the public about Mr. Corzine's past. 
 ''He promised he was going to bring Wall Street to State Street,'' Mr. Christie said at a recent campaign appearance in Orange. ''He sure did: the same fiscal mismanagement that sent our economy into disaster.'' 
 The Christie campaign has also accused Mr. Corzine of cronyism, charging that his administration, which appointed three executives with ties to Lehman Brothers to the State Investment Council, lost $20 million by investing pension funds in Lehman three months before the firm went bankrupt. 
 Mr. Corzine's advisers point out that New Jersey is seeking to recoup losses from Lehman Brothers. Before Mr. Christie became the United States attorney, they note, he worked as a lobbyist and represented the Securities Industry Association in its effort to block securities fraud from being included under the state's Consumer Fraud Act. 
 ''Christie has tried to recast himself as an outsider when, in fact, he is the ultimate insider,'' Mr. Darcy said. 
 Mr. Corzine's campaign has tried to boost his candidacy by using Democratic allies, including President Obama, to extol the governor's business background and argue that it has helped improve the lives of New Jersey residents. 
 ''The argument they're making is that because of his experience in the business world, New Jersey is in a better spot than it would have been without his leadership, and is doing better than other states,'' said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University. 
 Mr. Corzine has bypassed opportunities to promote his Wall Street background, even when it might have been tied to positive economic news. Since December, New Jersey has reached agreements to lure nearly 2,000 jobs from Wall Street to Jersey City by using millions in state tax incentives and other enticements.
 Mr. Corzine has crowed about the successful recruitment, and been unapologetic about poaching jobs from New York, but he and his advisers have avoided suggesting that his Wall Street connections might have helped seal the deals. Jerold L. Zaro, a top economic adviser, said it was ''mere coincidence'' that the new jobs were in an industry synonymous with Mr. Corzine. ''We're trying to attract good jobs, wherever they may come from,'' Mr. Zaro said. ''We're open to all comers.''

HEADLINE: Nursing Homes That Belie the Bad Image

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
I have often said in no uncertain terms that I never want to be placed in a nursing home unless it is to recover from a treatable illness or injury. I have heard so many horror stories of neglect, mistreatment, understaffing, poorly trained attendants and even corruption. I shared the common perception of a nursing home as the last place you go before you die, and this was not how I wanted to spend my last days.
 Then last spring, after I had made similarly disparaging remarks in a public forum, I was invited to tour one of the largest nursing homes in Florida, now called Miami Jewish Health Systems. I was delighted to discover an example of a home where one could not only benefit medically and emotionally but also enjoy one's last days. 
 This is an all-purpose, nonprofit facility that evolved through visionary leadership and generous donations from community members to become one of the top-ranked centers in the nation. Many of its features, especially the caring and respect devoted to each resident by well-trained personnel, could serve as a model for nursing homes throughout the country. 
 It is one-stop shopping, complete with an acute-care hospital, short- and long-term skilled nursing care, in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation services, a memory and dementia clinic, psychiatric treatment, a pain center, recreational and entertainment activities, respite care for caretakers, spiritual and religious services, assisted living quarters, hospice care and even treatment for children with cerebral palsy.
 The Miami Model
 Of course, there are other well-run facilities throughout the United States, like the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx. But many nursing homes, even those that lack the space and finances to provide soup-to-nuts care, could learn from the 20-acre facility in Miami, where the ill and infirm of every ethnicity and religious persuasion spend days, weeks, months or years. 
 There I met Annabe Schwartz, a 94-year-old widow, meticulously groomed and well dressed, who sat in her wheelchair surrounded by plants and pictures she had chosen.
 ''I love this place,'' she told me. ''It's my home.'' Although she said she was estranged from her family, at the Miami home she said she felt cared for, appreciated and respected, with prompt attention to her medical needs. 
 Staff members trained in gerontology greet each resident by name and with a smile, know each one's medical and personal histories and seem to enjoy taking care of older people, even those who can at times be cantankerous. 
 The Miami home has 492 beds, 300 of them for long-term care for people who are chronically ill and no longer able to live independently. Eighty-five percent of patients are covered by Florida's Medicaid program, which pays $205 a day for each, or $75 less than the actual cost of care, which must be raised through contributions and foundation grants.
 In an article last April in The Journal of the American Medical Association, a group of researchers concluded that a large percentage of patients throughout the country lacked continuity of care -- contact with the same physician both in and out of the hospital. Far too often, once patients leave the hospital, their care lacks coordination and follow-up, leading to frequent and costly returns to the hospital -- a problem the Obama administration will have to solve if it is to contain the costs of care for the growing aged population. This kind of coordination is a hallmark of the Miami home.
 Ideally, most long-term nursing care would be provided in the patient's home, the most economical solution and the stated preference of 9 in 10 older Americans. For example, as reported recently by AARP, Florida spends about $5,000 a year to help one older person remain at home through its community care program and $8,000 for Medicaid home services; the average annual cost of a Florida nursing home is $65,000.
 Still, if a nursing home is an inevitable destiny for you or a loved one, it is possible to find a good one. In her enlightening book ''Taking Charge: Good Medical Care for the Elderly and How to Get It'' (Old Mission Press, 2006), Jeanne M. Hannah, a Michigan lawyer whose mother died of neglect in a nursing home, wrote, ''There was a pervasive attitude among the caregivers I encountered in the long-term care facility that the patients were old and were going to die anyway, that caring for them -- changing diapers, hand-feeding -- was something that the workers did, not because they liked to do it, wanted to do it or were even particularly good at it, but because they needed the minimum wages that are paid for these unpleasant jobs.''
 Ms. Hannah found that in her mother's nursing home there were not enough aides to help patients with activities like feeding, that aides lacked adequate training and supervision and that medical attention by doctors and skilled nurses was brief and infrequent.
 ''Unless your loved one is in a most unique facility,'' she concluded, ''it will be up to you to monitor her care and assist with her care.''
 A Checklist for the Search
 Ms. Hannah and her co-author, Dr. Joseph H. Friedman of Brown University School of Medicine, listed five main steps they regarded as essential in seeking out a nursing home.
 Investigate deficiencies. Quality standards have been established by the federal government and state health departments. A nursing home that fails to comply with a standard or regulation is issued a deficiency citation, and information about these deficiencies can be found on the Medicare Web site Nursing Home Compare, at www.medicare.gov/NHCompare.
 Choose quality over location. ''Location is not the best reason for selecting a facility,'' the authors wrote. ''Your primary consideration should be high quality of care,'' which includes the highest possible staffing levels and, ideally, direct connection with a hospital. Here again, the Medicare Web site can help.
 Monitor the care. Don't assume you can depend on the facility to make sure the patient receives proper care. Visit often at various times, including nights, weekends and holidays, when the staff members on duty may not be the most experienced. Make sure medications are given at the right times and check on the amount of food and fluids the patient is actually consuming, since malnutrition and dehydration are common hazards in nursing homes and can be fatal.
 Assist at meals. For patients not adept at feeding themselves, arrange to have someone come in to assist with eating, especially at the noontime meal, the main one in nursing homes.
 Hire a geriatric care manager. If no one nearby is able to assist a nursing home patient, consider hiring a professional who can serve as family liaison. A geriatric care manager is trained in gerontology and can visit the patient, evaluate and monitor the situation, and arrange medical and other appointments. The National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers maintains a directory, searchable by ZIP code, at its Web site, www.caremanager.org.

HEADLINE: Measure of U.S. Service Sector Rose in September

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A private trade group said Monday that its measure of the American service sector grew in September for the first time in 13 months.
 The Institute for Supply Managementsaid in a report that its service index hit 50.9 last month, up from 48.4 in August. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a reading of 50, the dividing line between growth and contraction.
 The index, which tracks more than 80 percent of the country's economic activity, including hospitals, retailers, financial services companies and truckers, hasn't grown since August 2008.
 The new orders index, an indicator of future activity, jumped to 54.2 in September, the first growth reading in a year.

HEADLINE: One State's Solution May Not Be a Model for the Nation

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Utah is only the second state to develop its own insurance exchange, and it is distinctly different from its better-known counterpart in Massachusetts. It is also unlike anything currently envisioned in Congress. 
 Aimed initially at small businesses, the exchange offers a way for companies to pay a fixed amount toward their employees' medical coverage, instead of buying the coverage directly for them. The workers then can select from various plans on the exchange. If they cost more than the employer's contribution, the employee pays the difference. 
 In terms of workplace benefits, it is the health care equivalent of an employer's shifting from a pension plan to a 401(k) retirement plan. 
 ''This is a grand experiment,'' said David Clark, the Republican state legislator who helped head the creation of the new exchange. 
 Since it was started in mid-August, the exchange so far has attracted about 230 small businesses, representing about 2,300 employees. Those workers have their choice of more than five dozen policies from three insurers: Humana, Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Utah, and SelectHealth, which is the health plan for the Intermountain Healthcare, the large hospital system in Salt Lake City. 
 What the exchange does not offer is a way for these small businesses to spread the cost of employing older or sicker workers over a larger group -- a step many health economists say would be crucial to making insurance more affordable for more people. But Mr. Clark said lawmakers decided, at least initially, to stay within the state's current rules, which place limits on how much more an insurer can charge one small group over another, as a way to protect employers with potentially high medical expenses. 
 Critics say the exchange is missing a vital opportunity. ''The true power of an exchange comes from its function as a purchasing pool, where risk is spread over a larger group,'' said Judi Hilman, the executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a research group that favors significant changes to the health care system. The project recently issued a report on the new exchange. 
 She also criticized the state's decision to move away from employer responsibility for worker coverage to a system in which companies put up only a fixed amount of money. The exchange does little to address the increasing unaffordability of care, she said. ''So far, we're taking the easy way out.'' 
 Despite a warm reception from one of Utah's senators, Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican, when the model was recently discussed in Washington, Ms. Hilman cautioned that the Utah exchange was not an example of how to fix the health care system. ''Those who are opposed to national reform will point to Utah,'' she said. ''I think that's a big mistake.''
 But Mr. Clark, for one, says he hopes federal lawmakers will wait to pass judgment on the Utah model until it has had a chance to prove itself.

HEADLINE: Cutting Carbon Emissions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''It's Easy Being Green,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Sept. 25): 
 Taking meaningful steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions will not be cheap or easy, but the reality is that no one knows precisely how much it will cost. What we do know is that it's a mission we must undertake, which is why our industry supports enactment of legislation to slash carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050.
 We also know that federal legislation must include strong consumer protection measures to help dampen electricity price increases. For example, Congress should establish a moderate floor and ceiling on the price of emission allowances to protect consumers from abrupt energy price increases and the economy from volatility. 
 Congress should also allocate a full 40 percent of allowances to the power sector, proportionate with the industry's carbon dioxide emissions. The benefits would flow through to electricity customers, under the supervision of state public utility commissions. 
 Moreover, emission reduction targets should reflect the availability of emerging climate-friendly technologies. 
 Taking these steps will help protect customers and help ensure sustained public support for tackling climate change.

HEADLINE: Prepaid, but Not Prepared for Debit Card Fees

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Buying a prepaid debit card these days is just about as easy as picking up a bottle of shampoo or a candy bar. Walk into a Wal-Mart or almost any major drugstore, and rows of plastic worth $25, $100 and even $500 beckon from kiosks alongside prepaid phone cards and gift cards for retailers. 
 ''No Credit Check. Safer Than Cash. No Bank Account Needed,'' says the Green Dot Visa Prepaid Card: Just pay at the register and the card is ready for A.T.M. withdrawals, store purchases and online shopping.
 For many people who do not have bank accounts, or cannot get a credit card, the appeal is irresistible, making the reloadable cards among the consumer banking industry's fastest-growing products. But their convenience comes with a catch: fees, often hidden in the fine print. 
 The MiCash Prepaid MasterCard docks cardholders a $9.95 activation fee. Like many competitors, it then charges numerous recurring fees, including $1.75 for each A.T.M. withdrawal, $1 for each A.T.M. balance inquiry, 50 cents for each purchase, $4 for monthly maintenance, $2 for inactivity after 60 days and $1 for a call to customer service.
 The Millennium Advantage Prepaid MasterCard goes further, listing an application fee of up to $99. The Silver Prepaid MasterCard advertises that it does not charge for overdrafts as many debit cards do, but it gives itself the option of charging a $25 shortage fee if customers exceed their balance. 
 ''It's a very expensive way to bank,'' said Jean Ann Fox, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America.
 A cottage industry only 10 years ago, reloadable prepaid cards have tapped into the vast pool of about 80 million consumers who have little or no access to bank accounts. The market includes college students who do not want to carry around wads of cash and consumers who do not want to type their credit card number into the Internet. 
 More typically, it comprises low-income people and immigrants who have fewer financial options than other Americans. Often, they turn to these cards because they cannot open a bank account, or they become fed up with the costs of check-cashing stores or overdraft fees on checking accounts. 
 Industry officials say the cards are a good deal because users can avoid the fees charged on low-balance bank accounts and at check-cashing stores. 
 ''If you look at these products today compared to even a checking account, many consumers have found that they can be far less expensive,'' said Gary Palmer, chairman of the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association. 
 But even as the industry expands, many prepaid cards continue to charge fees -- including for purchases and paying bills -- that can quickly accumulate. 
 Like many workers, Tyrell Blocker, 20, of Brooklyn, could ill afford the surprise when he took such a card last week to a Pay-O-Matic Financial Services store in Manhattan after a bank turned him down for an account because he lacked one of two required pieces of identification. As soon as the cash from his paycheck landed on his card, he noticed fees accumulating. Mr. Blocker returned to Pay-O-Matic to complain and only then was provided a detailed list of more than two dozen fees, he said.
 ''I need every last dime I got; I've got a newborn,'' Mr. Blocker said. A spokesman for Pay-O-Matic said the card was fairly new and the firm was working to make the fees more transparent. 
 Little Regulatory Scrutiny
 Because it is a relatively new industry, prepaid cards have not undergone the Congressional and regulatory scrutiny of credit and debit cards. In the spring, lawmakers restricted interest rate increases and hidden fees on credit cards, and regulators are now examining stricter rules on overdraft fees on checking accounts. Even gift cards, which expire when the money runs out, will soon be subject to new rules limiting monthly fees and expiration dates. 
 Congress has asked regulators to determine if prepaid cards warrant the same protections extended to debit and credit cards. The industry's trade association says such measures are unnecessary and would make cards more expensive.
 But consumer advocates say the lack of regulation means that prepaid card users can continue to be blindsided by hidden fees, and have few legal protections to recover their money if a card is lost or a charge disputed. 
 Mike Henry, who owns a small print shop in California, had not been able to recover $50 stuck on his Only 1 Visa prepaid card after it stopped working. He gave up after numerous calls to customer service -- at 95 cents each -- went unresolved. Only 1, meanwhile, continued to send daily updates of his balance as it was eaten away by monthly fees. His account was finally whittled to zero. 
 ''For the last six months, I turn on my computer and check my e-mail and get slapped in the face,'' he said.
 Only 1 officials said they regretted his inconvenience and were refunding Mr. Henry's money. 
 Among the beneficiaries of these cards are Visa, MasterCard and Discover, which receive about a nickel to 20 cents each time a credit or debit card emblazoned with their logo is swiped. While the companies do not disclose income from prepaid cards, their efforts to add tens of millions of users represents a potentially significant source of new revenue. 
 Financial firms that issue the cards are often little-known companies with names like Green Dot, NetSpend and AccountNow. Since they get money upfront from the consumer, there is relatively little risk with prepaid debit cards, compared with credit cards and other loan-making products. 
 Given the number of people who have little or no relationship with a bank, both in the United States and abroad, the financial industry is betting on a boom. In 2008, for instance, customers loaded about $8.7 billion onto prepaid cards, a 125 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Mercator Advisory Group. The industry is expected to balloon to $119 billion by 2012, Mercator predicts. 
 ''Every year we've seen big growth,'' said Steve Streit, the founder of Green Dot, now one of the largest reloadable prepaid card companies. ''There's a part of me that believes we are just at the entry ramp to growth right now.''
 The cards are part of a larger universe of plastic that includes prepaid phone cards and gift cards, payroll cards and government benefit cards. Industry officials are particularly excited about the explosive growth from government agencies and companies as they replace paper checks with prepaid cards to save money. Social Security payments are now offered on prepaid cards to retirees without bank accounts, and many states do the same with welfare payments. Wal-Mart recently said it would pay employees only on prepaid cards if they did not have a bank account for direct deposit. 
 These fees tend to be lower than those on commercial prepaid cards. But critics question why there are any fees at all, particularly when the recipients do not have a choice. 
 ''To me, it's a terrible thing to give people their pay on a card that has fees on it,'' said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities for Consumer Action. 
 Reloadable prepaid cards hardly existed a decade ago. Then, as credit cards surged and the Internet bubble lifted the economy, a handful of companies noticed an untapped market in teenagers who wanted to shop on the Internet, but were not eligible for credit cards. But it soon became clear that the larger market for prepaid cards was people who do not use banks and the uncreditworthy. 
 In the years since, dozens of companies and banks have latched on, some offering celebrity branding to lure customers. Johnny Cash, Usher, Carmen Electra and the football player Vince Young have all had their name attached to a prepaid card, and the hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons continues to back the RushCard, mainly to African-Americans, as a ''better alternative'' than banks and credit cards.
 But these efforts are not without controversy. Mr. Simmons, for example, has batted down repeated criticism that his card saps money from low-income users. His Pay-as-You-Go card has come under scrutiny for charging a $19.99 activation fee deducted from the cash first loaded onto the card; a $1 convenience fee for the first 10 purchases every month; and a fee of $1 for every bill paid with the card. 
 Fees Are Declining
 Industry officials say fees have been declining, especially after Wal-Mart this year trimmed fees on the MoneyCard Prepaid card it sells, which prompted several other issuers to cut prices too. They add that consumer complaints are rare and that surveys indicate the vast majority of customers like the cards.
 An industry-sponsored study by Bretton Woods, a bank advisory firm, said that cards like Green Dot, Wal-Mart and NetSpend are cheaper than a checking account, whose annual cost can be as high as $353, assuming six overdraft charges, compared with $207 for a direct-deposit prepaid card. 
 Yet in many instances, even the lowest-fee prepaid cards can cost more if consumers are able to avoid bank overdraft fees. That should get easier after several large banks announced recently they would let customers decline overdraft protection.
 While most major banks charge $10 or less a month for a low-balance checking account, a survey of two dozen prepaid cards released in August by the Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, found that the cheapest, the Wal-Mart Money Card, cost $16.59 in the first month and $21.54 in the second.
 By contrast, the most expensive card, the Millennium Advantage card, cost $115.05 in the first month, because of a $99 application fee, and $27.95 the second month, the survey, compiled by Michelle Jun, a lawyer for Consumers Union, showed.
 And the actual fees charged can be confusing. A spokesman for the Millennium Advantage card said that while it lists the $99 fee, the company charges only up to $30. A spokesman for the Silver card said that it does not actually charge the $25 shortage fee shown in its fine print, and is working to remove it from company documents.
 ''How are consumers supposed to keep the fees straight if the companies can't?'' said Michael McCauley, a spokesman for Consumers Union. 
 In the meantime, bewildered by opaque terms and often dodgy customer service, many consumers are fending for themselves. 
 Damon Saxton, 34, said he had given up on prepaid cards and hoped to return to a bank, if they will have him. Mr. Saxton began using a prepaid card after being barred from getting a bank account for cashing a check from an eBay sale without realizing it was fake.
 But Mr. Saxton, who lives in Florida, said that the two years he used his Vision Premier Prepaid Visa Card were marred by petty fees and horrible customer service. 
 Mr. Saxton said that when he punched the wrong code into an A.T.M., the bank charged him $2.95 for a declined A.T.M. transaction. When he called to complain, he said, they charged him an additional $1.95. When someone got hold of his card number and racked up several hundred dollars in shortage fees, Vision Premier covered the fees with Mr. Saxton's tax return, which was directly deposited onto the card, he said.
 A spokesman for the Vision Premier said Mr. Saxton's experience was not the norm. The company eventually refunded the fees. 
 ''I wasted countless hours dealing with this problem, not to mention the stress,'' Mr. Saxton said. ''I think the whole business is based around nickel and diming.''

HEADLINE: Upgrade for Big Banks Helps Chase Away Gloom

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street climbed back to its feet on Monday after two weeks of losses.
 Investors went shopping across all sections of the market, from financial shares to oil producers to health care companies. They were heartened by new figures showing that service businesses, which dominate the American economy, grew last month after nearly a year of relentless declines, a private research group said on Monday. 
 The report from the Institute for Supply Management offered corroboration that the economy was recovering, though perhaps at a glacial pace. Businesses said that new orders were coming in and business activity was picking up, though they were still cutting jobs and worried about overstocked shelves. 
 Over all, the report noted only a slight return to positive growth, but it seemed enough of a shift for Wall Street. 
 A report from Goldman Sachs upgrading big banks to attractive encouraged investors to buy in the financial sector. 
 Shares of the consumer bank Wells Fargo rose nearly 7 percent to $28.09, and other financial giants like the Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were all higher. Regional lenders, too, were up slightly, even though Goldman cautioned they could be outfoxed by their larger rivals.
 ''The market has failed to recognize the dramatic improvement in earning power at the large banks versus the regionals,'' Goldman analysts wrote.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.08 points, or 1.18 percent, to close at 9,599.75, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.25 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,040.45. The Nasdaq was up 20.04 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,068.15.
 The price of crude oil inched up to $70.41 a barrel, and gold prices shot to $1,017 an ounce as the dollar weakened against other major currencies. 
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 103 13/32 and the yield remained at 3.22 percent.
 Comments from the White House about its efforts to stabilize the job market spurred speculation that Washington would push through extensions of several tax credits and spending programs already passed under the stimulus. Some investors fear a so-called double dip recession if the government abruptly withdraws stimulus spending.
 ''The economy itself is not yet healthy enough to propel itself forward without the aid of the government. That is the consensus,'' said Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.
 After two weeks of declines and souring economic news, investors had been looking for something to fill their sails in advance of third-quarter earnings season, which begins on Wednesday when the aluminum maker, Alcoa, reports results. 
 This summer, businesses showed they could turn a profit by slashing costs, usually by laying off workers and reducing plans for growth. Now, many investors are hoping for glimmers of rising revenue at industrial producers, consumer companies and financial firms as the recession ebbs.
 Some analysts believe that companies will surprise Wall Street with better profits and smaller losses than expected, touching off another surge forward in stocks.
 ''We're looking for some decent numbers,'' said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.
 But last week, stocks fell close to 2 percent after new reports on job losses, and on weakened manufacturing activity and automobile sales, suggested that the recovery will be a difficult slog for investors and workers alike. The weak economic numbers reinforced worries that stocks had surged too far, and were overdue for a correction. 
 On Monday, some investors were betting that such a correction had already occurred, and began buying again. Shares of department stores like Macy's, Saks and Dillard's all rose more than 3 percent, and the online marketplace eBay was up slightly after the report on service-sector growth.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auctions of three- and six-month bills and 10-year inflation notes:

HEADLINE: State Forces Are Accused Of Abuses In Honduras

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Tegucigalpa last week and added updated information from Mexico City.

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras 

 BODY:
Rosamaria Valeriano Flores was returning home from a visit to a public health clinic and found herself in a crowd of people dispersing from a demonstration in support of the ousted president, Manuel Zelaya. As she crossed the central square of the Honduran capital, a group of soldiers and police officers pushed her to the ground and beat her with their truncheons.
 She said the men kicked out most of her top teeth, broke her ribs and split open her head. ''A policeman spit in my face and said, 'You will die,' '' she said, adding that the attack stopped when a police officer shouted at the men that they would kill her. 
 Ms. Valeriano, 39, was sitting in the office of a Tegucigalpa human rights group last week, speaking about the assault, which took place on Aug. 12. As she told her story, mumbling to hide her missing teeth, she pointed to a scar on her scalp and to her still-sore left ribs. 
 Since Mr. Zelaya was removed in a June 28 coup, security forces have tried to halt opposition with beatings and mass arrests, human rights groups say. Eleven people have been killed since the coup, according to the Committee for Families of the Disappeared and Detainees in Honduras, or Cofadeh. 
 The number of violations and their intensity has increased since Mr. Zelaya secretly returned to Honduras two weeks ago, taking refuge at the Brazilian Embassy, human rights groups say. 
 The groups describe an atmosphere of growing impunity, one in which security forces act unhindered by legal constraints. Their free hand had been strengthened by an emergency decree allowing the police to detain anyone suspected of posing a threat.
 ''In the 1980s, there were political assassinations, torture and disappearances,'' said Bertha Oliva, Cofadeh's general coordinator, in an interview last week, recalling the political repression of the country's so-called dirty war. ''They were selective and hidden. But now there is massive repression and defiance of the whole world. They do it in broad daylight, without any scruples, with nothing to stop them.''
 Amid the crackdown, a delegation of foreign ministers from the Organization of American States is scheduled to arrive in the capital, Tegucigalpa, on Wednesday in an attempt to restart negotiations between representatives for Mr. Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the de facto president. 
 In advance of the meeting, Mr. Micheletti lifted the decree Monday. 
 The abuses could have a chilling effect on presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 29. The de facto government and its supporters argue that the elections will close the chapter on the coup and its aftermath, but the United Nations, the United States and other governments have said that they will not recognize the vote if it is conducted under the current conditions. 
 ''Elections are a risk because people won't vote,'' said Javier Acevedo, a lawyer with the Center for Research and the Promotion of Human Rights in Tegucigalpa. ''The soldiers and police at the polls will be the same ones as those who have been carrying out the repression.'' 
 Investigators from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights visited in August, and found a pattern of disproportionate force, arbitrary detentions and control of information.
 The group asked the de facto government to provide protective measures for dozens of politicians, union leaders, teachers, human rights workers and journalists who say they have been followed and threatened. 
 The de facto government responded that strong measures were needed against Mr. Zelaya's supporters, whom they described as vandals, a point backed up by government television advertisements showing burning buses and street barricades. Some of the demonstrations have turned violent as some of Mr. Zelaya's supporters have smashed storefronts and burned tires at street barricades. The government says that three people have been killed since the coup. 
 Mr. Micheletti has said the investigators from the Inter-American Commission were biased, noting that its president, Luz Patricia Mejia, is Venezuelan. Much of Honduras's political and economic elite feared that Mr. Zelaya was trying to copy Venezuela's brand of socialism as he moved toward an alliance with that nation's president, Hugo Chavez. 
 The Honduran government's human rights institutions have failed to respond to the violations with any vigor, advocates say. 
 The human rights prosecutor, Sandra Ponce, is on vacation, according to news reports. Ramon Custodio, the government human rights commissioner who fought repression in the 1980s, has generally supported the coup, although he has criticized some actions of the de facto government.
 Groups that were vulnerable to human rights abuses before the coup face even more risk now. Since the coup, for example, there have been six murders of gay men or transvestites, according to gay rights groups. Until 2008, the average number of such killings each year was three to six.
 The day after Mr. Zelaya returned, the police broke up a demonstration by his supporters outside the Brazilian Embassy with tear gas. As people were fleeing, security forces tear-gassed the Cofadeh office, just blocks away. The action, Ms. Oliva believes, was aimed at preventing Cofadeh lawyers from intervening by taking testimony or seeking the release of people who were detained. 
 Since Mr. Zelaya's return, security forces also have been rumbling through poor neighborhoods that are the base of his support. ''They are going into neighborhoods in a way to intimidate people,'' said Mr. Acevedo, the lawyer. In that time, the center has documented an increasing level of violence. Investigators have seen more than two dozen people with bullet wounds in hospitals, and some detainees have had their hands broken and have been burned with cigarettes, he said.
 While the police and soldiers are looking for the activists who have been organizing resistance, the sweep seems to pick up anyone who gets in their way. 
 Yulian Lobo said her husband was arrested in the neighborhood of Villa Olimpica and accused of having a grenade. ''It came out of nowhere,'' she said, adding that her husband, a driver, had not been to pro-Zelaya marches.
 Lesbia Marisol Flores, 38, is a resistance activist, but when the police beat her up, she was waiting at a bus stop after attending the wake of a 24-year-old woman who died after she was tear-gassed outside the Brazilian Embassy on Sept. 22.
 ''There were eight policemen and their faces were all covered,'' she said, adding that they had selected her at random from the group at the bus stop. ''There was no motive. It is their hobby now.''

HEADLINE: Exchange, or Shortchange?

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It is the sleeper issue in the current health care debate. 
 Despite all the disagreement in Washington, every proposal now before Congress to overhaul the nation's health care system includes creation of an insurance ''exchange'' -- a marketplace that would operate something like a Travelocity Web site for insurance policies. 
 In theory at least, the exchange would fix a fundamental flaw in the present system by giving small businesses and individuals a broad choice of insurance policies at competitive prices. Right now, such buyers typically have few affordable options.
 The idea of an exchange has support from the White House and many in Congress -- from people who also advocate including a government-run insurance plan in the marketplace and from those who oppose letting the government compete with commercial insurers. 
 But policy experts say few lawmakers have yet paid enough attention to what that new marketplace should look like -- and whether it would actually work as promised.
 Without careful design and adequate rules of fair play, and without letting enough buyers participate to create a robust market, the exchange might not actually stimulate new competition among the nation's health insurers. In other words: What happens if you build an exchange and insurers do not flock to it with new, well-priced wares?
 The risk is that many local markets could end up looking much as they do today -- with small businesses and individuals at the mercy of too few insurers wielding too much power in their regions. 
 ''We may not be able to improve competition in the short run through the exchange,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist at the New America Foundation, a Washington research group that supports an overhaul of the insurance market. 
 So far, the House proposal calls for the creation of a national exchange where someone in Iowa, for example, may have the same choice of health plans as buyers in Maine and California. Because insurance is now a state-by-state patchwork, such an approach would conceivably enhance competition by creating an interstate market. 
 But critics worry that the result may be a few big providers of one-size-fits-all plans, still leaving many small businesses and consumers with products that do not meet their needs or budgets. 
 Both Senate proposals, meanwhile, favor the creation of state-based exchanges, where a state may have the choice of deciding whether its residents can also buy from a national or regional exchange. The exchanges may have other wide variations, depending on the model chosen by a state or outlined in the legislation. 
 Some may mirror the one in Massachusetts, which actively screens the policies and negotiates with insurers on behalf of customers. Others may operate more like electronic yellow pages, where insurers list their offerings with little government involvement or oversight. 
 Another big question is whether there will be enough new customers to prompt insurers to actively compete for their business. 
 As currently outlined in the Congressional proposals, participation in the exchanges would be limited in some way -- to only the very smallest employers, or to residents of a single state or to people who do not now have coverage through their employers. 
 Another limiting factor, policy experts say, would be whether Congress provides generous enough subsidies so that people who do not currently have insurance could afford it. 
 For all their potential drawbacks, the exchanges are meant to address a fundamental issue: the current lack of competition in many parts of the country. 
 President Obama, for example, in his recent speech to Congress, cited states like Alabama where the insurance market for individuals and small companies is dominated by a handful of carriers. As a result, he said, ''the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down.''
 A recent analysis by the Government Accountability Office notes that in more than a dozen states, including Delaware, Maine, North Dakota and Rhode Island, the largest health insurer offering coverage for a small business commands more than half of the overall market. 
 Some insurers argue that the strongest need for competition is among the hospitals and doctors, not the health plans serving as middlemen. 
 ''There has to be competition within the delivery system,'' said David H. Klein, the chief executive of the powerful Excellus BlueCross BlueShield in Rochester, a nonprofit insurer that is one of the major sources of coverage in that market. ''In most of America, that just isn't going to happen.''
 But small business owners frequently complain they when they have limited choice among insurers, they have little bargaining clout. ''It's a 'take it or leave it' for some of the biggest carriers out there,'' said Amanda Austin, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses. 
 At Smithfield Diesel and Transmission Repair in Rhode Island, for example, for years the choice of insurers has been limited to the state's two biggest carriers -- a Blue Cross plan and United Healthcare -- said Joan Frattarelli, who runs Smithfield Diesel with her husband. This year, the company's costs went up by 29 percent, to about $34,000 for coverage of four employees under Blue Cross. 
 Ms. Frattarelli said she worried that some proposals in Congress would continue to restrict her options to only those plans now available in Rhode Island, which would leave her no better off. ''Competition is the name of the game,'' she said, ''I don't care what industry it is.'' 
 The hope in Washington, of course, is that an influx of tens of millions of newly insured customers will lure insurance companies to enter new markets. That is what happened a few years ago when private insurers flocked to offer prescription drug coverage after it was added to the Medicare program, said Ken Sperling, a health care consultant for Hewitt Associates. 
 But because of the restrictions on who can shop, and the question of whether the shoppers will be able to afford insurance, no one knows how many new customers there might be, especially in some in the least populous markets.
 The big national insurance companies, like Humana, United Healthcare and Aetna, would not speculate on how the exchanges might affect their business plans. But some of the regional insurers say they could be tempted to expand, at least into nearby markets or states. 
 ''It's not off the radar screen,'' said George C. Halvorson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, the big California health plan. ''We're going to sit down and take a really hard look.'' 
 Another deterrent facing new entrants is the fact that established insurers can negotiate the deepest discounts with the local hospitals and doctors, making it hard for a new player to compete on price.
 ''The big dominant insurer in any market has the providers pretty much sewn up,'' said Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University. ''I think that's the big problem, and I don't know that the legislation addresses that very well.''
 Congress must also decide whether the exchanges would have any authority to decide which plans are offered and at what price, said Paul Fronstin, a policy analyst with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a co-author of a recent report on insurance exchanges. ''The exchange can have a more active role if it negotiate rates,'' he said, ''but it is not clear what is going to happen.'' 
 In Massachusetts, for example, the state's exchange, called the Connector, negotiates directlywith the state's private insurance companies in offering a small number of state-subsidized plans -- similar to what an employer does when it screens the policies offered to its work force. 
 ''We work as an aggressive employer, offering managed competition,'' said Jon Kingsdale, the executive director of the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority. He said the agency's ability to negotiate on behalf of 180,000 customers who required state subsidies was a reason it achieved a 6 percent reduction in the cost of premiums this year. 
 But the Connector would be less effective if it had no say over which plans were offered on the exchange, said Mr. Kingsdale, who criticized the Senate Finance committee's proposal, for example, as potentially creating little more than ''an automated yellow pages.'' 
 Because formulating an effective exchange is so difficult, some policy analysts are still arguing that only a new government-run competitor could create a powerful enough force in many parts of the country to offset the home-court advantage many insurers already wield. 
 ''People don't realize how hard it is to crack these markets,'' said David Balto, a former official with the Federal Trade Commission who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group. ''What you need to have,'' he said, ''is something that effectively disrupts the market.''

HEADLINE: Worrying About the Safety of Beef

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Burger That Shattered Her Life: Trail of E. Coli Shows Flaws in Ground Beef Inspection System'' (front page, Oct. 4):
 Your article about E. coli and the young woman whose future has been irreversibly altered through the simple, all-American act of eating a hamburger is a stunning indictment of the food-processing industry in general and the specifically named corporations whose moral bankruptcy is made all the more glaring by their efforts to justify their actions behind a curtain of claims of trade confidentiality. 
 It also offers an equally harsh negative judgment of the federal authorities whose mandate is to protect the integrity of the public's food supply chain but who have chosen to interpret this responsibility so lightly as to let such claims stand while ignoring repeated offenses by the industry. 
 Is it any wonder that cynicism with regard to the efficacy of government is at an all-time high?
 A. Victoria Bridgehampton, N.Y., Oct. 5, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I ate my last hamburger last night. It tasted wonderful -- juicy, fragrant and meaty. Then I saw the photo of Stephanie Smith and read the accompanying article. It's a terrible but ultimately not surprising tale, given the continued lack of self-regulation and the emphasis on profit over safety in the meat industry.
 The only way the meat industry will change its ways is for people to stop buying ground beef and cause sales to plummet. Only then will these companies ''do the right thing,'' if only to ensure their continued survival.
 Starting today, I'm no longer eating ground beef.
 Ann Calandro Flemington, N.J., Oct. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your otherwise impressive article did not mention irradiation, the only reliable method of eliminating E. coli O157:H7 and other disease-causing microbes from raw meat and poultry. The Food and Drug Administration approved irradiation as safe and effective for use on poultry in 1992 and on meat in 1997. But for more than 20 years, consumer groups led by Public Citizen have worked to scare the public about food irradiation and threatened to boycott companies that market irradiated products.
 In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that irradiating half the meat and poultry consumed in the United States would mean 900,000 fewer cases of food-borne illness and 350 fewer deaths each year. Unfortunately, irradiated meat and poultry can't be found on store shelves. For that you can blame a cowardly food industry and a cynical consumer movement, willing to sacrifice lives to further its antinuclear agenda.

 To the Editor:
 As someone who has followed this issue for years, I would no sooner eat burger meat from an industrial processor than I would send a 4-year-old across Broadway alone. 
 While this tragedy will increase calls for sorely needed government regulation, the real answer lies in the hands of each one of us: buy your burger from a local butcher who processes his ground beef daily on the premises.
 There are many of these, survivors of the industrialization of our food supply, in most cities and towns across America. You will enjoy a much better meal and can safely cook it to your preferred doneness, although it will cost more.
 The consumer, in his willy-nilly race to the bottom of the price chain, is the real enabler here. I wonder if the inflated health insurance premiums we all pay, in part to account for worst-case scenarios like that of Stephanie Smith, are in effect a hidden subsidy for these food-processing giants, who, like the banks that don't even know who actually owns the mortgage, are unable to tell where our food even comes from.
 Serge Scherbatskoy Arcata, Calif., Oct. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I have been a strict vegetarian most of my life, and, as such, I have never lacked reasons -- ethical, economic and health-related -- to continue this lifestyle. But Stephanie Smith's very tragic hamburger-induced affliction provides me with still another excuse (as if I needed one) to shun the carnivorous ways of so many of my fellow beings. 
 I wish Ms. Smith the very best. 
 Gordon Wilson Laguna Niguel, Calif., Oct. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Nobody on the path followed by the contaminated beef that wrecked Stephanie Smith's life has accepted responsibility for his failures in the obligation to assure food safety. The Department of Agriculture, Cargill and all their suppliers mouth meaningless, and nonbinding, pledges to make incremental improvements while assuring us only that they will not take all the measures that are within their power to produce safe food.
 The Department of Agriculture, our government, continues to compromise our health in favor of industry convenience. How many lives must be lost or horribly altered before the agencies we entrust with our well-being do their jobs and begin to look out for our interests?
 Gary Paudler Summerland, Calif., Oct. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 With regard to the tragic E. coli food poisoning of Stephanie Smith, which has probably left her paralyzed for life, as well as many others around the country ill from tainted ground beef, I find the comments of Dr. Kenneth Petersen, an assistant administrator with the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, dreadful, appalling and alarming. 
 He stated that the department could demand mandatory testing, but that it had to consider what effect that would have on companies as well as consumers. He said, ''I have to look at the entire industry, not just what is best for public health.'' 
 It was my understanding that the agency's first priority was and should be the safety of the public! Imagine if I and the rest of the medical profession said we had to look at the entire pharmaceutical and surgical supply industry's needs, not just our patients' health. What a potential disaster that could be for our patients' health and well-being!

HEADLINE: The View From 1889

 BODY:
The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, built in the late 19th century to link New York and New England to the coal beds of Pennsylvania and the West, is a marvel of Industrial Revolution engineering. It fills the sky over the Hudson River, a muscular lattice of trusses and struts on giant footings, a survivor from a long-gone era before bridge mediocrities like the Tappan Zee. 
 Anyone who has ever gazed on it from the riverbank and wondered what it was like to walk across will now be able to find out. It has just been opened to the public as Walkway Over the Hudson, the latest example of the new kinds of infrastructure -- for tourism and recreation -- that are reshaping the Hudson Valley. 
 The bridge was abandoned in the 1970s and sat for decades because it was too expensive to tear down. Volunteers made fitful efforts to repair it as a walkway, but the project took off only about five years ago with big infusions of ambition and money, including federal and state aid and a $2 million corporate grant. This year's 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's river trip helped push the $38 million project to completion.
 The bridge is part of a bigger web of things to see and do up and down the Hudson River. There are trails and bike paths from both sides linking the nearby Mid-Hudson Bridge, downtown Poughkeepsie, and parks, historic homes and landmarks. To the many civic, environmental and historic organizations that look after the Hudson Valley -- including Scenic Hudson, whose land acquisitions have given the region a wealth of public greenery -- the bridge has two jobs: be lovely to look at (and from), and energize the economy. 
 The Henry Hudson anniversary sparked many plans for legacy projects, many of them -- including land purchases as a bulwark against view-destroying sprawl -- still unrealized. Maybe as the economic and aesthetic benefits of this once-dreamy, impractical vision -- saving and fixing a big old bridge -- become clearer, people will summon the will and means to dream even bigger.

HEADLINE: Does Obama Get It?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The big question on the domestic front right now is whether President Obama understands the gravity of the employment crisis facing the country. Does he get it? The signals coming out of the White House have not been encouraging.
 The Beltway crowd and the Einsteins of high finance who never saw this economic collapse coming are now telling us with their usual breezy arrogance that the Great Recession is probably over. Their focus, of course, is on data, abstractions like the gross domestic product, not the continued suffering of living, breathing human beings struggling with the nightmare of joblessness.
 Even Mr. Obama, in an interview with The Times, gave short shrift to the idea of an additional economic stimulus package, telling John Harwood a few weeks ago that the economy had likely turned a corner. ''As you know,'' the president said, ''jobs tend to be a lagging indicator; they come last.'' 
 The view of most American families is somewhat less blase. Faced with the relentless monthly costs of housing, transportation, food, clothing, education and so forth, they have precious little time to wait for this lagging indicator to come creeping across the finish line.
 Americans need jobs now, and if the economy on its own is incapable of putting people back to work -- which appears to be the case -- then the government needs to step in with aggressive job-creation efforts.
 Nearly one in four American families has suffered a job loss over the past year, according to a survey released by the Economic Policy Institute. Nearly 1 in 10 Americans is officially unemployed, and the real-world jobless rate is worse. 
 We're running on a treadmill that is carrying us backward. Something approaching 10 million new jobs would have to be created just to get back to where we were when the recession began in December 2007. There is nothing currently in the works to jump-start job creation on that scale.
 A massive long-term campaign to rebuild the nation's infrastructure -- which would put large numbers of people to work establishing the essential industrial platform for a truly 21st-century American economy -- has not seriously been considered. Large-scale public-works programs that would reach deep into the inner cities and out to hard-pressed suburban and rural areas have been dismissed as the residue of an ancient, unsophisticated era.
 We seem to be waiting for some mythical rebound to come rolling in, magically equipped with robust job creation, a long-term bull market and paradise regained for consumers.
 It ain't happening.
 While the data mavens were talking about green shoots in September, employers in the real world were letting another 263,000 of their workers go, bringing the jobless rate to 9.8 percent, the highest in more than a quarter of a century. It would have been higher still but 571,000 people dropped out of the labor market. They're jobless but not counted as unemployed. The number of people officially unemployed -- 15.1 million -- is, as The Wall Street Journal noted, greater than the population of 46 of the 50 states.
 The Obama administration seems hamstrung by the unemployment crisis. No big ideas have emerged. No dramatically creative initiatives. While devoting enormous amounts of energy to health care, and trying now to decide what to do about Afghanistan, the president has not even conveyed the sense of urgency that the crisis in employment warrants.
 If that does not change, these staggering levels of joblessness have the potential to cripple not just the well-being of millions of American families, but any real prospects for sustained economic recovery and the political prospects of the president as well. An unemployed electorate is an unhappy electorate. 
 The survey for the Economic Policy Institute was conducted in September by Hart Research Associates. Respondents said that they had more faith in President Obama's ability to handle the economy than Congressional Republicans. The tally was 43 percent to 32 percent. But when asked who had been helped most by government stimulus efforts, substantial majorities said ''large banks'' and ''Wall Street investment companies.''
 When asked how ''average working people'' or ''you and your family'' had benefited, very small percentages, in a range of 10 percent to 13 percent, said they had fared well. 
 The word now, in the wake of last week's demoralizing jobless numbers, is that the administration is looking more closely at its job creation options. Whether anything dramatic emerges remains to be seen. 
 The master in this area, of course, was Franklin Roosevelt. His first Inaugural Address was famous for the phrase: ''The only thing we have to fear. ...'' But he also said in that speech: ''Our greatest primary task is to put people to work.'' And he said the country should treat that task ''as we would treat the emergency of a war.''
 Now that's the sense of urgency we need.

HEADLINE: AS JOB LOSS RISES, OBAMA AIDES ACT TO FIX SAFETY NET

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; John Harwood contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With unemployment expected to rise well into next year even as the economy slowly recovers, the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Congress are discussing extending several safety net programs as well as proposing new tax incentives for businesses to renew hiring.
 President Obama's economic team discussed a wide range of ideas at a meeting on Monday, following his Saturday radio address in which he said it would ''explore additional options to promote job creation.'' But officials emphasized that a decision was still far off and that in any event the effort would not add up to a second economic stimulus package, only an extension of the first. 
 ''We're thinking through all additional potential strategies for accelerating job creation,'' said Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod.
 The latest deliberations, and Mr. Obama's added phrase in Saturday's radio address, occurred against a backdrop of worsening joblessness. While some economists and policy makers say the recession is easing, a report on Friday showed unemployment in September inched up to 9.8 percent, a 26-year high. 
 Among the options for additional steps is some variation on Mr. Obama's proposal during the stimulus debate to give employers a $3,000 tax credit for each new hire, which Congress rejected last winter partly out of concern that businesses would manipulate their payrolls to claim the credit. Another option would allow more businesses to deduct their net operating losses going back five years instead of the usual two; Congress limited the break to small businesses as part of the economic stimulus law.
 The search for further remedies is part of a two-track effort in the White House and Congress. Democrats are also considering plans to continue through 2010 the extra unemployment assistance and health benefits available to people who are out of work for long periods. Also likely to be retained, some officials say, is a popular $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers that was included in the $787 billion stimulus law and has helped rouse a housing market that nonetheless remains shaky.
 The unemployment and health benefits are otherwise due to expire at the end of this year, and the homebuyer's credit at the end of November. Extending the unemployment and health benefits alone through next year could cost up to $100 billion. Additional measures would raise the price at a time when the White House and Congress are confronting growing pressure to avoid adding to already high deficits.
 Yet Democrats are more anxious about stemming the loss of jobs and creating new ones.
 With economists forecasting that unemployment could hit 10 percent before job growth returns, perhaps in mid-2010, Democrats face month after month of bad news on the jobs front in a midterm election year, when a president's party typically loses Congressional seats. Charlie Cook, a longtime nonpartisan election analyst, said last week that he was raising the odds of Democrats losing their House majority to about 50-50.
 Even a modest stimulus package that mostly maintains current programs would ignite a debate about the effectiveness of the original $787 billion plan, stoking Republicans' arguments that the package of spending and tax cuts was a waste of taxpayers' money. While most economists agree with Democrats that job losses would have been worse without the stimulus, Mr. Obama remains on the defensive for his initial promise that it would save or create 3.5 million jobs.
 Despite the bad jobs figures, Democrats in Congress generally agree with the White House that a second full-blown stimulus package is not needed, barring an economic relapse.
 The $787 billion recovery plan was intended to stretch over two years, partly in anticipation that the downturn would be prolonged. About 60 percent of the total is yet to be released, and much of that will go toward projects like road-building, other construction and research that save or create jobs. 
 Mark Zandi, an economist who occasionally advises Congressional Democratic leaders, and before that advised Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in his two presidential campaigns, has projected an additional 750,000 job losses through next March, which would bring total losses to almost 9 million since December 2007. Mr. Zandi predicted that the unemployment rate would peak at 10.5 percent next June.
 It is ''very important,'' he said, for the government to ''continue to provide significant support to the economy through next year.'' At the least, he said, that should include extending the homebuyer's credit, various business tax breaks and mortgage relief programs.
 But the demands on the federal government are likely to expand beyond that in the coming year.
 Continued job losses only add to the plight of the states, which already are reeling from reduced tax revenues and increased demand for social services. Most states were able to balance their budgets this year, as they are required to do, only with billions of dollars in infusions from Washington. And the fiscal outlook for the states is now worse than a year ago, according to agencies that monitor them.
 As the White House and Congress proceed with discussions of what to do next, Congress is working to stretch unemployment compensation for people who have been out of work for up to 79 weeks, or a year and a half. The House passed a bill for 13 additional weeks of aid for jobless workers in the 27 states with unemployment rates of 8.5 percent or higher, but some senators want an extra 12 weeks of benefits available in all states. 
 With the safety net programs due to expire after Dec. 31, the White House and Congress have contemplated for some time that they would probably have to renew them. 
 Besides the extended unemployment and food stamp benefits, they would keep alive a subsidy for people who lose their jobs and opt for the Cobra program, which lets them buy continued health care coverage under their former employers' insurance plans. The subsidy covers up to 65 percent of the insurance premiums for most workers.
 As Democrats have found, aiding those who have lost their jobs is simpler than preventing more layoffs and creating new jobs.
 ''There may not be anything we can do,'' said a Democratic Congressional leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. ''Under any circumstances, it's going to take a while for jobs to recover.''

HEADLINE: Obama Reaches Past Congress for Health Care Support

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Opening a new front in the effort to promote its plans for an overhaul of the nation's health care system, the Obama administration is courting support from Republicans and independents some distance from Capitol Hill, and aggressively publicizing the results. 
 In a statement distributed by the White House, Tommy G. Thompson, the former Republican presidential candidate, health and human services secretary and four-term governor of Wisconsin, offered strong praise Monday for the legislation nearing approval by the Senate Finance Committee. 
 The statement, issued jointly with Richard A. Gephardt, the former House Democratic leader, said that ''there are some issues that remain troublesome and unresolved in the Senate Finance Committee's bill.'' 
 But it called the bill ''another important step toward achieving the goal of health care reform this year.'' And more bluntly, it said, ''Failure to reach an agreement on health reform this year is not an acceptable option.'' 
 The effort by the White House to win high-visibility support away from Congress is similar to one that was undertaken during debate on the administration's economic stimulus package. When Republican lawmakers overwhelmingly opposed that initiative, the White House reached out to Republican governors, many of whom voiced support. 
 ''The president is trying to build the broadest coalition possible for his approach to reforming the health care system,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House spokesman. ''We often find a very different, less partisan approach outside the hothouse of the Beltway.''
 In another statement promoted by the White House, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, the onetime Democrat turned Republican who is now turned independent but is nonetheless running for re-election this year on the Republican line, said Monday that the health care overhaul advanced by Democrats ''is shaping up to merit broad, bipartisan support.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who has made health initiatives like banning smoking and trans fats a top priority of his administration, characterized the legislation unfolding in Congress as ''incorporating Republican ideas and earning deserved support from Republican leaders such as former Senate majority leader Bill Frist.'' 
 Mr. Frist, who was a Tennessee heart-lung transplant surgeon before entering politics, said publicly last week that if he were still in Congress, he would vote for the health care undertaking. In an interview Monday, he said he was not endorsing the Finance Committee's bill per se but was backing the Democratic-led push for what he called transformational change to the health care system.
 ''I am not going to give up on the process,'' he said. ''A lot of my colleagues have said it would be easier to defeat the bill and wait until after the elections, and I disagree with that.'' 
 He said that he believed it was essential to bring 20 million of the ''hard core uninsured'' under the insurance umbrella and that he favored more emphasis on reimbursing health care providers by outcome and doing more to lower the cost of care.
 To draw more Republican support, he said, Democrats should expressly rule out using a legislative shortcut that would bar any filibuster of the health care bill. But he commended President Obama for pushing ahead with his initiative despite huge obstacles.
 ''You have to admire him for taking it on,'' Mr. Frist said. ''I think we have a moment where we could do something that expands access, improves quality of care and, in time, controls costs.''

HEADLINE: Recalling Indian Cinema's Orson Welles

BYLINE: By RACHEL SALTZ

 BODY:
Guru Dutt, the great poet of Hindi cinema, was also in his heyday -- the 1950s and early '60s -- something of a matinee idol. No wonder: with his soulful eyes, sensuous mouth and flyaway locks of wavy hair, he looked like the brooding artist he so often played. 
 But Dutt, who has been called the Orson Welles of India, was first and foremost a director and producer, one who created an unmistakable personal voice within the commercial industry. Along with Raj Kapoor (the showman to Dutt's poet) and a few others, he ushered in what most consider the golden age of Hindi cinema. 
 Revered in India, he is too little known here, a wrong that the New York Film Festival helps to right with its series ''A Heart as Big as the World: The Films of Guru Dutt,'' beginning on Wednesday. The series -- astonishingly the first American retrospective of his work -- includes movies he directed and starred in, as well as a couple that he produced (and starred in), and a documentary, ''In Search of Guru Dutt.'' 
 The tragic-poet image clings to Dutt partly because his life, too, seemed to follow a Hindi movie script. It's hard to resist the temptation to link him to the character he plays in ''Kaagaz ke Phool'' (''Paper Flowers,'' 1959), a successful film director who falls from grace and dies a destitute alcoholic. 
 Told in flashback, the story is bracketed by scenes of the old director wandering a vacant back lot. At the end, he sits one last time in a director's chair in an empty studio. He dies there, just as the crew arrives. Only one man recognizes him. 
 ''Kaagaz'' was a flop, and Dutt was heartbroken: he never directed another movie, though he continued to produce. He died in 1964 at 39, a possible suicide, having mixed sleeping pills and alcohol.
 In ''Pyaasa'' (''Thirst,'' 1957), his other masterpiece, Dutt again plays an unhappy artist, this time an unemployed poet. Like the hero of ''Kaagaz,'' he has been rejected by his family, only to find the artistic path a lonely one. These characters stand apart from the crowd in newly independent India, depicted by Dutt as spiritually bankrupt, a country that values money over art, ''that worships idols and destroys humans,'' as the poet in ''Pyaasa'' says.
 Dutt's films have a formal rigor unusual for the commercial industry of that time. He makes elegant use of crane and tracking shots -- his signature move is a little dolly in so the camera can study a face more closely -- to create a restless style that fits his restless, brooding heroes. 
 The consistency of that style can partly be attributed to the team he assembled and used as often as he could, especially the cinematographer V. K. Murthy, responsible for the moody black-and-white images; the composers O. P. Nayyar and S. D. Burman, who contributed the often melancholy songs; and his muse, the actress Waheeda Rehman. 
 Still, it's not all gloom and doom in the House of Dutt. His movies can be surprisingly light-hearted.''Mr. and Mrs. '55'' (1955), a comedy of marriage, opens wittily with the passing of a divorce law. Dutt plays a cartoonist (unemployed, of course) who marries a wealthy woman so she can claim her inheritance. He then must wrest her away from her auntie, a feminist who doesn't understand what makes women happy. 
 ''Mr. and Mrs. '55'' may be unusually socially conservative for Dutt, but the swashbuckler ''Baaz'' (''The Falcon,'' 1953) has an anticolonial heart and a feminist twist. The Falcon is a woman, a freedom fighter who now and again finds time to save the life of Prince Ravi, played by Dutt, in his best Douglas Fairbanks mode. 
 Featuring pirates, brutal Portuguese overseers and horsemen galloping along the palm-lined Malabar coast, ''Baaz'' is a dream of a Saturday matinee movie, refracted through a Hindi cinema lens. And it's all in a day's work for Guru Dutt: director, actor, producer.
 ''A Heart as Big as the World'' runs through Sunday at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: All Suited Up for Mischief, To Rumple Stuffed Shirts

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
It takes some nerve, not to mention diabolical intelligence and financial resources, to pull off the elaborate pranks devised by Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno (who are in real life Jack Servin and Igor Vamos), the antiglobalization activists and satirical performance artists known as the Yes Men. 
 Whether their high jinks accomplish much beyond momentarily embarrassing the corporations and government agencies they misrepresent at business conferences and public forums is an open question. But it is great fun to watch them do their dirty work. In their second film, ''The Yes Men Fix the World,'' they pose as representatives of Dow Chemical, Halliburton, Exxon and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The most outrageous of the modest proposals offered by these impostors might have made Jonathan Swift smile. 
 ''What we do is pass ourselves off as representatives of big corporations we don't like,'' Mr. Bonanno cheerfully explains at the beginning of the film. ''We make fake Web sites, then wait for people to accidentally invite us to conferences.'' 
 The Yes Men have no doubts about the righteousness of their cause. At the top of their enemies list stand Milton Friedman, ''the guru of greed'' (their words) and champion of free-market economies, who died three years ago, and his followers. 
 In the movie's first and greatest prank, they set up a fake Dow Chemical Web site and waited for a response. A week before the 20th anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal disaster at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in India, the BBC mistook their site for the real thing and invited a corporate representative to give a live interview. Posing as the fictional Jude Finisterra, Mr. Bichlbaum declared on television that Dow, which had bought Union Carbide in 2001, was taking complete responsibility for the deadly gas leak and would set up a $12 billion fund to compensate the victims and clean up the site.
 Dow stock plummeted, until the hoax was revealed. But the company never acted on the Yes Men's suggestions, and television commentators denounced the stunt as a cruel joke for giving the victims of the disaster false hope. But when the Yes Men are shown visiting Bhopal after the interview, the people they talk to express an amused gratitude for the news media attention. 
 In the silliest and most Swiftian stunt, the Yes Men impersonated Exxon spokesmen at an energy conference in Calgary, Alberta, and passed out candles made of Vivoleum, a foul-smelling new biofuel supposedly made of flesh from people who had recently died. In a filmed testimonial, the stand-up comedian Reggie Watts plays an Exxon janitor dying of cancer who donated his body to produce the test version of the fuel. The hoax was spotted, and the Yes Men ejected. 
 The funniest prank, played at a gathering of insurers, has them pretending to be Halliburton representatives demonstrating the Survivaball, an inflatable pod six feet in diameter and engineered to be an all-purpose protection from catastrophic climate change. The wearer, once outfitted, resembles a giant doughnut equipped with buglike feelers, waddling along in baby steps. How anyone could take such an invention seriously is almost beyond comprehension. But at the end of the demonstration, insurance representatives line up to accept the Yes Men's fake business cards. 
 In New Orleans Mr. Bichlbaum, posing as Rene Oswin, a bogus spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, announces to a group of contractors that instead of tearing down public housing that had been relatively unscathed by Hurricane Katrina, HUD would rebuild and reopen it for the return of displaced residents. The agency was not amused, and once again the Yes Men were denounced for spreading false hope. 
 In the movie's final stunt the Yes Men printed and passed out thousands of copies of a facsimile of The New York Times, dated July 4, 2009, and stamped with the motto ''All the news we hope to print,'' with the headline ''Iraq War Ends.'' It concludes the movie on a wistful, utopian note.
 If the Yes Men's antics have a lot in common with the stunts of Sacha Baron Cohen and Michael Moore, they are executed more in the spirit of dry amusement than as showboating, gotcha moments. For as entertaining as they are, the Yes Men are not stars; after the movie ends, it is hard to remember what they look like. 
 Their failure to shame companies like Dow Chemical into doing what the Yes Men believe to be the right thing brings up the question of why they bother. I imagine they would argue that they are sowing the seeds of a populist revolt somewhere down the line. If they can do it, why not us?

HEADLINE: Basic Brands On a Tear

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Readers of this week's People magazine could be excused for believing they were leafing through a Look magazine from 1959. Of the 44 full-page ads in the issue, half are for brands like Campbell's, Jell-O, Kraft cheese, Lipton tea and Post cereal.
 Familiar packaged foods that were once dismissed as dowdy or out of date are regaining their puissance as Americans spend less and eat at home more. While marketers in fields like automobiles, financial services and luxury goods are slashing ad budgets -- among them, Chrysler and Citi -- advertising is being maintained, and in some cases increased, for prosaic mealtime products like Heinz ketchup (up 967.1 percent in the first half of this year, according to TNS Media Intelligence), Hellmann's mayonnaise (up 165.6 percent) and Jif peanut butter (up 39.8 percent). 
 ''There's a strong opportunity for these well-known brands, and they're capitalizing on it,'' said George Belch, chairman of the marketing department at San Diego State University. ''You're seeing less of Ford and G.M. and more of Oscar Mayer and Kellogg.'' 
 The campaigns are another sign that marketers, in this case food companies, are still scrambling to keep up with the profound changes in consumer behavior caused by the recession. 
 ''Manufacturers see the new DNA of shoppers,'' said Thom Blischok, president for consulting and innovation at Information Resources Inc., a market research firm in Chicago.
 ''In hundreds of surveys over the past two years, people have told us about subtle but dramatic changes like 'I'm buying less toothpaste because I'm putting less on my brush,' '' Mr. Blischok said.
 At the same time, consumers reported buying more products like basic food ingredients. In other words, goodbye to costly gourmet meals and hello to traditional dishes like that green bean casserole made with Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.
 In many instances, suddenly budget-conscious consumers are switching from more expensive foods and ''are discovering the difference they've been paying for is not worth it,'' said Phil Lempert, editor of The Lempert Report, a daily food industry newsletter.
 The sharp cheddar cheese sold by Kraft ''is a dollar or two less than the exotic brand,'' he added, and ''they are not that different.''
 The growing power of middle-brow meal items was apparent in a decision on Monday by Conde Nast to close the more upscale of its two food magazines, Gourmet, and keep publishing the more mainstream Bon Appetit.
 ''Gourmet was a tough sell to packaged goods advertisers,'' said George Janson, managing partner at the GroupM Print unit of GroupM, a division of WPP devoted to helping marketers make media decisions.
 ''People are now looking for recipes and ingredients that are more accessible,'' he added.
 Venerable foodstuffs are not only looming larger in the media in which they typically appear, they are turning up in unexpected places. The episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' broadcast by NBC last week featured commercials for a Kellogg's cereal and Tabasco hot sauce.
 It is no wonder, then, that homey brands like Birds Eye, Bumble Bee, Betty Crocker, Del Monte, Hunt's, Mott's, Spam and Velveeta are seeking to reclaim a place in the front ranks of marketing.
 Typically, Birds Eye runs one campaign each year, said Matt Park, chief marketing officer at Birds Eye Foods in Rochester, N.Y., but currently three are running, including ads that begin this week for the brand's Steamfresh product line.
 ''We want to put as much money and resources as possible into marketing and product innovations,'' he added, ''because all the research we've seen indicates that consumers will be spending more time at home and less time eating out at restaurants.''
 Not only are these food brands regaining a robust presence in media outlets, but new products are being introduced under mainstay names like French's, Hormel, Quaker, Ritz and Wheaties.
 For instance, the Hormel Foods Corporation has introduced what Scott Aakre, the company's vice president for marketing of grocery products in Austin, Minn., described as ''a more premium chili'' under the Hormel Chili Master name.
 Although priced higher than the Hormel Chili brand, which made its debut in 1937, the newcomer offers value because ''it's an opportunity to have a great meal at home,'' Mr. Aakre said.
 There are also new ads for Spam -- another Hormel brand that made its debut during the Depression -- suggesting Spam as an ingredient in easy-to-make dishes like macaroni and cheese or grilled cheese sandwiches. The Hormel agency is the Minneapolis office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
 In January 2010, said Elliott Penner, president at the French's food division of Reckitt Benckiser in Parsippany, N.J., ''we plan launches in mustard and hot sauce, innovative new products that extend the categories.'' 
 The expansions of the French's mustard and Frank's RedHot brands received approval after recent campaigns for both, centered on offering larger bottles at regular prices, produced ''some pretty great growth,'' Mr. Penner said, in revenue and market share.
 ''We work hard to create a point of difference between our products and competitors','' he added, ''and between our products and private label,'' which typically cost less than name brands, ''and make sure that point of difference is relevant.''
 Other marketers of longtime kitchen favorites agree that as nice as it is to capitalize on nostalgic feelings, they must also meet contemporary needs.
 ''A lot of times, people are talking about a return to the '50s,'' said Sally Robling, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Pinnacle Foods Group in Mountain Lakes, N.J., which sells stalwarts like Log Cabin and Mrs. Butterworth's syrups, Swanson frozen dinners and Vlasic pickles.
 ''But it's important we're going forward in this new environment in a way that's relevant to today,'' she added, ''instead of just playing on our history.''
 For instance, this sentence was added last year to ads for the Duncan Hines line of mixes and frostings: ''There are some investments that always give great returns.'' The ads were created by Merkley & Partners in New York, another Omnicom agency. 
 Duncan Hines is getting a presence in social media, Ms. Robling said, to let devoted users, whom she calls ''alpha bakers,'' share recipes more easily. And Pinnacle is adding popular flavors to the Duncan Hines line like carrot cake and red velvet. 
 For many of these brands, said Patty Bloomfield, vice president and engagement director at Northlich in Cincinnati, the creative agency for Birds Eye, ''the good news is people have a very strong feeling'' about their quality and remember growing up with them.
 But they still ask ''does Birds Eye fit into the way I live my life today?'' she added. ''Even as they're watching pennies, they still value high quality, convenience, great taste and healthfulness.''
 As for the future, experts say they believe the back-to-basics shift in consumer sentiment could become permanent even after the economy improves.
 ''This new consumer will shop the rest of her life differently,'' said Mr. Blischok of Information Resources. ''Behavior has been modified as a result of this recession.''

HEADLINE: Wallowing in Misery for Art's Sake

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Late in ''The White Ribbon,''Michael Haneke's black-and-white study of child abuse, class resentment and incipient fascism in a northern German village on the eve of World War I, one character, a baroness, expresses a wish to leave. ''I can't live in an atmosphere of malice, envy, cruelty and brutality,'' she announces to her husband. In that case, the baroness has come to the wrong film festival. 
 By the same token, though, the New York Film Festival's selection of Mr. Haneke's film, anointed with the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, makes perfect sense. As it enters its final stretch -- the closing-night feature, Pedro Almodovar's ''Broken Embraces,'' starring Penelope Cruz, will screen on Sunday -- this 47th edition of New York cinephilia's flagship event has already distinguished itself as the grimmest in memory. 
 How grim? This festival turns to Todd Solondz for a soothing dose of humanism. In his new film, ''Life During Wartime,'' Mr. Solondz, American cinema's misanthropic bard of suburbia, revisits some of the characters from ''Happiness,'' his queasy 1998 masterpiece, which starred Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jane Adams, among others. The cast is different (if equally excellent) -- it includes Ciaran Hinds, Allison Janney, Shirley Henderson and Paul Reubens -- but most of the situations once again are creepy, freakish or sad. Yet there is also something generous, even gentle, in the way Mr. Solondz treats the wayward souls in his care. He does not deny them the possibility of forgiveness -- it's the theme of the movie -- or refuse his audience the tearful consolations of melodrama.
 And it seems that the only comfort at this festival is to be found in tears. Mr. Almodovar's new film, characteristically rich in color and feeling, full of unruly passions and conflicting desires, is also shadowed by death, romantic disappointment and grief. Souleymane Cisse's incisive ''Min Ye ...'' (''Tell Me Who You Are''), about a wealthy Malian family in crisis, has some fascinating Almodovarian overtones, and it is enlivened by the extravagant, divaesque dignity of Sokona Gakou in the role of a woman on the verge of a marital breakdown. But it, too, traffics in unhappiness.
 Still, Mr. Cisse's and Mr. Almodovar's films -- along with bits of Jacques Rivette's contemplative, autumnal ''Around a Small Mountain'' and Catherine Breillat's kinky, feminist fairy tale, ''Bluebeard'' -- feel like outliers, small oases of aesthetic release in a festival that seems to have been organized in pointed opposition to the pleasure principle. The cumulative picture of the human condition that has emerged since opening night is dominated by sadism, guilt, violence and despair, a panorama of pessimism notable for its exhausting rigor and relentless consistency. 
 In many of the films, including ''The White Ribbon,'' our species' capacity for cruelty seems less a discovery than an axiom. Given the chance, our instinct will be to inflict pain, and we will justify our blood lust with appeals to reason, love and morality. The frequency with which this principle of innate depravity is invoked -- by Lars von Trier in ''Antichrist,'' by Bong Joon-ho in ''Mother,'' by Claire Denis in ''White Material,'' among many others -- hardly seems coincidental. It is, rather, a pervasive, secular version of original sin, and as such the sign of a worldview, a set of assumptions shared by filmmakers of varying backgrounds and styles and by the critics who establish and sustain their reputations. 
 This year's New York Film Festival can be understood as an unusually powerful and disciplined presentation of an aesthetic ideology we might call festivalism. There is some irony in the name, since a central tenet of festivalism is an abiding skepticism about the nature and value of fun. That's not what movies are for! 
 But the festivalist mentality does not simply rest on a taste for depicting or witnessing human misery -- social, sexual, economic and psychic. Rather, the embrace of such harsh thematic content reflects a commitment to a dogma of artistic obduracy. T. S. Eliot said of modern poetry that ''it must be difficult,'' an imperative defiantly reflected in a program, harvested mostly from other festivals, that pushes the boundary between the challenging and the punitive.
 The festival's selection committee -- the critics J. Hoberman, Dennis Lim, Melissa Anderson and Scott Foundas, along with Richard Pena, executive director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center -- has been roundly scolded by some bloggers and journalists for the sin of elitism. Others have defended their choices, and accused their detractors of favoring commercialism over art. But this kind of polarization -- a fight mostly among critics conducted in the name of the artists and the audience -- is itself another manifestation of festivalism. Is it really necessary to choose between pandering to the tastes of the crowd and exalting cinematic excellence? Is film culture now split between esotericism and escapism? 
 Don't get me wrong. I'm no populist, and I often gravitate toward art that resists immediate understanding and easy enjoyment. And to single out the critics on the selection committee would be bad faith on my part. Some of my best friends are critics, and some of my favorite critics chose the movies for this festival. One problem may be that they approached the selection process more as critics than as curators, resulting in a slate that reflects a restricted range of tastes and sacrifices variety for coherence.
 But the achievement of such coherence suggests that something larger may be at work here. The Film Society, which has welcomed New Yorkers with more flexible ticketing policies (and cheaper tickets available shortly before each screening), surely did not intend to scare away the public. The constricted and forbidding program it offers is not -- or not only -- due to pusillanimous judgment. It is, rather, a symptom of the divided, anxious state of American, and indeed of global film culture.
 Over the past 20 years film industries around the world have lost state support and local audiences. In some cases Hollywood's ambassadors have lobbied hard against exhibition quotas aimed at reserving a portion of a given country's screens for homegrown movies. Other countries -- in the developing world, and also in the poorer corners of Europe -- simply do not have enough screens to show the latest American blockbusters alongside their domestic competition. Not only must ambitious filmmakers seek financing abroad; they are also encouraged to aim their movies at the international festival circuit, where they are more apt to find an appreciative, self-selected audience. Some of the finest African, Southeast Asian and Eastern European filmmakers are more likely to be known and respected in Toronto, Venice or New York than in their own cultural capitals.
 Meanwhile, the American art-movie economy --the independent sector, as we sometimes prefer to call it -- has gone through another cycle of boom and bust. Money for the midlevel, middlebrow, studio-distributed films that have traditionally rounded out the New York Film Festival slate has dried up in the current recession. And the films themselves have encountered something of a backlash among critics allergic to the slightest whiff of earnest commercialism or awards-season preening. 
 What was once a wide and crowded middle ground between popular taste and high art has eroded, and that territory has frequently been demarcated and defended by institutions like the Film Society. Ideally and at its best, the kind of high-minded middlebrowism represented by the New York Film Festival could provide a bridge for curious patrons, a path from the familiar and the fun toward the rarefied and the difficult, as well as a yearly sampling of world cinema in all its protean abundance.
 But festivalism lives in a high castle, surrounded by a moat not entirely of its own construction. Today's festival system, which assiduously scouts new locations and sponsors despite economic trouble, promotes a transnational fraternity of directors, journalists and, well, festival programmers. This is not a bad thing, but it is a mixed blessing. The festival world is gratifyingly cosmopolitan -- so many movies from so many places! -- yet it can also feel narrow, small and self-regarding. Inhabitants tend to encounter the same kinds of movies again and again, and to participate in the same arguments about them. Even acts of extreme provocation, like ''Antichrist,'' this year's designated traveling scandale de festival, have a ritualistic, predictable quality. 
 The current New York Film Festival produces more fatigue than shock, and seems governed less by a sense of adventure than by academic duty and confirmation bias. How do we know this festival has the best films in the world? Because all the other festivals agree. It's a nonstop party, as long as we follow the party line. 
 The 47th New York Film Festival runs through Sunday. Most movies will be shown in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. Tickets are $20; $10 for obstructed view. Fifty $10 rush tickets will be available an hour before showtime on the day of performance. Information: (212) 875-5050; tickets: (212) 721-6500; filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: Our Three Bombs

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I am a 56-year-old baby boomer, and looking around today it's very clear that my generation had it easy: We grew up in the shadow of just one bomb -- the nuclear bomb. That is, in our day, it seemed as if there was just one big threat that could trigger a nonlinear, 180-degree change in the trajectory of our lives: the Soviets hitting us with a nuke. My girls are not so lucky.
 Today's youth are growing up in the shadow of three bombs -- any one of which could go off at any time and set in motion a truly nonlinear, radical change in the trajectory of their lives. 
 The first, of course, is still the nuclear threat, which, for my generation, basically came from just one seemingly rational enemy, the Soviet Union, with which we shared a doctrine of mutual assured destruction. Today, the nuclear threat can be delivered by all kinds of states or terrorists, including suicidal jihadists for whom mutual assured destruction is a delight, not a deterrent.
 But there are now two other bombs our children have hanging over them: the debt bomb and the climate bomb.
 As we continue to build up carbon in the atmosphere to unprecedented levels, we never know when the next emitted carbon molecule will tip over some ecosystem and trigger a nonlinear climate event -- like melting the Siberian tundra and releasing all of its methane, or drying up the Amazon or melting all the sea ice in the North Pole in summer. And when one ecosystem collapses, it can trigger unpredictable changes in others that could alter our whole world.
 The same is true with America's debt bomb. To recover from the Great Recession, we've had to go even deeper into debt. One need only look at today's record-setting price of gold, in a period of deflation, to know that a lot of people are worried that our next dollar of debt -- unbalanced by spending cuts or new tax revenues -- will trigger a nonlinear move out of the dollar and torpedo the U.S. currency.
 If people lose confidence in the dollar, we could enter a feedback loop, as with the climate, whereby the sinking dollar forces up interest rates, which raises the long-term cost of servicing our already massive debt, which adds to the deficit projections, which further undermines the dollar. If the world is unwilling to finance our deficits, except at much higher rates of interest, it would surely diminish our government's ability to make public investments and just as surely diminish our children's standard of living.
 Unfortunately, too many conservatives, who would never risk emitting so much debt that it would tank the dollar, will blithely tell you on carbon: ''Emit all you want. Don't worry. It's all a hoax.'' And too many liberals, who would never risk emitting too much carbon, will tell you on emitting more debt: ''Spend away. We've got plenty of room to stimulate without risking the dollar.'' 
 Because of this divide, our government has not been able to put in place the long-term policies needed to guard against detonating our mounting debt bomb and climate bomb. As such, we're in effect putting our kids' future in the hands of the two most merciless forces on the planet: the Market and Mother Nature.
 As the environmentalist Rob Watson likes to say, ''Mother Nature is just chemistry, biology and physics.'' That's all she is. You can't spin her; you can't sweet-talk her. You can't say, ''Hey, Mother Nature, we're having a bad recession, could you take a year off?'' No, she's going to do whatever chemistry, biology and physics dictate, based on the amount of carbon we put in the atmosphere, and as Watson likes to add: ''Mother Nature always bats last, and she always bats a thousand.'' 
 Ditto the market. The market is just a second-by-second snapshot of the balance between greed and fear. You can't spin it or sweet-talk it. And you never know when that balance between greed and fear on the dollar is going to tip over into fear in a nonlinear way.
 That is why I was heartened to see the liberal Center for American Progress stating last week that, while the stimulus is vital to rescuing our economy, the size of projected budget deficits demand that we also start thinking about broad-based tax increases and reductions in some spending and entitlement programs supported by liberals. I am equally heartened when I see Republicans like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urging his party to start taking climate change seriously.
 But we also need to act. If we don't, we will be leaving our children to the tender mercies of the Market and Mother Nature alone to shape their futures.
 This moment reminds me of an image John Holdren, the president's science adviser, uses when discussing the threat of climate change, but it also applies to the dollar: ''We're driving in a car with bad brakes in a fog and heading for a cliff. We know for sure that cliff is out there. We just don't know exactly where it is. Prudence would suggest that we should start putting on the brakes.''

HEADLINE: Beijing's Afghan Gamble

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. KAPLAN. 
Robert D. Kaplan is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a correspondent for The Atlantic.

 BODY:
IN Afghanistan's Logar Province, just south of Kabul, the geopolitical future of Asia is becoming apparent: American troops are providing security for a Chinese state-owned company to exploit the Aynak copper reserves, which are worth tens of billions of dollars. While some of America's NATO allies want to do as little as possible in the effort to stabilize Afghanistan, China has its eyes on some of world's last untapped deposits of copper, iron, gold, uranium and precious gems, and is willing to take big risks in one of the most violent countries to secure them.
 In Afghanistan, American and Chinese interests converge. By exploiting Afghanistan's metal and mineral reserves, China can provide thousands of Afghans with jobs, thus generating tax revenues to help stabilize a tottering Kabul government. Just as America has a vision of a modestly stable Afghanistan that will no longer be a haven for extremists, China has a vision of Afghanistan as a secure conduit for roads and energy pipelines that will bring natural resources from the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. So if America defeats Al Qaeda and the irreconcilable elements of the Taliban, China's geopolitical position will be enhanced. 
 This is not a paradox, since China need not be our future adversary. Indeed, combining forces with China in Afghanistan might even improve the relationship between Washington and Beijing. The problem is that while America is sacrificing its blood and treasure, the Chinese will reap the benefits. The whole direction of America's military and diplomatic effort is toward an exit strategy, whereas the Chinese hope to stay and profit.
 But what if America decides to leave, or to drastically reduce its footprint to a counterterrorism strategy focused mainly on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border? Then another scenario might play out. Kandahar and other areas will most likely fall to the Taliban, creating a truly lawless realm that wrecks China's plans for an energy and commodities passageway through South Asia. It would also, of course, be a momentous moral victory achieved by radical Muslims who, having first defeated the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, will then have triumphed over another superpower.
 And the calculations get more complicated still: a withdrawal of any kind from Afghanistan before a stable government is in place would also hurt India, a critical if undeclared American ally, and increasingly a rival of China. Were the Taliban to retake Afghanistan, India would face a radical Islamistan stretching from its border with Pakistan deep into Central Asia. With the Taliban triumphant on Pakistan's western border, jihadists there could direct their energies to the eastern border with India.
 India would defeat Pakistan in a war, conventional or nuclear. But having to do so, or simply needing to face down a significantly greater jihadist threat next door, would divert India's national energies away from further developing its economy and its navy, a development China would quietly welcome.
 Bottom line: China will find a way to benefit no matter what the United States does in Afghanistan. But it probably benefits more if we stay and add troops to the fight. The same goes for Russia. Because of continuing unrest in the Islamic southern tier of the former Soviet Union, Moscow has an interest in America stabilizing Afghanistan (though it would take a certain psychological pleasure from a humiliating American withdrawal). 
 In nuts-and-bolts terms, if we stay in Afghanistan and eventually succeed, other countries will benefit more than we will. China, India and Russia are all Asian powers, geographically proximate to Afghanistan and better able, therefore, to garner practical advantages from any stability our armed forces would make possible.
 Everyone keeps saying that America is not an empire, but our military finds itself in the sort of situation that was mighty familiar to empires like that of ancient Rome and 19th-century Britain: struggling in a far-off corner of the world to exact revenge, to put down the fires of rebellion, and to restore civilized order. Meanwhile, other rising and resurgent powers wait patiently in the wings, free-riding on the public good we offer. This is exactly how an empire declines, by allowing others to take advantage of its own exertions.
 Of course, one could make an excellent case that an ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan is precisely what would lead to our decline, by demoralizing our military, signaling to our friends worldwide that we cannot be counted on and demonstrating that our enemies have greater resolve than we do. That is why we have no choice in Afghanistan but to add troops and continue to fight. 
 But as much as we hone our counterinsurgency skills and develop assets for the ''long war,'' history would suggest that over time we can more easily preserve our standing in the world by using naval and air power from a distance when intervening abroad. Afghanistan should be the very last place where we are a land-based meddler, caught up in internal Islamic conflict, helping the strategic ambitions of the Chinese and others.

HEADLINE: An Oasis of Stability Amid a Downturn

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va. 

 BODY:
While many metropolitan markets around the country are enduring steep increases in vacancies in their office and retail sectors, the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington is an oasis of stability -- and even of prosperity.
 Served by five Metro subway stops within four miles, the corridor continues to attract new tenants, buyers and developers in the face of the deepest recession since the Great Depression. ''It's really an anomaly, considering the tough economy we've been in since December 2007,'' said Sigrid G. Zialcita, managing research director for Cushman & Wakefield, a global real estate services firm. 
 The firm's most recent figures for the corridor show vacancy rates of 8.6 percent for offices -- compared with a national suburban rate of 18.3 percent -- and 3.5 percent for retail space, the second lowest of 23 major markets surveyed, ranging from 3.3 percent in Washington to 27.5 percent in Orlando. 
 Office rents in the corridor are actually up slightly, but remain below those in Washington, across the Potomac River. ''For comparable Class A space, we're looking in the D.C. central business district at about $50 to the mid-$60s for trophy space,'' Ms. Zialcita said. But in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, rents for Class A offices are $39 to $45 a square foot. 
 The 3.3-mile corridor extends from the high-rise riverside canyons of Rosslyn; through Courthouse, the seat of Arlington County's government; to hip Clarendon; to Virginia Square with its branch campus of George Mason University; and finally to Ballston, a few square blocks of high-rise offices, hotels and residences and also a hub for science and technology. 
 ''The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor will continue to be the most sought-after area in Northern Virginia in the foreseeable future,'' Cushman & Wakefield said at the end of June. ''It has remained resilient during the worst recession in decades, and should continue to do so, as demand will remain healthy and new supply will be low for the next few years.'' 
 The positive economic vibe was evident this summer with the announcement that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would move its 800 employees from older leased space nearby into a new 355,530-square-foot building designed to meet Defense Department antiterrorism standards.
 The new Darpa building, slated to be completed in 2012, is part of a 1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use project called Founders Square. The developer is the Shooshan Company, which was already the dominant builder in Ballston. It previously built the Liberty Center, a one-million-square-foot mix of commercial, residential and retail space completed in March 2008. 
 ''We just consistently have new development in what we call urban villages,'' said Terry Holzheimer, Arlington County's director of economic development, recalling that ''we were a decaying urban corridor in the 1970s.'' Since then, he said, ''Arlington has been nothing but consistent in terms of adding buildings over time: 20 million square feet of office space and 20,000-plus housing units over a 25-year period.'' 
 Government agencies and related contractors account for 60 percent of the leased office space in the corridor, Mr. Holzheimer said.
 Arlington County's 26 square miles were a part of the original District of Columbia, but were returned to Virginia in 1846. The transit-related development in the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor has won national recognition for smart growth that mixes offices, shops and living quarters close to subway stops. ''We really worked on creating a sense of place, and on what kind of development we wanted near our Metro hubs,'' said Barbara A. Favola, chairwoman of the county's governing board. 
 Rosslyn was little more than a collection of pawn shops and auto repair shops until the 1960s, when new office buildings rose to accommodate government agencies forced to relocate after the razing of temporary buildings erected on the Mall during World War I. Those early Rosslyn high-rises are now gradually being replaced by office towers. 
 ''The Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, with its immediate access to downtown Washington, D.C., is an ideal submarket for transit-oriented, mixed-use development,'' said Brian P. Coulter, chief development officer of the JBG Companies, which has been a major developer in Rosslyn and is also active in Ballston. 
 While Wilson Boulevard, a main artery, helps define the corridor, the key element in its success has been the subway. Planners had wanted to place it in the median of Interstate 66, on a more northerly alignment. But Arlington officials fought to have it run underground in the corridor to spur development.
 Among recent projects, the Wooster and Mercer Lofts condos, completed in 2007 with ceilings up to 18 feet high and the intentional look of restored industrial warehouses, are three blocks from both the Rosslyn and Courthouse Metro stations, and they are eight-tenths of a mile by foot across the Francis Scott Key Bridge to Georgetown. The developer, Jim Abdo, said that 95 percent of the 87 units in the two buildings had been sold, at prices ranging from $700,000 to $1.2 million. 
 Mr. Abdo said he intended to break ground within 12 months on another upscale condo project on an adjacent three-acre lot that he bought for $20 million and cleared of mid-20th-century garden apartments. It is to be called Gaslight Square and have 117 units ranging from $650,000 to $1.3 million. 
 ''There's a lot of tremendous economic fundamentals in place'' in the corridor, Mr. Abdo said, ''and a lot of positive growth in retail, restaurant and culture.'' 
 A few Metro stops away, the developer John Shooshan has turned formerly somnolent Ballston into a high-rise, mixed-use area. ''We're just blessed to be in the right place, even at the wrong time,'' he said. His Liberty Center complex is 100 percent leased, he said. 
 The National Science Foundation moved to Ballston in 1993, in the vanguard of many institutions. 
 These include Marymount University, whose business school is across the street from Virginia Tech's planned expanded research center. 
 The Nature Conservancy, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office and Virginia Tech's Advanced Research Institute, which is to move into the new center, are all part of the Ballston scene. The Ballston Common Mall provides retailing and the Kettler Capitals Iceplex, where hockey fans are admitted free to watch the Washington Capitals practice.
 One Metro stop closer, Virginia Square, just blocks from Ballston, has George Mason's Law School and School of Public Policy and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Dan McCaffery, a Chicago developer, saw the corridor's potential a decade ago when he bought land in Clarendon. Former owners had wanted to build a Home Depot, but citizens resisted. 
 Mr. McCaffery instead built Market Common, a mixed-use project that opened in 2001 and continues to thrive with two street-facing levels of high-end stores arranged in a horseshoe facing a long landscaped lawn, with apartments and offices above and adjacent. ''It's all self-contained,'' Mr. McCaffery said. ''There's always a buzz.'' 
 Whitlow's on Wilson, a restaurant on Wilson Boulevard, is part of the buzz. Displaced by urban renewal in downtown Washington, it relocated to Clarendon in 1995. The owner, Greg Cahill, liked the small-town feel that he found. 
 The ambience is more urban these days. Now, he said, many places, including Whitlow's, feature live music, and there is more of just about everything. ''There are more people, more buildings, condos, apartments,'' he said. ''It's a nice, safe place to come.''

HEADLINE: Support Builds For Tax Credit To Help Hiring

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The idea of a tax credit for companies that create new jobs, something the federal government has not tried since the 1970s, is gaining support among economists and Washington officials grappling with the highest unemployment in a generation.
 The proposal has some bipartisan appeal among politicians eager both to help their unemployed constituents and to encourage small-business development. Legislators on Capitol Hill and President Obama's economic team have been quietly researching the policy for several weeks. 
 ''There is a lot of traction for this kind of idea,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip. ''If the White House will take the lead on this, I'm fairly positive it would be welcomed in a bipartisan fashion.''
 In addition to the economists working on the proposal, some heavyweights support the concept, including the Nobel laureate Edmund S. Phelps, Dani Rodrik of Harvard and former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. 
 One version of the approach, to be unveiled next week by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization, would give employers a two-year tax credit if they increased the size of their work force or added significant hours of work (for example, making a part-time worker full time). Employers would receive a credit worth twice the first-year payroll tax for each new hire, amounting to several thousand dollars, depending on the new worker's salary.
 ''It's beautiful if it can be timed at a dire moment like this, when unemployment is way too high and appears to be going somewhat higher,'' said Mr. Phelps, an economics professor at Columbia, lamenting that the president dropped it from the $787 billion stimulus plan approved in February. ''But it's a pity that this wasn't done a year ago.''
 One of a number of ideas being discussed, the policy is intended to encourage companies to start hiring again by making it cheaper to add new workers. It has raised concerns, though, that employers might try to exploit the system.
 States have dabbled with similar tax credits in recent years, with mixed results. The federal government last tried this measure in 1977-78. During that period, employment -- which had been soft from the 1973-75 recession -- climbed at a record pace. The creation of one out of three jobs that was awarded the credit then was attributed directly to the policy. But the permanence of those jobs was less clear, and some dispute how many of those positions would have been created eventually anyway. 
 Supporters say that improvements upon the 1970s policy would increase its potency. These include better publicizing the credit; making it available even to concerns that are not making money, in the form of a direct payout to nonprofits and companies in the red; and distributing the credit quarterly so that companies see it sooner.
 Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research who is working on the draft with John H. Bishop of Cornell, estimates that it would cost about $20,000 for each job created. 
 But some dismiss the idea as corporate welfare. 
 ''Some bad ideas never go away,'' said Howard Gleckman, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. ''It's just providing incentives to lots of companies that probably aren't going to make it in the end anyway.''
 Under the proposal from Mr. Bartik and Mr. Bishop, the credit in the first year would equal 15.3 percent of the cost of adding an employee. In the second year, it would fall to about 10.2 percent. 
 For example, hiring a worker might cost a small business $50,000 annually. But with the tax credit, the cost would fall to $42,350 in the first year, and then be $44,900 the next year. After that, the cost would return to $50,000.
 The credit would apply only to the portion of an employee's salary under $106,800. Lowering the cap further, however, could provide an even greater benefit to low-wage, unskilled workers. 
 The authors estimate their proposal could create more than two million jobs in the first year.
 ''Businesses like those provisions that reduce the hurdle rate that you have to surmount in order to make an investment -- like an employee -- a profitable investment,'' said Robert Willens, president of a tax and accounting advisory firm in New York.
 Of course, even in recessionary times, some companies are hiring without tax breaks. So a subsidy could merely benefit those businesses that already would have added new workers.
 An American Economic Review study has suggested that the 1970s policy was responsible for adding about 700,000 of the 2.1 million jobs that were awarded the credit. This may sound modest, but if accurate, economists say it would make this proposal a successful and relatively cheap way of creating jobs. 
 Advocates argue that such incentives would be more effective this time around not only because of design, but also because of timing. In 1977, hiring was already on the upswing, whereas economists expect today's job market to decline a bit more and then stagnate for months. 
 ''Now is a better time than '77 was because we're closer to the bottom of a recession,'' said Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who helped create the 1970s plan. ''This could help an uptick proceed more rapidly.''
 But critics of the idea argue that businesses hire based on actual demand for their products, and a minor subsidy for adding an employee will not make up for the collapse in demand across the broader economy.
 ''Why would a business hire a new worker?'' Bill Rys, tax counsel to the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business industry group, said. ''They're hiring because they need to do work. Unless you have work to do, it's still an expense.''
 Barack Obama -- like Senator John Kerry before him -- proposed a job creation tax credit during his presidential campaign, and then in discussions for the stimulus package. The proposal was eventually killed because of concerns that employers would exploit the tax credit. For example, companies might close and reopen, claiming credit for all their ''new'' employees.
 Even advocates acknowledge that, as with any tax incentive, employers and their accountants will take advantage of loopholes. But they argue that with strong rules -- possibly by reducing the credit for ''new'' companies, or by requiring a company's overall wage bill to rise along with its work force -- the proposal could minimize such abuse.
 Deficit hawks still worry about the cost of the proposal, and whether it would be politically feasible for Congress to phase it out once businesses have grown used to it. 
 The biggest fear among some, though, is that the proposal might unintentionally reduce job opportunities if it sits in Washington too long without passing.
 ''Particularly for big employers, if they think a job creation tax credit is in the offing, it could certainly be an incentive to delay hiring,'' said Lee E. Ohanian, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''That means it could have the perverse effect of actually prolonging the recession.''

HEADLINE: A Thirst for Credit

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
A year after Washington rescued the big names of American finance, it's still hard to get a loan. But the problem isn't just tight-fisted banks.
 The continued disarray in debt-securitization markets, which in recent years were the source of roughly 60 percent of all credit in the United States, is making loans scarce and threatening to slow the economic recovery. Many of these markets are operating only because the government is propping them up. 
 But now the Federal Reserve has put these markets on notice that it plans to withdraw its support for them. Policy makers hope private investors will return to the markets, which imploded during the financial crisis. 
 The exit will require a delicate balancing act, government officials said. 
 ''You do it incrementally, where and when you think you can, and not sooner,'' said Lee Sachs, a counselor to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. 
 The debt-securitization markets finance corporate loans, home mortgages, student loans and more. In good times, they enabled banks to package their loans into securities and resell them to investors. That process, known as securitization, freed banks to lend even more money.
 Many investors have lost trust in securitization after losing huge sums on packages of subprime mortgages that had high default rates. The government has since spent more than $1 trillion trying to restore the markets, with mixed success.
 Until more of the securitization market revives, or some new form of financing takes its place, a wide range of loans needed to secure a lasting economic recovery will remain elusive, experts said. 
 ''Given the imperative for securitization markets to fuel bank lending, we won't have meaningful economic growth until securitization markets are re-established,'' said Joseph R. Mason, a professor of banking at Louisiana State University. Mr. Sachs agrees: ''It's very important these markets come back to get credit to businesses and families who need it, and also as a sign of confidence.'' 
 Enormous swaths of this so-called shadow banking system remain paralyzed. Depending on the type of loan, certain securitization markets have fallen 40 to 100 percent. 
 A once-thriving private market in securities backed by home mortgages has collapsed, from $744 billion in 2005, at the peak of the housing boom, to $8 billion during the first half of this year. 
 The market for securities backed by commercial real estate loans is in worse shape. No new securities of this type have been issued in two years. 
 ''The securitization markets are dead,'' said Robert J. Shiller, the Yale University economist and housing expert who predicted the subprime collapse. The government is supporting them, he said, but it's unclear what will happen when it extricates itself. ''We're stuck,'' he said.
 Despite the running problems, federal officials hope to start weaning the securitization markets off government support next spring. The Federal Reserve has spent about $905 billion buying government-guaranteed mortgages in an effort to keep mortgage rates low. It will continue buying until it reaches its target of $1.25 trillion. 
 Complicating the Fed's plan, banks -- the other source of credit next to the securitization markets -- continue to rein in lending, according to data from the Federal Reserve. And next year, banks face accounting rule changes and capital requirements that could further restrict their ability to make loans. 
 To be sure, certain corners of the securitization market are percolating again, thanks to the government's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, which provides attractive financing for investors who buy the securities.
 Bonds backed by consumer debt -- credit card debt, auto loans and some student loans -- are being issued at costs close to those before the financial crisis, an indication that the market is functioning again. 
 But the program applies only to borrowers with stellar credit. It does not cover credit card debt or auto loans for people with blemished credit histories. 
 ''The market is coming back, but a lot of it is because of TALF,'' said Hyun Song Shin, a Princeton economist who studies securitization. ''The big question is, Will the private issuance market stand on its own two feet without TALF, or has there been a fundamental change in the market that it is somehow hobbled permanently?'' 
 That question is hard to answer as long as the government is dominating certain securitization markets. So far, the Fed has been most aggressive in supporting the market for mortgage-backed securities, which plays a crucial role in housing finance. The Fed is virtually the only buyer for these instruments, purchasing about $905 billion worth of government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities through mid-September. Industry analysts estimate that is about 80 to 85 percent of the market.
 ''This is public support,'' said George Miller, executive director for the American Securitization Forum, which represents the industry. ''At the end of the day, the mortgage risk is held by the taxpayer.''
 Investors are particularly concerned about the commercial real estate market. A big worry is that $50 billion of securitized commercial property loans are due to be refinanced in the next year. If that can't be done, a toxic mix of declining property prices and maturing loans could lead to fresh losses at many banks. 
 ''If there's no mechanism, those properties will default,'' said Arnold Phillips, who oversees mortgages and structured securities for the $50 billion in fixed-income investments managed by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. 
 As long as the market remains closed, banks will be reluctant to make loans for commercial real estate, since they would have to hold on to them, rather than package them into securities. 
 Meanwhile, the programs the government has started have not changed securitization practices that many investors say were a cause of the financial crisis. Lawmakers remain concerned that when securitization comes back, it does so in a way that doesn't put the financial system at risk. 
 ''Our challenge is to have a robust securitization process that adds value to the economy and doesn't undermine it,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment. He plans to hold a hearing on securitization next month to find out why consumers and businesses are still having so much trouble getting loans.

HEADLINE: At Jewish Delis, Times Are as Lean as Good Corned Beef

BYLINE: By JOAN NATHAN

 BODY:
HOBBY'S DELICATESSEN & RESTAURANT in downtown Newark may have lost much of its more traditional clientele over the years, but it has held on to tradition. The corned beef and the tongue are cured for 14 days in stainless steel bins in the basement. The salamis hanging on the wall look as if they've been drying there, their flavor intensifying, since the Brummer family bought the place in 1962.
 Samuel Brummer and his sons, Michael and Marc, even make their own matzo ball soup and potato pancakes.
 But in Newark, as in so many cities, holding on has been tough for delis. 
 ''In 1945, there were 12 delis in Newark,'' said Samuel Brummer, 86. ''Now we are only two.''
 Old customers moved on, but new ones keep them going.
 ''Our clientele used to be 10 percent black and 75 percent Jewish,'' he said. ''Now it is 50/50.'' 
 David Sax, a 30-year-old freelance writer, listened and nodded. Many delis are seeing more African-American customers. 
 ''In many ways, deli owners in places like Detroit or Chicago have told me, they are better deli clients than Jews,'' Mr. Sax said referring to African-Americans. ''They accept it as it is. Take a corned beef sandwich. A Jewish customer will say, 'I want the corned beef lean, from the middle of the brisket,' because their grandfathers did. It's like Jews going to a Chinese restaurant. They love it for what it is and they are better clients because of it.'' 
 Mr. Sax loves delis for what they are and mourns the loss of so many of them around the country. For the last two years he has been writing the blog Save the Deli celebrating great delis and chronicling their demise. And this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is publishing his book ''Save the Deli,'' an account of his journey of discovery through the world of delis, from New York to Toronto, Detroit, Miami and Los Angeles; London, Paris and Poland. 
 After digging into a sandwich of fresh roast turkey, with juicy white and dark meat carved off the bone, at Hobby's, we headed to some Jewish delis clinging to old ways that stretch back a century. 
 When Eastern European Jews began immigrating to New York by the thousands in the late 19th century, they found delicatessens started by gentile German immigrants who had brought their pickled and smoked pork and beef to the United States. 
 ''Jews made the deli their own and carved out a niche for themselves,'' Mr. Sax said.
 Jewish delis began to predominate. By the 1930s, New York City alone had at least 1,500 kosher and kosher style, Mr. Sax said. Today there about two dozen kosher ones left. 
 Mr. Sax feels emotionally drawn to delis. ''I grew up with salami sandwiches, baby beef and matzo ball soup,'' said Mr. Sax (a Toronto native).
 As an undergraduate at McGill University he took a course called ''the Sociology of Jews in North America.'' While researching a term paper on Jewish delicatessens in North America with a friend, he realized that little had been written about the business of delis. His blog and book will help remedy that.
 What he found was not very encouraging. In the old days, everybody cured their own corned beef and pastrami, made their own pickles, and used bread from a neighboring bakery. Now, few even make their own matzo balls.
 Zayda's Kosher Deli in South Orange, N.J., is actually a supermarket that makes a line of kosher classics like kugels, chicken soup and kasha varnishkes sold at stores in the area like Shop-Rite, Fairway and Whole Foods. But when we stopped in at Zayda's, there was no place to schmooze and no owner in sight.
 ''This is what the original deli was like,'' Mr. Sax said. ''It was a convenience store, a neighborhood grocer, a place to go for sandwich meats and kosher foods.'' 
 Irving's Delicatessen on Route 10 in Livingston, N.J., had room to schmooze, more than their owners would like. It's in a plaza with several casualties of the recession, an Office Depot, a furniture store and a carpet store, all closed. Most of Irving's 140 seats were empty in the middle of the day. 
 ''I'm losing money every day,'' said Marc Singer, the manager who runs the deli with his cousin Michael Holst, the owner. ''In the depth of the summer we had no one coming through the door.''
 But delis are up against more than a bad economy. ''Jews are largely assimilated and don't want to eat only Jewish food,'' Mr. Sax said. 
 When they do, they have to face concerns that might have been overlooked a few years ago. Foods like pastrami and kishke (beef intestine casings stuffed with brisket fat or chicken fat, matzo meal, onions and carrots) are delicious, but they're not health food.
 Doing things right costs money, even when foods aren't prepared in house. 
 ''Quality New York deli meats come at a high price,'' Mr. Singer said. ''I count myself fortunate to get $12.95 in New Jersey for a corned beef sandwich that would sell for $16.95 in the city.''
 To compete with chain restaurants that offer mass-produced deli products, mom-and-pop restaurants ultimately make little on their meat. ''Every other corner deli sells Boar's Head brand,'' Mr. Sax said.
 Irving's uses the same pastrami supplier in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as Katz's on the Lower East Side and has a former Katz employee, Pedro Hernandez, hand cutting his meat.
 Mr. Sax, who spent a night behind the counter learning to slice meat at Katz's, said the best delis have a master cutter, not a slicing machine. When you steam a piece of meat for a long time, as with a good piece of pastrami once it has been cured and smoked, it will tear apart if it isn't cut by hand. 
 Mr. Singer added, ''Hebrew National pastramis are a round cut intended for machine slicing at the local deli.'' 
 And Hebrew National, once owned by a Jewish family, the Pineses, is now under ConAgra Foods. 
 Mr. Sax appreciates the little guys who make as much of their own food as possible, like Hobby's house-cured corned beef and Brent's Deli's homemade kishke in Los Angeles, a deli town for which he has high regard. 
 And in his book he considers the pairing of ''slowly steamed pastrami and hot crusty double-baked rye bread infused with caraway seeds'' at Langer's Delicatessen and Restaurant in Los Angeles a perfect sandwich. 
 Jay & Lloyd's Kosher Deli in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, has an awfully good pastrami sandwich and nice, crisp zucchini potato latkes. Caricatures of pickles and sandwiches share the walls of the deli with photographs from the 1940s of deli workers union dinners. 
 Lloyd Lederman, a third-generation deli owner who opened Jay & Lloyd's in 1993, wore a hat shaped like a giant hot dog.
 ''You have to have a deli shtick,'' said Mr. Lederman, 52. ''We go into the dining room and sit down with the customers and schmooze. We used to have rude waiters to add to the shtick. We put a joke of the day on the cash register. My dad did it and I do it. You have to have a passion.'' 
 Mr. Sax said: ''For me, the great thing about that place is the joy he has for his life. For the deli man, all of life is about the deli.''

HEADLINE: Dollar Slides as Other Markets Climb

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Investors clamored to buy pretty much anything on Tuesday -- as long as it was not the dollar. 
 A seven-month slide in the value of the dollar gained force as investors migrated to other markets and fretted over a report that crude oil could one day be priced in other currencies, hobbling the dollar's role as a vehicle for global trade. 
 On Wall Street, shares climbed on hopes of robust profit reports as earnings season unofficially begins this week. And the dollar's decline propelled gold prices to record highs above $1,040 an ounce and touched off a buying spree for copper, silver, platinum and crude oil -- commodities that typically hold their value if the dollar does not. 
 ''Right now it doesn't give any sign of pulling back significantly,'' said James Steel, a commodities analyst at HSBC. ''There's still a worry about the dollar. There's a latent worry about inflation.''
 The dollar slipped further against major currencies, continuing a decline that has sent it tumbling 15 percent since early March. The dollar fell to $1.47 against the euro, and the Japanese yen strengthened to 88.83 for every dollar. 
 Investors who sought the relative safety of the American currency during the financial crisis are now pursuing higher returns in stocks, commodities and foreign currencies, out of concern that demand for American debt is waning, and that the dollar could someday lose its status as the world's reserve currency.
 Underlying the dollar's weakness is the growing perception that many policy makers around the world, and in Washington, may welcome a slow but sustained depreciation of the dollar, especially against the Chinese renminbi and other Asian currencies.
 A weaker dollar would make imported goods more expensive in the United States and American exports more competitive, but it could make overseas investors wary of buying the Treasury bonds that the country needs to sell to finance its deficit.
 The slide gained momentum after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised investors Tuesday by raising interest rates, making Australia the first big economy to lift rates after the global financial crisis.
 Countries around the world -- including the United States -- trimmed interest rates to record lows as the credit crisis metastasized last year, in an emergency effort to stimulate the markets and keep lending from drying up. Although credit is flowing better now, the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates will hover near zero for some time.
 ''The move was taken as a sign that the global economy is firmly on the road to recovery,'' said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo. ''That's lifted risk appetites and assets across the world. The dollar strengthened when global financial markets went into a tailspin and has retraced back all that strength.''
 Adding to the turmoil, a report on Tuesday in The Independent, a British newspaper, suggested that China, France, Japan and Russia were in secret talks with Persian Gulf countries to abandon the dollar for international trade in oil and replace it with a basket of currencies and gold.
 The article named no sources and was quickly denied by Muhammad al-Jasser, the governor of the Saudi central bank, and Dmitry Pankin, Russia's deputy finance minister. French officials declined to comment. In China, the government is closed for a weeklong holiday, but well-connected bankers were skeptical.
 ''While informal discussions might have taken place, I doubt they represent a serious intent to undermine the existing global monetary order or the role of the U.S. dollar,'' said Fred Hu, who is the chairman of greater China for Goldman Sachs and advises the Chinese government.
 But the report caught the attention of investors because several economists had been predicting that at some point, the world's oil exporters would start moving toward other currencies to limit exposure to the dollar.
 ''It won't be easy to make such a shift; it's a pretty unrealistic idea in the near term,'' said Qu Hongbin, an HSBC economist in Hong Kong. But in the years to come, he added, China would be delighted if it could print its own currency to pay for oil, instead of having to earn dollars through exports.
 Any shift away from the dollar for oil trading, or for commodities more broadly, would seriously undermine global demand for dollars and strengthen the alternatives to it. This would make it harder for Washington to borrow overseas to finance its budget and trade deficits, and could fuel inflation in the United States. 
 Analysts characterized the surge in commodities prices on Tuesday as a reaction to weakness in the dollar, rather than a sign of bullish hopes for a quick recovery. Although activity is picking up, oil consumption remains subdued as factories work at part capacity, and consumers are still reluctant to spend thousands of dollars on gold jewelry when the recovery is tenuous. Crude oil futures in New York rose 43 cents, to $70.83 a barrel, and gold futures rose $21.90, to $1,039.70. 
 Despite worries about the eclipse of the dollar and an estimated $1.6 trillion deficit in 2009, the United States is still finding many eager buyers in the debt market. Foreign governments have billions of dollars in their coffers, and demand for Treasury notes has risen since May, making it cheaper for the government to finance its own operations.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 131.50 points, or 1.37 percent, to 9,731.25, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 14.26 points, or 1.37 percent, higher at 1,054.72, adding to their sharp gains from a day earlier. The Nasdaq was 1.7 percent, or 35.42 points, higher at 2,103.57.
 Interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 103 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.26 percent, from 3.22 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Boulud Joins Michelin Pantheon

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
THE latest New York restaurant ratings in the Michelin and Zagat guidebooks offer few surprises. But if the cheer from Daniel Boulud did not wake you up, it could have. 
 After four years with two stars, his Restaurant Daniel was awarded three stars in the 2010 Michelin, the book's highest rating. Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Masa and Per Se also hold three Michelin stars. 
 ''It's the Nobel Prize!'' said Mr. Boulud, the owner and executive chef. ''I'm proud for my staff, for my parents and for my customers.'' 
 Michelin results came out on Monday; Zagat, two days later.
 In the Michelin guide, Corton, which opened last fall and was not in the guide for 2009, received two stars. Alto was elevated to two from one. Eleven Madison Park, which was awarded four stars by The New York Times, now has one star in Michelin. But Adour and Del Posto were demoted to one from two.
 The one-star category has grown, with 44 restaurants, compared with 34 in last year's guide. 
 ''We welcomed a lot of very good restaurants this year,'' said Jean-Luc Naret, the director of guides for Michelin. The total number of restaurants in the guide has increased to more than 650 this year, up about 50 percent since the New York guide was inaugurated five years ago. To reflect the economy, this year's guide also has a much longer list of Bib Gourmand restaurants (meals for less than $40), and value places (less than $25). 
 Unlike Michelin, which uses its own full-time employees to visit restaurants anonymously, the Zagat guide, published since 1979, tallies assessments made by restaurant goers. Its publishers, Tim and Nina Zagat, wrote in the 2010 guide that in spite of the recession, ''most restaurants are weathering the storm reasonably well.''
 This year Aureole, which moved in June from East 61st Street to an office building near Bryant Park, received a rare rating of 29 for food (out of a possible 30). But the rating was qualified with the symbol for ''low response/less reliable,'' which kept it off Zagat's list of ''Top Food Ratings.'' 
 In the ranks of ''most popular,'' there was some shuffling of the usual suspects. Peter Luger, Nobu and Balthazar rose in the ranks, while Jean Georges dropped a bit. Corton sailed into the top food rankings with a 27 and Marea, another first-timer, received a 26. A new category, cheese specialists, has been added.
 The Zagat Survey for New York, 2010 is $15.95; Michelin New York City 2010 is $17.99.

HEADLINE: Architects Reimagine the Barnes Collection

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Can a design convey an institution's feelings of guilt?
 That's the question that came to mind when I saw the plans for the new Barnes Foundation in downtown Philadelphia, which are scheduled to be unveiled on Wednesday.
 A few years back, the decision to move the Barnes, a revered American art institution, from its current location in the suburban town of Merion, Pa., to a site in Philadelphia's museum district caused an uproar -- not only because it brazenly went against the will of the founder, Albert C. Barnes, but also because it threatened to dismantle a relationship among art, architecture and landscape that was critical to the Barnes's success as a museum.
 For any architect taking on the challenge of the new space, the tangle of ethical and design questions might seem overwhelming. What is an architect's responsibility to Barnes's vision of a dazzling but quirky collection of early Modern artworks housed in a rambling 1920s Beaux-Arts pile? Is it possible to reproduce its spirit in such a changed setting? Or does trying to replicate the Barnes's unique aura only doom you to failure?
 The answers found in the drawings of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, the New York architects who took the commission, are not reassuring. 
 The new Barnes will include many of the features that have become virtually mandatory in the museum world today -- conservation and education departments, temporary exhibition space, auditorium, bookstore, cafe -- making it four times the size of the old Barnes. The architects have tried to compensate for this by laying out these spaces in an elaborate architectural procession that is clearly intended to replicate the serenity, if not the eccentric charm, of the old museum.
 But the result is a convoluted design. Almost every detail seems to ache from the strain of trying to preserve the spirit of the original building in a very different context. The failure to do so, despite such an earnest effort, is the strongest argument yet for why the Barnes should not be moved in the first place.
 The old Barnes is by no means an obvious model for a great museum. Its unlikely suburban setting was partly intended as a tweak to the city's wealthy downtown art establishment. Inside the lighting is far from perfect, and the collection itself, mixing masterpieces by Cezanne, Picasso and Soutine with second-rate paintings by lesser-known artists, has a distinctly oddball flavor.
 But these apparent flaws are also what has made the Barnes one of the country's most enchanting exhibition spaces. The creaky floors and cluttered rooms are light years away from the bigger, more blockbuster-oriented museums of Philadelphia, Washington and New York -- a difference that has only grown more extreme in recent years, as museums have poured money into increasingly slick expansion projects. There are no distracting, superfluous spaces in the old Barnes -- no education centers or contemplation zones. The homey atmosphere of the place reinforces a feeling of being engaged in an intimate dialogue with Barnes himself, not with an anonymous curatorial staff. 
 And the juxtaposition of magnificent and lesser works offers a to-the-point lesson in what makes great art and forces you to consider why your eye is immediately drawn to one work and not another. It makes art personal.
 The artworks and galleries in the new Barnes will be displayed in exactly the same arrangements, but their surroundings will be grander and far more polished. The museum, composed of two buildings facing each other across a glassed-in court, will stand on Benjamin Franklin Parkway -- the Beaux-Arts axis that runs from the foot of the Philadelphia Museum of Art past the Rodin Museum and the Free Library. 
 Visitors arriving from the parkway will follow a drawn-out path that begins on one side of the museum and then will turn to run along the front of the building before arriving at the main entry. 
 From there they will be able to peer across the court through a big floor-to-ceiling window at the building that houses the galleries. 
 It's a perverse tease. Instead of heading directly to the art, they will turn into another room to pick up their tickets, and then turn back before entering the courtyard. From there they will make their way to the gallery building and another lobby. By then I'd be surprised if they had any energy left for the art. What they'll need is a drink.
 The desire to draw out the experience -- which is meant to intensify it, but paradoxically ends up sapping it of life -- continues inside the gallery building. 
 While the floor plan here is basically the same as in the original, Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien have inserted new spaces into the sequence of rooms: a reading room, a classroom and a sunken garden court to allow visitors to take a break from the art. This has become a fashionable strategy in contemporary museum buildings. It was originally intended to combat ''museum fatigue'' and follows the notion that viewing room after room of paintings makes it harder to experience them fully.
 But these added spaces also interrupt the sense of immersion that is so critical to enjoying art. The reading room feels especially out of place. In a model of the design, it is flanked by narrow corridors and looks a bit like leftover storage space. (The architects acknowledge that they have not fully resolved the room's design.) And the Barnes's intimate scale -- it has only 24 gallery rooms -- makes the point of such a space questionable.
 To be sure, not all of the architecture here is so tortured. Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien are known for their deft use of materials and they have invested a great deal of time in the feel of the individual spaces. The exterior of the building will be clad in gorgeous limestone from the Negev Desert, with a rough texture and creamy color that seem imbued with the weight of human history. Some of the panels will project out slightly, evoking the haunting forms of a Rachel Whiteread sculpture.
 The main court, conceived as the museum's social heart, will be paved in dark hardwood and look out onto a garden terrace. The architects hope eventually to connect the terrace to the Rodin Museum a short walk to the east, a nice idea that would strengthen the relationship between the museum and the park that surrounds it.
 But even here the design seems somewhat strained. The stone panels are set in stainless-steel frames with occasional bronze accents, a system similar to the one that Richard Meier used at the Getty and that looks more and more fussy each time I go back to see it.
 And a gigantic light bar that hovers over the main courtyard and projects from the end of the building feels like overkill: its translucent form, which will be lighted up at night, is nearly as big as the gallery building itself.
 Still, the biggest problem with the design is not the fault of the architects: it has to do with the public the museum will serve. Part of the beauty of the Barnes Foundation is that it is so far removed from the tourist economy that drives major cities today. To get to it, visitors have to make an appointment, then take a train or a car to Merion, a half-hour from Philadelphia. These steps put you in a certain frame of mind by the time you arrive: they build anticipation and demand a certain commitment. They also serve as a kind of screening system, discouraging the kind of visitors who are just looking for a way to kill time. 
 The new Barnes is after a different kind of audience. Although museum officials say that the existing limits on crowd size will be kept (albeit with extended hours), it is clearly meant to draw bigger numbers and more tourist dollars. For most visitors the relationship to the art will feel less immediate.
 And this, alas, is a problem no architect could have solved.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 14, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An architecture review last Wednesday about the design for the new Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia misstated the location of the Rodin Museum with respect to the garden terrace planned for the Barnes. The Rodin Museum, to which the Barnes designers hope to connect the terrace, is a short walk to the northwest, not the east.

HEADLINE: Greenhouse Emissions Expected to Decline in Wake of Recession

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Little good can be said about the worst economic slump since the 1930s, but it has produced at least one piece of positive news: the downturn will make it a bit easier to slow the rise in emissions responsible for climate change.
 The International Energy Agency made that prediction in a report Tuesday on global greenhouse gas emissions. Because of slower economic growth, the agency slashed, by 5 percent, its estimate of how much greenhouse gas emissions will be produced in 2020. 
 But the energy agency also cautioned against complacency, stressing that reaching a deal in climate talks to be held in Copenhagen at the end of the year is crucial to limiting the rise in global temperatures.
 Another reason for cautious optimism, the report said, is that China will be able to slow the growth of its emissions much faster than commonly assumed because of its rising investment in wind and nuclear energy and its newfound emphasis on energy efficiency. 
 But avoiding some of the worst consequences of climate change will still require significant and rapid investments in clean technology, and more meaningful cuts in carbon emissions, the report said.
 ''This gives us a chance to make real progress toward a clean-energy future, but only if the right policies are put in place promptly,'' said the agency's executive director, Nobuo Tanaka. 
 As a result of the economic slump, global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are expected to decline by 3 percent this year, the steepest drop in the 45 years according to figures compiled by the agency. That compares with an average growth of 3 percent a year over the last decade. 
 The report outlines how governments can achieve additional cuts through energy efficiency and investments in clean technologies. The goal is to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Meeting that target will require reducing emissions by 23 percent in 2030 compared with what they would otherwise be, the agency said.
 ''The message is simple and stark: if the world continues on the basis of today's energy and climate policies, the consequences of climate change will be severe,'' Mr. Tanaka said.
 The cost of making the necessary changes would be $10 trillion from 2010 to 2030, the agency said, but lower spending on energy bills would offset much or all of that investment. Every year of delay, however, would add $500 billion to the necessary investments, the agency said.
 One of the report's main findings was that China's recent energy policies could achieve much bigger cuts than expected. 
 China overtook the United States as the world's top emitter of global warming gases in 2007 after more than a decade of rapid industrialization. But China is building more nuclear power plants and increasing the role of renewable energy, raising efficiency standards in new buildings, and gradually moving the economy from its manufacturing base to services, the agency said. 
 If China manages to achieve the predicted savings, that nation will be ''at the forefront of all global efforts to combat climate change,'' Fatih Birol, the energy agency's chief economist, said in an interview. 
 Continued progress in China could increase the pressure on the United States, which has so far initiated no overall policy to reduce emissions, as well as on other industrialized nations.
 While calling for deep cuts in emissions, the report acknowledged that profound transformations in energy usage would be necessary to achieve the cuts. In the transportation sector, for example, which is dominated by fossil fuels, 60 percent of worldwide car sales by 2030 would have to be either hybrids, plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles to meet the agency's goals.

HEADLINE: Lobster Roll With That Anorak?

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: PORT CLYDE, Me. 

 BODY:
 EYEING a vivid heap of buoys on her wharf here, Linda L. Bean hatched another idea for her burgeoning lobster empire. 
 The buoys would be ideal decorations for Ms. Bean's next lobster-roll stand, in Delray Beach, Fla. She was ready, as ever, to write a check. Money has been no object for Ms. Bean, an heiress to the L. L. Bean fortune, in the two-plus years since she plunged into the struggling Maine lobster industry. To ensure a supply for her lobster-roll chain and a supermarket line of lobster products, Ms. Bean has spent millions to acquire and upgrade three wharves and buying stations -- where several dozen lobstermen sell their catch -- as well as a processing plant on the state's midcoast.
 She is opening a ''lobster academy'' for chefs, is seeking to trademark new names for lobster products (she thinks ''claws'' sound scary) and pushing, against the wishes of many here, for the state's lobster catch to be certified as sustainable by a London-based environmental group. 
 Her goal, she said, is to save Maine's most iconic industry by ending its dependence on Canadian processors and, under her Linda Bean's Perfect Maine label, to mass market Maine lobster the way Perdue does chicken. 
 ''What we're trying to do is raise it up a notch in terms of identification as being very special,'' she said, adding that too many Americans unwittingly eat ''impostor'' lobster from Canada. ''They have to trust my name.'' Ms. Bean, whose grandfather founded L. L. Bean, is banking on that name and a gene for smart marketing, she said, as well as on a fast-growing work force of locals who know their way around lobster. With their help, she estimates that she will buy about 5 percent of the state's catch this year, a striking amount given her newcomer status. Besides the wharves, she owns a warehouse, several trucks and a pound, where thousands of live lobsters can be stored for months.
 Nobody has complained yet of a monopoly in the making, but Ms. Bean, 68, is not universally loved in the insular, male-dominated lobster industry, or in Maine as a whole.
 A deeply religious, conservative Republican who lost two races for Congress, she has raised hackles among some residents by fighting gay rights and casinos. Some in the lobster business question her hostility toward Canadian processors, with whom they have long relationships, and whether the ideas she seems to churn out at warp speed will work. 
 ''She's only been in the business three years and you're telling me she's got all the answers?'' asked Peter McAleney, a lobster dealer in Portland who is president of the Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers' Association. ''We're already branded -- it's known as king of the sea, nothing has changed.'' 
 Others say Ms. Bean's strategies are worth a shot, especially since she has the money to see them through at a time when few others want to invest in such a battered industry. Price and demand have hit their lowest points in years because of the economic crisis, leaving an oversupply of a luxury product that many say should be diversified. Even the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, the industry's marketing arm, has a budget of only $400,000 a year. 
 ''If Linda can brand her little part of the industry and do a good job marketing it,'' said Gerald Cushman, a fifth-generation lobsterman in Port Clyde, ''I can only think it will help everyone else. While the rest of us are nickel-and-diming, she's able to jump right in.'' 
 Ms. Bean, who had no experience in the industry before buying her first wharf in 2007, said she stepped in because nobody else was moving decisively to solve its problems. 
 ''It doesn't seem like anyone is focused on the severity and the immediacy of the problem,'' she said, ''and what could be done better.''
 Focused she is, but how Ms. Bean keeps track of her projects is anyone's guess. Foremost is the Linda Bean's Perfect Maine Lobster Roll chain, which she aims to expand from 2 stands and 3 restaurants in Maine to at least 100 franchises nationwide in a year. In addition to her signature lobster roll -- a quarter-pound of meat, topped with herbs, on a grilled, buttered roll spread with mayo -- the menu will include Linda Bean's Port Clyde Lobster Stew and Linda Bean's Lobster Cuddlers, the name she is seeking to trademark for claws with drawn butter. 
 ''We're trying to find better names for claws,'' she said, studying one before popping it into her mouth at the Dip Net, a longtime Port Clyde restaurant that she bought this year. ''Like chicken tenders -- it tells you you're eating something succulent, not scary.'' 
 Ms. Bean hired Margaret McLellan, a corporate chef from a lobstering family, to develop new products and to run the Lobster Academy at Cook's Cove, scheduled to open next summer, where chefs from around the world can learn new ways to cook with lobster. She wants her ''frozen line of lobster meals and treats,'' including her lobster stew and other, yet-to-be-disclosed items, to be on sale in 2,000 grocery stores, along with live lobsters with tags that identify their port of origin -- Port Clyde, Tenants Harbor or Vinalhaven. 
 Her plant, which opened in July and can process 20,000 pounds of lobster meat daily, is one of only four in Maine. At least half of the state's lobster catch is sent to Canada to be processed and labeled a product of that country, a procedure Ms. Bean considers ''a tyranny on our price here.'' 
 But many say her belief that all Maine lobster should be processed in Maine is naive. Canadian processors can charge less because they are given generous government subsidies, said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. 
 Even more controversial is Ms. Bean's resolve to have the state's lobster fishery certified as environmentally sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, a London group that promotes responsible fishing. Wal-Mart, for one, has vowed that by 2011, it will buy only from fisheries certified by the council. ''People are worried about where their fish is coming from,'' she said. ''We here in Maine know our catch is sustainable, but someone in California may not.''
 Her position irks many lobstermen and dealers, who question why Maine should pay an estimated $150,000 for the certification and an additional $25,000 to $50,000 a year to maintain it. Maine lobster does not need an outside group's approval, they say, and there is no guarantee that certification would make it more valuable anyway.
 ''This industry can't bear any more cost right now if not guaranteed a profit,'' Mr. Cushman said.
 Others question Ms. Bean's choice of Frank Perdue as a role model, saying that giant companies should not have a role in Maine's famous mom-and-pop industry. ''All the little independent operators, whether farmer or fisherman, seem to disappear in that process,'' said a veteran lobsterman who requested anonymity because he said he did not want to anger Ms. Bean. ''That doesn't bode well for 100 little harbors up and down the coast of Maine.''
 If Ms. Bean knows she has detractors, she does not say so. She said she worried at first that lobstermen would not want to sell to her, and that they suspected her interest in the industry was fleeting. ''The impression I got was that they were thinking, 'Oh, well, she'll turn all this into condominiums,' '' Ms. Bean said of her wharves, where the lobstermen sell her their catch.
 She has worked to win their loyalty by selling bait and gas with no profit margin, she said -- lobstermen are independent operators who own their boats -- and by giving them annual bonuses that amount to an extra 33 cents for every pound they sold her that year. ''They've become quite loyal,'' she said. 
 Generally, though, she stays off the docks and sticks to the more cerebral part of her enterprise: coming up with marketing schemes, lobster products and catchy advertising. She is hoping to trademark two phrases to describe her product line: ''It Stirs Your Primal Senses'' and ''In a Class by Itself.'' 
 ''I love to work with words,'' she said, admiring the latter phrase on a truck. 
 She has also commissioned local artisans to make tableware from lobster shells and a lobster claw pendant; both will be sold at her restaurants.
 ''If I'm quick I can do it for Christmas,'' said Ms. Bean, whose role at L. L. Bean is limited to a seat on its board. 
 Ms. Bean, who drove from her wharves to her processing plant one warm afternoon last week wearing fur earmuffs and blasting classical music from her Jeep, is sending ''lobstermobiles'' -- RV's that sell lobster and shrimp rolls -- to county fairs, a practice she may expand to East Coast boat shows and to Wall Street. 
 Many here wonder how long she will keep buying wharves and other pieces of the lobster industry, a question she herself cannot answer. She said she has spent ''several million'' so far and would keep spending if demand proved high enough. ''Who knows?'' she said. ''I don't have a target. I just want to take care of the situation.''

HEADLINE: City of 8 Million Was a Ghost Town at the Polls

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In the 97th Election District of the 79th Assembly District in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, the polls opened last Tuesday at 6 a.m. They remained open until 9 p.m. Not one of the district's 58 enrolled Democrats turned out to vote for public advocate or comptroller in two citywide primary runoff races that are considered tantamount to election.
 It was the same story in a Sunnyside, Queens, election district and another in Canarsie, Brooklyn: no votes at all. 
 According to preliminary returns, in fact, no votes were recorded in scores of the city's 6,100 election districts. In hundreds more, where the number of enrolled Democrats ranged from 1 to nearly 1,100, fewer than 10 voters turned out to choose the city's official watchdog and its chief fiscal steward. 
 For a week, New Yorkers have known that the runoff was a feeble exercise in participatory democracy of historic proportions. Fewer than 8 percent of the city's roughly three million enrolled Democrats voted in an election that cost the city $15 million and the four candidates millions more. 
 A closer look at the data is apt to only deepen the public's appreciation of how the two winning candidates -- Bill de Blasio for public advocate and John C. Liu for comptroller -- achieved something less than a mandate from the city's populace. They won with the votes of less than 2 percent of all New Yorkers.
 The precise counts in the city's hundreds of election districts are subject to change as malfunctioning machines are accounted for and lapses by the authorities in promptly and accurately reporting vote totals are corrected. But none of the adjustments will be sufficient to keep the 15 hours of mostly nonvoting on Sept. 29 out of the record books, nor quiet the growing chorus of calls for changing how runoff elections are conducted.
 ''I would say this is unprecedented, and the low turnout makes a strong case for instant runoff voting,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, a historian at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ''Of course, that would probably require us to have modern voting machines.''
 The two front-runners in the Sept 15 primary, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Liu, won with less than 40 percent, the threshold required to avoid a runoff. In the rerun for public advocate on Sept. 29, Mr. de Blasio, a member of the City Council from Brooklyn, defeated Mark Green, the former public advocate, with 138,736, or 63 percent of the vote. Councilman John C. Liu of Queens defeated a fellow councilman, David Yassky of Brooklyn, for comptroller with 127,173, or 56 percent. 
 Both runoff winners discounted the notion that the low turnout undermined their legitimacy.
 Mr. Liu said that he had been campaigning citywide for more than a year and, through a spokeswoman, added: ''New Yorkers who came out to vote in the runoff elections were fully engaged on the issues and recognize the important role of the comptroller's office, especially in these tough economic times.''
 Mr. Liu is virtually certain to become the first Asian-American elected to citywide office in the general election next month, and his popularity in Asian neighborhoods helped him collect the needed -- if strikingly few -- votes he required to win.
 The largest turnout of any Assembly district in the city, 19 percent, was in Lower Manhattan, which includes Chinatown, where Mr. Liu won with 69 percent of the vote. In one election district there, turnout was 67 percent, and Mr. Liu won with 81 percent. He carried another nearby district, where turnout was 50 percent, with 94 percent of the vote. 
 Mr. de Blasio, for his part, did not let the epically modest turnout erode his confidence that he was the people's choice.
 ''I spent the past year in communities throughout the city discussing the issues that matter most to New Yorkers,'' he said. ''Through the enthusiasm for this campaign and through the over 600,000 votes cast in two elections, New Yorkers have made their voices loud and clear that it's time for change.''
 The biggest turnout in that race, probably not surprisingly, was in the 44th Assembly District, Mr. de Blasio's home base in Brooklyn. Just 18 percent of the district's registered Democrats voted, but he won 78 percent of those votes.
 Staten Island was the borough that had the poorest overall turnout -- with just 6 percent of eligible Democratic voters casting a ballot. The highest-performing borough, Manhattan, managed 12 percent.
 The area of the city that turned out the lowest percentage of possible voters was the South Bronx. There, Mr. Liu carried the day by rallying to attract all of 782 votes in an Assembly district with more than 31,000 registered Democrats, according to an analysis for The New York Times by Queens College demographers.
 The city's Board of Elections, which runs the city's voting efforts, met Tuesday, but a spokeswoman said the low turnout was not discussed. The board begins its official canvass of the runoff results Wednesday. It is expected to take two weeks. It is likely that some of the election districts with no votes recorded in the initial tally might, in the end, be discovered to have experienced some voting.
 Until last week, the lowest citywide turnout was in 1993, when Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens defeated the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, for the Democratic nomination for comptroller. Just over 10 percent of the city's 2.28 million enrolled turned out in an election with no other races on the ballot.
 Mr. Hevesi had 172,484 votes to Ms. Holtzman's 83,876.
 Those numbers, of course, seem faintly majestic when set against last Tuesday's.
 That said, there was at least one bright spot amid all the apathy. The best voter participation rate was recorded in Queens, in the 15th Election District of the 27th Assembly District in Queens: 100 percent.
 There, the one enrolled Democrat eligible to vote actually did.

Liu was nominated for city comptroller and Bill de Blasio for public advocate was dismal, under 8 percent of voters. In many election districts, nobody turned out.

HEADLINE: Wounded by Defeat, Politicians in India Turn Against One Another

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
It is an all-too-familiar political story. 
 First there was the electoral drubbing at the hands of a center-left juggernaut. Next came the recriminations, with party leaders taking nasty, public swipes at one another in dueling magazine articles, op-ed articles and talk show appearances. Then came the agonizing debate: should the party lurch rightward to consolidate its base, or rush toward the center to attract moderate voters? And finally, the purge: party members who do not make the ideological cut are cast out or pushed aside. 
 If the script sounds familiar to those who have followed American politics in the last year, this one is playing out in the majestic, colonial-era halls of power in India's capital, where the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which seemed almost unstoppable when it swept into power a decade ago, is at risk of slipping into irrelevance. 
 The descent of the B.J.P., India's second-largest political party, has once again raised a question that has pricked at the world's most populous democracy since its independence from Britain in 1947: Will the country ever produce a true rival to the Congress Party, which has governed for most of the last 62 years? And if it does not, what does that mean for India's democracy? 
 Its onetime winning formula, combining a muscular nationalism with pro-market reforms and pledges of good government, fell flat in the face of a revitalized Congress Party in parliamentary elections in May.
 The bad news did not stop there, keeping India's lively political press gleefully busy with one scandal after another. The squabbling reached its peak two months ago when the party expelled one of its stalwarts, Jaswant Singh, for writing a book that lionized the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. 
 Since its release in August, Mr. Singh's book, ''Jinnah: India -- Partition -- Independence,'' has shaken the B.J.P. Mr. Singh was summarily expelled from the party, and Gujarat, one of India's wealthiest states and a bastion of B.J.P. support, tried to ban his book. Its main offense is that it does not blame Mr. Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, for the partition of British India in 1947, but Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. 
 The battle over Mr. Singh's book is merely the latest development in what has been a grim political struggle for the soul of the party. The party was once so successful that it seemed that the Hindu nationalist fervor that brought it to the fore might transform the secular, diverse nation that is modern India into one guided and dominated by a single faith. 
 In the 1980s and '90s the defiant pose of Hindu nationalism fit well with the mood in India, which was tired of being seen as an impoverished nation forever hobbled by experiments with socialism and inept public administration. Hindutva, as the ideology was known, cultivated a tougher image that matched India's global aspirations.
 If the Congress Party, which has governed India for much of its history, gave India freedom, then the B.J.P. gave it self-respect in a world accustomed to thinking of it in terms of human suffering. 
 But in the 21st century, India has become an emerging power whose voice rumbles with growing authority. The old insecurities that drove middle-class Hindus toward the B.J.P. seem to have melted away. 
 To many political observers, the B.J.P. got precisely the defeat it deserved. It failed, the argument goes, to present a coherent alternative to the Congress Party, which had governed in a shaky coalition with decidedly underwhelming results for five years. 
 In this context, what seems like an intramural squabble in a party still nursing its wounds from a nasty whipping has much broader consequences. 
 ''We are going back into a period of Congress dominance,'' said Prem Shankar Jha, an analyst who writes frequently on politics. ''But it is an insecure dominance, which always leads to very bad governance.'' 
 Ramachandra Guha, an Indian historian, said the B.J.P.'s implosion made it nearly impossible for the party to play the much-needed role of loyal opposition, keeping the governing party in line. 
 ''Clearly we need some kind of robust alternative to the Congress,'' Mr. Guha said. ''One does not want the Congress to acquire a sense of invincibility.''
 But if recent events are any guide, the B.J.P. is too busy with its internal tussles to take on the governing party. Such battles have served only to remind voters of the kinds of narrow causes the party has championed in the past, often with tragic results.
 One is its support for the reconstruction of a temple at the site in the state of Uttar Pradesh that Hindu nationalists believe to be the birthplace of Ram. In 1992, rampaging Hindu mobs destroyed a mosque that had been built there, and spasms of religious violence reverberated in India for years afterward, culminating a decade later in riots in Gujarat that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. 
 While such issues fire up the party's base of militant, upper-caste Hindus, they have over the years alienated many voters from the party. 
 ''Middle-class voters seemed embarrassed that in the 21st century they should be asked to debate India's future on the basis of a dispute over a medieval mosque,'' Vir Sanghvi, a columnist for The Hindustan Times, wrote this summer.
 The Congress Party's huge victory in parliamentary elections in May was celebrated as a chance to end the fractious era of messy coalition politics that had held back major reforms. 
 But in the past, long periods of virtually unchallenged Congress rule have not been particularly kind to India. It is no coincidence, analysts say, that India's rise as a global economic powerhouse really took off as the B.J.P. became a viable national alternative to Congress. 
 In a speech to the party faithful after the electoral defeat, the Bharatiya Janata Party's candidate for prime minister, the octogenarian L.K. Advani, was almost valedictory, saying that his party, whatever its failures, had broken the Congress's lock on national power. 
 ''In the last two decades the B.J.P. has succeeded in transforming this single dominant party polity into a bipolar polity,'' he said. 
 Sudheendra Kulkarni, a senior party member who quit the B.J.P. after the flap over the Jinnah book, said the party had fallen flat because it misread voters. It is less clear where the party goes now. 
 ''We focused on negatives when the people wanted a positive, superior agenda for governance and development,'' he said. ''People want India to grow steadily on this path, with no disturbances and no turmoil.''

WEINSTEIN--Ida Winaker Loewenberg, 92, of Brooklyn and Neponsit, died September 29, 2009, in Boca Raton, Florida. She was the loving and beloved wife of the late Stanley A. Loewenberg and Jacob M. Weinstein. 
She was predeceased also by her parents Minnie and Harry Winaker and her brother Oscar. Left to mourn her are her cherished children Susan L. Shulman (Victor Shulman), Paul H. Weinstein (Wendi Glassman) and Andrew Z. Weinstein (the late Etta Sanders), her adored grandchildren Stephanie A. Shulman (Amir Bronstein), David J. Shulman (Fernanda Cohen-Shulman), Nicholas and Jonah Weinstein, her special great-grandchildren Mia and Liam Bronstein, her beloved sister Sylvia Ayes (the late Theodore) and brother Laurence Winaker (Rhea), many nieces and nephews and all those who were fortunate enough to have known her and to have been touched by her gentle nature, kindness and generosity. A Girls High School graduate at the age of 16, she earned bachelors and masters degrees from NYU. After working as a hospital dietitian, she had a long career as a Home Economics and then substitute teacher in several Brooklyn public schools. She was an intrepid, inspired cook; a master storyteller (especially in Yiddish); a shrewd political observer and proud Liberal. Her intelligence showed through in her sense of humor and wit, which were extraordinary. But above all, her love for her family and her friends was unconditional and her loyalty to us all was fierce. We have lost a woman beyond measure. Services were held privately in New York.

HEADLINE: A Good Return on Investment

 BODY:
The recession has dealt a heavy blow to low-income families. Many have had to move in with relatives; those still lucky enough to live on their own typically are spending too much of their meager incomes on rent and utilities, which places them at clear risk of homelessness. The problem will only get worse as more people who have lost their homes to foreclosure flood into the rental market, driving up rents and putting even more pressure on lower-income families who are barely making ends meet. 
 Congress could help rescue these struggling families by putting money into the National Housing Trust Fund, which was signed into law in 2008 but has never been financed. 
 Modeled on state-level programs, the National Housing Trust Fund would provide subsidies and incentives to developers who preserve, rehabilitate and construct housing, primarily for extremely low-income families. Under this system, a developer who earmarked, for example, 10 percent of units in a market-rate building for the lowest-income families would receive a subsidy proportionate to that investment. In addition to providing homes for the most vulnerable families, this money would help stimulate the construction of multifamily buildings at a time when the credit markets are still uncertain. 
 When Congress set up the trust in 2008, it was expected to eventually generate about $500 million a year -- with the money to come from the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their implosion meant that the money never arrived. 
 New bills pending in the House and Senate would set aside $1 billion for the trust fund from the profits that the government will reap from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which invested in struggling banks in the depths of the financial crisis. Lawmakers should move quickly to approve this legislation. Washington should do more to help struggling families find decent, affordable places to live. Investing in the National Housing Trust Fund is an important step.

HEADLINE: Sharp Reversal For California Over Welfare

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif. 

 BODY:
As he pressed state lawmakers over the summer to close a record budget deficit, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger lathered scorn on the state's welfare-to-work program. He called it too lenient on the work requirement and overly generous in its benefits. At one point, he proposed eliminating it, then compromised to make it tougher. 
 So Anna Zendejas, a welfare recipient in a farm town 50 miles west of here, was more than a little surprised to get a letter recently saying that she did not need to work to collect her check -- in effect, a return to the much-derided welfare approach that existed before a national overhaul in the 1990s. 
 It was no fluke. This fall, tens of thousands of Californians will be given a similar choice as the state embraces a startling reversal in some of its welfare policies for the next two years. It is a route that few are happy with, but that reflects the intersection of a recession, the worst fiscal crisis in the state's modern history, a governor determined to slash social services and the unplanned effects of federal stimulus money. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger did wring savings out of the state's welfare-to-work program, known as CalWorks, and achieved a future tightening of the rules. But those changes do not start until July 1, 2011. In the interim, to save $375 million a year, the state is trimming the employment assistance programs at the heart of the welfare-to-work approach, especially subsidized child care, and suspending work requirements for a large share of recipients. Those programs were selected, in large part, because they were not eligible for extra federal money under the stimulus act.
 Though state officials emphasize that the change is temporary, some people inside and outside of state government worry that the abrupt reversal may encourage a return to habits that could be difficult to undo.
 ''We spent 10 years changing the culture, from just getting a check,'' said Frank Mecca, executive director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California ''We think this will send a confusing message and do lasting damage.'' 
 The recession has put welfare programs in many states in a bind: revenues are down, more people are in need and jobs are more scarce. The two-year stimulus money has helped many states avoid trimming the rolls, but each is working out its own service cuts, and some, including California and New York, are using the federal money to provide wage subsidies to some recipients trying to enter the tough job market.
 Donna Pavetti, a welfare expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group in Washington, said it was unclear whether other states might follow California's lead in relaxing work requirements; some states might be doing so already, she said, just less overtly.
 Still, what California does often takes on outsized significance because the state's welfare rolls are outsized. In July, while looking for budget cuts, Mr. Schwarzenegger complained that California had 12 percent of the nation's population but 30 percent of the people on welfare.
 As elsewhere, California's welfare roles plummeted after the 1996 national overhaul of welfare, from 921,000 families in 1995 to 466,000 families in 2008, but they did not fall as much as in most states. In the recession, rolls have climbed and are projected to reach 557,000 families in 2010, or about 1.3 million individuals.
 Parents with special hardships or the youngest babies have always been exempt from work requirements in California, but now two large groups making up one-third or more of all applicants can also opt out: single parents with a child age 1 to 2, or those with two children under 6. 
 Ms. Zendejas, 20, is the mother of two boys under 6. She has worked part time as a supermarket cashier, but under the old work-to-welfare rules she was supposed to spend an additional 15 hours in vocational training or searching for a more stable job, an effort that she found too hard to juggle, resulting in a financial penalty.
 Now she needs to do none of that to get her check, and the penalty of more than $120 a month is ending, too. ''It's a relief,'' she said. 
 John Wagner, director of the California Department of Social Services, said the backpedaling on job aid was ''a function of the tough decisions required by this fiscal crisis.'' With the caseload rising in the recession -- and jobs scarce anyway -- the state did not increase spending for CalWorks, and while stimulus money helped, the $375 million gap remained. 
 ''I think there's still a strong message, in the short term and the long term, that CalWorks needs to incentivise work,'' Mr. Wagner said. 
 Phil Ansell, the CalWorks policy director in Los Angeles County, said scaling back the work requirement seemed the best among bad options, but he was less confident about how its resurrection in 2011 would play out.
 ''It will not be a simple deal to restore it by snapping our fingers,'' he said of the emphasis on work.
 Fresno County is one of the first to notify recipients and recent applicants of the new policy. Belying stereotypes, only about 10 percent of those who could be exempted from the work requirements -- and supporting aid like child care -- chose to do so in the first month. 
 ''What we're seeing is that most people want to participate in activities to get them ready for jobs,'' said Julie Hornback, director of the Fresno Department of Employment and Temporary Assistance. Opting out is voluntary for now, but officials here and in much of the state expect that the low rate of volunteers and tight finances will force them to make it mandatory for new applicants and some others. 
 Some recipients could be sorely disappointed. Removing work supports ''would be really hard for me to accept,'' said Lashe Baldwin, 22, who has a 2-year-old son and a 19-month-old daughter and has chosen to stay with the program. After starting on CalWorks in January, she worked without pay assisting a job specialist at the county agency. 
 She gained invaluable knowledge about job skills, she said, and has been recommended for a position as an aide in a home for the mentally ill, with a salary that would initially be subsidized by CalWorks using stimulus money. 
 ''Especially when you have kids, you can't just sit around and collect checks,'' Ms. Baldwin said. 
 When the state's new rules take effect in two years, the financial penalties for those not meeting work requirements, or who use up the maximum 60 months of assistance, will rise, and cost-of-living increases will not come automatically, among other changes that are expected to drive welfare rolls down and save hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
 California Reeling: Changes to Public Aid. This is the first in a series of articles that examines how California's multibillion-dollar budget crisis is changing the state.

HEADLINE: China Aims to Steady North Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea's leader gave an unusually exuberant welcome this week to the prime minister of China, whose trip was intensely monitored by the rest of the world for progress on efforts to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 But the deal struck by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China had far more to do with the two countries' shared goal -- stability in North Korea. 
 When Mr. Kim met Mr. Wen on Monday, North Korea said it was ready to return to six-nation talks on ending its nuclear program -- but only if it saw progress in bilateral talks with the United States, state-run media in China and North Korea reported Tuesday. For months, North Korea had insisted that it would never return to the talks demanded by the United States, calling them ''dead.'' 
 North Korea's reversal came after China signed a series of agreements that promised aid for the North and an expansion in economic exchanges, including the construction of another bridge across their tightly controlled river border.
 In somewhat ceremonial language, the two governments also vowed to support each other ''for generations to come'' -- a pledge interpreted as a reference to the ill health of Mr. Kim and the possibility that the youngest of his three sons, Kim Jong-un, is being groomed as his successor. 
 It was unclear whether Kim Jong-un was formally introduced to Mr. Wen.
 A belligerently anti-American North Korea has often been considered as China's buffer against American influence in the region. China also wants to ward off an implosion by North Korea, which would endanger the stability of its own border area. 
 ''The results of Wen Jiabao's trip show that China's foremost concern is to secure stability in North Korea,'' said Han Suk-hee, an expert on Chinese-North Korean relations at the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. ''The deals they signed are aimed at ensuring stability in North Korea even after Kim Jong-il is gone. China effectively announced that it did not agree with the United States and South Korea on sanctions against North Korea.''
 The joint announcement gave China something on the nuclear front to show the world -- if only a vaguely worded promise to possibly return to talks -- that might ease international pressure on it to do more on North Korea.
 But the limits of the deal were underlined by the South Korean news agency Yonhap, which said North Korea was in the final stage of restoring its plutonium plant. That plant was mothballed after an international agreement in 2007 but revived in a fury after the North's missile and nuclear tests prompted new international sanctions this year.
 North Korea has repeatedly used negotiations over ending its nuclear weapons program as a way of extracting aid and diplomatic concessions from other countries. North Korea has so far received $2.2 billion under failed international deals aimed at persuading it to dismantle its nuclear facilities, according to a report this week by Kwon Young-se, a governing party lawmaker in South Korea.
 While the economic assistance China promised may elevate its leverage over North Korea, it may also deprive the United States and South Korea of theirs by sapping the strength of sanctions, analysts said. 
 ''This is a breakthrough for Kim Jong-il,'' said Chang Yong-seok, research director at the nonprofit Institute for Peace Affairs in Seoul. ''China reconfirmed that it remained the biggest patron of the North Korean regime. It's a boost for Kim Jong-il's grip on power.
 ''But one can imagine frustration in Washington.''
 Ian C. Kelly, a State Department spokesman, said the government was waiting to hear the details from the Chinese. 
 South Korea said it had already expressed concern about whether the Chinese moves violated United Nations Security Council sanctions.
 ''We are expecting China to explain the details of its economic cooperation programs with North Korea and whether they violated the Security Council resolutions,'' Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan told a group of South Korean news media editors, according to Yonhap.
 Mr. Yu described Beijing's diplomacy as a combination of sanctions and engagement arising out of a concern that isolation and pressure alone would drive North Korea only to strengthen its nuclear weapons programs. 
 China's trade and aid have become more crucial to North Korea's survival, especially with South Korea refusing to send aid to the North during the past year and a half. Last year, trade between China and North Korea reached $2.79 billion, up 41.3 percent from 2007. That has slipped in the first eight months of this year to $1.6 billion, a fall of 6.2 percent from the same months last year. 
 Some analysts say that China's influence over North Korea may be overstated.
 ''China has long sought to parlay economic engagement into political influence over North Korea, '' said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ''Beijing's efforts, however, have been for naught. Despite extensive Chinese government largess and business engagement, the Chinese leadership was unable to persuade North Korea to abandon either nuclear weapons program nor prevent long-range missile launches and nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.''
 Even in the North's discussion of returning to talks, it held to its longstanding approach of framing the issue of its nuclear weapons program largely as a matter between itself and the United States. ''We expressed our readiness to hold multilateral talks, depending on the outcome'' of bilateral talks with the United States, said the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency in a report on the Kim-Wen meeting. ''The six-party talks are also included in the multilateral talks.''
 ''The hostile relations between the D.P.R.K. and the United States should be converted into peaceful ties through the bilateral talks without fail,'' the agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying, using the initials for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name. 
 Washington said recently that it was open to direct negotiations with the North to coax it back to the six-nation talks, which also include South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.
 But both the United States and South Korea have said that bilateral discussions should not be a substitute for six-nation negotiations and that they will maintain sanctions until North Korea relents on its nuclear program.

HEADLINE: Partisan Economics In Action

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Successful economic ideas usually end up being taken too far.
 Democrats dominated the middle part of the 20th century, thanks in part to their vigorous response to the Great Depression. They used the government to soften the effects of the Depression and to build the modern safety net. But they failed to see the limits of the government's ability to manage the economy and helped usher in the stagflation of the 1970s.
 Ronald Reagan then came to power promising to cut taxes and unleash the forces of the market. And the Democrats spent the next dozen years struggling to absorb the lessons of their failures.
 More than a few people believe the Republican Party is in a similar place today. 
 When I asked Dale Jorgenson, the eminent expert on productivity (and a Republican), what had been the positive aspects of President George W. Bush's economic policy, Mr. Jorgenson said, ''I don't see any redeeming features, unfortunately.'' After Republicans opposed the stimulus package this year, The Financial Times, not exactly a liberal organ, called the party's ideology harebrained. When Olympia Snowe was recently explaining why she might be the only Republican senator to vote for health reform, she suggested it was because her party had moved so far to the right.
 But perhaps the most persistent -- and thought-provoking -- conservative critic of the party has been Bruce Bartlett. Mr. Bartlett has worked for Jack Kemp and Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush. He has been a fellow at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation. He wants the estate tax to be reduced, and he thinks that President Obama should not have taken on health reform or climate change this year.
 Above all, however, he thinks that the Republican Party no longer has a credible economic policy. It continues to advocate tax cuts even though the recent Bush tax cuts led to only mediocre economic growth and huge deficits. (Numbers from the Congressional Budget Officeshow that Mr. Bush's policies are responsible for far more of the projected deficits than Mr. Obama's.)
 On the spending side, Republican leaders criticize Mr. Obama, yet offer no serious spending cuts of their own. Indeed, when the White House has proposed cuts -- to parts of Medicare, to an outdated fighter jet program and to subsidies for banks and agribusiness -- most Republicans have opposed them. 
 How, Mr. Bartlett asks, is this conservative? How is it in keeping with a party that once prided itself on fiscal responsibility -- the party of President Dwight Eisenhower (who refused to cut taxes because the budget wasn't balanced) or of the first President Bush (whose tax increase helped create the 1990s surpluses)? 
 ''So much of what passes for conservatism today is just pure partisan opposition,'' Mr. Bartlett says. ''It's not conservative at all.''
 He became well known several years ago for attacking the younger Mr. Bush, in a book called ''Impostor.'' But Mr. Bartlett has turned out to be more interesting than most people who publicly break from their own party. In a series of columns for Forbes and in a book that comes out next week, ''The New American Economy,'' he has started to describe a new conservatism. He is, in effect, laying intellectual groundwork for a Republican Bill Clinton -- the politician who curbs his party's excesses. 
 You can argue that this sort of reassessment should not make conservatives feel insecure. In many ways, they have won. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Clinton, has proposed raising the top marginal tax rate to a level that's lower than it was for most of the Reagan administration. Most Democrats now acknowledge the central idea of supply-side economics: tax rates matter. 
 The best parts of supply-side economics have been ''completely integrated into mainstream economics,'' Mr. Bartlett writes. ''What remains is a caricature -- that there is no problem that more and bigger tax cuts won't solve.''
 His conservatism starts with the idea that high taxes are no longer the problem, even if complaining about them still makes for good politics. This year, federal taxes are on pace to equal just 15 percent of gross domestic product. It is the lowest share since 1950. 
 As the economy recovers, taxes will naturally return to about 18 percent of G.D.P., and Mr. Obama's proposed rate increase on the affluent would take the level closer to 20 percent. But some basic arithmetic -- the Medicare budget, projected to soar in coming decades -- suggests taxes need to rise further, and history suggests that's O.K.
 For one thing, past tax increases have not choked off economic growth. The 1980s boom didn't immediately follow the 1981 Reagan tax cut; it followed his 1982 tax increase to reduce the deficit. The 1990s boom followed the 1993 Clinton tax increase. Tax rates matter, but they're nowhere near the main force affecting growth.
 And taxes are supposed to rise as a country grows richer. This is Wagner's Law, named for the 19th-century economist Adolf Wagner, who coined it. As societies become more affluent, people demand more services that governments tend to provide, like health care, education and a strong military. A century ago, federal taxes equaled just a few percent of G.D.P. The country wasn't better off than it is today.
 Modern conservatism, Mr. Bartlett says, should therefore have two main economic principles. One, it should prevent government from getting too big. There is no better opportunity than health reform, given that the current bills don't do nearly enough to slow spending growth. Instead of pushing the White House to do better, however, Congressional Republicans are criticizing any effort to slow spending as an attack on Grandma. They're evidently in favor of big Medicare, just not the taxes to pay for it. 
 The second goal should be to keep taxes from being increased in the wrong ways. Supply-side economics is based on the idea that higher tax rates discourage work and investment, two crucial ingredients for economic growth. But higher taxes on consumption don't have nearly the same effect as taxes on incomes or companies. If anything, consumption taxes encourage savings, which lifts investment.
 So Mr. Bartlett advocates a value-added tax -- a federal sales tax -- which most other rich countries have. Canada has a value-added tax that raises revenue equal to 2 percent of its G.D.P., and its economy has grown faster than this country's over the last decade. Britain raises 6 percent of its G.D.P. through such a tax and Sweden raises 9 percent, and their economies have grown as fast as the American economy. 
 I don't agree with everything Mr. Bartlett says, and you probably don't either. Maybe you don't like a national sales tax because you think it will inevitably hurt the poor. Maybe you have specific ideas for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from the federal budget to keep taxes from rising much. 
 But you don't have to agree with all the specifics to see that he has a larger point. One of the country's two political parties has no answer to an enormous economic issue -- the fact that the federal government cannot pay for its obligations. This lack of engagement is a problem, just as it was a problem when Democrats were saying that welfare was working, teachers' unions were always right and stagflation couldn't happen. 
 For now, there is little reason to think the Republicans are on the verge of a Clinton-like reform. But it is hard to see how they can ultimately stick to their current platform. Atsome point, the government will have to figure out how to pay for the baby boomers' retirement. ''Trends that can't continue,'' as Mr. Bartlett says, ''don't.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Working to Overturn Justices on Age Bias

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Three Democratic Congressional committee chairmen said Tuesday that they would move to overturn a four-month-old Supreme Court ruling that made it significantly harder for workers to win many age discrimination cases.
 The three chairmen criticized the court's decision in a case involving a 54-year-old man who was demoted, saying the ruling flouted Congress's intent and created unfair obstacles to the victims of age discrimination.
 In a 5-to-4 ruling last June, the Supreme Court created a tougher burden of proof for plaintiffs in age bias cases. Previously, if an employee could prove that age was a factor in an adverse employment decision, like a demotion or a layoff, the employer then had to show that it had acted for a valid reason other than age discrimination. But as a result of the June ruling, employees now face the full burden of demonstrating that age was the deciding factor. 
 ''This extremely high burden really undermines workers' ability to hold employers accountable,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
 He was joined at a news conference by Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. The chairmen said the Supreme Court's ruling came at an especially bad time because more than two million Americans 55 and over were unemployed and because the number of age discrimination cases filed last year jumped 29 percent over 2007 levels.
 The court's decision, in Gross v. F.B.L. Financial Services, was generally welcomed by business because it made it harder for plaintiffs to win cases. 
 Michael W. Fox, a corporate lawyer scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday, said he would defend the court's ruling, adding that it helped provide clarity and that the old formula was ''problematic.'' 
 ''It was terribly confusing both to courts and juries,'' Mr. Fox said. ''The courts were somewhat in disarray as to what the state of the law was.''
 Mr. Leahy asserted that the court's ruling was an ''activist'' decision, noting that the court had established a different burden of proof for age discrimination cases than for race, sex and religion discrimination cases.
 ''What our bill does is restore the intent of Congress, an intent that I believe the Supreme Court negligently ignored,'' Mr. Leahy said.
 The ruling's defenders said that Justice Clarence Thomas's majority decision had followed Congressional intent, noting that Congress had amended the main employment discrimination act to make the burden of proof easier for plaintiffs, but had not done so with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
 Michael Eastman, executive director of labor policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said his organization was open to discussing whether to adjust the newly established burden of proof in age discrimination cases. ''We would be very concerned to the extent that the proposal goes further than that,'' Mr. Eastman said.
 AARP, the nation's largest advocacy organization, with 40 million members, vigorously backed the proposed legislation, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.
 ''Unless Congress passes this bill, too many older workers who have been victims of arbitrary age discrimination will be denied their day in court,'' said Nancy LeaMond, an executive vice president of AARP.

HEADLINE: 4 Senators' Concerns Reflect Health Care Challenge

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia is upset that a health care bill poised for approval by the Finance Committee would turn nearly a half-trillion dollars over to insurance companies, whose profits he says are ''out of sight.''
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine worries that the bill would require people to buy insurance they cannot afford. Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas fears that the bill would be too costly for the government. 
 And Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon warns that the bill would lock many workers into health plans selected by their employers, without allowing them to shop for better, cheaper plans, an alternative that could help drive down costs for everyone.
 Those senators -- three Democrats and one Republican, Ms. Snowe -- have not indicated how they will vote on the Finance Committee legislation and said Tuesday that they were agonizing over the decision. 
 White House officials and the committee chairman expect the Democrats to support the bill, if only to advance it to the next stage of the legislative process, the Senate floor, for what is likely to be a raucous, riveting and unpredictable debate. 
 Taken together, the four senators represent the spectrum of concerns Democrats will face in trying to assemble the 60 votes they need to get a bill through the full Senate using regular procedure. Satisfying each of them, without alienating the others, is the challenge facing Democratic leaders.
 The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, predicted Tuesday that Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Wyden would be with him ''when the final votes are cast'' in committee. Other Democrats said, with less certainty, that they expected Ms. Snowe to support the bill in committee as well. 
 While the four senators do seem genuinely undecided, by declining to commit in advance they also maximize their leverage: their ability to win changes in the legislation later on.
 ''I'm pondering,'' Mr. Rockefeller said. ''It's an imperfect bill, with a lot of pluses and minuses.'' 
 Mr. Rockefeller said the committee had improved the bill over the last two weeks by preserving the Children's Health Insurance Program and by preventing taxes on expensive insurance policies for some people in high-risk occupations, like coal miners
 Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Rockefeller and Ms. Snowe said that in deciding how to vote, they would be influenced by a cost estimate soon to be completed by the Congressional Budget Office. President Obama has insisted that whatever final legislation emerges from Congress must not add to the federal budget deficit and must slow the growth of health spending in the long term.
 On health care, Mr. Rockefeller illustrates the views of liberal Democrats. Under the bill, he said, insurance companies would receive more than $460 billion over 10 years to help pay for the coverage of low- and middle-income people. Congress, he said, must create a new government-run health plan, to compete directly with private insurers. The Finance Committee last week rejected his proposal to create such a public option.
 Although she is a Republican, Ms. Snowe's views reflect the concerns of many centrist Democrats. She worries that some middle-income families will find insurance unaffordable, even with federal subsidies. And she wants to give the private insurance market an opportunity to work, under new federal rules, before setting up a government plan in states where affordable coverage proves unavailable.
 Centrist Democrats like Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware have similar ideas. Rather than setting up a single national government health plan, they would prefer to let states decide what to do. 
 Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, describing himself as a ''Jeffersonian Democrat, someone who believes the laboratories of democracy typically work,'' said it might make sense for states to act as a testing ground for a public option. That way, Mr. Nelson said, if the public option failed, it would do so on a small scale, and problems might be easier to fix.
 But reflecting divisions that could lie ahead on the Senate floor, Mr. Rockefeller said this approach was unacceptable to him. State health plans would not be strong enough to compete effectively with big private insurance companies, he said.
 Mrs. Lincoln, who is up for re-election next year in a state that voted heavily Republican in the 2008 presidential race, said she and her constituents in Arkansas would focus on the cost of the legislation and its effect on the country's fiscal condition. 
 ''We have got probably one of the lowest median incomes in the country,'' Mrs. Lincoln said. ''We have got people who know what it means when you spend beyond your means and you hit difficult economic times.''
 Mrs. Lincoln said her constituents were ''enormously alarmed about the amount of debt that we have.'' And she said she worried that the cost of the bill could rise further as a result of amendments that might be added by her Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor.
 As for how she would vote in the committee, Mrs. Lincoln said the budget office analysis would be crucial. ''I am going to wait and see what the scores are,'' she said. 
 Mr. Wyden noted that the committee's bill would not offer additional options to the overwhelming majority of Americans who already have insurance. His concern is shared by some Democrats and also by many Republicans, who say the bill does not do enough to let the marketplace spur competition, and he said he would continue fighting on the Senate floor to make changes to the measure.
 ''Democrats from the president on talk about how the American people ought to have choices like a member of Congress,'' Mr. Wyden said. ''Now under consideration is an idea that millions and millions won't get any choice at all, let alone what a member of Congress gets.''
 ''When you think about where this is headed,'' he added, ''you are still seeing additional patches added to the crazy quilt that is American health care.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Protests Violence In Guinea

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CONAKRY, Guinea 

 BODY:
The Obama administration has injected itself into the crisis in Guinea, taking the unusual step of sending a senior diplomat to protest the mass killings and rapes here last week.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called for ''appropriate actions'' against a military government that she said ''cannot remain in power.''
 ''It was criminality of the greatest degree, and those who committed such acts should not be given any reason to expect that they will escape justice,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters in Washington. She said that the nation's leader, Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara, and his government ''must turn back to the people the right to choose their own leaders.'' 
 The military seized power here last December, and pressure has been rising as Captain Camara, 45, backed off a pledge not to run in this country's presidential elections in January. At a demonstration against him on Sept. 28, witnesses said soldiers opened fire on the crowds and raped and sexually assaulted female protesters. Human rights officials estimate that as many as 157 people were killed. The government has put the number at 56. 
 On Monday, William Fitzgerald, deputy assistant secretary of state, met with Captain Camara for two hours. He said he insisted, in strong language, that Captain Camara was responsible for the violence, despite the military strongman's repeated denials. Mr. Fitzgerald said he also repeated that Captain Camara should not run in the elections, a key opposition demand. 
 ''The message is, what happened on Sept. 28 is totally unacceptable, from every way you look at it -- the killings, the gender violence,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said in an interview at the United States Embassy here Tuesday. ''I said, 'Mr. President, whether you like it or not, it's tied to you. You are responsible for Sept. 28. The buck stops with you.' '' 
 The response from the captain was noncommittal, he said. 
 American pressure is limited in French-speaking West Africa, a region to which it has typically paid scant attention. But Mr. Fitzgerald's meeting with Captain Camara is seen as significant by Africa experts as an example of President Obama's push for good governance and human rights on the continent -- the focus of a speech he gave in Ghana in July that is still widely commented on. 
 A month later, Mrs. Clinton traveled to eastern Congo to speak out against the systematic rape of girls and young women amid the sectarian strife there. She has made the fight against mass rape a major theme in a foreign policy that focuses on the plight of women in the developing world.
 Mr. Fitzgerald's visit comes after a week of international expressions of disgust over the violence at the Stade du 28 Septembre here. The stadium is named for the day in 1958 when Guineans voted against an offer of partnership from their colonial master, France, setting the stage for independence days later. Guinea was the first country in French-speaking Africa to declare independence. 
 The military government has claimed that many victims at the stadium were trampled. On Tuesday, The New York Times obtained photographs showing bodies in a pile and lined up, perhaps as many as 20, with no blood on them. But the bodies shown represent only a portion of the perhaps 160 dead, and scores of witnesses insist that most people were shot.
 Days after the protest, the major hospital was still treating people suffering from gunshot wounds, and scores of people say they are still missing loved ones.
 Sidya Toure, a former prime minister, who was at the stadium and was beaten by soldiers, said he saw the anonymously circulated pictures and speculated that the government allowed the bodies to be photographed to back their claims. 
 He said about 20 were indeed trampled in the frenzy of running from the bullets. But he, like many others, is adamant about the shooting. 
 ''Absolutely,'' he said in an interview Tuesday night. He said he was seated in the stands, with other opposition leaders.
 ''I saw people falling in front of me. I said, 'Why are these people falling?' '' Then, he said, he looked to his left. ''I absolutely saw soldiers firing directly on people.''
 France, a traditional partner of Guinea, has suspended military aid, and on Sunday its foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said, ''It seems to me that today, one can no longer work with Dadis Camara, and there should be an international intervention.''
 Captain Camara reacted angrily to these statements, telling reporters Monday that ''Guinea is not a subprefecture, is not a neighborhood in France.'' 
 The Economic Community of West African States, an alliance of West African nations, on Monday sent the president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, as a mediator between Captain Camara and the opposition. Diplomats and opposition figures here are skeptical, however, about Mr. Compaore's chances, as the opposition has insisted on a condition Captain Camara has not been willing to concede: that he not run for president. 
 American diplomats have previously refused to meet with Captain Camara. The special circumstances of last week's massacre, however, dictated a meeting, diplomats suggested, and added urgency to their previous insistence that he not run. 
 ''He's a president in a bubble,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''I don't think his advisers are telling him the truth about his popularity and his standing in the world.''
 Captain Camara, known for a somewhat disjointed speaking style that is often hard to penetrate, nonetheless ''was lucid,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. 
 ''There was no evidence of drinking or drug-taking,'' he said. 
 ''In America's view, Moussa Dadis Camara can't be president, and we are going to hold him to that,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. 
 He acknowledged that ''America's leverage is not as strong here as it is in many parts of Africa,'' but he said that sanctions, a visa ban and an asset freeze were all possibilities. 
 ''I did say that he was becoming a pariah among world leaders, and that he had to think long and hard about possibly running for president, because the international community would not accept him as a leader,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said.

HEADLINE: Obama, Democrat in Chief, Isn't Much Help to Party in Mayor's Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
To bolster Democratic prospects, President Obama has tried to elbow New York's governor, David A. Paterson, out of next year's race, and has thrown his weight behind New Jersey's governor, Jon S. Corzine, in next month's election.
 Then there is the mayoral race in New York City.
 Here, the president has all but ignored the Democrat running on a message of change and embraced the incumbent running on the Republican ballot on Nov. 3.
 Confused? 
 So is William C. Thompson Jr., the Democratic nominee for mayor this fall. 
 Since Mr. Obama's election, Mr. Thompson, the city's comptroller, has found his attempts to piggyback on Mr. Obama's popularity drowned out by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has tethered himself to the president.
 Mr. Bloomberg has met with the president four times since his inauguration, held public events with four of his cabinet members, and heaped praise on the new administration at every turn, no matter how mundane the occasion. 
 ''Superb move,'' Mr. Bloomberg declared in a press release after Mr. Obama created the job of chief performance officer at the White House. 
 On Tuesday, he accepted the endorsement of a close Obama ally, John D. Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama's transition team last fall.
 The mayor's courtship of the president and his allies has deprived Mr. Thompson of a natural advantage in an election in which he enjoys painfully few of them. He trails Mr. Bloomberg in name recognition, money, endorsements and, now, love from the nation's top Democrat. 
 After meeting with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office recently to discuss education, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire former media mogul, said he and the president ''have a lot in common.'' 
 Mr. Thompson begs to differ. ''The mayor thinks that if he stands close enough to Obama, people will mistake him for the president,'' he said. ''That's not going to happen, trust me.''
 At stake, for Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Thompson, is much more than photo ops and bragging rights. Support from the popular president could transform what now seems to be a lopsided race, giving Mr. Thompson a needed boost in the polls or further solidifying Mr. Bloomberg's commanding lead. 
 There may be little upside for Mr. Obama to weigh in on a local race whose outcome would have little bearing on his agenda in Washington, and choosing the losing candidate would diminish his standing a year before crucial midterm elections. But the White House has left the door open, saying that the president would not rule out an endorsement in the New York mayor's race. 
 So both candidates are quietly -- or not so quietly -- jockeying for the president's blessing. Mr. Thompson's campaign manager traveled to Washington a few months ago to meet with a senior White House official and make the case for a presidential endorsement.
 At first blush, Mr. Thompson seems like the obvious choice. The president and the comptroller share party affiliation, race and a political pedigree. (Mr. Obama rose through Chicago's Democratic machine; Mr. Thompson marched through New York's.)
 Early in the presidential campaign, Mr. Bloomberg privately complained that Mr. Obama was ''inexperienced at running things'' and ''too willing to make political compromises,'' according to a new biography of the mayor, ''Mike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics'' (PublicAffairs, 2009), by Joyce Purnick, a former Metro Matters columnist and metropolitan editor for The New York Times. 
 Even when it became clear Mr. Obama would prevail, Mr. Bloomberg refused to endorse him, and he repeatedly praised his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, a personal friend.
 Mr. Thompson, by contrast, the city's first black comptroller, eagerly endorsed Mr. Obama and briefly volunteered for him in Pennsylvania. ''Billy has a natural lineage to an Obama-like candidacy,'' said Al Sharpton, who is close to both Mr. Obama and Mr. Thompson. ''But,'' he added, ''the mayor has a much bigger megaphone to broadcast his relationship with the president, which makes it seem bigger than it probably is.''
 That handicap has been on vivid display on the campaign trail, where Mr. Thompson describes waiting in line for two hours to vote for Mr. Obama, an experience he says helped motivate him to run for mayor.
 At a union hall a few months ago, the story brought the mostly black audience to its feet. ''There is a man who sits in Washington -- his name is Barack Obama -- because of people like you!'' he thundered. ''In New York City, we can do the same thing!''
 ''Yes we can!'' the workers shouted.
 Unfortunately for Mr. Thompson, nobody outside the room heard it. But here's what 300,000 people did hear: that Mr. Bloomberg had endorsed Mr. Obama's health care plan. 
 Only a handful of people attended the press conference in Washington where Mr. Bloomberg announced it. But the mayor's campaign paid for automated calls to 300,000 numbers to spread the word. ''Like President Obama, Mayor Bloomberg says it's time to put politics aside,'' said the voice of a campaign worker on the recording. 
 Soon after, the mayor's campaign mailed out a brochure quoting Arne Duncan, Mr. Obama's secretary of education, praising New York City's public schools for making ''real progress'' under Mr. Bloomberg. 
 Of course, publicity alone does not explain the mayor's close ties to the Obama White House. The White House, at times, seeks Mr. Bloomberg's support on issues like health care reform because of his stature and influence on Wall Street. 
 What's more aides to both men said they are, in many ways, kindred spirits, focused on postpartisan politics (in theory, if not always in practice), public health and environmental sustainability.
 Indeed, the president has called Mr. Bloomberg an ''outstanding mayor.'' 
 Cory A. Booker, Newark's mayor, said Mr. Bloomberg's success was indisputable, even to Democrats, who would like to take back control of City Hall. ''At some point, you have to stop looking at party and start looking at progress,'' he said as he ticked off Mr. Bloomberg's accomplishments.
 Still, White House aides said they have been taken aback by the onslaught of attention from the Bloomberg administration. One adviser said the president's office had been bombarded with requests by Mr. Bloomberg's office for joint press conferences and meetings. ''For every one thing we do with them, we turned down five of them,'' said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending the mayor. The White House would welcome similar overtures from Mr. Thompson. But so far, they have been limited at best. ''There will be opportunities to do things with the White House,'' Mr. Thompson said in an interview. 
 His supporters are wagering that voters will look past White House meetings and presidential name-dropping when casting a ballot in the mayor's race. 
 ''In this race, Bill is the antiestablishment candidate who represents change,'' said David Pollak, who ran Mr. Obama's campaign in New York. ''Mr. Bloomberg is the status quo candidate.''
 Inside the union hall where Mr. Thompson spoke, Marissa Green, a city employee, said she saw parallels between Mr. Thompson and Mr. Obama. 
 ''They are both about change,'' she said. And, she added, ''Nobody thought Barack Obama would ever be president, did they?''

HEADLINE: Building a Company on Government Contracts

BYLINE: By SHARON McLOONE

 BODY:
In 1995, Sharon Brown and her husband, Daryck, founded Environmental and Occupational Safety Services at their kitchen table. The company, which retrains workers in the fields of environmental engineering and cleanup, started to grow by winning contracts from the state of New Jersey and later branched out to do work for the federal government as well. It now has offices in Red Bank, N.J., and in Washington, and has fluctuated between five and 15 employees depending on work flow. The company's revenue topped $500,000 in 2008 and could go as high as $700,000 in 2009. It just won a $500,000 contract from the U.S. Air force to redesign safety equipment..
 Ms. Brown spoke recently about the challenges of being a government contractor (you can read a small-business guide to government contracting here). A condensed version of their conversation follows. 
 Q.Why did you decide to start your own firm?
 A. My husband and I are both engineers. We met at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and we were both working for large corporations before we started E.O.S.S. in 1995. It was a calculated risk to start a firm but I knew I had skills that were marketable and could get another job.
 Daryck stayed with his full-time job until recently. We made that decision because we knew that our medical benefits were very important to us, and we couldn't afford the kind of coverage we had at the big firms as small-business owners. 
 I remember my boss said: ''You're going to be back. You have a new Volvo and a new baby.'' I remember having kind of a sick feeling as I walked out of my comfortable job. ...My former employer is now a client.
 Q.When you started your business, you did work for the state but didn't consider bidding on a federal contract. Why?
 A. I thought a federal contract was beyond us because of our size, but then I did some research. We were eligible to qualify for the HUBZone program because at the time the firm was located in Asbury, N.J. The program helps underprivileged areas develop their economic base.
 We also qualified for the 8(a) program. [To qualify, a company must be owned and controlled at least 51 percent by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The business owner must have a net worth of less than $250,000, excluding the value of the business and personal residence.]
 Q.Which program was more valuable to you?
 A. They all have benefits. Through the 8(a) program I was able to receive training at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business in 2004. It was paid for by the Small Business Administration. I left the class empowered and came back and won a $2.3 million contract with the Navy. Sometimes it takes a stranger to pump you up. I have a master's degree in engineering management, but the additional training was helpful. I still have very close friends from that and won some work at a Marine Corps base in California from my relationships there.
 We also just got our veteran-owned certification. I was in the Naval Reserve for almost 15 years, although I was never active duty. My husband was in Desert Storm but since I own 51 percent of the company, the certification really depends on me. The Veterans Administration buys differently than other government agencies, but it buys everything from hospital gowns to paper cups. At the V.A., a veteran-owned business gets preference over an 8(a) firm. They give service-disabled vets the highest preference. There are a lot of people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and with the employment situation not so great, starting a business isn't a bad idea.
 Q.What do other entrepreneurs need to know about getting into government contracting?
 A. If you don't deliver, you cannot conduct business with the government. A lot of people think the government gives slackers contracts. They don't. Past performance is key. You also should know that you have to please the technical and contract people because they will make or break you.
 Q.What mistakes have you made?
 A. The biggest mistake was thinking that the 8(a) program was going to be the be-all-end-all to securing work. ... The real truth is that sometimes people who are competing for a contract think they have a leg up because of gender or race, but the real deal is if you can't do the work, you're not getting it. Always make sure that your work is undisputable.
 Q.Did you ever fear the company wasn't going to make it?
 A. I worried after our first Navy contract ended. I thought we weren't going to get anything of substance. We had been marketing to the Navy for over a decade and finally we partnered with another firm that was already working with the Navy and we got the contract. I was glad but frustrated because I felt we should have been able to get in much earlier.
 Sometimes I felt like getting into federal contracting was a different world for me, and I felt the sense of, ''Who's this black girl trying to come in here and get work?'' But if you have to prove yourself by doing 150 percent, we worked 160 percent.

HEADLINE: Irving Penn, Fashion Photographer, Is Dead at 92

BYLINE: By ANDY GRUNDBERG

 BODY:
Irving Penn, one of the 20th century's most prolific and influential photographers of fashion and the famous, whose signature blend of classical elegance and cool minimalism was recognizable to magazine readers and museumgoers worldwide, died Wednesday morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 92. 
 His death was announced by Peter MacGill, his friend and representative.
 Mr. Penn's talent for picturing his subjects with compositional clarity and economy earned him the widespread admiration of readers of Vogue during his long association with the magazine, beginning in 1943. It also brought him recognition in the art world; his photographs have been exhibited in museums and galleries and are prized by collectors. 
 His long career at Vogue spanned a number of radical transformations in fashion and its depiction, but his style remained remarkably constant. Imbued with calm and decorum, his photographs often seemed intent on defying fashion. His models and portrait subjects were never seen leaping or running or turning themselves into blurs. Even the rough-and-ready members of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang, photographed in San Francisco in 1967, were transformed within the quieting frame of his studio camera into the graphic equivalent of a Greek frieze. 
 Instead of spontaneity, Mr. Penn provided the illusion of a seance, his gaze precisely describing the profile of a Balenciaga coat or of a Moroccan jalaba in a way that could almost mesmerize the viewer. Nothing escaped the edges of his photographs unless he commanded it. Except for a series of close-up portraits that cut his subjects' heads off at the forehead, and another, stranger suite of overripe nudes, his subjects were usually shown whole, apparently enjoying a splendid isolation from the real world.
 He was probably most famous for photographing Parisian fashion models and the world's great cultural figures, but he seemed equally at home photographing Peruvian peasants or bunion pads. Merry Foresta, co-organizer of a 1990 retrospective of his work at the National Museum of American Art, wrote that his pictures exhibited ''the control of an art director fused with the process of an artist.''
 A courtly man whose gentle demeanor masked an intense perfectionism, Mr. Penn adopted the pose of a humble craftsman while helping to shape a field known for putting on airs. Although schooled in painting and design, he chose to define himself as a photographer, scraping his early canvases of paint so that they might serve a more useful life as backdrops to his pictures.
 He was also a refined conversationalist and a devoted husband and friend. His marriage to Lisa Fonssagrives, a beautiful model, artist and his sometime collaborator, lasted 42 years, ending with her death at the age of 80 in 1992. Mr. Penn's photographs of Ms. Fonssagrives not only captured a slim woman of lofty sophistication and radiant good health; they also set the esthetic standard for the elegant fashion photography of the 1940s and '50s. 
 Ms. Fonssagrives became a sculptor after her modeling career ended. In 1994, Mr. Penn and their son, Tom, a metal designer, arranged the printing of a book that reproduced his wife's sculpture, prints and drawings. In addition to his son, Mr. Penn is survived by his stepdaughter, Mia Fonssagrives Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer; his younger brother, Arthur, the well-known director of such films as ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' and eight grandchildren.
 Mr. Penn had the good fortune of working for and collaborating with two of the 20th century's most inventive and influential magazine art directors, Alexey Brodovitch and Alexander Liberman. He studied with Mr. Brodovitch in Philadelphia as a young man and came to New York in 1937 as his unpaid design assistant at Harper's Bazaar, the most provocative fashion magazine of the day. But it was under Mr. Liberman, at Vogue, that Mr. Penn forged his career as a photographer.
 In the book ''Irving Penn: Passage'' (1991), a compilation of the photographer's career, Mr. Liberman wrote of meeting Mr. Penn for the first time in 1941: ''Here was a young American who seemed unspoiled by European mannerisms or culture. I remember he wore sneakers and no tie. I was struck by his directness and a curious unworldliness, a clarity of purpose, and a freedom of decision. What I call Penn's American instincts made him go for the essentials.''
 Irving Penn was also a consummate technician, known equally for the immaculate descriptive quality of his still-life arrangements of cosmetics and other consumer goods and for his masterly exploration of photographic materials. Not content with the conventions of the darkroom or with the standard appearance of commercial prints, he was willing to experiment. He resorted to bleaching the prints of his nudes series, eliminating skin tones and making female flesh appear harsh and unforgiving but nonetheless sexually charged. 
 At the height of the cultural convulsions of the 1960s Mr. Penn taught himself to print his own pictures using a turn-of-the-century process that relies on platinum instead of more conventional silver. The process produces beautiful, velvety tones in the image and is among the most permanent of photographic processes, although it requires time-consuming preparation and precise control in the darkroom.
 Over the next 30 years Mr. Penn labored to print all his new work, as well as to reprint much of his earlier work, using this platinum process, which requires that a photographer mix a recipe of exotic chemicals and then hand-coat them onto a sheet of drawing paper. Mr. Penn, who almost single-handedly brought the process back into popularity among photographic artists, perfected a method of coating the paper with multiple layers of metallic salts, greatly increasing the depth and luminosity of the final print.
 Mr. Penn's concern with the longevity of his prints was one aspect of an enduring career. Not only was he the photographer with the longest tenure in the history of Conde Nast, which publishes Vogue; he also created timeless images of fashion and celebrity, two arenas characterized by constant change. At the same time, he took pains to acknowledge mortality and decay in his photographs, focusing his more personal work on cigarette butts, sidewalk detritus and, while in his 70s, on the skulls of wild animals.
 In his catalog essay for a 1984 retrospective of Mr. Penn's work at the Museum of Modern Art, John Szarkowski, then the museum's director of photography, wrote, ''The grace, wit, and inventiveness of his pattern-making, the lively and surprising elegance of his line, and his sensitivity to the character, the idiosyncratic humors, of light make Penn's pictures, even the slighter ones, a pleasure for our eyes.''
 Irving Penn was born June 16, 1917, in Plainfield, N. J. His father, Harry, was a watchmaker and his mother, Sonia, a nurse. As a student at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art, later to be known as the Philadelphia College of Art (and now the University of the Arts), from 1934 to 1938, Mr. Penn studied drawing, painting and graphic and industrial design. His most influential teacher was the designer Alexey Brodovitch, a Russian emigre by way of Paris who was familiar with vanguard developments in European art and design.
 Although Mr. Brodovitch worked in New York City for Harper's Bazaar, he traveled to Philadelphia on Saturdays to meet with his students and to evaluate their work. Mr. Penn's graphic talent impressed Mr. Brodovitch, and he chose him to be his unpaid assistant at Bazaar during the summers of 1937 and 1938.
 After finishing school and moving to New York, Mr. Penn worked as a free-lance designer and illustrator for Bazaar and other clients. He also bought a camera and began to photograph storefronts and signs he saw in Manhattan. In 1940 he inherited Mr. Brodovitch's position as director of advertising design for the Saks Fifth Avenue department store, but within a year he decided to travel to Mexico and attempt a career as a painter.
 Before leaving for Mexico Mr. Penn, at Mr. Brodovitch's suggestion, offered his position at Saks to another Russian emigre designer, Alexander Liberman. Mr. Liberman declined, but by the time Mr. Penn returned to New York in 1943, with his canvases scraped totally clean, Mr. Liberman was the art director of Vogue, and he returned the younger man's favor by offering Mr. Penn a job as his assistant.
 Mr. Penn's first assignment was to supervise the design of Vogue's covers, and he obliged by sketching out several possible photographic scenes. Unable to interest any of the staff photographers in taking them, he took to the photo studio himself, at Mr. Liberman's suggestion. The first result of this opportunity was a color still-life photograph of a glove, belt and pocketbook, which was published as the cover of Vogue's Oct. 1, 1943, issue. Mr. Penn's photographs would appear on more than 150 Vogue covers over the next 50 years.
 During World War II, Mr. Penn joined the American Field Service and drove an ambulance in Italy, where he got a taste of European culture. Arriving in Rome in 1944, he spied the artist Giorgio de Chirico carrying a shopping bag of vegetables home from the market.
 ''I rushed up and embraced him,'' Mr. Penn recalled in ''Passage,'' the 1991 compilation of his life's work. ''To me he was the heroic de Chirico; to him I was a total stranger, probably demented. Still, he was moved and said, come home and have lunch with us. For two days he showed me his Rome.'' 
 During those two days Mr. Penn made his first black-and-white portraits, beginning what would become a celebrated archive of the leading artists, writers and performers of the second half of the 20th century.
 Returning to Vogue in 1946 as a staff photographer, Mr. Penn went on to fill the magazine's pages with portraits of cultural figures like Edmund Wilson and W. H. Auden, still lifes of accessories and graphic fashion photographs. His 1947 image ''Twelve of the Most Photographed Models of the Period,'' a group portrait, includes, at its center, Lisa Fonssagrives.
 Ms. Fonssagrives would later appear in some of Mr. Penn's most memorable fashion images, among them ''Rochas 'Mermaid Dress,' Paris'' and ''Woman with Roses, Paris,'' both taken in 1950, the year she became his wife.
 Those pictures were made during Mr. Penn's first assignment to photograph the Paris collections for Vogue. Using a discarded theater curtain for a backdrop and a borrowed studio filled with daylight, he choreographed some of the most spare and delicate fashion photographs yet produced, treating the clothes less as dresses to be worn than as shapes to be perceived in silhouette.
 Unlike Richard Avedon, the other important new fashion photographer of the postwar period, Mr. Penn expressed himself and his subjects best through a Shaker-style restraint. In 1948, for example, he began to pose his portrait subjects by wedging them between two plain walls that met in a sharply angled vee, a scene offset only by a scrap of fraying carpet, on which subjects as prominent as Spencer Tracy, Joe Louis and the Duchess of Windsor stood, crouched or leaned.
 The same year, while on assignment for Vogue in Peru, Mr. Penn ventured on his own to Cuzco and photographed the exotically dressed families who lived in the mountainous countryside, presenting them nonjudgmentally.
 Two decades later he expanded on these portraits during trips to Dahomey (now called Benin), to Morocco, to New Guinea and elsewhere, using a portable studio to provide a textured but seamless background. The pictures, in color as well as black and white, were featured annually in Vogue. In 1974 they were published in a book, ''Worlds in a Small Room,'' which seemed to emphasize the perseverance of cultural diversity.
 Mr. Penn was also capable of making Western culture seem strange and fascinating. In the early 1950s he made a series of portraits of small tradesmen (''Petit Metiers,'' in French) working in Paris, London and New York. Again relying on his spare studio to separate his subjects from their surroundings, he nevertheless insisted that the tradesmen wear the clothes and tools of their work: two pastry chiefs in white aprons and toches hold rolling pins; a fishmonger carries a fish in one hand and a rag in the other. 
 In 1949 and 1950, Mr. Penn produced images of female nudes as a personal project, using fleshy artists' models and focusing exclusively on their torsos. In the process of printing he attacked the light-sensitive paper with bleach and other chemicals to remove most of the skin tones, creating a rough chiaroscuro effect antithetical to then-prevailing notions of corporeal beauty. These unsettling pictures were not exhibited or published until 30 years later, in 1980, when the Marlborough Gallery mounted a show called ''Earthly Bodies.'' The critic Rosalind Krauss, writing in the catalog, called the nudes ''a kind of privately launched and personally experienced kamikaze attack on his own public identity as a photographer of fashion.''
 The quest to undercut fashion's standards of perfection, and to find beauty in the disdained, overlooked or overripe, runs throughout Mr. Penn's career. In an otherwise pristine still life of food, he included a house fly, and in a 1959 close-up, he placed a beetle in a model's ear. From 1967 to 1973 he produced color essays of flowers, published each year in Vogue's Christmas issue; in each case the blooms are past their prime, their leaves wilted, tinged with brown and falling.
 Mr. Penn acquired a reputation for perfectionism at all costs. In the book ''Passage,'' Mr. Liberman recounts that when Mr. Penn was asked to take a picture of glasses falling from a serving tray, the photographer insisted that for authenticity's sake Baccarat crystal be used. The art director ruefully remembered that several dozens of the glasses were shattered before the photograph was made to Mr. Penn's standard.
 In the mid-1960s, just as Mr. Penn began to be consumed by his experiments with platinum printing, fashion and fashion photography switched gears decisively. Neither his style nor his manner matched the era's spirit of sexual liberation and spontaneous, sometimes drug-assisted creativity. The public image of a fashion photographer came to be exemplified by the anything-goes protagonist of Michelangelo Antonioni's film ''Blow Up,'' played by David Hemming. 
 Mr. Penn observed the rebelliousness of the '60s with a curious eye, even taking an assignment from Look magazine to photograph the ''summer of love'' scene in San Francisco. But his stylistic confidence seemed to falter when it came to portraying the minimally structured garments and ultra-thin models of the time. His photograph of the model Marisa Berenson, wearing a breast-plate-size peace sign and little else, suggests the photographer's ambivalence about an era in which no clothes often seemed the preferable fashion. Not surprisingly, he concentrated on producing photographs intended to be viewed as art.
 In 1975, the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a small exhibition of his recent work printed using the platinum process: a series of greatly magnified images of cigarette butts. Transformed from gutter discards to iconic status, the mashed and bent cylinders again showed Mr. Penn's penchant for straying far from the politesse of his fashion and portrait pictures. The cigarette butts were followed by a series focused on other forms of sidewalk debris, including flattened paper cups, deli containers and rags; these photographs, presented in platinum, were exhibited by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1977 in a show called ''Street Material.''
 As a result of the two museum exhibitions, Mr. Penn's work played a significant role in the rise of photography's fortunes in the art world. In the late 1970s and early 1980s his pictures were exhibited several times at the Marlborough Gallery in New York. In 1984 a 160-print traveling retrospective of his career was organized by Szarkowski. Since 1987 his pictures have been exhibited on a regular basis at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, which now represents his work. 
 Passing the age of 65 without a thought of retirement, Mr. Penn devoted himself increasingly to still-lifes, on assignments for Vogue and for advertising clients like Clinique cosmetics, and in photographs for exhibition. On his own time he constructed arrangements of bones, steel blocks and bleached animal skulls. These table-top compositions recall Dutch vanitas still-lifes as well as Giorgio Morandi paintings. At the same time, Mr. Penn produced several memorable portraits for Vogue of older artists of his own generation, like Willem de Kooning, Isamu Noguchi and Italo Calvino, and began contributing portraits to the fledgling Conde Nast magazine Vanity Fair. In 1985 he began to draw and paint again, after a hiatus of 43 years. 
 A collection of many of his most important images, in a variety of genres, was acquired jointly by the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of American Art in 1990; the museums, both branches of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, also mounted an exhibition of the collection titled ''Irving Penn: Master Images.'' In its first foray into modern photography, the Morgan Library & Museum in New York acquired 67 of Penn's portraits in 2007 and exhibited them last year. Another major show opened in September at the J. Paul Getty Museum of Los Angeles.
 In 1996 Mr. Penn donated the bulk of his archives and 130 of his prints to the Chicago Art Institute. An exhibition of these prints, ''Irving Penn: A Career in Photography,'' organized by Colin Westerbeck, opened at the Art Institute the following year and subsequently toured the country. In 2005 the National Gallery in Washington mounted a smaller retrospective of Penn's career that consisted entirely of his platinum prints.
 The critic Richard Woodward, writing in 1990, argued that Mr. Penn would be best remembered for the work he did for the museum wall, not the printed page. ''The steely unity of Irving Penn's career, the severity and constructed rigor of his work can best be appreciated when he seems to break away from the dictates of fashion for magazines,'' he wrote. ''Only then is it clear how everything he photographs -- or, at least, prints -- is the product of a remarkably undivided conscience. There are no breaks; only different subjects.''

HEADLINE: Gourmet to All That

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER KIMBALL. 
Christopher Kimball is the publisher of Cook's Illustrated magazine.

 BODY:
THE precursor to Gourmet, and the first truly successful American food publication, was founded in the 1890s and titled The Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics. It eventually changed its name to American Cookery and then died in 1947, forced under, in part, by the founding of Gourmet in 1941 by Earle MacAusland, who had patterned his new brainchild on the catalog-magazine of a famed Boston food purveyor, S. S. Pierce. It was the end of domestic science and food economy and the beginning of the era of the gourmet, ''the honest seeker of the summum bonum of living'' as set forth in the charter issue. MacAusland's recipes made few accommodations to reality; he even suggested that subscribers save the issues and use the recipes once rationing had ended. 
 Now, 68 years after its founding, Gourmet has followed American Cookery, ending a long and masterful turn at the helm of the food publishing world. This, hard on the heels of the death of Julia Child in 2004, makes one tremulous about the future. Is American magazine publishing on the verge of being devoured by the democratic economics of the Internet? Has the media industry fully become an everyman's playing field, without the need for credentials or paid membership? Or, to ask the questions that every media executive is really whispering, ''Will I have a job next year?''
 My first experience with Gourmet was a head-on collision. In 1990, 10 years after I had founded Cook's Magazine, Conde Nast purchased Cook's and then immediately shut it down, Gourmet swallowing up our subscribers. It was the triumph of the American magazine model, one driven by lifestyle rather than nuts and bolts, and floated by the billions of advertising dollars that poured through a narrow spigot into the magazine industry, controlled by a select few, the chauffeured, hard-charging publishers of New York's powerhouse magazine corporations. It was a top-down, winner-take-all proposition, an oligarchy of sorts, a business with a huge barrier to entry and no welcome mat for the upstart entrepreneur. In a serendipitous turnabout 19 years later, Cook's is today alive and well (I restarted the magazine in 1993) and Gourmet has foundered. The difference? We abandoned advertising in 1993 for a 100-percent subscriber-financed model, including a thriving paid Web site. 
 Yet the media world was not without charm, as I learned in 1985 during my first meeting with S.I. Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast. (Mr. Newhouse had just purchased The New Yorker, a magazine that already owned a controlling share in my Cook's Magazine.) It was 7 a.m., his favored meeting hour, and I discovered him shoeless, stuffed into a baggy gray sweater, and shuffling about, half-swallowing his words in a manner that spoke of humility and intellect, rather than New York arrogance. Here was a guy, I thought, who really loves the magazine business. He poured his fortune into his magazine properties and his editors, even when the prospect of return seemed dim. His was a world of philanthropic publishing.
 Gourmet, then, was not just a piece of editorial flummery; it represented the hopes and dreams of its owner, a respect for those who had earned the chops, as it were, who had a lifetime of good breeding and experience in order to stand at the cultural helm. One is reminded of M. F. K. Fisher's ''Alphabet for Gourmets,'' published in 1949; the noted epicure Samuel Chamberlain, one of the magazine's first stars; or culinary luminaries like James Beard, who was a frequent contributor. Both the economic and editorial models were in sync; advertisers had to pay premium prices to join the club and editors, like Ruth Reichl, had to become stand-alone cultural icons, not mere backroom scribes. 
 The shuttering of Gourmet reminds us that in a click-or-die advertising marketplace, one ruled by a million instant pundits, where an anonymous Twitter comment might be seen to pack more resonance and useful content than an article that reflects a lifetime of experience, experts are not created from the top down but from the bottom up. They can no longer be coronated; their voices have to be deemed essential to the lives of their customers. That leaves, I think, little room for the thoughtful, considered editorial with which Gourmet delighted its readers for almost seven decades. 
 To survive, those of us who believe that inexperience rarely leads to wisdom need to swim against the tide, better define our brands, prove our worth, ask to be paid for what we do, and refuse to climb aboard this ship of fools, the one where everyone has an equal voice. Google ''broccoli casserole'' and make the first recipe you find. I guarantee it will be disappointing. The world needs fewer opinions and more thoughtful expertise -- the kind that comes from real experience, the hard-won blood-on-the-floor kind. I like my reporters, my pilots, my pundits, my doctors, my teachers and my cooking instructors to have graduated from the school of hard knocks. 
 Julia Child, one of my Boston neighbors, epitomized this old-school notion of apprenticeship. As her dinner companion one evening, I watched as she became frustrated by the restaurant's dim lighting, grabbed a huge watchman's flashlight from her pendulous satchel and proceeded to illuminate her main course. She wanted to investigate her food before eating it, the waiter's recommendations notwithstanding. This act of spontaneous journalism evolved from a lifetime love of education and reverence for true expertise. Her first question upon meeting a young chef was always, ''And where did you train, dear?''

HEADLINE: Revisiting Entrepreneurs Who Ride the Economic Waves

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
J. ROBERT HILLIER has been doing deals all his life, and whenever one falls short of his hopes, he always seems to have plenty of others to keep him busy.
 In June 2007, Mr. Hillier announced the $30 million merger of his Princeton, N.J., architectural firm with a Scottish conglomerate, RMJM, and shifted his entrepreneurial zeal to a Web site called Obit.
 The content would be an eclectic mix of obituaries, essays, cartoons and profiles of active oldsters, he said at the time. He predicted the venture ''could become very big.'' 
 I recently asked Mr. Hillier, 72 years old, how things were going. Great, he said. He reminded me that the timing of the sale of his firm was ''perfect,'' coming just before the economic collapse. He went on to say that in January, he bought Princeton Magazine, which was being published in another county. He relocated the magazine to Princeton, he said, redesigned it, upgraded the content and has already increased advertising revenue by 40 percent. He predicted that circulation, now 34,000, would grow to 50,000 within five years.
 ''It has been a home run,'' Mr. Hillier said.
 Furthermore, he said, he left RMJM in July and started a design and development real estate venture called J. Robert Hillier. ''I decided to brand myself,'' he said. In its first six weeks, it has landed 12 projects.
 But what about Obit? It's doing ''O.K.,'' he said. It has won four Webby Awards, and the number of ''hits'' has risen to more than 100,000 a month. ''But the topic of death is still a hurdle for a lot of readers,'' he said. Winning over advertisers is not easy, either.
 Never mind all that. Mr. Hillier says he is also the majority owner of Princeton's 13,000-circulation free weekly community newspaper, Town Topics. He describes it as a ''gold mine,'' with a return of 26 percent in an ugly environment for most publications. And he teaches an architecture seminar at Princeton University.
 ''It's all about having fun,'' he said.
 So it is for us all. Writing this column for 2 1/2 years has been a great ride for me that ends in December. To say farewell, I decided to return to some of the entrepreneurs I have profiled to ask how their businesses have fared, and to tell their stories in a three-part series.
 A recurring theme (no surprise here) was their struggle to make headway in the recession. Yet, while some are treading water or have thrown in the towel, others, like Mr. Hillier, have prospered -- in some cases, not in spite of but because of the recession.
 David Goldin, owner of AmeriMerchant, a New York financial services company whose successful legal battle with a rival was detailed here in August 2007, says that while his firm has been caught up in the economic turmoil, he expects it to emerge stronger than ever.
 Earlier in this decade, Mr. Goldin, 37, spent thousands of hours gathering evidence to show that AmeriMerchant, which advances cash to merchants in return for a portion of their future credit card receipts, did not violate a patent held by a Georgia company called AdvanceMe on its method of doing business.
 After an appeal by AdvanceMe was rejected last year by a federal court, he said, calls from private equity firms, hedge funds and other potential investors picked up markedly. But when the financial crisis deepened, his phones went silent.
 To cope, Mr. Goldin persuaded lenders to maintain his credit lines while he cut costs, sharply reduced the bad debt on his books and switched his target from customers dependent on the housing industry to businesses that do well in recessions, like fast-food restaurants. He says his efforts have paid off: as other companies in his sector have failed, AmeriMerchant remains profitable, its staff is growing and revenue is gaining, he says.
 ''We believe many of our competitors waited too long to adjust and are too deep in bad debt to ever pull out,'' he said.
 Despite his optimism, Mr. Goldin says he sometimes wonders whether his choice of advancing unsecured working capital to small businesses was the right entrepreneurial choice. ''Maybe I should have my head checked,'' he said.
 Richard Enos, the 33-year-old co-founder of StudyPoint in Boston, says the recession has taught him more lessons about business in 18 months than he had learned in the previous eight years.
 In November 2007, Mr. Enos told me he wanted to ''build the nation's most successful private in-home tutoring services company.'' He was on a hiring binge. He projected a 66 percent growth in revenue the following year, and he had plans to increase StudyPoint's presence in other cities.
 He missed most of the targets, but he says he has not abandoned his goal.
 And today, things are looking up. Revenue, which declined in 2007 and 2008, now looks likely to grow by 25 percent this year, to $5.2 million. The company has moved into the black after two years of losses. He is hiring again and his staff, which had shrunk through attrition, is back to where it was two years ago, at 32. The company has expanded into 23 cities, from 10 in late 2007.
 Mr. Enos's strategy for maneuvering through hard times, he says, was to discard ancillary activities like teaching in schools and stick to his core business. He also credits his no-layoffs policy with raising morale and productivity. ''Every major company in our industry was letting people go except us,'' he said. 
 Ruth Deming, who appeared in this column in April 2008 with the lament that her New Directions Support Group in Philadelphia for victims of depression and bipolar disorder was so cash-poor it was turning her into a ''penniless do-gooder,'' has also weathered the recession.
 In addition to increasing rates to participants for attending meetings to $5, from $3, New Directions has been successful at winning grants, Ms. Deming, 63, said. Last month alone, it received $15,000 from the Patricia Kind Family Foundation and $3,500 from her county's health department. It also obtained a $2,500 gift to keep its twice-yearly magazine, The Compass, alive.''We're still going strong,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Global Economic Crisis Rescues European Bank

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
As recently as last year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development seemed like a relic of the post-cold war era. One of the nations providing the bank's financial backing, Australia, asked for its money back, while one of the new European Union members, the Czech Republic, became the first country to leave its lending programs.
 But the bank, which helped shepherd Soviet-bloc eastern European command economies into the free-market era, has found a renewed sense of purpose in stabilizing these economies and protecting their hard-won progress. 
 The instability of the region, even amid a general nascent rebound, was highlighted Wednesday when an auction of Latvian treasury bills failed to attract any bidders. The failed auction increased the likelihood that Latvia would have to devalue its currency and roiled currency and financial markets. 
 It is just the latest in Eastern European woes.
 The breakneck growth of recent years turned out to be unsustainable, relying too heavily on capital flows from abroad that have dried up.
 As a result, 2009 has been one of the busiest years in the history of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Now, it is seeking an increase in financing to help combat the effects of the global crisis on the region, which has crushing debt denominated in other currencies, like euros, Swiss francs and Swedish kronor. 
 (As fears grew that Latvia would devalue its currency, the kronor fell, for instance.)
 The bank injected money into financial institutions lending in the region. In May it said that it would pump $578 million into Eastern European subsidiaries of the Italian bank UniCredit, the largest banking group in the region.
 In a letter to member countries, including the United States, last month, President Thomas Mirow asked for an additional $14.6 billion to offset the flight of private capital that has made the region one of the world's most vulnerable to the recent economic turmoil. 
 Bank experts predict that economies across the territory spanning the former Soviet Union and former Warsaw Pact will contract an average of 6 percent in 2009.
 ''It would be premature to say that a general turnaround has begun,'' Mr. Mirow said in the letter. 
 In the former Communist states, the fear is that economic problems will be followed by political and social instability. ''Setbacks in transition have generally been limited, but some of the tenets of free-market reform will now be under scrutiny,'' Mr. Mirow said.
 Indeed, government leaders have fallen this year in Hungary, Latvia and most recently Romania. Though last week's collapse of the Romanian governing coalition had more to do with politics than economics, the country is mired in recession and, like the other two, was forced to accept a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
 The region now finds itself in the early stages of what could be a recovery, or an intermission before a renewed downturn. ''Despite the fact that the days of panic are over, we're not completely out of the woods,'' said Marcello Zanardo, a Central and Eastern Europe banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Wood in London.
 Mr. Zanardo said that he expected to see the value of nonperforming loans rising ''well into 2010,'' and that the region was vulnerable to a renewed slowdown in the global economy, the so-called double-dip recession.
 So far, Poland has been the exception, managing to avoid recession, and the government expects growth of around 1 percent in 2009. Meanwhile in Hungary, the International Monetary Fund forecasts a contraction of 6.7 percent, with some economists estimating even worse.
 The fund estimates that the Latvian economy could end up contracting by 18 percent this year. And Ukraine, also politically troubled and outside the European Union, will most likely drop 14 percent.
 Bank officials hope that, shortly before the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, countries like the United States, France and Germany will prove ready to help Europe's young democracies even in the face of their own needs at home and the rising deficits exacerbated by stimulus spending.
 Founded in 1991, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had a clear mission in its early days. The economies emerging from behind the Iron Curtain were hobbled by central planning, and the bank said its job was to ''foster the transition towards open market-oriented economies.''
 Josue Tanaka, now a corporate director, was in the first group of employees to join the bank, before they had computers or even tables at their London headquarters. ''We opened a map and it was, literally, 'What do we do first?' '' Mr. Tanaka recalled.
 Olivier Descamps, who joined the bank in 1993 and now works as its business group director for southeastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus, recalled: ''No one else had the risk appetite. All the banks were completely scared about this melting territory.''
 But in recent years the region had become a popular place to invest. By 2007, the bank's former Communist clients were growing at a rapid 7 percent a year clip, and the Czech Republic became the first to leave, with the expectation that the other new European Union members would follow suit as they were strong enough to attract foreign investment.
 Australian officials said in 2008 that they would withdraw their stake in the bank to invest in poorer neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Meanwhile, the bank announced that it would begin operations in Turkey, a country that was never part of the Soviet bloc.
 Instead, the credit squeeze that came on the heels of the collapse of Lehman Brothers last autumn proved that some of the growth in the region was probably unsustainable, and that the bank had a role to play in sheltering its charges and consolidating their gains.
 ''An institution like the E.B.R.D. has collected lots of skills,'' Mr. Mirow said. ''My sense is the world is in great need of those skills.''
