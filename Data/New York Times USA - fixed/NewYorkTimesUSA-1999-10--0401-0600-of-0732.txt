HEADLINE: Debating Stadium Costs and Benefits

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Oct. 16

 BODY:
If Michael Graney has his way, this perennial second city will be looking for a band of young men to banish its chronic inferiority complex and improve the economy.
Their job: throwing, catching and hitting for a still unnamed minor-league expansion team in an as-yet-unbuilt $21.3 million stadium called Peter Pan Park. 
 But some in this industrial city long overshadowed by Boston say the plan will not work, and a referendum to stop the project is gaining support.
"This proposal just doesn't make sense," said Richard Stebbins, a leading opponent of the 5,300-seat stadium.
"It is a travesty to mortgage some of our economic future for a facility that will be used about 200 hours a year," said Mr. Stebbins, a retired banker.
Cities across the nation are struggling with the question of whether new sports complexes will be economic boons or boondoggles. In this decade, 46 major league stadiums and arenas have been built or renovated for teams in the four principal professional sports leagues, and 49 more are under construction or in the planning stages, said Andrew Zimbalist, sports economist at Smith College, about 20 miles north of Springfield.
The cost/benefit analysis goes beyond the bottom line, with civic pride and family entertainment all fitting into the mix. But the question often boils down to who will pay for the infrastructure.
Even when governments pay, there are no guarantees, as Hartford, Conn., learned this spring. The Connecticut Legislature agreed to pay for a new $375 million stadium after the New England Patriots said it would move to Hartford, 26 miles downriver from Springfield. But when the football team received another offer from Massachusetts, it decided to stay put.
Cities that want to get in on a boom in minor league baseball face similar issues. In the case of Springfield, the city is putting up $2 million and the state has promised $4 million in transportation and economic development grants to get the site ready for a team from the Northern League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball.
Mr. Graney, president of the nonprofit Springfield Baseball Corporation, which would own the team, says the mostly private financing sources his group assembled insulate taxpayers from risk.
But Mr. Stebbins said debt service on bonds and loans alone would exceed revenue even if optimistic attendance figures of 4,200 per game held, insuring that the city would never attract a quality ball club to its stadium.
The grants promised by the state would come at the expense of potentially more productive projects, Mr. Stebbins said.
The City Council recently voted 6 to 3 to use eminent domain to take the proposed site for the stadium, a shopping center in the shadow of two interstate highways. But a group called Citizens Action Network is mounting a petition drive to force a referendum to block the project, and the seizure is being fought by some merchants and the owners of the shopping center.
This is the fifth effort in five years to find a minor league team for Springfield, which had professional baseball on and off from 1902 until its ball park burned down in 1965. In 1995 a deal was all but done with a group of investors who had bought Pennsylvania's Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League for $4.1 million. When Harrisburg officials heard of the deal, they complained to the league and were able, at the last minute, to buy the club for $6.7 million.
"They've been to the altar many times," said Andrew Linker, a sportswriter for The Harrisburg Patriot-News, an observer of Springfield's travails.
This time, Mr. Stebbins said, the city's power brokers "have fallen in love with the allure of baseball." He added that the stadium was destined to become a white elephant, an assessment shared by Professor Zimbalist.
New stadiums, whether for the minor or major leagues, are never sound investments, Professor Zimbalist said, and the Springfield plan is especially ill-conceived because almost a quarter of the proposed budget is for seizing property and relocating 16 businesses.
Mr. Graney contends that the stadium will increase traffic for local businesses as part of a broad revitalization effort that includes expanding the Basketball Hall of Fame, building a new convention center and reviving two downtown theaters.
The team will give the city a "psychological boost," he said.
The stadium, planned to open in 2001, is supported by the Mayor and a majority of the City Council. It is being designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group, responsible for high-profile projects like Camden Yards in Baltimore and the proposed new Fenway Park in Boston.
One supporter, Peter Picknelly Sr., owns the Peter Pan Bus Lines, a long-distance service based in Springfield. He has promised a $3 million donation of his own money to the project, and his company is buying naming rights for $1 million more.
Mr. Picknelly's father named what was then a jitney company with two vehicles for his son 65 years ago. His mother was reading the story of Peter Pan to the 3-year-old Peter, and his parents decided he resembled the fabled boy who refused to grow up.

HEADLINE: Leo Lionni, 89, Dies, Versatile Creator of Children's Books

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER 

 BODY:
Leo Lionni, who introduced an introspective sensibility to children's literature through the metaphorical characters Frederick, Swimmy and Little Blue and Little Yellow, died on Monday at his home near Radda in the Chianti district of Italy. He was 89.
Mr. Lionni was an artist, magazine art director, graphic designer, children's book illustrator and author. He had many careers, including Futurist painter, architectural critic for the Italian magazine Casabella, advertising designer for the N. W. Ayer agency in Philadelphia, graphic design consultant to Olivetti in Milan and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, art director for Fortune, Print and Panorama magazines and professor of design at Cooper Union. 
But he earned worldwide popularity as the author and illustrator of more than 30 children's books, many of which were translated into numerous languages and are still in print.
He turned to creating children's books at 50, and, even after he began to suffer from Parkinson's disease 15 years ago, he was extraordinarily productive.
"Little Blue and Little Yellow," Mr. Lionni's first children's book, began as a desperate effort to calm his two rambunctious grandchildren on an hourlong train ride from Manhattan to Greenwich, Conn. It was 1959, and Mr. Lionni, then the art director of Fortune magazine, was taking the two to his suburban home. Unable to quiet them, he took a copy of Life magazine from his briefcase and turned to a page dominated by blue, yellow and green. He tore the paper into small circles, then improvised a story that captured their attention.
His story was about two circles, Little Blue and Little Yellow, the best of friends, who go on a hike. While playing hide-and-seek in a forest, they lose sight of each other. They search everywhere to no avail. Suddenly, behind a large tree, they are reunited and hug; doing so, they become Little Green.
"The children were transfixed," Mr. Lionni recalled in his memoir, "Between Worlds" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1997). "And I noticed that the passengers who were sitting within hearing distance had put down their papers and were listening, too. So for their benefit, I had Little Green go to the Stock Exchange, where he lost all his money. He broke out in yellow and blue tears, and when he was all tears, he was Little Blue and Little Yellow again and their stock rose 12 points."
Mr. Lionni eventually presented a refined version of the story to Fabio Coen, the children's editor for MacDowell Obolensky in New York, who agreed to publish it.
"It would take more than one evening with Fabio before I could fully understand how much the simple little tale of two blobs of color would affect my soul, my mind and my way of life," Mr. Lionni wrote.
Leonard Lionni was born in the Netherlands in 1910. His father was a diamond cutter and his mother was a singer. His Uncle Piet, an architect, gave the boy his first set of drafting tools; two other uncles, both collectors of modern art, fed his artistic inclinations. One uncle hung a Chagall painting outside the boy's room.
Mr. Lionni studied arts and crafts in primary school and was permitted to draw at the Rijksmuseum, where he copied plaster casts; he later recalled feeling that Rembrandt, van Gogh, Mondrian, architecture and music were "one big mood to me."
When he was 14, he lived in Philadelphia, where his father worked for the Atlantic Richfield Company. A year later, he moved to Genoa, Italy, where he attended a commercial high school, learned Italian and became conversant in Italian art, literature and poetry. At 16, he met Nora Maffi, who a few years later became his wife. The marriage endured for 69 years.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Louis Manny; four grandchildren, Pippo Lionni and Annie Lionni (for whom "Little Blue and Little Yellow" was conceived) Gina Zucker and Sylvan Lionni, and six great-grandchildren.
His wife's father was a founder of the Italian Communist Party and was placed under house arrest by the Fascists after their rise to power in 1922. This had a strong effect on Mr. Lionni's own political consciousness.
By the late 1920's, he had become interested in commercial art and produced his own advertisement proposals for Campari, which had a progressive graphic policy. Inspired by Futurist art, he found himself painting turbulent abstractions in 1931. His work caught the eye of F. T. Marinetti, leader of the faded Futurist movement.
Mr. Lionni was ambivalent about such recognition: Futurism celebrated Fascism, and its chaotic esthetic conflicted with his own rationalism. "I am really Dutch," he wrote. "I felt closer to de Stijl, and respond to the patterns and symmetry of the tulip fields."
While designing advertisements for a living, he attended classes at the University of Genoa, earning a doctoral degree in economics. He returned to Philadelphia to work as a designer for N. W. Ayer.
Mr. Lionni's other early jobs included art direction for advertisements for Ladies' Home Journal, the Ford Motor Company and the Container Corporation of America, for which he commissioned illustrations from Willem de Kooning, Alexander Calder and Fernand Leger for a celebrated series of ads based on great ideas. He also worked with a young Andy Warhol on the Regal Shoes account.
In 1947, Mr. Lionni moved to New York, and one of his first assignments was for Fortune magazine.
"Once Henry Luce asked me," he said, " 'Why can't Fortune be as good looking as Harper's Bazaar?' My answer was obvious: 'Because businessmen are not as good looking as fashion models.' "
He accepted the challenge nonetheless, changing the magazine's format and typography and giving unparalleled exposure to illustrators and fine artists who created pictorial essays.
He was a consultant to Luce on the prototype for Sports Illustrated. He designed the Museum of Modern Art's catalogue for Edward Steichen's milestone photography exhibition "The Family of Man," which is still in print, and the American Pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair.
At 50, Mr. Lionni decided to resettle in Tuscany, where he painted and created huge fantasy plants in brass and iron. Seeking a way to combine his applied and fine art work, he hit upon children's books as the perfect means. There he found the key to unlocking decades of personal fears, joys, insecurities and loves, by presenting them through animal metaphors. The books offer windows onto what he called "the soul." "Little Blue and Little Yellow," "Swimmy," "Frederick," "Nicolas, Where Have You Been?" and "Matthew's Dream," among his most popular and introspective books, are, on one level, autobiographies.
For his second book, Mr. Lionni did not resort to, as he said, "Little Blue Goes to the Zoo." Instead, he wrote and illustrated "On My Beach There Are Many Pebbles," a collection of drawings of fish pebbles, people pebbles and so on, hidden among the real pebbles, realistically rendered in pencil.
In his third book, "Inch by Inch," he developed the first of his animal fables. "Although it doesn't have an explicit moral, it invites a search for meaning," he said.
In "Inch by Inch," a helpless inchworm uses ingenuity to outwit a powerful bird. The story carries a recurring messages: that the imagination can transcend all obstacles.
His best-known book, "Swimmy," is about a diminutive fish bamboozling its predator, a giant tuna, by organizing other smaller fish into the shape of a large one. When Swimmy says, "I will be the eye," it is clear that this is also a portrait of the artist as seer.
Frances Foster, his editor for many years, said, "I think that's certainly the way Leo saw his role as an artist, seeing for people."
"Tillie and the Wall," from 1989, a book about seeing beyond impenetrable barriers, was published in Germany around the time that the Berlin wall fell, and it sold well there. Mr. Lionni was so excited by the potential of this book to impart more worldly ideas that he decided that from then on, everything he did would have some sort of social message.
"He felt that the world was in such a state that he really couldn't afford not to use the picture book as a kind of soapbox," Ms. Foster said.
In 1997, his critically praised memoir was published. Bruce McCall wrote in The New York Times Book Review that it was the story of "a man with exquisitely fine-tuned creative imagination, a clear mind, perfect taste and mercilessly high standards."
A year later, Parkinson's disease left him unable to type or sketch, but he kept conceiving ideas for more stories and fables.
Mr. Lionni once confessed in an interview that he had trouble with children, even grandchildren, in small groups. "I don't know how to get to them," he said, "and so I do banal things," like making noises.
"I wish I could just read them something."

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Old-Time Rivals Make A Date to Go Dancing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER REARDON; Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the coming New Year's Eve celebration at Times Square.

 BODY:
MORE than most dance companies, American Ballet Theater prides itself on its versatility. And rightly so. Last spring it presented "Giselle" and other Old World heirlooms. For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and runs for two weeks at City Center, the troupe will flaunt its progressive side, taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de Mille, the wry populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver partnering of Nacho Duato.
As disparate as these dances are, however, one piece in the program stands out as a real stretch: Martha Graham's "Diversion of Angels." 
 Such a union of classical and modern might have been thought treasonous when the piece was first seen in 1948. Back then, ballet was lofty and lithe, a passport to the heavens. Graham's work was its antithesis, an earthbound art that bared the human soul. Her signature move, an abdominal contraction and release that starts deep in the pelvis, would have made a naif like Giselle blush with shame.
Even now, with choreographers shuttling back and forth between classical and contemporary troupes, adding Graham to Ballet Theater's repertory is a rare and risky endeavor. Only three other ballet companies have performed her work, and never in New York, where her troupe is based.
"There's an expression in England about taking coals to Newcastle," said Wayne Eagling, artistic director of the Dutch National Ballet, which will stage its fifth piece by Graham next month. "It's like a company bringing Balanchine to New York; it better be bloody good."
Some purists are aghast at the notion that dancers with no prior training in the Graham technique could, after six weeks of rehearsals, do her work justice. Others wonder why Ballet Theater's Ashley Tuttle, a paragon of classical form, would bother with Graham's barefoot modernism. But the most common refrain is simply, "What took so long?"
Ballet Theater has been a crucible of crossover ballet at least since 1976, when it asked Ms. Tharp, who was known for setting dances to songs by Petula Clark and the Beach Boys, to make a piece for Mikhail Baryshnikov. The result was "Push Comes to Shove," a public sensation that breached the wall between ballet and modern dance for good. (The company will perform it, minus Mr. Baryshnikov, at City Center.)
There was talk of adding Graham to the repertory a dozen years ago. She and her rehearsal director, Peggy Lyman, even came and taught a class. But the project stalled with Mr. Baryshnikov's departure as artistic director in 1989, Graham's death two years later and financial crises at both companies. (Ballet Theater paid off the last of its $5 million debt in 1998, while the Graham troupe retired its $2 million debt earlier this year.)
Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director since 1992, eventually resumed the conversation with Ron Protas, his counterpart at the Graham studio.
"I felt it was important for the company to do a Graham piece, and do it well, because she's such an influential figure," Mr. McKenzie said. "You're going to get it watered down, three times removed, from some present-day choreographer anyway. So why not go to the source?"
Mr. Protas was game. At the time, he was laying the groundwork for the new Martha Graham Trust, which licenses her work to dance companies and schools. The goal, he said, is to keep her work alive and help it reach a broader audience. To that end, he struck a deal that allows Ballet Theater to perform "Diversion of Angels," Mr. McKenzie's first choice, at a cost of $55,000 for the first year.
"Angels" was an anomaly for Graham. Sprightly and tender, it came just after three of her darkest works: "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey" and "Errand Into the Maze." Instead of Medea, Jocasta and Ariadne, the tragic heroines of those glosses on Greek myth, it presents three couples happily in love.
To Graham, who created the piece during her brief marriage to Erick Hawkins and never performed in it, the couples represented different shades of devotion. The two lovers dressed in white should appear "mature and balanced," Mr. Protas told the dancers after watching a rehearsal earlier this month. The red couple should be erotic, he added, the yellow one playful and elusive. The dancing, to an ebullient score by Norman Dello Joio, is arguably lighter and more linear than anything else in Graham's oeuvre. But it's no cakewalk.
"You cannot hide behind a narrative or a story or a dramatic portrayal," said Peter Sparling, a former Graham dancer whose modern-dance troupe in Ann Arbor, Mich., recently performed "Angels." "It's essential, lyrical Graham. The technique is laid bare."
Some of her dancers once dubbed the piece "Perversion of Angles," a sobriquet that seems even more apt at Ballet Theater. Four weeks into rehearsals, the dancers had the basic structure down. But the women were still struggling to throw themselves into radical tilts without falling off balance and learning to leap without letting their center of gravity ride too high. The men, wearing knee pads and ballet slippers that will have to be gone by opening night, grimaced as they plunged to the floor and tried to spiral right back up.
"This is the purest modern-dance technique there is," said Keith Roberts, a principal dancer who has created roles with Ms. Tharp, James Kudelka and Lar Lubovitch. (Mr. Roberts will also dance in Mr. Lubovitch's newest work, "Meadow.") "It's like asking a modern dancer to do 'Sleeping Beauty.' "
Even so, the effort is not unprecedented. Many notable Graham dancers (including Graham herself) mastered her technique after years of classical training. Rudolf Nureyev, who was jeered during his clumsy debut with the Graham company in 1984, eventually became an important interpreter of her work. And last year the Colorado Ballet scored a hit with its production of "Appalachian Spring" (1944), after six solid weeks of rehearsal.
Takako Asakawa, a Graham protege who is teaching them the piece, said she had hoped to start off with a few weeks of classes. But the troupe's busy schedule made that impossible. So after showing them a 1976 video of "Angels," with herself as the red girl, she dived right in, demonstrating each of the roles herself.
"Our best way of bringing it to life is through imitation," said Mr. Roberts, who dances as the red boy. "We may not fully grasp what's going on, but if we can imitate it until we get it into our body, then we can start understanding the feeling of it. It's kind of a backward approach, but it's all we can do in the time we have."
ONE of the more striking images in rehearsal was that of Ms. Tuttle, her feet wreathed in adhesive tape, laying a string of altered arabesques across the floor. Every few steps she stopped, lifted herself up on point with a visceral contraction and then surged ahead.
Mr. McKenzie had initially pegged her as the yellow girl, an effervescent role that seemed to suit her persona. "My natural movement quality is to be more upright, more flighty, more like Giselle," she said. But Ms. Asakawa, sensing an untapped potential, shrewdly recast her as the red girl.
On the whole, Ms. Asakawa said, she has found Ballet Theater's dancers more receptive to Graham than their peers at the Paris Opera Ballet, where she restaged "Temptations of the Moon" (1986) a few years ago. But with two weeks to go, she was still dissatisfied with their timing and spacing, and she thought their transitions were rough. Again and again she instructed them to flex their feet, molded their torsos with her hands and shared emotional insights into the roles. In a dance studio, it was pretty much business as usual.
"They're not going to look like people who have studied Graham technique for 12 years," Mr. Protas said. "But I think they will have mastered it to a degree that's acceptable and dramatic."
Then he offered an anecdote that, if true, appears to call the entire enterprise into question.
"Martha's disciples have much more rigidity about her work than she did," he said. "One time she told Misha, 'Darling, this contraction and release thing: it's so overrated.' Of course, it's the whole basis of her work."

 CORRECTION:
An article on page 11 of Arts & Leisure today about American Ballet Theater's season at City Center misstates the fee that the Martha Graham Trust is charging Ballet Theater to perform Graham's "Diversion of Angels." According to Jane Hermann, who wrote the contract for the trust, it is a flat three-year agreement, not a one-year agreement, and the fee is considerably less than $55,000.

HEADLINE: The Return of the Suit That Speaks (Quietly) for Itself

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
LAST summer, Dr. Andre L. Churchwell bought himself a new blue suit. Not just any blue suit, but a single-breasted, two-button model with peak lapels and a dapper ticket pocket -- a ringer, he was quick to note, for "the suit Pierce Brosnan was wearing when he first met Renee Russo in 'The Thomas Crown Affair.' "
Dr. Churchwell, 45, a cardiologist in Nashville, makes it a point to know about such things. Speaking by phone from his office, he all but crowed describing another recent acquisition, a dove-gray coat and trousers made in New York by his tailor, Leonard Logsdail, and cut, he said, from the poshest "Super 100" wool flannel. 
 Terms like Super 100 and Scabal (a luxury fabric from a British textile mill) have also leeched into Dennis Saul's conversation. The head of his own stock brokerage firm, Mr. Saul, 56, has his suits made in Brooklyn by a tailor whose name he won't disclose -- for fear of driving up his prices. Each new ensemble sets Mr. Saul back about $2,000; a bargain, he maintained, since "I'm getting the difference between a Chevy and a Porche."
"Last Saturday, I looked at 20 different fabrics," he recalled. "I like to feel that in the course of examining this stuff, I'm building a body of knowledge."
Dr. Churchwell and Mr. Saul are devout members of an exclusive but growing fraternity of affluent clothing buffs, who have turned their backs on off-the-rack apparel in favor of a garment uniquely tailored to their whims.
Men like these contend that they are wild about a custom suit's superior fit and quality. But they are just as taken with its unspoken function as a badge of rank, an expression of their rarefied tastes and connoisseurship -- as though it were a rare wine or a vintage car they had studied up on before acquiring.
Increasingly brand-conscious, a prosperous minority of men with a passion for finery have given rise to dynamic sales of hand-made apparel for the first time since the boom years of the 1980's. In this decade, suit sales over all have taken a beating as consumers lean toward casual wear. But when men do buy suits, retailers and tailors say, they are more likely to splurge these days, investing in top-of-the-line goods. Just as in the 80's, men's wear's last gilded age, when a peacock display of red suspenders or an Hermes tie were thought to be status symbols, consumers with well-lined pockets are not blinking at the $2,000 to $7,000 price tag for a custom suit. It's the sartorial equivalent of a platinum card.
Members of the custom club like to subtly signal one another by flaunting their ticket pockets -- slim pockets on the jacket originally used to fit a pair of theater tickets -- and functioning buttonholes on jacket sleeves, which Wall Street's young turks leave undone in a quiet show of status.
"In the last few years, the custom business has picked up dramatically," said Clifford Grodd, the president of Paul Stuart, a high-end men's-wear emporium in midtown Manhattan, where the custom business has doubled since the mid-90's.
Other merchants cite a similarly robust growth -- about 15 to 25 percent annually -- in hand-tailored suits, though no industry-wide figures exist.
"One of the hallmarks of affluence, besides buying your Range Rover, is having a suit made," Mr. Grodd said. "Saying you have a custom-made suit is like name dropping."
The lineup of clothiers offering men's custom services in the New York area, including suits, shirts and sometimes ties, includes tailors like Leonard Logsdail; specialty stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, and such lofty labels as Oxxford, Kiton, Zegna, Brioni, Attolini and, most recently, Giorgio Armani, who began selling made-to-measure suits just this fall under the Collezioni label.
Even Moe Ginzburg, the venerable rack-and-pipe operation on lower Fifth Avenue that is home to $250 budget suits, is trading up. Next spring, the store will feature made-to-measure men's apparel in its newly renovated and gentrified store. Paul Ginzburg, the third-generation owner of Moe Ginzburg, expects made-to-measure customers to come from the ranks of those who are "bestowing fine wine on themselves, along with good caviar, expensive girlfriends and even more expensive wives," he said, adding, "A custom suit is one more luxury that makes them feel they have arrived."
Consumers, and some retailers, are often confused about the terminology of tailored clothing. Essentially, there are three levels of quality and expense:
* A custom suit, the cordon bleu of tailored apparel, is cut and stitched from scratch, using a paper pattern designed for each client that is fitted in muslin. Known as a bespoke suit in England. Prices range from $2,000 to well over $7,000.
* A made-to-measure suit is a Betty Crocker variation on custom tailoring. Customers are measured, and choose from a wide range of fabrics, but their suits are cut using standard patterns, not made from scratch, then fitted to them. This is what men's-wear designers offer when they do "trunk shows" at stores. Priced from $700 to $2,500.
* Off-the-rack suits, those hanging in stores when customers walk in, are made in standard sizes and can be altered in simple ways by a tailor. Priced from $100 to $3,000.
Hand-made suits appeal to the kind of man who wants a walnut dashboard in his car and a cherrywood floor in his dining room. "The more prosperous the man, the more difficult it is to satisfy his needs," said Lawrence Kudlow, 52, the chief economist at Schroder & Company and for CNBC.com, and a commentator for Bloomberg News. Mr. Kudlow, who buys his hand-made pinstripe suits from Mr. Logsdail, views the craving for hand-made apparel as the indicator of a larger trend. "Customization is a theme in all consumer goods," he noted. "The suit business is part of that."
Indeed, Kurt Salmon Associates, a New York consumer research group, which conducted a survey of middle- to high-income shoppers earlier this year, forecasts increases of 20 to 30 percent in sales of custom-made apparel over the next decade.
Younger consumers, men now in their 30's and 40's, whose notions of style were honed on aggressively voguish labels like Prada, Helmut Lang and Dolce & Gabbana, are among those giving made-to-order suits a push. Disenchanted by the indifferent construction and evanescent life span of designer brands, some have discovered custom apparel.
"Men's clothes are becoming so fashion forward that I can't wear them," complained Giovanni Russo, one such recent custom convert. Mr. Russo, 33, an art director and the head of his own New York design firm, called Design No. 11, has mostly abandoned designer suits, which he deems too flashy, for the subtlety of a trim-fitting gray wool coat and pair of trousers, like those he ordered last summer from Seize Sur Vingt, a downtown clothier to the young and hip.
Learning about the arcana of style -- the names of fabrics, the types of stitching -- is part of the allure of a custom suit, said Dan McCampbell, the fashion director for men's wear at Saks Fifth Avenue, who based his observations on findings from a survey by the store of 300 consumers aged 25 to 64 and earning $75,000 a year or more. "Men are turning increasingly to a tailor or a knowledgeable sales associate to inform them about how clothes are made," he said. "Why? They see clothes as an investment."
And he might have added, an instant passport to James Bondian self-assurance. Some tailors trade on their clients' eagerness to become connoisseurs -- a trait hard-wired into many men, the same instinct that leads them to become audio buffs -- while preying slyly on their insecurities. One television executive, who didn't want to go on record as buying high-priced suits, told of visiting the New York hotel suite of Gianni Campagna, a Milanese tailor, who says he has made suits for the billionaire Ronald O. Perelman and Henry Kravis, the financier.
"I had on my best Zegna suit," the client recalled, laughing ruefully, "but they looked me over, and told me my cuffs were too short, my shoulders too low and my buttons too high. All I could think was, Oh my God, do I look that bad?" He succumbed just the same, buying one suit in solid gray wool and another in a navy Prince of Wales plaid. Cost: $3,800 each. He also bought a cashmere sportscoat for $2,600.
Some men take the passion for personalization to extremes. Mr. Logsdail, a midtown tailor with a Savile Row pedigree, tells of one client who asked to have his suit coat lined with a patchwork of silk Hermes scarves.
But Americans more often shun such display, opting for refinements as faint and elusive as the scent of English lavender. They include Jeffry Schneider, 31, an investment banker and longtime patron of Paul Stuart. His latest purchase is a Tasmanian wool suit decorated with plaid so fine it is all but invisible. "A hand-made suit is a subtle thing," he said during a fitting at the store the other day, pointing out the hand-stitching along the edge of the lapel. "But this is my favorite detail," Mr. Schneider said, turning his jacket inside out to show off his pen pocket -- a one-inch slash just beneath his left breast pocket.
Retailers acknowledge that the advantage of such features may well be in the wearer's eye. "So much of this business is psychological," said Mr. Grodd of Paul Stuart. "A hand-sewn buttonhole is a sign of status, sure, but one that is much overrated. With all the technology available now, handwork doesn't necessarily make something better."
True custom fans brush such reservations off like lint. Eager to stand out from the herd and, at the same time, blend in with their peers, some take a line from their tailors, contending, a bit solemnly, that their suits are an addiction -- not to say the plushest of security blankets. They certainly serve that purpose for Mr. Russo. "I hate being self-conscious," he said. "I like to feel that my clothes aren't wearing me. And when I find a suit I really can relax in, well, I just go with it."

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Old-Time Rivals Make A Date to Go Dancing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER REARDON; Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the coming New Year's Eve celebration at Times Square.

 BODY:
MORE than most dance companies, American Ballet Theater prides itself on its versatility. And rightly so. Last spring it presented "Giselle" and other Old World heirlooms. For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and runs for two weeks at City Center, the troupe will flaunt its progressive side, taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de Mille, the wry populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver partnering of Nacho Duato.
As disparate as these dances are, however, one piece in the program stands out as a real stretch: Martha Graham's "Diversion of Angels." 
 Such a union of classical and modern might have been thought treasonous when the piece was first seen in 1948. Back then, ballet was lofty and lithe, a passport to the heavens. Graham's work was its antithesis, an earthbound art that bared the human soul. Her signature move, an abdominal contraction and release that starts deep in the pelvis, would have made a naif like Giselle blush with shame.
Even now, with choreographers shuttling back and forth between classical and contemporary troupes, adding Graham to Ballet Theater's repertory is a rare and risky endeavor. Only three other ballet companies have performed her work, and never in New York, where her troupe is based.
"There's an expression in England about taking coals to Newcastle," said Wayne Eagling, artistic director of the Dutch National Ballet, which will stage its fifth piece by Graham next month. "It's like a company bringing Balanchine to New York; it better be bloody good."
Some purists are aghast at the notion that dancers with no prior training in the Graham technique could, after six weeks of rehearsals, do her work justice. Others wonder why Ballet Theater's Ashley Tuttle, a paragon of classical form, would bother with Graham's barefoot modernism. But the most common refrain is simply, "What took so long?"
Ballet Theater has been a crucible of crossover ballet at least since 1976, when it asked Ms. Tharp, who was known for setting dances to songs by Petula Clark and the Beach Boys, to make a piece for Mikhail Baryshnikov. The result was "Push Comes to Shove," a public sensation that breached the wall between ballet and modern dance for good. (The company will perform it, minus Mr. Baryshnikov, at City Center.)
There was talk of adding Graham to the repertory a dozen years ago. She and her rehearsal director, Peggy Lyman, even came and taught a class. But the project stalled with Mr. Baryshnikov's departure as artistic director in 1989, Graham's death two years later and financial crises at both companies. (Ballet Theater paid off the last of its $5 million debt in 1998, while the Graham troupe retired its $2 million debt earlier this year.)
Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director since 1992, eventually resumed the conversation with Ron Protas, his counterpart at the Graham studio.
"I felt it was important for the company to do a Graham piece, and do it well, because she's such an influential figure," Mr. McKenzie said. "You're going to get it watered down, three times removed, from some present-day choreographer anyway. So why not go to the source?"
Mr. Protas was game. At the time, he was laying the groundwork for the new Martha Graham Trust, which licenses her work to dance companies and schools. The goal, he said, is to keep her work alive and help it reach a broader audience. To that end, he struck a deal that allows Ballet Theater to perform "Diversion of Angels," Mr. McKenzie's first choice, at a cost of $55,000 for the first year.
"Angels" was an anomaly for Graham. Sprightly and tender, it came just after three of her darkest works: "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey" and "Errand Into the Maze." Instead of Medea, Jocasta and Ariadne, the tragic heroines of those glosses on Greek myth, it presents three couples happily in love.
To Graham, who created the piece during her brief marriage to Erick Hawkins and never performed in it, the couples represented different shades of devotion. The two lovers dressed in white should appear "mature and balanced," Mr. Protas told the dancers after watching a rehearsal earlier this month. The red couple should be erotic, he added, the yellow one playful and elusive. The dancing, to an ebullient score by Norman Dello Joio, is arguably lighter and more linear than anything else in Graham's oeuvre. But it's no cakewalk.
"You cannot hide behind a narrative or a story or a dramatic portrayal," said Peter Sparling, a former Graham dancer whose modern-dance troupe in Ann Arbor, Mich., recently performed "Angels." "It's essential, lyrical Graham. The technique is laid bare."
Some of her dancers once dubbed the piece "Perversion of Angles," a sobriquet that seems even more apt at Ballet Theater. Four weeks into rehearsals, the dancers had the basic structure down. But the women were still struggling to throw themselves into radical tilts without falling off balance and learning to leap without letting their center of gravity ride too high. The men, wearing knee pads and ballet slippers that will have to be gone by opening night, grimaced as they plunged to the floor and tried to spiral right back up.
"This is the purest modern-dance technique there is," said Keith Roberts, a principal dancer who has created roles with Ms. Tharp, James Kudelka and Lar Lubovitch. (Mr. Roberts will also dance in Mr. Lubovitch's newest work, "Meadow.") "It's like asking a modern dancer to do 'Sleeping Beauty.' "
Even so, the effort is not unprecedented. Many notable Graham dancers (including Graham herself) mastered her technique after years of classical training. Rudolf Nureyev, who was jeered during his clumsy debut with the Graham company in 1984, eventually became an important interpreter of her work. And last year the Colorado Ballet scored a hit with its production of "Appalachian Spring" (1944), after six solid weeks of rehearsal.
Takako Asakawa, a Graham protege who is teaching them the piece, said she had hoped to start off with a few weeks of classes. But the troupe's busy schedule made that impossible. So after showing them a 1976 video of "Angels," with herself as the red girl, she dived right in, demonstrating each of the roles herself.
"Our best way of bringing it to life is through imitation," said Mr. Roberts, who dances as the red boy. "We may not fully grasp what's going on, but if we can imitate it until we get it into our body, then we can start understanding the feeling of it. It's kind of a backward approach, but it's all we can do in the time we have."
ONE of the more striking images in rehearsal was that of Ms. Tuttle, her feet wreathed in adhesive tape, laying a string of altered arabesques across the floor. Every few steps she stopped, lifted herself up on point with a visceral contraction and then surged ahead.
Mr. McKenzie had initially pegged her as the yellow girl, an effervescent role that seemed to suit her persona. "My natural movement quality is to be more upright, more flighty, more like Giselle," she said. But Ms. Asakawa, sensing an untapped potential, shrewdly recast her as the red girl.
On the whole, Ms. Asakawa said, she has found Ballet Theater's dancers more receptive to Graham than their peers at the Paris Opera Ballet, where she restaged "Temptations of the Moon" (1986) a few years ago. But with two weeks to go, she was still dissatisfied with their timing and spacing, and she thought their transitions were rough. Again and again she instructed them to flex their feet, molded their torsos with her hands and shared emotional insights into the roles. In a dance studio, it was pretty much business as usual.
"They're not going to look like people who have studied Graham technique for 12 years," Mr. Protas said. "But I think they will have mastered it to a degree that's acceptable and dramatic."
Then he offered an anecdote that, if true, appears to call the entire enterprise into question.
"Martha's disciples have much more rigidity about her work than she did," he said. "One time she told Misha, 'Darling, this contraction and release thing: it's so overrated.' Of course, it's the whole basis of her work."

HEADLINE: The World;
The Real Power Struggle Isn't Just About Nukes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
STEP outside the United States for even a few days, and the country has never looked more powerful: An economy that won't quit, a military that has never faced fewer direct challenges, a popular and business culture that has become the world's most eagerly-sought export.
But take one step back into Washington and it's easy to wonder if you are talking about the same country. The President of the most powerful nation at its most powerful moment has rarely looked weaker than he did last week, when the Senate overwhelmingly defeated the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
 Mr. Clinton responded with an hour-long recitation of the dangers of a "new isolationism." Republicans shot back that Mr. Clinton had cynically sought to turn a popular but hard-to-enforce treaty into a political weapon. Bickering along these lines will doubtless go on for months. But it masks the real debate.
The test ban treaty was only the latest of a number of divisive issues in the capital that share a common subtext: An argument not over whether the United States is strong, but over how it should use its power. Should it strut the global beach alone, or leverage that power by accepting restraints on its freedom to act?
It is that debate that has eroded the "vital center" that Mr. Clinton talks about so often in his laments about the disappearance of bipartisanship in foreign affairs.
Mr. Clinton himself, who has been episodic in focusing on foreign policy, has ranged all over the map on this question. He preaches cooperation one day and acts unilaterally the next -- whether the issue is swatting Saddam Hussein or slapping huge tariffs on low-cost Japanese steel. Usually, though, he has come down on the side of power-sharing, either pressing for more arms control accords even if that means a slow deterioration of the American nuclear fleet, or granting more power to the World Trade Organization even if sometimes strikes down American laws.
Over the past three years battles have gradually gotten more and more vociferous, as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty showed. Now it has turned into an open fight, bound to haunt Mr. Clinton as he finishes the last 15 months of his term. It is also certain to plague his successor in a city where the consensus about American responsibilities in the world has splintered.
It is a battle in which Mr. Clinton has steadily been losing ground. In his first term he won over moderate Republicans to push through the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global trade treaty that created the World Trade Organization. True, these victories came only after desperate legislative battles, but unlike the test ban treaty, they were at least fought out in hundreds of hours of hearings and public debate. But lately, with the exception of the war in Kosovo, he has been unable to stitch together any kind of majority for his international initiatives. He was unable even to convince his own party to vote to give him authority to negotiate new trade treaties -- a reminder that, for all his denunciations of isolationism on Thursday, most of the economic isolationists in Congress are Democrats.
And now, in a treaty that involved national security rather than economic prosperity, the culmination of an idea whose intellectual roots go back to Eisenhower Republicans, he became the first President since Woodrow Wilson to face outright rejection of a major international accord. The fact that Democrats and Republicans were unable to agree on the obvious face-saving compromise -- a delay of the vote until after the Presidential election -- seems to prove that the politics of post-cold war Washington really are different. "It's inconceivable," one of Mr. Clinton's top advisers said, "that this would have been the outcome if the country still felt under an imminent threat from a major enemy."
Even so, many of those who had doubts about the treaty and thus voted against it would have preferred to see it postponed, amended or at least fully aired in hearings rather than killed. Moderate Republicans who voted no like John McCain, the Presidential candidate, were clearly uncomfortable with the message that the treaty's rejection sent around the world. "There has always been an isolationist wing in our party and they were transcendent in the 20's and 30's," Mr. McCain said on Friday, trying to distance himself from that group as fast as he could. "It's still there, it will always be there, yet I have every confidence that the majority will take an international viewpoint."
Others say that the instinct in evidence on the Senate floor on Wednesday night was less about isolationism than about unilateralism -- preserving America's ability to use its power unchallenged. In the case of the test ban treaty, that means retaining an ability to go back to traditional deterrence, constantly improving America's nuclear arsenal and forcing a resurgent Russia or an ambitious China to fear a financially ruinous arms race. After all, the Soviet Union went that route and bankrupted itself along the way.
"I don't think the Republican party has ever been or is now a party of isolationism," said Michael Mandelbaum, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the Republicans who voted against the treaty, he noted, rank among the Senate's strongest internationalists. "But there is a very strong unilateralist impulse manifesting itself. That's very different. It's not opposed to foreign entanglements, it just sends a message: 'Don't tie our hands.' "
Mr. Clinton argued vociferously against that approach during his press conference on Thursday, warning that if an anti-test ban treaty President ever gets elected (he named no names, but clearly had George W. Bush Jr. in mind) "we'll have China testing; we'll have India testing; we'll have Pakistan testing." The result, he argued, would be a return to an economically destructive arms race. Sooner or later, he predicted, Republicans would be pressing for "30 or 40 or 50 billion a year" in additional defense spending.
He may be right. But it is also possible that the lessons of the cold war run deep, and countries now feel far more competitive pressure than they did a decade ago to invest that money in their economic well-being.
"At the same moment that Clinton is talking about isolation, American foreign investment is off the charts, American economic engagement around the world is breaking all records," said Jeffrey E. Garten, a former Under Secretary of Commerce and now dean of the Yale School of Management. "In some subtle way this has ricocheted back to Washington, and perhaps there are a lot of people who feel that you can reject an arms control treaty and still not be withdrawing from the world."

THE MYTH OF THE
 FIRST THREE YEARS
 A New Understanding of Early Brain
 Development and Lifelong Learning.
 By John T. Bruer.
 244 pp. New York:

 This century began with the ascendancy of the unconscious and is ending with the ascendancy of the brain. These very different explanations of behavior have two things in common. Both the unconscious and the brain are invisible to the naked eye, therefore requiring phalanxes of experts to explain them. And both notions have been used to serve the deeply held American cultural belief in infant determinism -- the idea that the first three years of life determine a child's development and personality.
It was bad enough when parents were told that their baby would form a lifelong unconscious image of them, based on how sensitive they were to the tiny tyrant's every emotional need. Now parents are being told to forget the unconscious and attend to brain wiring. As Rob Reiner's "I Am Your Child" campaign puts it, "The early years last forever." This is because, the public is told, the baby's brain is forming trillions of synapses (connections between nerve cells), many of which have, by puberty, been "pruned away." Enriched environments and mental stimulation are critical to synapse production, and thus to a baby's mental, musical and artistic abilities. Kindergarten is too late.
In this era of the brain, such an argument is powerful. Do you know how many synapses you have? Of course not, but if you're like me you will jump at the chance to add a few more, or at least keep the ones you have. So it's no wonder that millions of parents are panicked. When you could only wreck your child's unconscious, the kid could always go to therapy. But if you miss that critical early period for stimulating your baby's brain, your child might never get to Harvard. As Hillary Rodham Clinton said during the 1997 White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning, this emphasis on the brain does "ratchet up the guilt."
That is why "The Myth of the First Three Years" is important. John T. Bruer, the president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation, which supports research on neuroscience and cognition, has written a clear and balanced assessment of what research has and has not discovered about infant brains, one that illuminates the connections between research, political values and social policy.
First, Bruer shows that "most learning is not subject to critical-period constraints, not confined to windows of opportunity that slam shut." For example, the years roughly until puberty are, in general, crucial for acquiring an unaccented second language. But most people can learn another language and improve their skills at any age.
Second, the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience are that the brain develops throughout life and that brain structure is continually affected by experience. Neuroscientists once believed that lost neurons could not regenerate; now it turns out that sometimes they can. "The brain is not 'cooked' by age 3 or age 10," Bruer writes. "Our brains remain remarkably plastic and we retain the ability to learn throughout our lives."
Third, infants subjected to severe, prolonged deprivation do indeed suffer intellectually -- though long-term studies find that many recover from even this poor start. But there is no single, correct way to stimulate a baby in order to produce maximum mental benefits. In those famous rat studies showing the benefits of "enriched" environments, the environments were actually typical of how rats live in the wild. Similarly, the natural environments in which most human babies live provide all the stimulation necessary for normal development.
Bruer's most debatable claim is that the rapid explosion of synapses in infancy is "under genetic, not environmental, control." But he is right that "more synapses do not necessarily mean more brainpower" and that the loss of synapses is not a result of inadequate stimulation; it is normal, necessary and unrelated to brain function. We lose synapses by the fistful by adulthood, but our knowledge and mental abilities continue to expand.
As Bruer observes, nowadays everyone feels the need to claim that science is on his or her side. Thus, the "I Am Your Child" campaign claims that "brain science" shows that you should be attentive; read, sing and talk to your baby; be selective about television; choose good day care. But how much reading and singing? How much attention? Neuroscience is silent.
Of course, the heart of this debate is not about what kind of mobiles middle-class parents should hang over their babies' cribs or whether listening to Mozart increases intelligence (it doesn't). It's about where society's resources should go in helping poor and disadvantaged children. Bruer argues that even the most intensive early-intervention programs, notably the Abecedarian Project in North Carolina and the nationwide Infant Health and Development Program, have had modest effects at best. They do boost school performance, but what matters most seems to be intensive training in academic skills over time. Otherwise, many of the benefits of early intervention wear off by adolescence.
BRUER worries that "the myth of the first three years" will persuade the public and lawmakers that once a child is older than 3, we might as well forget any other programs. According to Bruer, bills to reduce or eliminate support for programs for older children (let alone adults) are already being considered in some states: no point providing literacy and education programs in prisons or the military; no point improving schools -- such efforts are too little, too late. What the new brain science really shows is that it's never too late. Brain science can therefore be used to argue both that it's important to give babies a good start and that a good start is not enough. It can be used to support programs to help underweight, underprivileged babies and programs aimed at older children and their unemployed, malnourished or illiterate parents.
The book has several annoying qualities. It is poorly edited (at least 200 of my synapses were deadened by its repetitive conclusions). It lacks a bibliography, so readers cannot find sources easily or check for important citations without struggling through the inadequate notes. Over all, however, these complaints are like ants at a picnic: nuisances, but they need not detract from the ample food for thought.

A Strained Relationship Turns Sour

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Like many relationships in Hollywood, the one between the trade papers -- Variety and The Hollywood Reporter -- and the movie studios is an odd one. The papers need studio advertisements to survive. And the studios need the trade papers to promote their latest deals, spin the news and learn what rivals are doing.
In this sometimes strained symbiosis, studios hold the economic leverage but haven't used it for years. Until last week. 
 In an unusual move, 20th Century Fox stopped all movie studio advertising in The Hollywood Reporter indefinitely, a move intended to damage the trade paper financially. Though executives at the studio, which is owned by the News Corporation, insisted that the decision was based on long-standing unhappiness with the way the trade paper was covering Fox, editors at The Hollywood Reporter, and just about everyone else in town, said that the reason for the economic boycott was simple: studio anger at the caustic comments in the newspaper about the new Fox film "Fight Club." The film opened this weekend with disappointing ticket sales and as of Sunday was No. 3 at the box office. The movie is a violent fantasy about men who pummel each other and go to physical extremes because they view their lives as miserable.
What enraged Fox executives were two Hollywood Reporter articles about the movie in the last two weeks. One brief article, written by Anita M. Busch, the newspaper's editor, and Thom Geier, a reporter, said that the openings of the film in Los Angeles and New York had been disastrous. Producers and agents were quoted, anonymously, as saying the big-budget movie was "loathsome," "absolutely indefensible" and "deplorable on every level."
Last week, in a prominently displayed column, Ms. Busch said that the movie "has drawn more gut anger from the industry than I've ever heard." Ms. Busch added: "And for good reason."
Ms. Busch said that the film "will become Washington's poster child for what's wrong with Hollywood. And Washington, for once, will be right." She wrote: "The film is exactly the kind of product that lawmakers should target for being socially irresponsible in a nation that has deteriorated to the point of Columbine," a reference to the high-school shootings in Colorado.
Fox followed with an economic boycott. Several rival studio marketing chiefs said that Fox would never take such a step against a big newspaper like The Times Mirror Company's Los Angeles Times, which printed a devastating review of the movie on Friday but is hardly as vulnerable to studio pressures as a trade paper.
And they said that because the studio had taken pride in the movie's provocative nature, and admitted that it would polarize audiences, Fox should not respond angrily to condemnations of "Fight Club." "It's part of the bargain to get attacked when you make this kind of movie," one marketing executive said.
Robert J. Dowling, the publisher and editor in chief of the newspaper, told his staff at a Monday meeting that Fox had warned him of "consequences" as a result of the "Fight Club" coverage, according to a participant. The potential loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars for The Hollywood Reporter could have a direct impact on raises, bonuses, travel and other contingencies, people close to the newspaper said. The paper is owned by the Dutch company VNU, which also owns trade magazines like Billboard and Adweek.
Mr. Dowling and Ms. Busch declined to discuss the matter.
Whatever the reason, the message sent to The Hollywood Reporter, and its rival, Variety, which is owned by Reed Elsevier Inc., was unmistakable. Both newspapers depend for their survival on nearly a dozen film studios and production companies and, to a lesser degree, television network advertising. In fact, the trade papers earn a hefty share of their income from November to January, during the Academy Award season. That's when studios with Oscar-hopeful films spend as much as $700,000, and perhaps far more, on campaigns in each of the trade newspapers. Television studios may also allot about $300,000 a year in trade paper advertising, mostly for the Emmys, though HBO spends far more.
In addition, both newspapers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on ads placed by studios that appeal to the vanity of stars and filmmakers by congratulating them on their newest films and latest honorary awards.
The last time a Hollywood studio used leverage against a trade paper was in 1992, when Paramount stopped advertising in The Hollywood Reporter for at least four months after a series of articles that said, essentially, that the studio was using exploitative advertisements for the film "Juice," about Harlem teen-agers.
That year, Paramount took another unusual step. A studio spokesman said Paramount, now a unit of Viacom, would halt all company advertisements in Variety because of a scathing review of the film "Patriot Games." The editor of Variety, Peter Bart, sent a letter to Paramount executives, saying that the review, by Joseph McBride, "was, to put it in a word, unprofessional," and that the critic "will not review any more Paramount films." Mr. Bart later said the review was politically biased and did not address the artistic merits of the film, which negatively portrayed the Irish Republican Army. Mr. McBride later left the newspaper. Eventually, the advertising issue faded, though Mr. Bart said that the studio actually never stopped advertising.
But the studios learned the limits of their power in 1993. At the time, The Los Angeles Times was told by Columbia Studios, owned by Sony, that it was not welcome and that the studio was weighing a halt of its advertising in the newspaper, then $5 million a year. The reason? A Times article said that a research screening of "Last Action Hero" had taken place with poor results.
The studio said no such screening took place and demanded a correction and an assurance that the journalist who wrote the story would no longer cover the studio. The newspaper held its ground and in a few days, the issue faded. Michael Cieply, a Columbia producer, termed it "a tempest in an Evian bottle."

Design Fantasies for a Strip of the West Side

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
There are only three more days to see an exhibition of new designs for the redevelopment of the far West Side of mid-Manhattan. I strongly urge you to see the show, on display through Wednesday in Vanderbilt Hall, the former waiting room at Grand Central Terminal. The five proposals on view are not uniformly great, but each is packed with intelligence, energy and pure, raw city love. And one, by the British architect Cedric Price, is a gem.
The designs are finalists in a competition conceived by Phyllis Lambert, founding director of the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal. Every three years the competition (officially titled the International Foundation for the Canadian Center for Architecture Prize for the Design of Cities) will address the needs of a different city. New York was the chosen site for the inaugural year. 
 In addition to Mr. Price, the architects chosen to compete include Thom Mayne of Santa Monica, Calif.; Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto of New York, and Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos of Amsterdam. Peter Eisenman of New York won the competition and its $100,000 prize with a design developed with David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
The site for the competition is a 20-block strip of Manhattan that stretches from Eighth Avenue west to the Hudson River and is bound on the south by 30th Street and on the north by 34th. Included in the area is the General Post Office, formally known as the James A. Farley Building, which is scheduled to become the new Pennsylvania Station. Much of the site is occupied by a tangle of transportation infrastructure: train tracks, highway overpasses, tunnel entrances and bus parking.
The exhibition at Grand Central can be seen as an effort to fill the void left by the collapse of city planning in New York in recent decades. It is far from certain that architects are qualified to fill this vacuum, but it has become reasonably clear that local community boards aren't up to the task. Community activists can be highly effective at preventing projects from disrupting neighborhoods, but they have little interest in fostering new architecture of character and no reason to think about the vitality of the public realm beyond their own backyards.
Reactivating the public realm is the express concern of these five designs. How to draw people in? What combination of functions and forms can create a sense of place and a sense of time? The architectural teams are not your usual cast of warm, fuzzy people pleasers. No Hugh Hardy, no David Rockwell, no Jon Jerde. Rather, with the exception of Mr. Price, the competitors are known primarily as formalists. They set great stock in the pure esthetics of design, and their designs tend toward the cool and experimental.
The choice of these architects was clearly polemic. At a time when New York is stuck in the formulaic belief that the only way to attract people is by creating ersatz versions of the past, the competition's organizers hoped to stimulate innovative ideas for structuring social space.
Unfortunately Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, chose not to compete. But most of the projects on view display Mr. Koolhaas's influence, if not in form then in scale. His concept of bigness, advocated in his 1995 book "S, M, L, XL," is the ruling principle that enables these architects to justify what are, in essence, megastructures: oversize buildings that contain an urban array of functions. Too, Mr. Koolhaas's firm, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, established in 1975, has long advocated the expansion of architecture's sphere of influence over urban planning.
With the exception of Mr. Price, the finalists share some common traits. All use curves or waves to set the site area off from the surrounding regularity of the Manhattan grid. With varying degrees of looseness, they adopt the megastructural approach: bringing together urban activities within a large, comprehensive architectural framework.
The dense mix of functions -- offices, apartments, parks, indoor recreation, sports stadiums, shops -- corresponds to what Mr. Koolhaas has called New York's "culture of congestion." But it also holds appeal for developers eager to squeeze the last economic drop out of the city's limited land.
Perhaps New Yorkers will be most interested in the scheme proposed by Mr. Eisenman. I plan to write about this design later, along with another recent competition-winning proposal by Mr. Eisenman: a new cultural center for the Spanish pilgrimage town Santiago de Compostela. But I left Grand Central thinking that Mr. Price's design is the one that best deserves our attention before the exhibition closes.
Mr. Price, 65, is not well known in this country, but he has been a legendary figure in British architectural circles since the 1960's. His best-known project is the unbuilt Fun Palace, designed with the theatrical impresario Joan Littlewood in 1962. The work exerted considerable influence over the development of "high tech" architecture in the 1970's.
The Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, designed by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano in 1971, is clearly descended from Mr. Price's Fun Palace. And his palace is also an ancestor of the megastructural approach adopted by most of the finalists in New York.
Mr. Price, however, has taken a very different route here. Playing a game of one-upmanship, his plan is as mortifying as only an Englishman knows how to be. In the Grand Central exhibition, allegedly avant-garde architects are falling all over themselves trying to show that they can outdo the developers on the developers' terms, and Mr. Price just strolls casually onto the site as if he were hiking across a moor, takes a few deep breaths and says: "Oh, no. It would be best if we didn't build here at all. Instead of building, we ought to be thinking about taking things down." Another deep breath. "We'll call it 'A Lung for Midtown Manhattan.' "
Mr. Price's "lung" essentially treats the site as a rectangular nature preserve. Train tracks would remain uncovered. New development would be banned. Over time some existing buildings would be eliminated. The site would be marked with a sparkling covering composed of small glass spheres.
The east and west boundaries would be fitted with tunnel-like structures that Mr. Price calls sleeves. These would be places people could go in any weather to contemplate views of the city and the river. They would also channel air from the river into the heart of the city. A third observation post would be created by excising two floors from an existing building that straddles the tracks.
Mr. Price's one-upmanship style extends to his mode of presentation. Instead of the glamorous computer renderings used by the other contestants, he offers rough pencil sketches that look as if they could have been dashed off on napkins between sips of claret. Even the term sleeves evokes drop-dead informality: custom tailoring of such exquisite refinement that a jacket turns out looking utterly shapeless.
Yet the truth is that this design is really the only one of the five that reaches beyond the formal qualities of architecture to deal with the quality of urban life. Mr. Price's chief concern, very simply, is with public health. It aims to improve the air, the amount of available light and the psychological release that open space provides. It is, in effect, a park in which the archeology of the industrial city takes the place of pastoral landscaping.
The design probably never stood a chance of winning. It can't pass for practical. City officials had already defined the site as the city's next great development corridor. But the idea of practicality is completely relative in this context. None of the projects are officially authorized. None have clients. The quality they project is not reality, but rather realness, to employ a term coined by uptown drag queens. They are practicality impersonators, developers en travesti.
Mr. Price chose not to go along with the impersonation. No massive new construction. No sports stadiums. No urban bone crunching. No high-tech structural calisthenics. No hay to be made. Just a light dusting of glass frosting and a breeze blowing from the river. Just a place for a city to breathe.

Raise a Glass to the Effervescent View of Russia!

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The American who brought consumer capitalism to Russia 40 years ago came back for a visit last week -- to the reports of bribery and money laundering, to the Mercedesful of impeccably suited thugs, to the political wars among the lap-dog newspapers and television networks of too-wealthy tycoons, to the throngs of street urchins and dumpster-miners trampled in the stampede to wealth.
All in all, he said, it could have been worse. 
 "The changes are unbelievable," said Donald M. Kendall. "People keep talking about crime and corruption and not about the amazing things that have happened here. You can't believe the merchandise in the stores and the shopping centers.
"Go out on the street and look at the traffic jams, at the cars. They're not just Mercedes. The changes here go deeper than that."
Even to dream about such things a decade ago, he said, "would have been absolutely impossible."
It is tempting to many to write off Russia's experiment with capitalism thus far as a waste of a decade, or even a net loss. Mr. Kendall is that rarest of Americans, not to mention native Muscovites: someone who still believes that the Russian glass is half full.
More specifically, he believes it is half full of Pepsi-Cola. For Mr. Kendall will forever be known for making Pepsi the first American consumer product on Soviet restaurant menus and store shelves.
As a rising executive at the Pepsi-Cola Corporation in 1959, Mr. Kendall bucked his elders and set up fountain dispensers at Sokolniki Park in Moscow, where the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev and Vice President Richard M. Nixon were about to christen the first American trade exhibition ever held in the Soviet Union.
"I went to Nixon the night before, at the embassy, and told him I was in a lot of trouble at home because people thought I was wasting Pepsi's money coming to a Communist country," Mr. Kendall said the other night at a Moscow reception sponsored by the company. "I told him that somehow, I had to get a Pepsi in Khrushchev's hand."
Mr. Kendall got far more than he could have imagined. The next day, Sokolniki was the scene of the famous finger-wagging "kitchen debate" between Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Nixon. Mr. Kendall now recalls watching, transfixed, as the two men verbally slugged it out over the merits of capitalism and communism.
In mid-left-hook, Mr. Nixon steered Mr. Khrushchev to the Pepsi pavilion for sips of cola, some made with American water and some with Russian. Mr. Khrushchev declared the Moscow version clearly superior and ordered everyone around him to partake.
Pepsi reaped a publicity windfall the company's elders never expected. Mr. Kendall became C.E.O. in 1965. A decade after that he negotiated a monopoly for Pepsi on cola sales with Mr. Khrushchev's successors that stood until the Soviet Union fell eight years ago.
And Mr. Kendall, who was merely seeking a toehold on a market his arch-nemesis, Coca-Cola, had not penetrated, discovered something more: an affinity for Russia that has become a personal cause, and a conviction that however bad things seem now, they will get better.
In that sense, his presence in Moscow last week for a slightly belated celebration of the July anniversary of the Sokolniki event, may have been a tonic. Although the occasion was marked by a banquet in the Kremlin Palace and speeches by Ambassador James Collins and others, it is safe to say that neither side feels a lot like celebrating.
Americans, burned by Russia's 1998 economic crash and intimidated by the scale of corruption, have reined in their business dealings here. Russians feel humiliated by privation and are seething over the American brouhaha about corruption -- a problem they say Americans ignored as long as it benefited them.
One of those Russians, Georgi Arbatov, dined last week with Mr. Kendall, the former Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, and other veterans of the Pepsi era of good feeling.
Mr. Arbatov, a familiar face to cold war Americans as director of the Institute for U.S.-Canada Studies, takes a more dyspeptic view of things. Mr. Kendall is a friend and a smart businessman, he said in a long interview last week, but his analysis of Russia's future is distinctly rose-colored.
"Shock therapy was a complete disaster for Russia," Mr. Arbatov said, using the shorthand for the effort to convert Russia overnight to a capitalist system. "There is tremendous polarization. On one side people have luxury cars and overseas bank accounts; on the other living standards have dropped tremendously.
"We were tremendously ideological. Ideology was like a religion. And suddenly, we lost the ideology, and the only god that exists is the greenback."
Mr. Kendall allowed that it is important to acknowledge the failures, and just as important to remember that the United States also has had its share of robber-baron tycoons, mafias, economic panics and corruption scandals.
Now retired for 13 years as the head of Pepsico Inc., Mr. Kendall is president of the East-West Institute, an organization broadly devoted to better understanding and relationships between Russia and the West. In that capacity, he argues that turning one's back on Russia at its low point would be a huge mistake.
"I was always convinced that we had to open this place up instead of isolating it, and I still am," he said. "It's going to come out in the end because they've got a younger generation here that's well-educated and doesn't want to go back to the past."
Just as he was in 1959, Mr. Kendall is in a minority. Asked what lies in Russia's immediate future, for example, Mr. Arbatov said simply, "Nothing good." Still, he acknowledged that he has been mistaken before. "I was at Sokolniki that day, with my wife and my boy, and we tasted Pepsi-Cola," he said. "And I must tell you -- almost none of the Russians liked it."

HEADLINE: Peace Changing the Face of the Prairie

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LANGDON, N.D.

 BODY:
Beneath the flat, broad plains of North Dakota, where the push of a button could have ignited a nuclear attack, the earth is exploding.
It is the sound of peace. 
 In a thunderous exclamation point to the end of the cold war, some 150 steel and concrete silos, once the launching tunnels of the nuclear Minuteman III missiles, are being blown to bits by dynamite.
"The silos were part of our everyday landscape, social and physical," said Carol Goodman, who farms near one of the missile sites with her husband, Bernie. "In so many ways, it set the rhythm of life in North Dakota. Now they'll be gone."
To fulfill the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the Grand Forks Air Force Base is overseeing the destruction in North Dakota of roughly one silo a week for the next three years. The first two silos were demolished just weeks ago. The nuclear missiles themselves were removed from 1995 to 1998. In all, 150 silos in North Dakota will be destroyed, with the next dynamiting scheduled for Wednesday.
Veit & Company, a demolition contractor, is destroying the silos, which reach more than 60 feet into the earth. Workers lace each silo with more than 800 pounds of dynamite, ammonia nitrate and fuel oil.
The first explosion, triggered at a site outside this little farm town of 2,335 people in northeastern North Dakota, about five miles from the Canadian border, sent chunks of concrete soaring 100 feet into the air.
"It's the end of an era," said Dick Parrish, a spokesman for Veit. "It makes you stop when you think what could have been."
Like other Americans, people in North Dakota say they are grateful that the end of cold war hostilities has made the nuclear sites unnecessary. But there has been no small measure of nostalgia for the arsenal that put prairie towns like Langdon in the center of world affairs.
In a place accustomed to a familiar, ordered world anchored by straight, square sections of cropland, the missile program brought thousands of newcomers from all over the country. Business in North Dakota, which had been hemorrhaging population since the 1930's, suddenly boomed -- rents soared, schools burgeoned and churches sprang up.
"Some of the older people saw it as an invasion," said Dawn Roppel, president of the Langdon School Board, who was a high school student here when the missile silos were being built. "But it was great for business."
To many North Dakotans, it was a time of social stimulation. Over a cup of coffee and a piece of rhubarb pie, longtime residents here would talk with their visitors and learn more about life in distant regions.
To some people, the concentration of nuclear firepower made North Dakota a likely target in an enemy attack. But more North Dakotans saw the missile bases as a shield.
"To me, it looked like protection, not a threat," said Bill Verwey, a grain elevator manager and former Mayor of nearby Nekoma, population 102. "If there was trouble, we were in the best place."
Whatever the case, North Dakotans were apt to go along with whatever the United States military deemed necessary.
"People here are pretty trusting," Mrs. Roppel said. "If the Government tells you it's going to be all right, you believe them. I don't know if that's trusting or naive."
But the ominous potential of the missiles was impossible to deny.
In a public meeting in September 1962, before the missile silos were built, a farmer asked an Air Force representative what effect the launching of missiles would have on his milk cows.
"None," the Air Force spokesman said. "If these missiles are launched, we will be at war. The milk cows would be the least of your problems."
When the missile unit at Grand Forks was disbanded last year, the Air Force cut more than 1,700 jobs. It was a bruising blow in a farm state already hard hit by rock-bottom prices for spring wheat, oats, barley and other crops.
"You can't raise $5 wheat and get $3 back," Mrs. Goodman said. "At least, you can't do it for very long."
Young North Dakotans, whose scores in college admissions tests routinely rank among the highest in the nation, have done the math. They continue to leave the state in large numbers.
"Sure, my boys would like to stay and farm," said Mrs. Goodman, whose oldest sons went to college to study economics, preparing for life behind a desk. "It's just not possible."
The county's population stood at about 6,200 in the 1990 census, but most officials acknowledge a decline of 800 or 900 people since then.
Looking for an economic savior, most people here hold out hopes that a new missile system will be based in North Dakota. The Soviet Union no longer exists, the North Dakotans say, but other troubles lurk.
In the most likely scenario, the land used for missile sites will be sold for farmland, said Staff Sgt. Rob Mims in Grand Forks, just as it was used before the cold war.
For years, farmers would tend crops right up to the fences that marked the missile sites, riding tractors and combines as they might anywhere else. The one difference, though, was that a uniformed airman stood watch nearby.
"You'd be plowing, and look over to see the airman with a gun, watching you, watching you all the time," Mrs. Roppel said. "That could give you the heebie-jeebies."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Towering Case Of Trump Writ Large

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IN an apparently unprecedented action, Donald J. Trump revealed on Friday that he is not fond of a sign on a building that spells out his name.
"Too glitzy," Mr. Trump said, referring to the four-foot-high gold-colored letters proclaiming T-R-U-M-P on the facade of the General Motors building. "Too shiny. Some people love the color. I don't love it." 
 Mr. Trump did not name the people who love the sign, and thus far it has not been possible to locate any of them. It has been easier to find people who share Mr. Trump's distaste for the gleaming letters, which appeared in late spring on a building that many New Yorkers would prefer to ignore altogether.
The skyscraper, which Mr. Trump bought with partners last year and renamed the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza, has always seemed out of place to architects. Some of them vainly picketed in the 1960's to save its predecessor, the Savoy Plaza, a hotel whose facade on Fifth Avenue elegantly framed one of the city's great public spaces, Grand Army Plaza.
That classic frame was ruined with the stark 50-story building set back from the sidewalk to make room for a woebegone little plaza with a sunken pit. But whatever the faults of the old G.M. building, at least it didn't have huge golden letters.
Two months ago Mr. Trump sounded proud of the letters, telling The New Yorker that they were titanium and "really expensive." Praising the way the letters were molded to wrap around the marble columns, he said, "The sign guy is a genius."
The building's tenants were not so impressed. Some complained about the big sign, as well as four smaller but equally shiny TRUMP signs at the corners -- two above F.A.O. Schwarz, the toy store at the 58th Street side, and two above the new CBS studio on the 59th Street side, where next month the network will begin broadcasting its revamped morning program.
On Friday, Mr. Trump said that he had assuaged the tenants' concerns, and that the gold-colored signs had never been intended to be permanent. The two corner signs facing Fifth Avenue will vanish, he said, making it possible for CBS to show an external shot of the throng outside its studio without giving Mr. Trump a free ad.
Mr. Trump said his name will remain in the other three spots -- at the center of the Fifth Avenue facade, and on the corners facing the side streets -- but in less gleaming style. The titanium letters will be replaced within a few weeks, he said, with letters the same size and shape made of bronze with an antique finish. "They're going to be very beautiful, very high-level material," he said.
AMONG architects who have heard the news, the reaction has been less than ecstatic.
"Well, bronze has a luster and a depth and a quietness that would be commendable," said Robert A. M. Stern, the New York architect and dean of the Yale School of Architecture. "Bronze would be better than gold, and fewer signs would be better than more. None would be better still. The building speaks for itself. Sometimes it's nice to hide your light under a bushel a little -- but that's not Donald."
No, it's not, as Mr. Trump is the first to acknowledge. "It's a branding thing," he said. "By putting the brand on the building, I can get more rent per square foot, solely and simply because of the Trump name."
He seems to be right about that, judging from the record-breaking rents he has collected in the G.M. building and other properties. Still, might people pay just as much to be in a Trump building that didn't scream his name? In this case, a more subtle brand might be better public relations.
One alternative, Mr. Stern noted, would be to highlight Mr. Trump's plans for landscaping the plaza and covering up the sunken pit. "What Donald is doing on the plaza is a huge improvement," he said. "Maybe there's a way to take the letters off the building and put them in the plaza instead."
That idea was passed along to Mr. Trump, whose reaction was less than ecstatic. "Well, it's certainly something I could look into," he said diplomatically, and explained again that the four-foot-high TRUMP had nothing to do with his ego. "It's purely economic. We put it there because people want to see it."
But couldn't they be satisfied without the sign? People don't need giant letters to know who built Rockefeller Center. And they probably appreciate his discretion.
"But Rockefeller Center doesn't get nearly the rent that I get," Mr. Trump said.

HEADLINE: DEVISING NEW MATH TO DEFINE POVERTY

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
The Census Bureau has begun to revise its definition of what constitutes poverty in the United States, experimenting with a formula that would drop millions more families below the poverty line.
The bureau's new approach would in effect raise the income threshold for living above poverty to $19,500 for a family of four, from the $16,600 now considered sufficient. Suddenly, 46 million Americans, or 17 percent of the population, would be recognized as officially below the line, not the 12.7 percent announced last month, the lowest level in nearly a decade. 
 A strong economy has undoubtedly lifted many families, but not nearly as many as the official statistics suggest.
"It is certainly our opinion, and the opinion of every researcher we have talked to, that something should be done to update the poverty measure," said Edward Welniak, chief of the Census Bureau's Income Statistics Branch.
Fixing a poverty line has always been a subjective endeavor. The current formula was created for President Lyndon B. Johnson to keep score in his "war on poverty" and has remained unchanged since 1965 except for adjustments for inflation. It is based on a minimal food budget that no longer represents American eating habits or spending. The Census Bureau's new Experimental Poverty Measures are an effort to determine what poor people must spend on food, clothing, housing and life's little extras.
"There is no scientific way to set a new poverty line," said Rebecca M. Blank, dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. "What there is here are a set of judgment calls, now being made, about what is needed to lift people to a socially acceptable standard of living."
Sociologists and economists who study what people must earn to escape poverty in the United States place the line even higher than the Census Bureau's experimental measures, which were published in July and are now the focus of a growing debate. They put the threshold for a family of four somewhere between $21,000 and $28,000. That is partly because the bureau's criteria, based largely on a study by the National Academy of Sciences, do not allow extra cash for emergencies -- to fix a car, say, or repair a leaky roof, or to buy health insurance.
Ordinary Americans, in opinion polls, draw the poverty line above $20,000, saying it takes at least that much, if not more, to "get along in their community," to "live decently" or to avoid hardship.
But a higher threshold means government spending would rise to pay for benefits tied to the poverty level, like food stamps and Head Start. That would require an incursion into the budget surplus that neither Republicans nor Democrats seek.
Not surprising, the White House, which would have to authorize a change in the poverty formula, is proceeding cautiously. "We have at least a couple of years more work to do," an Administration official said, passing the decision for redefining poverty to the next administration.
For Crystal McConnell and Austin Johnson, an Indianapolis couple, the poverty line, in their view, is definitely north of the $22,250 they expect to earn this year -- even in Indianapolis, where incomes and living costs closely match the national average.
The couple do not seem poor. They live in a rented brick bungalow in a neighborhood of similarly modest, well-kept homes. The brightly colored plastic toys of their two sons are strewn about the living room, which is furnished comfortably with faux-leather sofas placed around a glass and wood coffee table.
But on a recent visit, the refrigerator was nearly empty. Five small packages of pork chops and chicken parts had to serve as the centerpiece of family meals for 11 days, when there would again be money for food.
"We go to my mom's after church sometimes for lunch, and during the week sometimes for dinner," Mr. Johnson said.
Mr. Johnson, 24, and Ms. McConnell, 22, have full-time jobs. As commuters occupying a home in a presentable neighborhood, they hardly fit American images of hardscrabble lives. But poverty licks at them.
Mr. Johnson is without health insurance, which he considers beyond the family's means. Once his provisional job as a load planner -- balancing the weight of cargo loaded onto jet aircraft -- becomes a permanent one, company health insurance will kick in. Meanwhile, the family goes into debt. Ms. McConnell has health insurance from the community center where she is a caseworker. But she did not have insurance last year and owes a hospital $630 for emergency-room treatment of her foot, injured in a car accident.
Housing, like health insurance, is a big hurdle. The poor are twice as likely as the nonpoor to rent rather than own their homes, according to a Labor Department study.
That is the pattern in Indianapolis, where housing costs are right at the national median. When the poor do buy homes, subsidies often grease the way, as they will for Florence Farmer, a 36-year-old single mother of two sons. The West Side Development Corporation, publicly subsidized, is renovating homes in rundown Indianapolis neighborhoods and giving away the down payments. Not many of the homes are available, but Ms. Farmer got one for $50,000, qualifying with her medical secretary's income of $17,000, an amount $4,000 above the official poverty level for a family her size. Her mortgage payment, $416 a month, the maximum she says she can afford, will be almost the same as what she now pays to rent a two-bedroom house.
Mr. Johnson and Ms. McConnell are struggling to stay in a neighborhood with a good public school for their elder son, Cyrin, who is 4. They moved to their three-bedroom bungalow in January, paying $600 a month in rent, a sum Ms. McConnell says they cannot really afford. The October rent came due on the first and was paid, but not the utilities, which were also due. The couple gambled that gas and electricity would not be cut off before their next paychecks, in midmonth. The nation's poor are four times as likely as the nonpoor to have their utilities cut off, the Labor Department found in its study. That has been Ms. Farmer's experience more than once.
The Indiana Economic Development Council, concerned about the proliferation of low-wage service jobs, has produced "basic needs" budgets for families here. The council concluded, for example, that a single parent with one or two children, working full-time, needs $20,700 to stay out of poverty -- not counting child-care costs.
Greg Schrock, a researcher for the council, which works to attract companies and new jobs to Indiana, said, "We have to understand where the economy is moving in terms of job creation, and it is unrealistic to think that we will move away from the creation of lower-wage jobs in the service and hospitality industries."
Such concerns played no role in creating the poverty formula now in use. Seeking good numbers in his war on poverty, President Johnson resisted setting the initial poverty threshold too high. Finally he approved a formula based on a food budget intended to provide barely sufficient nutrition -- and then only if "the housewife is a careful shopper, a skillful cook and a good manager who will prepare all the family's meals at home."
To arrive at a poverty threshold, the bare food budget was multiplied by three; at the time, food was one-third of the average family's purchases. Today it is about one-fifth, but neither the formula nor the original food budget has ever changed. The original poverty threshold has been adjusted each year since to allow for inflation, and that is all.
The new thinking has several facets. It redefines income to include for the first time noncash income like food stamps and rent subsidies. It puts child care and other work-related expenses in a separate category because they vary so much from family to family. And it tries to determine what a low-income family must spend in the 1990's not only to survive, but to preserve a reasonable amount of self-respect.
A telephone is considered essential. So is housing in good repair. Clothing is no longer just to keep warm or covered; looking decent is a critical status symbol. That is why Isaac Pinner, 16 and in ninth grade, and his sister, Lea, 12 and in seventh grade, insist they are not poor. Sitting in the living room of their rundown rented home with their mother, Julie Pinner, 35, a receptionist and clerk, they resent her decision to talk to a reporter about poverty. "I get what I want," Lea said, and Isaac agreed. "Why talk to us?" he asked.
Judging by their clothes, they do not seem poor, although their mother's income of $15,500, including a rent subsidy, while higher than the official poverty line for a single mother of two, puts the Pinners right at the dividing line in the Census Bureau's experimental measures.
"They think I am richer than I am," said Ms. Pinner, who noted that the gas was turned off recently when she could not pay the bill. She also lacks money to fix her car.
"But," Ms. Pinner said of her children, "he wears the latest Nike brand shoes and she the latest Levi's. I like them to look nice, and here in the ghetto there are standards of dress. If they don't dress up to the standards, other kids tend to pick on them. I am not the only poor person who dresses her kids."
Most proposed definitions of poverty include a car -- an old one -- which is deemed necessary not only for work but for the odd outing, or the supermarket. "Not having a car is a big dividing line between the poor and the not so poor," said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
More often than not, poor Indianapolis families own used cars, but they are often at risk. Austin Johnson, for example, says he cannot afford car insurance. Neither can Nevada Owens, who is also short of money to fix a flat tire. She drives her 1985 Delta Oldsmobile with a spare doughnut tire permanently on a rear wheel. The car was a gift from her church, but the cost of gasoline for this guzzler eats up 7 percent of her $17,300 in annual income.
Her income, from welfare, food stamps, rent and tuition subsidies and a $3,000 gift from her mother, puts Ms. Owens, a single mother, and her three children just above the official poverty line. But at 21, studying to be a licensed practical nurse, she needs the car. The course work requires her to travel from her school to two different hospitals, about 25 miles a day.
Then there is the Saturday outing in Ms. Owens's old car, which she drives to her grandfather's home in a rural area outside the city -- the one family luxury. "We have a cookout," she said, "and the kids play on the swings and my mother comes over -- she lives two doors away. We have a good time."
In a 1993 study of impoverished single mothers, published as the book "Making Ends Meet," Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, reported that the mothers found themselves forced to spend more than their acknowledged incomes. They got the difference from family members, absent boyfriends, off-the-books jobs and church charity.
"No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures," Ms. Edin said recently, "such as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them, or the cable subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Help Ford Deliver 11% ProfitGain in Quarter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Strong sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars in the United States gave the Ford Motor Company better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, even as the company acknowledged severe problems in its European operations.
Ford said today that it had earned $1.11 billion, or 90 cents a share, up 11 percent from the third quarter last year, when it earned $1 billion, or 80 cents a share. It beat analysts' profit expectations of 85 cents a share. 
 Ford's gain would have been even larger except for a one-time charge of $125 million for retirement health care and life insurance costs at an auto parts division, the company said.
Investors focused today on the company's strong overall earnings, bidding up Ford's stock in a weak market. Shares rose $1.50, to $52.0625.
Ford has profited, particularly in North America, by discontinuing slow-selling, unprofitable car models and replacing them with more lucrative models. Successful new models include the Lincoln LS sports sedan, the Jaguar S-type sedan and the Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle.
W. Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman and chief financial officer, acknowledged today in the bluntest terms used yet that the company was having problems in Europe. Ford's European operations lost $171 million in the third quarter despite profits from its Volvo Cars and Jaguar divisions in Europe, and despite the success there of the Ford Focus compact sedan.
"I guess it's an indication of the magnitude of the other problems," that the European operations lost money despite those three successes, Mr. Booker said at a news conference today at Ford's headquarters here in a southwestern suburb of Detroit. Ford has been losing market share in Europe as rival auto makers, particularly Volkswagen A.G., have introduced more exciting car designs.
Ford lost $273 million in Europe in the third quarter of 1998, but that included high costs for the introduction of the Focus. The company said today that "Ford does not expect to achieve its 1999 milestone for Europe to improve operating earnings year over year."
The company also announced a management shake-up on Friday aimed partly at improving results in Europe. The new structure will give more autonomy to Ford's European operations, which have been run mainly from here in recent years.
Ford's South American automotive operations have also been losing money, partly because of economic problems in Brazil but also because Ford did not invest in new models and factories there until recently. Ford lost $72 million in the third quarter, compared with a $44 million loss a year earlier.
By contrast, Ford earned $1 billion from North American automotive operations in the quarter, despite setting aside $100 million for a continuing program of reducing white-collar employment through voluntary-departure incentives. Ford, which did not declare the $100 million as a one-time charge, had earned $896 million in the region a year earlier.
Rod A. Lache, an auto analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, predicted that Ford would continue to do well at home while struggling overseas. "The North American earnings are going to keep getting better and the rest are going to be nonfactors for Ford as a whole," he said.
Ford's cash reserves swelled to $25.7 billion, compared with $22.9 billion a year earlier. Despite occasional criticisms from institutional investors and Wall Street analysts, Ford has been conserving cash to prepare for the next recession and for possible mergers.
The auto parts subsidiary, Visteon Automotive Systems, which Ford is expected to spin off soon, earned $155 million in the third quarter excluding the one-time charge, which occurred when an outside actuarial analysis of a Visteon division caused Ford to conclude that it had been underestimating costs for retiree health care and life insurance. Ford officials declined to identify the division, saying only that it was small and that they did not believe other divisions had similar problems. Visteon earned $148 million a year earlier.
Ford Credit, the auto loans and leases division, earned $317 million in the third quarter, up from $272 million a year ago. The Hertz Corporation, the car rental business in which Ford owns an 80 percent stake, earned $139 million, up from $119 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A Call for Equal Access for All Investors

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, stepped up his campaign against selective disclosure yesterday, asking companies to let all investors take part in conference calls about important information.
"I appeal to companies, in the spirit of fair play: Make your quarterly conference calls open to everyone, post them on the Internet, invite the press," Mr. Levitt said in a speech to the New York Economic Club. 
 The point is to give all investors equal access to potentially market-moving information, Mr. Levitt said. The commission will consider rules in the next few months "to close the gap between those in the so-called 'know' and the rest of us in the public," he said.
The Microsoft Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores and the Exxon Corporation, for example, have failed to invite all shareholders to take part in telephone conference calls in recent months in which company officials discussed earnings, investments and other matters with analysts and institutional investors.
Mr. Levitt also criticized what he called a "web of dysfunctional relationships" among companies, brokerage analysts who follow their performance, and securities firms that rely on their analysts to help get underwriting business.
"In many respects, analysts' employers expect them to act more like promoters and marketers than unbiased and dispassionate analysts," Mr. Levitt said, adding that analysts who "go against the grain" may be excluded from conference calls or "even silenced" by their own firms.
"Analysts' compensation is increasingly based on the profitability of their firm's corporate finance division, and their contribution to the deals to which they are assigned," Mr. Levitt said.
Taking another step to provide access to more information, the commission, he said, would issue a preliminary proposal to form a central national stock market that would require electronic links among competing domestic markets, allowing investors to see the best prices to buy or sell shares on any of the markets.
Mr. Levitt also suggested concern about one of the staples of the initial public offering process -- the meetings in several cities where company officials and their investment bankers hold closed-door sessions with institutional investors. Mr. Levitt said, "While roadshows obviously serve a valued purpose, they shouldn't be the vehicle for giving a very different look at the company that's not in the prospectus," he said.
Louis Thompson, head of the National Investor Relations Institute, which represents corporate investor relations executives, said some changes might be necessary, though "our capital markets are working pretty darn well." Some companies have already changed their disclosure procedures. Amazon.com and the Iomega Corporation, for example, broadcast calls over the Internet.
Conagra Inc., the second-largest United States food company, has let all shareholders listen to executives discuss its results, after it was criticized for a March call that included analysts and portfolio managers. Conagra shares fell 9 percent that day.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Coca-Cola will try to promote its top brand with more emotion.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott and Constance L. Hays 

 BODY:
THE Coca-Cola Company, the maker of the world's best-known brand, will soon be exhorting consumers to take what amounts to a magical mystery tour of the mouth by enjoying the "unique taste sensation" and "sparkle on your tongue" of its flagship product.
Starting early next year, the company will promote its best-selling brand -- known as Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere -- in more emotional, elemental ways intended to resonate with consumers who tell market researchers they value attributes like authenticity and optimism and have been eschewing colas in favor of beverages like water, juices and flavored teas. 
 The overhaul of the flagship brand's advertising, marketing, promotions and graphics, which amounts to a re-introduction of the venerable soft drink, will end campaigns that have carried the theme "Always Coca-Cola" since 1993. The changes will also involve a revamping of Coca-Cola's relationship with its myriad agencies around the world as the task of providing strategy for sales pitches is centralized and the duties for creating ads for the flagship brand are assigned to a shorter list of shops.
Charles S. Frenette, chief marketing officer at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, outlined the new magic-tinged methods of selling Coke in a 90-minute interview yesterday at the company's New York office in midtown Manhattan. While he described as premature discussion of details like the new brand theme, he discussed generally a sweeping overhaul of how Coca-Cola will be sold, from redesigning employee uniforms to increasing the availability of modern versions of Coke's traditional contoured bottle.
Mr. Frenette's talk of "fireworks on the tongue" and "a little magic" generated by quaffing what he acknowledged was "just a soft drink" sounded like phrases lifted from the pages of the Harry Potter books. Indeed, Coca-Cola could use such sorcery to enliven sales of its flagship brand, which have been inching forward worldwide but more slowly than during the 1970's and 1980's.
"Coca-Cola Classic has held its own through the 90's," said Gary Hemphill, vice president at the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a research, data and consulting company in New York. "But they always want to do better."
"Coca-Cola has gotten big by thinking small," he added, "emphasizing broad-based marketing themes and focusing locally. It's Coke's challenge to connect better with consumers."
The new campaigns for Coca-Cola will cover the United States and overseas markets, where Coke sales have been disappointing in the last year, hampered by economic crises and retail price increases.
The reason "Always" is not forever is that although it "served us extremely well," Mr. Frenette said, it was perhaps more about "Coca-Cola the institution" than "Coca-Cola the brand."
"The strategy we're embarking upon is one of reconnecting with consumers today," he added, by offering them "an invitation to view life through the optimistic lens that Coke provides."
"We're finding people looking for touchstones," he added, "that are real and dependable and genuine."
Drinking a Coke is "just a simple moment of refreshment," Mr. Frenette said. "We don't make the moment, the consumer does; we just add a little magic."
The new campaigns will be centered on a "core proposition," a strategic statement developed by Coca-Cola and shared with the agencies: "Only the unique sensory experience of an ice-cold Coca-Cola brings a magical delight to the real moments of my life."
And clearly the executives have spent considerable time thinking about that. Mr. Frenette described Coca-Cola as offering "enjoyment inextricably linked to the power of the secret formula" and discussed how "it awakens all of your senses."
The chief method to convey those intangibles will be to focus on the contoured green-tinted glass bottle, the only Coca-Cola container until the 1950's. The bottle -- originally six and a half ounces, now eight -- has appeared recently on Coca-Cola labels, signs and ads and inspired a successful line of 20-ounce contoured plastic bottles.
Now the smaller bottle -- with the word "Coca-Cola" embossed in glass again -- will play an even more prominent role to help prod sales. The company plans tactics from samplings in malls to contests to installing ice chests at convenience stores. Even so, Mr. Frenette said its role would be mainly promotional, adding that he expected American consumers to keep buying Coke in cans and plastic bottles.
"That bottle is a metaphor for Coca-Cola, a metaphor of what's inside," said Mr. Frenette, who took over as the marketing chief 18 months ago from Sergio Zyman. "When that bottle is in your hand, it says something."
One analyst who follows Coca-Cola, Emanuel Goldman at Merrill Lynch, praised the initiative because, he said, Coke in smaller containers tastes better: "By the time you're down to the lower part of the 64-ounce bottle, you've lost the fizz. They're trying to remind people the name of the game is refreshment."
Another reminder will be the new graphics, produced by Lipson Alport Glass & Associates in Northbrook, Ill., along with an in-house team at Coca-Cola. The graphics show the brand's name in larger type under the word "Enjoy," which has been identified with Coke for decades. There is also a glass bottle tipped to one side, its metal cap off and the contents fizzing up and out. The familiar red disk logo, in one design, is topped with crushed ice.
That emphasis on chilled Coca-Cola evokes the major investments that bottlers have made, at the company's urging, in refrigerator cases and other equipment. For instance, one bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, announced a $5.2 billion investment plan last summer, much of which was for such equipment.
The exhortation to "enjoy" Coke comes as its primary competitor, Pepsi-Cola -- sold by the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc. -- urges consumers to taste "the joy of cola." The current Pepsi-Cola campaign, by the BBDO New York unit of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, is centered on an upbeat jingle infused with a perception of bubbly fun.
"This is not 'The joy of cola' but the enjoyment of life," Mr. Frenette said. "We're pretty confident we can stand on our own."
As for the agency relationships, Mr. Frenette played down reports of a shake-up in creative responsibilities. Rather, he described a process that would be streamlined to place "more focus" on a short list of shops that have been considered first for Coca-Cola work in various countries.
He listed: the Leo Burnett Company unit of Leo Group; D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Communications, part of MacManus Group; Doner; Edge Creative, the lead creative agency in the United States; McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Publicis, part of Publicis S.A., and Wieden & Kennedy.
"The difference is that they'll all be working off a common strategy," Mr. Frenette said. "And the winners are the ones who do the best work."
With earnings shortfalls a problem, the company does not expect to significantly increase its marketing budget to pay for the new campaigns, Mr. Frenette said.

HEADLINE: Warner-Lambert Profit Rises; American Home Shows a Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Warner-Lambert Company said yesterday that its third-quarter profit was up 38 percent, lifted by sales of its prescription drugs and consumer products, but a rival drug maker, the American Home Products Corporation, posted a loss of $2.9 billion after setting aside cash to pay for the settlement of litigation related to its fen-phen diet drug.
Warner-Lambert, which makes Listerine mouthwash and Dentyne chewing gum, said net income rose to $417 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $302 million, or 34 cents a share, for the 1998 period. The performance matched estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 Sales reached $3.2 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the corresponding period in the previous year.
Shares in Warner-Lambert, which is based in Morris Plains, N.J., were up $2.6875, to $70.5625.
Overall sales in the pharmaceutical segment, largest of the company's three business divisions, increased 30 percent, to $2 billion.
Pharmaceutical sales were driven by continued growth of the Lipitor cholesterol-lowering drug. Worldwide sales of Lipitor increased 72 percent, to $981 million for the quarter.
Warner-Lambert now controls about 44 percent of the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, compared with 20 percent for its leading rival, Merck & Company, the maker of Zocor, according to the market research firm IMS Health.
The Neurontin anticonvulsant product also had strong sales gains -- up 79 percent, to $237 million.
"We were able to achieve exceptional financial results while continuing to invest heavily behind a pharmaceutical pipeline that is the most promising in the company's history," said Lodewijk J. R. de Vink, the chairman of Warner-Lambert, noting that the company increased research and development investment by 35 percent, to $347 million.
Sales for the consumer health care segment increased 10 percent to $761 million, led by strong sales of Listerine, up 7 percent, to $115 million.
Sales increased 2 percent for the Adams confectionery segment, to $482 million. Dentyne was the segment's best-performing brand, with sales up 21 percent, to $39 million.
American Home said it lost $2.9 billion, or $2.20 a share, after setting aside $3.5 billion for the fen-phen settlement and other one-time items. A year earlier, the company, which is based in Madison, N.J., earned $619 million, or 46 cents a share. Sales increased to $3.32 billion from $3.22 billion.
Excluding the charges, American Home earned $633 million, or 48 cents a share, which was one cent better than analysts surveyed by First Call had forecast.
The company's stock was up $1.25, at $46.1875.
American Home said earlier this month that it had agreed to pay $4.8 billion over a period of up to 16 years as part of a national settlement of thousands of fen-phen liability lawsuits.
The company also took a one-time charge of $220 million for revamping the poor-performing Cyanamid crop-protection business and for buybacks of herbicide products.
American Home said its results were helped by rising sales of its estrogen replacement and arthritis drugs. The company, which markets the Premarin female hormone replacement drugs and rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, said its drug sales increased 10 percent in the third quarter, to $2.6 billion.
Sales in the consumer health division, including over-the-counter products like the painkiller Advil and Centrum vitamins, rose 7 percent, to $606.6 million.
Sales of agricultural products sales dropped 57 percent, to $130.2 million.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Investors Continue to Be Hesitant As Stocks Finish the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, but investors remained hesitant and analysts said there were no indications that the recent steep slide in the market had ended.
Led by shares of banks, which posted strong third-quarter earnings, the Dow Jones industrial average staged a late surge and closed nearly 100 points higher. But technology shares, led lower by Dell Computer, remained weak, and the Nasdaq composite index, which registered a new high on Oct. 11, fell for the fourth time in five sessions. 
 Dell, which lost 1 1/2, to 41 5/16, dropped further in after-hours trading after announcing that rising prices for computer memory chips in the wake of last month's earthquake in Taiwan would hurt third-quarter profit. Analysts said Dell, a bellwether for the industry, could drag down the technology sector today. Page C6.
At the close yesterday, the Dow was up 96.57 points, or 1 percent, to 10,116.28, led by J. P. Morgan, Citigroup and big drug stocks like Merck and Johnson & Johnson.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.72 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,254.13, as gains in stocks like Wal-Mart Stores and Bristol-Myers Squibb offset big declines in computer makers and highfliers like Lucent Technologies.
The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply, but the losses were far worse with an hour left in the trading day.
At the close, the index was down 42.68 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,689.15. Earlier, the index was down nearly 100 points. Since it peaked on Columbus Day, the index has plummeted 226 points, or nearly 8 percent.
"The Dow stocks led the tech stocks higher," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market analyst at Legg Mason in Baltimore. "As the Dow improved, that at least got traders to cover their shorts in the Nasdaq composite."
Traders said that most of the worries that had been plaguing the stock market for months remained in place. The dominant concern is today's report from the Labor Department on consumer prices. On Friday, the market swooned after the Government reported that producer prices posted their biggest one-month gain in nine years.
"I don't think the selling is over," said Ned Collins, head stock trader at Daiwa Securities America. "With the consumer price report coming on Tuesday, the threat of a Fed rate hike still there and worries about Y2K, it is hard to tell people they have to own stocks."
Those concerns, particularly worries about interest rates, have pushed many investors to the sidelines. "We have been waiting and worrying about the Fed since May," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "That worry has taken about 10 percent to 20 percent out of daily trading volume since then."
Yesterday's session was again noteworthy for fairly low trading volume. On the New York Stock Exchange, 818.7 million shares changed hands. Trading volume on the Nasdaq stock market was a total of 997.3 million shares.
J. P. Morgan, which has seen its stock fall sharply over the last two months, was the Dow's best performer yesterday.
Shares of the bank holding company, which reported third-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, jumped 7 5/16, to 113.
Investors also rewarded Citigroup, another Dow component that reported strong earnings. The stock closed at 43 11/16, up 1 3/16.
Drug stocks also had a good day.
Merck, a Dow component, rose 1 15/16, to 72 3/16. Bristol-Myers Squibb was up 1 1/4, to 71 1/2. And Warner- Lambert, which reported strong earnings, gained 2 11/16, to 70 9/16.
On a day when interest-rate sensitive bank and financial stocks were rising, fears about further increases in rates helped to push down technology stocks.
In addition to Dell, Intel fell 1 1/2, to 69 3/8; Lucent dropped 1 5/8, to 57 3/8, and Oracle shed 1 1/8, to 43 7/8.
Investors continued to batter companies that come to market with bad news. Shares of Lexmark International, the maker of ink-jet and laser printers, dropped when it said its fourth-quarter profit would be at the low end of analysts' estimates. The stock, which had been a highflier, fell 28, to 65.

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Bloomberg News
 Treasury prices fell yesterday on concern that the consumer price report today will show faster inflation, increasing the chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time since June.
The price of 30-year bond fell 26/32, to 97 14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.32 percent from 6.26 percent on Friday.
Analysts expect the Consumer Price Index to show an increase of 2.6 percent for the 12 months ended in September, up from 2.3 percent in the year through August. That increase may be enough to prompt Fed officials to raise interest rates as soon as their next policy meeting on Nov. 16.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.739	97.472	High Rate	4.99%	5.00%	Coupon Yield	5.13%	5.21%	Low Rate	4.89%	4.89%	Median Rate	4.99%	4.99%	Total applied for	$30,120,316	$27,335,164	Accepted	$12,913,916	$12,195,914	Noncompetitive	$1,171,505	$958,914	
Both issues are dated Oct. 21, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 20, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on April 20, 2000.

HEADLINE: Perdue Offers a Plan to Fight Odor and Pollution

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: LAUREL, Del.

 BODY:
Here in the heart of the busiest poultry-raising area in the world, there are remarkably few chickens in plain sight across the gentle countryside, but Frank LeCates can smell the birds all about him.
"Chicken farms, I'm surrounded by chicken farms -- 35 of them all around me," bewailed Mr. LeCates, whose 79 years coincide with the poultry industry's growth to its dominant position across the lower Delmarva Peninsula. "It's a desperate situation, a stinky situation, putrid even some days when I have to burn pine branches in the yard to try and dispel the smell." 
 Mr. LeCates said it had helped very little that the chickens were raised inside low-lying sealed barns with ventilation fans.
These silvery barns quietly mark the pastoral fields like extraterrestrial dormitories in a vast poultry universe. Six hundred million chickens a year come and go from 2,700 family farms on the peninsula, leaving 600,000 tons of what the industry calls litter and what Mr. LeCates calls abomination.
While other agricultural areas offer autumnal tableaux of piled pumpkins and dried corn stalks, for the hard-working chicken farmers of Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, it is "crusting out" time when they dig the thick litter from the barns and pile it in the fields, six feet high in some places, for eventual use as fertilizer.
But now, prodded by new environmental laws, the industry's regional leader, Perdue Farms Inc., was planning a radical approach to begin dealing with long-running complaints that drainage from chicken manure seriously pollutes waterways, from drinking wells to the vast resources of Chesapeake Bay.
Perdue intends to build a 24-hour-a-day factory here that will collect and treat chicken litter -- a compound rich in phosphorus and nitrogen that includes excrement and sawdust -- to produce fertilizer pellets.
While the proposed factory seems unlikely to ease the complaints of Mr. LeCates and other residents with noisome barn odors, environmentalists welcome it as a technological breath of fresh air.
"We think it's great," said Mike Hirshfield, vice president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental watchdog for the region.
Such a candid blessing was all the more remarkable after the decades of struggle between environmentalists and the poultry industry, the region's chief employer. But Mr. Hirshfield hailed the Perdue plant as a major innovation in what has been a very troubled area.
"Of all the options we've seen, this is one of the most promising, and it's certainly the one furthest along," he said of the plant, which Perdue hopes to open next year.
Mr. Hirshfield said stronger state laws were forcing farmers to adopt various solutions for the problems of runoff from manure, fertilizers and fungicides. The runoff has been blamed for helping to cause a nutrient imbalance in the bay that harms shellfish and undersea grasses at the heart of the food chain.
"This technology seems able to handle a large fraction of the problem," Mr. Hirshfield said. "It seems to be a winner."
The factory would treat about 13 percent of the peninsula's chicken litter and serve as a test for what Perdue officials hope will be more factories across the region in a dramatic solution of shipping out the waste and turning a profit, too.
Perdue plans to truck up to 80,000 tons a year to the single-story factory, which is to be built here on a 210-acre site set back from the road.
Mr. LeCates and other residents are far from thrilled that this quiet hamlet of farm and residential neighborhoods will become a funnel, in effect, for far more than its local share of chicken droppings.
"It smelled bad in 1931, now it will get 400 times worse," said Mr. LeCates, a salesman.
He and other residents say they doubt assurances from Perdue that there will be no more than 10 truckloads of litter a day. The trucks will be covered with tarps, the company promised, and unloaded within a closed $10-million plant designed to thwart environmental runoff.
Mr. LeCates's neighbor Jerry Taylor was organizing community opposition from the ramparts of his bait and tackle shop directly across from the farm where the factory is to be built.
"I think our county has already sold us out," Mr. Taylor said, referring to the Sussex County officials who count agriculture as the county's principal economic resource.
"There are perquisites on the way," he said, referring to county budget benefits, including tax revenues; the estimated 20 jobs the factory will create and other benefits envisioned by Perdue, which employs 20,000 people nationwide with annual sales of $2.5 billion.
"We smell chicken manure where they smell money," Mr. Taylor said of more than 800 petitioners opposing the plant under such names as Citizens' Resistance Against Perdue.
Dennis Hearn, who has been a chicken farmer for 20 years, raising 75,000 broilers a year, said, "I'm not too sure about the factory."
He warily noted that farmers heavily depend on Perdue and other brand-name buyers and that any new technology usually means higher costs for the contract farmers.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation emphasized that farmers should receive fair value in the litter recycling. And Perdue was promising farmers options to keep using litter as fertilizer, sell it at the factory or offer it in exchange for regular barn cleanings. Perdue is operating the factory as a joint venture with Agri- recycle Inc. of Springfield, Mo.
Mr. Hearn now gives his litter to a neighboring farmer, who cleans the barns without charge to obtain manure for his crops. But that option might end because the laws that prompted the plant are also holding farmers responsible for observing far tighter limits on fertilizer use and runoff.
"We're completing the recycling loop," said N. Wayne Hudson, director of the proposed plant, noting that vast amounts of feed used on the chicken farms come from the fertilizer-dependent Midwest, where the pellets will be shipped and sold.
"We've had inquiries from several states about the technology," Mr. Hudson said, describing it as the first of its kind.
Down the road from the proposed plant, Bill Beyer, whose family has run a horse farm here for 20 years, said he had learned to coexist with the chicken farmers. The main problem, he said, seemed to be the secrecy that shrouded the factory plan, which he thought was intended to limit controversy until the precise site was announced as a fait accompli.
"It reminds me of the Verrazano Bridge construction," said Mr. Beyer, a former resident of Staten Island, which the bridge connected to Brooklyn amid furious opposition from badly disrupted neighborhoods.
"Nobody wanted it, but it came," Mr. Beyer said, standing near a rustic fence sign that proclaimed, "Horse Manure For Sale."

HEADLINE: Drug May Be Cause of Veterans' Illnesses

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
A scientific survey underwritten by the Pentagon has concluded that an experimental drug given to American troops during the Persian Gulf war to protect against a nerve gas may be responsible for the chronic illnesses afflicting tens of thousands of veterans.
The report, to be released at a news conference on Tuesday, is the first commissioned by the Pentagon to identify a possible cause for the illnesses, which have collectively come to be known as gulf war syndrome. It sharply contradicts two earlier Government studies -- by a Presidential commission and by the Institute of Medicine -- that ruled out the drug as a cause. 
 The drug, pyridostigmine bromide, or P.B., was distributed to 250,000 to 300,000 of the nearly 700,000 American troops sent to the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991 as a "pretreatment" for potential Iraqi attacks with the nerve agent soman. While the drug has been used since 1955 to treat a rare neurological disorder, its use as an antidote to soman is still regarded as experimental.
More than 100,000 veterans have reported experiencing symptoms associated with gulf war syndrome, including chronic fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep disorders. But because of the Pentagon's acknowledged shoddy record keeping in the war, it may be impossible to know how many of those took the drug and in what quantities.
After years in which the Pentagon has systematically discounted possible explanations for the ailments, including stress, exposure to oil-well fires and depleted uranium used in American bombs, the report is something of a breakthrough.
Wary of the reaction of veterans' groups and their supporters in Congress, Pentagon officials today played down the findings of the survey, which was conducted over two years by the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research organization financed by the Defense Department.
"This is not a Eureka," said Dr. Sue Bailey, a physician who is the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. Dr. Bailey and other officials said they accepted the report's findings but added that more studies were needed before a direct scientific link could be established. They also said the Pentagon would continue to keep the drug in its arsenal of vaccinations and antidotes for troops who might face attacks with chemical and biological weapons, even though the survey's conclusions also raise questions about its effectiveness against soman.
The report, which runs 385 pages and was written by Dr. Beatrice Alexandra Golomb, is based on the findings of scores of medical studies on pyridostigmine bromide. Dr. Golomb is a professor at the University of California at San Diego and a physician at the Veterans Affairs medical center in San Diego.
Her report cites studies that have linked the drug to side effects similar to those experienced by some veterans. One study, by Hebrew University in Israel, linked the drug to neurological disorders in mice. Another, by the University of Texas and Duke University, concluded that when mixed with other chemicals it could cause nerve damage.
Dr. Golomb's report goes on to suggest that the drug's short-term effects can become chronic because it causes abnormal levels of the nerve-signaling chemical acetylcholine. The chemical is involved in many important functions, including sleep, muscular activity, memory and pain, which have all been cited as problems for ill veterans.
The report said research showed that individual reaction to the drug depended on different factors, including stress, physiology and exposure to other agents, including pesticides and even nicotine and caffeine. That would explain why only some veterans have reported illnesses.
"One cannot rule out the possibility that long-term effects of P.B. might occur and might participate in the production of neuropsychological and other deficits reported by some" veterans, Dr. Golomb concludes.
Scientists and veterans' advocates have long pointed to pyridostigmine bromide, as well as other experimental drugs given to troops in the gulf, as one of the possible culprits in the still unexplained illnesses attributed to gulf war syndrome. Separate reports by the House and Senate identified it as such and called for further research into the drug's effects.
Dr. Bernard D. Rostker, the Under Secretary of the Army who is the Pentagon's senior official overseeing gulf war illnesses, said the Pentagon had strongly supported several studies on pyridostigmine bromide, including Rand's, because of those concerns. He said the Pentagon was already spending $20 million on additional research into the possible links considered in Rand's report.
"That does not mean we have made a direct relationship between the two," he said, referring to the drug and the syndrome. "It means we don't have enough information."
The initial reaction on Capitol Hill was harsh. Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who is one of the most outspoken critics of the Pentagon's handling of the issue, accused the Pentagon of moving slowly to study the drug and of "restating the obvious need for aggressive research."
"The sad news is how little has been learned in eight years about organophosphate poisoning and the delayed neuropathies that appear to play a role in the illnesses suffered by gulf war veterans," Mr. Shays said.
Under a special waiver from the Food and Drug Administration, the Pentagon distributed thousands of packets of pyridostigmine bromide to the troops as they deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Troops were ordered to take three flat white tablets each day as long as they were in the region, although it appears they did so erratically.
Pyridostigmine bromide is the only known treatment for soman, a deadly gas developed by the Soviet Union. Although Iraq is known to have made weapons with other nerve agents, including sarin, no evidence has surfaced to suggest Iraq ever made weapons with soman.
Dr. Golomb also reported that some studies on animals suggested that the drug might not be very effective against soman at the doses given and may in fact increase susceptibility to other chemical weapons.
The drug has not been given to troops since the gulf war, but Dr. Rostker said the findings would not change the Pentagon's policy to use it whenever commanders determine that an enemy might have soman.
"Its continued use is warranted given the fact that an exposure to soman would result in almost immediate death," Dr. Rostker said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up Pressure on Taliban to Deliver Osama bin Laden

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 18

 BODY:
With the Islamic Taliban movement of Afghanistan under a threat of United Nations sanctions if it does not turn over a Saudi-born militant for trial in the United States, a Clinton Administration envoy met with a Taliban representative today in New York to press for action.
The Taliban leadership has been harboring the militant, Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in connection with bombings of United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. The Taliban have proposed asking an international group of Islamic scholars to look into the case and perhaps find a way to meet the American request. But they have always stopped short of actually agreeing to place Mr. bin Laden in American custody. 
 The American envoy, Michael A. Sheehan, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, said in an interview after the talks with the Taliban representative, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, that the United States was "always prepared to talk to them about ways in which the resolution can be implemented." But the bottom line, he said, is that Mr. bin Laden must be surrendered.
Mr. Mujahid represents the Taliban in New York. The movement controls most of Afghanistan, but it does not yet hold the country's United Nations seat because of opposition from the United States and other countries.
On Friday, the Security Council gave unexpectedly strong backing to a resolution to impose sanctions in 30 days that will freeze the Taliban's economic assets abroad and curtail international flights by the national airline, Ariana, if Mr. bin Laden and one of his chief aides are not turned over.
American diplomats were surprised last week when two Islamic nations on the Security Council, Bahrain and Malaysia, joined in a unanimous 15-to-0 vote for sanctions.
Mr. Mujahid said in a recent interview, though, that the Taliban's leaders do not have cash stored abroad and that the sanctions would hurt only Afghan traders and other middle class citizens who use the airline.
The meeting today was the first between the United States and the Taliban since the resolution was proposed by the United States. Mr. Sheehan said he described the move in the Security Council as just another step to put pressure on Afghanistan. "We're going to keep putting more bricks on the pile," he said.
"I told him we would welcome any way they could find that would bring bin Laden to justice," he added, responding to the Taliban's uncertain overtures.
The United States has been talking with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, the only three nations that have diplomatic relations with the Taliban Government, a senior State Department official said today, adding that there appeared to have been some progress, including with Pakistan.
United Nations officials say that the Taliban gets their strongest sustained support from Pakistan.
Other countries in the region, including Iran and Tajikistan, aid the remnants of the Government ousted by the Taliban.
That Government, a coalition of factions that often fought one another, came to power with American backing after the fall of the last pro-Soviet Government and continues to fight the Taliban in northeast Afghanistan. In a recent report to the Security Council, Secretary General Kofi Annan said that all outside military aid had to stop or Afghanistan's perpetual civil wars would never end.

HEADLINE: THE MONEY MOVERS: A special report;
Tracking How Pair Went From Russia to Riches

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LOWELL BERGMAN; Additional reporting for this article was done by Michael R. Gordon, Alan Feuer and David S. Koeppel.

 BODY:
Six years ago, a self-effacing Russian emigre with scant business experience set up a modest New Jersey company that planned to introduce entrepreneurs from the new Russia to American capitalists.
Peter Berlin's venture, Benex International Company, got off to a slow start. But after a few years of arranging shipments of stereos and other electronic products to Russia, Mr. Berlin hit on something simpler and more lucrative to move around the world: money. 
 It proved an inspired choice. Nearly everyone in Russia with any money, from businessmen to gangsters, was searching for ways to hide their cash from onerous taxes or overly inquisitive investigators. Mr. Berlin offered a fast, discreet vehicle for moving dollars offshore -- lots of dollars.
Mr. Berlin's companies opened accounts at the Bank of New York, where his wife, Lucy Edwards, was an executive, and began whisking billions of dollars a year out of Russia. Ms. Edwards was in an ideal position to help. Just as he began his new business in 1996, she was promoted to a prestigious job at the bank in London drumming up commercial clients in Russia.
The couple prospered. According to people involved in the investigation, they earned millions of dollars from Benex's dealings, depositing the money offshore in accounts in the British Channel Islands and elsewhere. Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards, who had previously owned a small home in upstate New York, bought a $500,000 apartment in central London and enrolled her daughter in an expensive private school.
Associates say little distinguished them from other Russian immigrants aspiring to upper-middle-class success in the United States. The diminutive Ms. Edwards, who rose from an entry-level job to executive in just eight years at the Bank of New York, was known for her diligence and energy in recruiting clients. Russian businessmen say Mr. Berlin had no obvious links to the titans of Russia's new market economy.
Nonetheless, the couple is now at the center of the biggest Federal money laundering investigation in history as law enforcement officials try to sort out how more than $7 billion sluiced through Mr. Berlin's companies over three years. Much remains unknown.
Federal investigators, for instance, suspect that Mr. Berlin's transformation from small-time businessman to leader of a widely used company was orchestrated by someone in Russia with ties to business or political leaders. But so far, neither they nor British investigators have been able to figure out who that might be.
Ms. Edwards' role remains equally unclear. British investigators who raided the couple's apartment in London in August found business cards and stationery for the Benex company that carried the Bank of New York logo. Prosecutors assert that Ms. Edwards was directly involved in expediting at least one transfer through Benex. And Western financiers say she ran financial seminars in Russia in which Benex's consulting services were promoted using the Bank of New York name.
Investigators are still trying to unravel whose money washed through Mr. Berlin's companies. Some of the more than 87,000 electronic transfers, they say, appear to involve legitimate Russian companies financing the purchase of imported goods and evading taxes. Some have been linked to Russian racketeers.
The Bank of New York, which is cooperating with the investigation, has not been accused of doing anything wrong. In an indictment in September that Federal prosecutors said was just the beginning of a far-reaching international inquiry, Mr. Berlin, Ms. Edwards and an associate were charged with illegally operating a money transfer business and taking deposits.
The case has already had an impact that few could have foreseen. It has roiled relations between Washington and Moscow, sparked a Congressional inquiry, given new momentum to corruption investigations into the financial dealings of Russia's business titans and President Boris N. Yeltsin's family, and become an issue in coming presidential elections here and in Russia.
Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards are still living in London, where their apartment is frequented by photographers and journalists seeking interviews. They and their lawyers have declined comment. Ms. Edwards's London-based lawyer has said that she has done nothing wrong and that the bank had no grounds for firing her.
 
The Beginnings
Two Long Roads From Russia
Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards came of age in a country in which banking was depicted as the glue holding together America's morally bankrupt economic system.
Ms. Edwards, born Lyudmila Pritzker in Leningrad, was the first of the two to make her way to the West. In 1977, Ms. Pritzker married Brad Edwards, a 19-year old American merchant seaman she had met at a club in Leningrad. After a civil wedding at the American consulate in Leningrad, they moved to Illinois, where their daughter, Amy, was born. The couple then settled in Colorado, where Ms. Edwards held a succession of jobs as a bank teller and waitress.
After the marriage fell apart in 1988, Ms. Edwards almost immediately landed an entry-level job handling commercial accounts at the Bank of New York, one of the country's oldest and most prestigious banks.
In 1988, the Bank of New York took over Irving Trust, which was doing extensive business in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Ms. Edwards joined the new Eastern European division in 1992 and became a loan officer two years later, moving for the first time into the executive ranks.
Ms. Edwards's bosses in the Eastern European unit were two well-regarded bank officers, Vladimir Galitzine, an American-born Russian with a royal pedigree, and Natasha Gurfinkel, an Ivy League-educated woman who, like Ms. Edwards, was a Russian immigrant to the United States.
The bank's strategy was straightforward. It hoped to become a key overseas player in Russia by making it easier for Russian companies to conduct business overseas. Ms. Edwards's verve in searching for clients immediately set her apart, associates say.
"What distinguished her to everyone was her energy, incredible energy," said a former colleague of Ms. Edwards. "When others would see four or five clients a day, she would see 10 or 12."
Peter Berlin's road to Western success appears to have been less smooth.
Records show that a man named Peter Berlin graduated from the Moscow Institute on Physics and Technology in 1978 with a degree in molecular chemical physics.
Mr. Berlin left Russia about 10 years ago, just as Communism was collapsing.
A trim, bearded man who stands about 5 feet 9 inches, Mr. Berlin may have lived inIndiana before he moved to New Jersey. His immigration status when he came to the United States is not clear; many Russians who travel under such circumstances leave Moscow on a tourist visa and then stay in the United States illegally. He later became an American citizen.
In the summer of 1992, Mr. Berlin married Ms. Edwards, a union that would have solved any immigration problems. A relative would say only that they met and married in the same year.
By 1993, he was trying his hand at business. He founded Benex, which listed his apartment in Cliffside Park, N.J., as its operating address. After several years, Mr. Berlin hooked up with a major Moscow-based dealer in consumer electronics and began brokering sales of televisions and other items.
As Ms. Edwards rose through the ranks at the Bank of New York, the couple's finances modestly improved. They bought a house in Narrowsburg, N.Y., for $125,000. Acquaintances say Mr. Berlin has a taste for fine art, particularly Impressionist paintings, but some found him, and his wife, uninspiring.
"They were not high-cultured and didn't seem to have much spiritual value," said Vadim Borshai, a Russian artist and a neighbor who lived near them in Narrowsburg. "There was no poetry in their soul."
The couple also had brushes with local law enforcement. Seven years ago, in a Nordstrom department store in Edison, N.J., Ms. Edwards tried to steal more than $1,400 worth of clothing. She was arrested and pleaded guilty, only to repeat the offense two years later at a Bloomingdale's store in Hackensack, N.J. -- this time, with 15-year-old Amy in tow. She was arrested again and later pleaded guilty.
The Bank of New York, which was employing her, did not learn of either arrest until after Federal investigators began scrutinizing the Benex accounts.
Mr. Berlin was arrested for shoplifting six years ago, records show, when he was charged in Fairview, N.J., with stealing sinus medicine from a local A.&P. He retained a lawyer, and the charges were later dropped.
 
The Companies
Red Flags Ignored By the Bank
On a winter day three years ago, Mr. Berlin took a step that would change his life: He strolled into the Bank of New York's Wall Street headquarters and opened an account in the name of Benex International. Six months later, in July 1996, he opened an account in the name of Becs International at the same branch.
Closer scrutiny by the Bank of New York would have revealed corporate records on file with the State of New Jersey showing that one of its employees, Ms. Edwards, was one of two officers at Benex (Mr. Berlin was the other). The bank's own records noted that Ms. Edwards had authority to withdraw money from the Becs account.
Both of those facts should have been red flags at the bank. Banks typically restrict employees from playing a direct role in customers' businesses. The Bank of New York allows such arrangements only with permission of its chairman. Ms. Edwards's formal links to her husband's ventures, the bank says, did not surface until late 1998, after the Federal inquiry began.
Bank employees knew that Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards were married, but this apparently served only to shield the accounts from scrutiny. In Congressional testimony last month, the bank's chief executive, Thomas A. Renyi, said the fact that Mr. Berlin was married to "a well-regarded bank officer" had dissuaded bank auditors from looking more closely at the money in the accounts. He described that as "a lapse on the part of the bank."
There was plenty to look at. It is not clear precisely when the companies began moving money out of Russia, but by 1996 they had become one of the more heavily used pipelines for sending out cash. Millions of dollars a day coursed through the network, pouring through the Bank of New York unchecked.
Banks do not typically make much profit transferring money from one country to another. They charge their better clients as little as a few dollars per transaction.
But Federal investigators say that in Russia's volatile economy, Mr. Berlin was able to charge a premium for a service that ran through the reliable, prestigious Bank of New York. His companies, investigators say, were paid a percentage of the total transferred, earning millions of dollars in profits.
There were some uniquely Russian forces fueling the demand for Mr. Berlin's services. Russia's high taxes and import tariffs give businessmen powerful incentives to hide the true costs of their deals, whether importing goods, buying property, or consummating routine deals. Offshore accounts help hide the volume of trade and commerce.
A few months after Mr. Berlin opened his first account at the bank, Ms. Edwards was courted by a Moscow-based bank but was persuaded to stay at Bank of New York with a prestigious promotion. She was sent to London by Ms. Gurfinkel and appointed a vice president, responsible for finding new business among Russian companies.
While both Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards wore off-the-rack business suits, a former colleague said, they sometimes spent weekends in Italy.
"Between 1996 and 1998, there seemed to be more money," the colleague said. "Peter was doing better, or that is what everyone attributed it to. But there was no ostentation, no high-priced clothing or jewelry."
Mr. Berlin's companies appear to have transacted much of their business from an office building in Queens, where a handful of people working with computers arranged hundreds of electronic transfers a day.
Russian investigators have told their American counterparts they believe that crime groups in Russia exercised some form of control over the operation. American officials say they have no evidence of that, but are still trying to understand how Mr. Berlin corralled so much of the money-moving business so quickly.
The customers appear to have covered the entire range of Russian commerce. Some of the money, Federal investigators say, was moved by Russian criminal groups. Italian prosecutors have found that Russian gangs operating out of northern Italy, for instance, used Benex to transfer several million dollars out of Russia.
More than half of the $7 billion handled by Mr. Berlin's companies moved through the accounts before any suspicions arose. But in early 1998, investigators in two countries, working on different cases, began asking questions about Becs, Benex and Mr. Berlin.
The Manhattan District Attorney office, working with British officials on a money laundering and stock manipulation case, found that a Russian emigre they were investigating, Roman Amiragov, was moving $300,000 to $500,000 a week through Benex into the Bank of New York.
A few months later, the Russian Government separately asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for help in tracing the ransom in a kidnapping case. The money, it turned out, had moved through a Benex account at the Bank of New York on its way to Russian organized crime figures, prompting the bureau to open its own inquiry.
The inquiry focused more closely on Mr. Berlin in August, 1998, after Republic Bank told the F.B.I. that $10 million had passed from Russia through an account controlled by one of his companies.
Mr. Berlin's money-moving operations continued at full throttle through the fall of 1998. But something had changed. His companies were being watched.
 
The Investigations
Startling Disclosures After Slow Start
In its initial phases, the case did not make much of a stir.
Federal investigators served a subpoena on the Bank of New York in September of 1998 for account records relating to Mr. Berlin's companies, among hundreds of such requests the bank receives each year.
Bank officials did not alert Mr. Renyi, the bank's chairman.
Federal investigators were startled by what they found. The records showed a dizzying array of transfers out of Russia and to dozens of countries, including in some cases back to Russia.
British investigators began electronic surveillance of Mr. Berlin's and Ms. Edwards's conversations, and the F.B.I. received transcripts, according to American law enforcement officials.
In March, confronted with requests for more information, the Bank of New York officials finally informed Mr. Renyi, the bank's chief executive, that a problem had arisen with the accounts used by Mr. Berlin's companies.
"The interest of the investigative agencies heated up in March, and that's when it went to the C.E.O," said one person with knowledge of the investigation at the bank. "There were people who knew there was a big-time amount of money there after the first subpoenas came in September of '98. But it wasn't until six months later that it went to the C.E.O."
There are conflicting views of how actively the F.B.I. pursued the case.
Numerous officials, including current and former members of the New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, the New York State Banking Department and the National Crime Squad of Britain, assert that the bureau moved too slowly.
Federal law enforcement officials maintain that they made a choice, at the outset, to investigate the case covertly. Mr. Berlin's accounts, they say, offered a rare window into Russian financial chicanery, provided that the inquiry could be kept secret.
Federal officials were trying to determine whether the rapid-fire transfers were money laundering, a difficult case to make because the law requires prosecutors to prove that the cash at issue was used in a crime such as drug dealing, extortion or fraud. The F.B.I., officials said, hoped to infiltrate the organization and find out more about how Russians launder their money.
"A lot of people got frustrated because we were trying to do the investigation without letting the targets know we were doing it," a Federal law enforcement official said. "We were actively investigating the money laundering case, but we restrained ourselves from doing anything that would tip them off. "
Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards were surprisingly open about the links between their two careers. For instance, brochures for Mr. Berlin's companies carried the Bank of New York logo. The couple traveled together to Russia and in 1996 and 1997, and Mr. Berlin sometimes signed his name to tabs billed to Ms. Edwards's expense account at the Bank of New York.
That discrepancy was eventually noticed by bank auditors in 1998, before the Federal inquiry began, but it did not prompt a closer look at the couple's financial dealings, according to people close to the bank.
Meanwhile, Federal investigators were struggling to understand a case that was largely unfolding in Moscow. The leads, law enforcement officials said, went in myriad, sometimes unfruitful directions.
Federal investigators at one point contemplated using an American diplomat in Moscow as an undercover agent. Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin had made contract with the diplomat in 1998 in an attempt to secure United States Government backing for their plan to convert a Russian defense factory to civilian uses.
Mr. Berlin was later taped by British investigators as he boasted about his ties to the diplomat. The plan was called off after The New York Times disclosed the inquiry in August.
Today, with the Federal investigation now a very public event, Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin, those investigating them and the Bank of New York all face complicated problems.
The F.B.I. can no longer conduct a covert investigation, leaving the bureau with the more difficult task of piecing the Benex puzzle together with help from Russia, or by persuading witnesses to come forward.
The Bank of New York has been cooperating with the investigation, but Federal authorities have indicated that they still plan to take a hard look at how the bank handled various issues surrounding Mr. Berlin's accounts. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has its own investigation under way, with uncertain consequences for the bank.
And with a Federal indictment hanging over their heads, and their bank accounts frozen, the pressure on Mr. Berlin and Ms. Edwards to cooperate with the Federal investigation has increased. But so far they have remained silent, declining all interview requests from the authorities or the press.
Last week, as Ms. Edwards remained holed up in her London apartment, she used her building's intercom system to decline an interview request.
"I wish I could help you, but I can't," she said.

HEADLINE: Fixing What Ails Pakistan: Can the Coup Leader Deliver on His Promises?

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Pakistan's new dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, essentially told the country on Sunday that he had to destroy democracy temporarily to save it.
His was a familiar message in a nation where military despots have ruled for 25 of its 52 years. Many in Pakistan, including some in the liberal intelligentsia, desperately want to believe in the general after a decade of corrupt, incompetent and often autocratic elected leaders. 
 But if history has a lesson to teach in Pakistan -- a still feudal society of 150 million where more than two-thirds of adults cannot read -- it is that each episode of repressive military rule makes democracy weaker, some social critics and scholars say.
The generals promise democracy, but are contemptuous of elected leaders who they think do not measure up and crush dissent once in power. And when these men, unschooled in the arts of managing a government or an economy, finally hand power back to politicians, the problems still loom large.
With his ramrod demeanor and personal vow of integrity, General Musharraf embodies the hope that an honest tough guy can fix what ails Pakistan. In his nationally televised address on Sunday evening, he promised to root out corruption, restore the economy and "true" democracy, show restraint with Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and respect press freedom. He also said he was ready to resume talks with Pakistan's rival and neighbor, India.
This was clearly meant to reassure a world nervously eying a coup in an avowedly nuclear power, and more particularly to reassure the United States, which has yet to decide whether to support a continuing economic bailout and has been pressuring Pakistan to resume negotiations with India.
General Musharraf's offer was regarded today with skepticism in India. The general is held responsible here for having brought his country to the brink of all-out war with India this summer over part of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir called Kargil. Both nations want Kashmir, and their conflict over the area has flared periodically since they were created from the British Indian empire in 1947.
If a leader is to be judged by his record, General Musharraf has not had an auspicious beginning. The Kargil conflict, the most notable action of his yearlong tenure as army chief, was a diplomatic fiasco. For more than two months, Indian troops battled to drive out hundreds of infiltrators now believed to have been mainly Pakistani Army regulars. The incursion ended ignominiously when the now-deposed Prime Minister bowed to American pressure and called for the withdrawal of the Pakistan-backed forces.
Like Pearl Harbor, the operation was brilliant tactically, but disastrous strategically, said Stephen P. Cohen, an expert on the Pakistani army at the Brookings Institution in Washington. And India has not forgotten or forgiven.
"We have a Government here which would perceive Pervez Musharraf as the man behind the Kargil misadventure," said P. R. Chari, director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in New Delhi. "So they're not going to feel like kissing and making up."
But even those who doubt that relations with India will markedly improve say it is unlikely that the general will create any new large-scale mischief soon because he is confronting Pakistan's crumbling economy. Pakistan is awaiting a $280 million installment of a $1.56 billion line of credit from the International Monetary Fund, but the military takeover may further jeopardize the loan, which had already been delayed.
Pakistan is down to about $1.5 billion in foreign exchange reserves, at most enough to pay for two months of imports -- oil, food and other essential commodities. Their loss could lead to even greater hardships for Pakistanis.
The United States, the most important voice in deciding whether to go forward with the loan, has not yet stated a position. American officials have condemned the military takeover and called for a return to democracy, though not for Mr. Sharif's restoration. And they are clearly worried about the prospect of a disintegrating economy in nuclear-armed Pakistan.
The American Ambassador, William B. Milam, today described General Musharraf as "a moderate man who is acting out of patriotic motivations."
"We have business with governments, good governments and bad governments," he said. "We will have to do business with this Government. I don't know how much."
In the longer term, the military is unlikely to pursue the deeper social reforms that would produce a more educated, assertive electorate. Most of Pakistan's federal budget now goes to the military and debt service. And the military has always jealously guarded its share.
"Why is it that Pakistan has not devoted significant resources to health, education, repairing irrigation canals?" asked Gowher Rizvi, a former professor of international relations at Oxford University who now directs the South Asia operation of the Ford Foundation. "It's because the military takes the largest chunk of the budget."
In his speech, General Musharraf said he had had no choice but to sacrifice a limb (the Constitution) in order to save the body (the nation). But one could also say Pakistan is like a body builder who has over-exercised one part of his anatomy (the military), while others (democratic institutions) have withered.
The reasons for the weakness of Pakistan's democracy are complex. It has a landed feudal class that was not subjected to vigorous land reforms as in India. The country never developed mass political movements of the poor and oppressed. Its bureaucracy is highly politicized and corrupt.
And it has a military that sees itself as the last bastion of honesty and stability -- and has often short-circuited the slow, painful and flawed democratic process.
"The military could do good if the leaders of the new Government are truly brilliant, economically informed, politically adept, principled, tolerant of genuine dissent and protective of human rights," said George Perkovich, a South Asia expert. "But men of such virtue are extremely rare anywhere, let alone in Pakistan."

HEADLINE: Blue-Collar City Finds a Fund-Raiser Too Steep

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., Oct. 18

 BODY:
Lionel Drean-Delva was marveling at the police officers, Secret Service agents and Presidential advance teams scurrying around his sleepy residential street this afternoon when a friend told him the reason for all the commotion. President Clinton was coming to town, to this modest neighborhood of ranch homes and one-car garages, to entertain an assortment of political contributors willing to donate as much as $25,000 each to New Jersey's 80 Democratic candidates for the state Assembly.
"Twenty-five thousand?" said Mr. Drean-Delva, 23, shaking his head as city police officers set a white barricade across Irvington Road to block traffic. " I guess no one from around here is going to be inside." 
 Even here in the heart of Union County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 7 to 1 and Mr. Clinton is generally held in high regard, the decision to hold a high-dollar fund-raiser in a decidedly working-class community raised a few of the unsettling class issues Democrats usually like to hurl at Republicans.
Elizabeth, an industrial city that meanders from the loading docks on Newark Bay to the cavernous retail stores, gritty used-car dealerships and go-go bars crowded near Newark International Airport, has undeniably enjoyed something of an upswing in recent years. Unemployment has dropped, city officials have managed to transform several abandoned warehouses and factories into shopping complexes and modest housing developments, and immigrants from the West Indies and South and Central America have given new vitality to shops and neighborhoods that were all but abandoned during Elizabeth's darkest days in the late 1980s.
But people realize how small a piece of the boom they are getting. So the notion that local officials are throwing a party that few local residents could ever dream of attending was enough to remind some of the city's 110,000 residents of their vague sense that Elizabeth might once again be left behind.
Mr. Drean-Delva, a Haitian immigrant who is studying to be a computer programmer, said he was grateful to Mr. Clinton for his intervention in Haiti and glad that the President could help Democrats compete with their Republican counterparts in Washington and New Jersey. But the sheer magnitude of the money involved left him worried that low- and middle-income Americans were simply being priced out of the political process.
"You kind of wonder what's going to happen to the poor people and minorities here," he said. "If the people in office are so busy raking in the money, who will have time to reach out to the poor people too?"
In interviews with more than a dozen Elizabeth residents, excitement about Mr. Clinton's visit was mixed with bewilderment at the high cost of political access. "Everyone knows who controls the power in the country," said Sylvia Torres, 31. "You're just not used to seeing it in your own home town."
State Democrats, who desperately need cash if they hope to reduce the Republicans' 48-to-32 majority in the Assembly, said the Presidential fund-raiser was well worth any public relations trouble it might cause. State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, who was host of the event at his modest home on one of Elizabeth's nicest streets and was co-chairman of Mr. Clinton's 1996 Presidential campaign in New Jersey, has never been apologetic about raising money. Because the tent erected on his lawn could accommodate only 120 guests and Democrats were hoping to raise $500,000, ticket prices were higher than usual, a party official said.
After the fund-raiser, Mr. Lesniak told reporters that the President had delivered a pep talk to New Jersey Democrats. Mr. Clinton also surprised his hosts by walking up the street, which is two blocks from a city housing project, and shaking hands with neighborhood residents. "It was like he didn't want to leave," Mr. Lesniak said.
Among those present today was Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs & Co. and now a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. He has pledged to dip into his $300 million fortune to finance his own campaign, and has promised to raise $100,000 for Assembly candidates.
The Mayor of Elizabeth, J. Christian Bollwage, declared that he and other Democrats needed to match Republican fund-raising. Mr. Bollwage credited Clinton Administration policies for Elizabeth's steep drop in crime and a decline in unemployment from 14 percent in 1992 to less than 8 percent today. This week alone, the city will open two new projects financed by the Federal Government: a $387 million shopping mall that will create thousands of new jobs and a new town-house development.
"I was always under the impression that the Constitution protects the rights of the wealthy, too," said Mr. Bollwage. "So if someone like Jon Corzine is willing to use his own money to run, maybe people shouldn't criticize him. And if people want to talk about campaign finance reform, it's not the Democrats holding things up in Congress."
In downtown Elizabeth, where the business strip is packed with cut-rate electronics stores, rental furniture outlets and a Dunkin' Donuts shop with a bulletproof window, many city residents consider such quibbling between the parties to be silly.
Whether it's a sign of advanced cynicism or highly evolved political realism, many residents say they are still concerned that the city's marginal improvement may be fleeting.
Paul Madden, a mover who was reared in suburban Morris County and moved to Elizabeth in 1991, said that although he was raised to believe that Democrats were the protectors of the working class, he no longer votes, and he thinks that the growing influence of money in politics has blurred the distinction between the parties.
"Elizabeth is one of these pockets of poverty surrounded by some of the richest suburbs in the second-wealthiest state in the nation," Mr. Madden said. "The next time the economy has a downturn, well, when suburbia gets a cold, cities like Elizabeth die of pneumonia."

HEADLINE: Sierra Leone Victims and Rebels Hear Albright's Message of Peace

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: FREETOWN, Sierra Leone, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today cuddled a 3-year-old girl whose arm had been hacked off by rebels, then met with rebel leaders responsible for thousands of such mutilations in this country's eight-year civil war, urging them to stick to a fragile peace agreement.
On the first day of a weeklong visit to Africa, Dr. Albright said that to insure lasting peace in this small West African nation, it was critical that the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, take part in the effort. 
 Mr. Sankoh was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but he was later freed and will occupy a high-ranking Government position under a peace deal that granted amnesty to the rebel fighters.
Dr. Albright pointedly avoided being photographed with Mr. Sankoh -- meeting him behind closed doors and providing no photo opportunities -- and emphasized the importance of eventually punishing war criminals.
The United States helped broker the peace deal, signed in July in Lome, Togo, between the Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front. But the agreement has been criticized by human rights groups as too lenient to those responsible for some of the worst atrocities seen in Africa.
At a camp housing 516 men, women and children -- run by Doctors Without Borders, the international relief organization that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week -- Dr. Albright walked around a courtyard on red earth baked hard by a burning sun. She met long lines of people, most of whose arms had been chopped off by machete-wielding rebels. "It's hard to reach out a hand to shake hands with somebody and know they do not have a hand," she said later.
Dr. Albright picked up a 3-year-old girl named Mamuna, who was dressed in a red jumper and whose right arm had been taken off at the elbow.
Mutari Jalo, who was missing his right arm and who was acting as the camp's informal chairman, told her, "We know the Government of America will help us to alleviate our suffering."
In her remarks today, Dr. Albright said, "Ultimately, the only way that reconciliation really can come is if people have a sense that justice has been done and those who have perpetrated the terrible crimes are punished individually."
But she emphasized that peace must first become entrenched in Sierra Leone, where carrying out the peace accord has been delayed by bickering among rebel leaders and where 45,000 fighters have yet to give up their weapons. Mr. Sankoh has just returned from visiting a rebel stronghold to encourage his men to comply.
"Sankoh is delivering the right message," Dr. Albright said at a news conference before meeting with him, "and I hope very much he will continue to intensify his efforts to insure full adherence to the Lome accord. The atrocities must end, and abductees must be released. The peace must be sustained."
The Secretary was repeating a theme enunciated by the State Department on Friday, when an Africa specialist fielded questions about the propriety of amnesty for the rebels.
"There will never be peace and security and an opportunity for development and recovery in Sierra Leone unless there is a solution to the source of the conflict," Susan E. Rice, Assistant Secretary for Africa Affairs, said at a briefing.
Here in Sierra Leone's capital, Dr. Albright met today with President Kabbah and pledged $55 million in aid -- the only aid announcement made so far on her trip. Most of it is for food, education and efforts to control the illegal traffic in diamonds, which fueled the civil war and has drawn in neighboring Liberia and Burkina Faso at various points.
She also promised $65 million in debt forgiveness, conditioned on Sierra Leone's agreement to carry out an International Monetary Fund economic program.
Part of the American interest in helping Sierra Leone is related to the Clinton Administration's effort to find ways to distinguish between legitimate diamond sales and those that finance strife in Africa.
The rebels in Sierra Leone, as well as those in Angola and Congo, have used diamond sales to prolong their conflicts. The war in Sierra Leone appears to have drawn more American attention because of the nature of the atrocities against civilians.
Dr. Albright's visit to Africa is also viewed by the Administration as an answer to criticism that Washington was prepared to intervene on humanitarian grounds in Kosovo and more recently to give some support in East Timor but has not shown such interest in Africa.
Of all the conflicts in Africa, the situation in Sierra Leone appeared to be one in which a visit from Dr. Albright could shine the brightest spotlight, Administration officials said.
Dr. Albright's visit to Africa, her third as Secretary of State, began with a brief stop in Guinea. After her visit to Sierra Leone, Dr. Albright arrived tonight in Mali, whose successful transition from dictatorship to democracy has made it a model in an unstable region. She was headed next to Nigeria, which recently ended nearly 16 years of military rule.
She is also to visit Tanzania and Kenya, in East Africa, where the American Embassies were bombed in 1998. On Thursday in Tanzania, she will attend the state funeral for Julius Nyerere, that country's founding father.
Today, at the American Ambassador's residence here, which overlooks the green hills and blue bays of this seaside town, Dr. Albright met with Mr. Sankoh and another rebel leader, Johnny Paul Koroma.
Her visit came two weeks after Mr. Sankoh's return to Sierra Leone. His extended stay in Togo, after the peace agreement was signed there in July, delayed carrying it out. The rebels were supposed to start giving up their weapons in August, and the process is finally expected to start this week.
Since his return, Mr. Sankoh has said that people must forget the past and move on. He has yet to visit the war amputees' camp, which has become an obligatory stop for visiting dignitaries, including the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan.
Earlier this month, Mr. Koroma, who led another faction, paid a surprise visit to the camp and, breaking down in tears, pleaded for forgiveness.
The amputees -- who like most ordinary Sierra Leoneans have expressed grudging support for the peace deal -- jeered at him.
Under the peace agreement, Mr. Sankoh will become the chairman of a commission overseeing the country's mineral resources, with the rank of Vice President. Several of his men will occupy other high-ranking Government positions in a power-sharing arrangement.
Mr. Sankoh, a cashiered army corporal and former commercial photographer, began the civil war in 1991, saying that the country's corrupt rulers had enriched themselves on diamonds while leaving Sierra Leone one of the poorest countries in the world. He attracted recruits in rural areas and for many years was rarely seen as he waged war from the bush.
But over the years, his message of economic exploitation was lost and his fighters became known for the atrocities they committed.
After Mr. Kabbah was elected President in 1996, the rebels began slicing off civilians' hands -- in retribution, the rebels often said, for having voted for Mr. Kabbah by putting a thumbprint next to his name on the ballot.
The number of deaths during the war is thought to be in the tens of thousands and the number of amputations in the thousands, but there are no accurate figures.
Dr. Albright's visit to Africa is her first since President Clinton's 12-day trip in March 1998. His visit -- with his pledge of more American interest in the continent, his talk of an African renaissance and a commitment to integrate African nations in the international community -- drew enormous attention to Africa.
But since then, many Africans and American critics of policy toward Africa have said the United States has failed to follow through.
As Dr. Albright's Africa visit was being prepared, Administration officials acknowledged that since President Clinton's visit, there had been few initiatives for Africa that had made much headway. The Secretary's visit was intended to give some programs -- including the Sierra Leone transition -- a jolt, the officials said.
Many critics have pointed out that Western countries have done comparatively little to intervene in civil wars in Sierra Leone, Congo, Angola and Sudan and in the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea -- all extremely lethal conflicts.
"The U.S. has played a leading role in the international community in assisting the peace process in Sierra Leone," the New York-based Human Rights Watch wrote in a letter to Dr. Albright last week.
Yet, the letter continued, the commitment to justice shown to Sierra Leone falls far short of that shown in Kosovo and East Timor, "even though the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone match or surpass anything seen in these crises."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Cuts by Nissan Are Deeper Than Foreseen

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Hobbled by years of losses and high debts, the Nissan Motor Company surprised Japan and the auto industry today with details of a radical overhaul plan that will make unexpectedly deep cuts at the company, Japan's No. 3 auto maker, and reverberate more broadly through the economy.
Under the three-year plan, presented by Nissan's aggressive new chief operating officer, Carlos Ghosn, three plants will be closed and 21,000 jobs eliminated, most of them in Japan. Nissan will also halve its supplier base and close 10 percent of its dealerships, with the objective of returning to profitability in the next fiscal year, starting April 1. 
 "I understand that a lot of people at Nissan will feel like orphans in this plan," Mr. Ghosn said at a briefing for reporters, where the details were released. "But we have no choice, and the fact that we have no choice is the strength of our plan."
He was echoed by Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president. "There is no other alternative for us," Mr. Hanawa said. "In order for us to survive, we must implement this revival plan."
Jason Vines, an American spokesman for Nissan, said that of the 21,000 jobs to be cut, 1,400 would come in the United States through attrition and the sale of divisions. The company, he said, plans to sell a 530-employee forklift division in Illinois and a 380-employee computer operations unit, with the other job cuts disappearing through attrition among Nissan's 11,000 American employees. No layoffs are planned, he added. Slightly more than half of Nissan's American employees work at two manufacturing plants in Tennessee.
The scope of the plan announced here took securities analysts and executives from other car companies by surprise, although its general parameters were well known. "As far as the numbers are concerned, it's even better than expected," said Koji Endo, an analyst at Schroders Japan, speaking presumably of Nissan's aim of a return to profitability.
In some respects, the plan is like other corporate reorganizations here these days, but the magnitude of Nissan's cuts makes it likely that its effects will be felt more strongly than others. About 500 parts and materials suppliers, for instance, will lose Nissan's business, and the communities affected by plant closings, still a rarity in Japan, could feel the most acute impact.
Nissan also plans to sell most of the shares it holds in companies that have been linked through loans and cross-shareholding, reducing its obligations to them as well as the impact of stock market fluctuations on its balance sheet.
"Very few of those companies we consider as indispensable," Mr. Ghosn said. "Over the next three years, a lot of these companies will be out of the reach of Nissan."
How those businesses and communities respond to the challenge created by Nissan today may in turn help shape the future of other Japanese businesses. In the same way that closing three of Nissan's plants is aimed at improving the productivity of its remaining factories, a supplier forced to become more competitive might be expected to become a healthier business.
Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Hanawa acknowledged that their plan was nothing until it was executed. "Ninety-five percent of the work remains," Mr. Hanawa said. "It is not going to be an easy process. It will be a very difficult one."
It will also be costly to Nissan. The company will take a 200 billion yen accounting charge, or about $1.9 billion, to cover the costs of the restructuring in the current fiscal year.
Mr. Ghosn said the year's losses would be much larger than the 60 billion yen the company had forecast in May. In addition, Nissan's liabilities will swell this year as changes in accounting rules force it to include previously unrecognized pension and other costs.
The financial pain will not be limited to Nissan, either. Renault S.A., the French car maker that purchased a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan in March and installed Mr. Ghosn and several other foreign executives to help lead a turnaround, said today that it would take a $317 million accounting charge related to its Japanese partner's restructuring.
But the plan's costs in human terms and in corporate pride are expected to be even greater. Traditional labor practices and tough labor laws make layoffs, as they are known in the United States, virtually impossible here.
"The plan is roughly what the doctor ordered," said Jay Woodworth, an independent automotive analyst. "Now I hope Mr. Ghosn has all his ducks in a row, and in particular has Nissan's labor union on board."
Indeed, while the rest of his speech was straightforward, Mr. Ghosn finessed the part on job reductions, using the same cautious language employed by Japanese executives forced to broach that uncomfortable subject. He said Nissan, which has a global work force around 148,000, planned to prune its work force through attrition, the increased use of part-time employees, spinoffs and "early retirement" -- a euphemism here for layoffs sweetened by generous severance packages.
Mr. Endo of Schroders said he had spoken with the chairman of the company's union not long ago, who told him that the union would be unhappy with any job cuts of more than 3,000. While it is almost unheard of for Japanese unions to strike, labor cooperation here is considered critical to the plan's success.
Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Hanawa played down such concerns today. "Already in the past we have had reallocations of personnel," Mr. Hanawa said. "This won't be a first-time experience."
In other respects, the plan's presentation was blunt and direct. "The key facts and figures about Nissan point to a reality: Nissan is in bad shape," Mr. Ghosn said.
The Japanese auto maker's market share has dropped to 4.9 percent worldwide from 6.6 percent in 1991. It has turned a profit in only one of the last seven years, and its debts, excluding potential liabilities related to leasing cars, are estimated at $12.6 billion by the end of this fiscal year in March 2000.
The restructuring plan presents a litany of cuts that go beyond plants and workers: purchasing costs, which now eat up 58 percent of Nissan's net sales, will be cut 20 percent. Platforms, the backbone of a vehicle, will be reduced to 14 from the current 24 by 2002, and to 12 by 2004, and Renault and Nissan will produce some cars on the same platforms.
But Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the plan was not only about cutting back and casting away, but also about creating new, more exciting-looking vehicles.
"Product development will be at the heart of Nissan's revival," he said. In one sign of Mr. Ghosn's commitment, the design team in Japan is being removed from the engineering group and placed under the oversight of Patrick Pelata, the French head of product development, in the hope of insuring that future Nissan models will have greater appeal to car buyers. Some have criticized Nissan design as unimaginative.
The restructuring plan was announced after the stock market closed here today. Earlier, Nissan's shares tumbled 7.1 percent to 637 yen, or $6.06. Later in New York, its American depository receipts closed unchanged on Nasdaq at $12.875. Renault's shares fell a little more than 2 percent in Paris to 49.9 euros, or $54.10.

HEADLINE: Chief Is Ousted at Rite Aid And Earnings Are Restated

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Directors of the Rite Aid Corporation stepped in yesterday in an effort to stem a series of disasters at the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, ousting Martin L. Grass, the chief executive, announcing that the company will restate $500 million in pretax earnings since 1997 and placing control with four independent board members.
With those changes, the company said that its lead bankers had agreed to recommend to lenders holding $2.7 billion in debt that loans due on Oct. 29 be extended by one year. It also said that Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles investment boutique, had agreed to invest $300 million in new preferred stock that can be converted into common shares worth 9.7 percent of the company. 
 Despite the huge restatement, some analysts said that the moves, taken as a whole, may be good news for investors. They said the heavy-handed management of Mr. Grass, along with a series of problems this year, had badly damaged the company's credibility with investors. And while Wall Street had been expecting a serious earnings restatement, it had not been clear until last night that the banks would roll their loans over.
Shares of Rite Aid have dropped 80 percent this year as the company badly missed earnings expectations, said it would have to restate earnings, and was charged last month by the Florida Attorney General with illegally overcharging uninsured pharmacy customers.
"It's the end of the Grass dynasty," said Mark Husson, a drugstore analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The directors and the banks must have been very upset and frustrated and lacked confidence in current management's ability to control this business."
While the earnings restatement is severe, Mr. Husson said, investors should be relieved that the lead banks agreed to the extension. But he noted that the company did not say what interest rate the banks would charge, and he said it might be some time before investors and analysts are able to sort out Rite Aid's true financial picture. The big restatements "make you wonder what the underlying earnings power of this company is," he said.
In an announcement last night, Rite Aid said its president and chief operating officer, Timothy J. Noonan, had been named interim chief executive. The company also said that the board had created an executive committee of four outside directors: Gerald Tsai, the former Fidelity mutual fund manager; Preston Robert Tisch, the co-chairman of the Loews Corporation; Leonard N. Stern, chairman of the Hartz Group, and Nancy A. Lieberman, a partner at the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm.
Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., also said it had not been able to find a permanent replacement for its former chief financial officer, Frank Bergonzi, who said in June he would resign. And the company said it would delay its quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had been expected Monday, but that the document would show no "material differences" with projections the company made on Oct. 11 that it expected a second-quarter loss of $67.9 million, or 26 cents a share.
Neither Mr. Grass, 45, the son of company founder, Alex Grass, nor Mr. Noonan, 57, could be reached for comment.
A company spokeswoman said that the executive committee was formed to act for the full board between meetings and that it would oversee the search for a permanent chief executive. She said that the earnings restatement came partly in response to issues raised in an S.E.C. review, but that the agency had not indicated any legal action was expected. She also declined to say whether the loan rollover was contingent on the departure of Mr. Grass.
The company had said earlier that the restatements would cover issues including changes "in the accrual for non-cancelable lease obligations relating to closed stores and to reflect non-cash charges related to a change in the company's method of accounting for impaired assets."
A secretary for Leonard Green said Mr. Green had no comment beyond a statement in which he said his investment "reflects the confidence we have in Rite Aid's core business."
Mr. Green will join the directors' executive committee after his investment closes, the company said. The preferred stock he will receive will pay an 8 percent pay-in-kind dividend -- meaning dividends will come in the form of more preferred stock. The conversion price, $11 a share, is 14.3 percent above yesterday's close of $9.625.

The cabin's only concession to comfort is a magnificent stone fireplace. Implements for dealing with the land and its wild inhabitants festoon the walls or lie casually about. Saws. Shovels. An auger. A box containing bird-banding equipment. 
 It was at The Shack, in south-central Wisconsin about an hour's drive north of Madison, that the ecologist Aldo Leopold -- one of the half-dozen most influential thinkers of the last 150 years on the relationship of human beings to the rest of nature -- gleaned many of his insights and sharpened his ideas. He collected a lot of his observations and thoughts in a small volume of essays published 50 years ago this month, titled "A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There."
The crowning essay, "The Land Ethic," argued that humans had a moral obligation to respect and protect the rest of the natural world. Human ethics and the human sense of community, he held, should be expanded to include not just people but also the land and its wild inhabitants. This land ethic, he wrote, "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it."
"A thing is right," he wrote, "when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." In one form or another, this idea is at the heart of the modern conservationist's credo.
Leopold may be less than a household word to many Americans, perhaps most. But in the field of conservation he is a titan. "A Sand County Almanac" is a bible of the environmental movement every bit as much as Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." In Washington, where national conservation policy has been going through major changes of philosophy in recent years, his name and ideas are everyday currency.
So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going strong, Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. The Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters recently held a conference here to examine his legacy. And two new books about his work have just been published:
*"Aldo Leopold: For the Health of the Land; Previously Unpublished Essays and Other Writings," edited by Dr. J. Baird Callicott and Dr. Eric T. Freyfogle (Island Press/Shearwater Books).
*"The Essential Aldo Leopold: Quotations and Commentaries," edited by Dr. Curt D. Meine and Dr. Richard L. Knight (University of Wisconsin Press).
The science of ecology has advanced rapidly in the last half century, and some of Leopold's writings are a bit outdated. Nevertheless, the central strains of his thought have remained remarkably durable, said Dr. Meine, a conservation biologist and writer based at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., and an organizer of the Madison conference.
Indeed, virtually every major idea, trend and enterprise in modern conservation, especially in the 1990's, was anticipated or advocated by Leopold: Setting aside protected wilderness. Treating predators not as pests to be eliminated but as essential ecological actors. Deliberately restoring the health of ecosystems degraded by human activity, from replanting prairies to reintroducing wolves. Using fire to regenerate landscapes. Taking entire ecosystems with their full, diverse panoply of species, rather than just individual species, as the main focus of conservation efforts. Treating people and their needs as an integral part of the ecosystem to be protected or restored rather than as something separate from nature.
More eloquently and effectively than anyone else, perhaps, Leopold applied the insights of the emerging science of ecology to conservation and set it all in a guiding philosophical context.
But Leopold did not live to see his influence grow. One week after "A Sand County Almanac" was accepted for publication by Oxford University Press, in April 1948, he hurried from The Shack to help fight a fire on a neighbor's land. There he had a heart attack and died at 61. "He never saw the impact of those essays; he would be very pleased," said Dr. Susan Flader, a historian and Leopold scholar at the University of Missouri at Columbia. But, she said, he was also a low-keyed, humble person who would probably feel "that the attention should be focused on the land."
By the time Leopold was born in Iowa in 1887, a vibrant tradition of conservation thought and values had already been established in America. Henry David Thoreau had argued that humanity could save itself not by destroying wilderness, but by becoming one with it. George Perkins Marsh, a Vermont naturalist, had written that nature, left alone, is basically stable and that wherever humans go, "the harmonies of nature are turned to discord." John Muir foreshadowed the science of ecology with his belief that everything in the universe is "hitched" to everything else. He also argued that wilderness existed for its own sake and so had to be honored and protected.
Leopold cut his intellectual teeth in a more utilitarian tradition established by Gifford Pinchot, the nation's chief forester under President Theodore Roosevelt. Pinchot believed that forests should serve society's economic needs, but that destroying them for short-term gain was self-defeating in the long run. Thus, conservation along scientific principles was essential.
With a master's degree in forestry from Yale University in hand, Leopold went to work for Pinchot's Forest Service in the Southwest. As one of the first conservationists to advocate the setting aside of protected wilderness areas, he was instrumental in establishing the first such Federal area, in the Gila National Forest of Arizona. He had no illusions about such actions, however: "Any wilderness program," he wrote, "is a rear-guard action, through which retreats are reduced to a minimum."
Two other interests especially engaged him in the Southwest: the whole complex of landscape processes, like fire and erosion, that shaped the vegetative mosaic of the region, and what was then called game management. The first interest would in time ripen into an appreciation of a landscape or an ecosystem as an integrated community of living things. The second would lead to a remarkable epiphany in which his view of the role of predators reversed by 180 degrees.
In the 1920's, wolves, mountain lions and grizzly bears were generally considered "varmints," as Dr. Flader puts it, and Leopold was an enthusiastic exterminator of them. But in a famous "Sand County" passage, he wrote of shooting an old wolf and reaching her "in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes." He came out of the experience believing that wolves were as essential to the healthy functioning of nature as were the deer that the exterminators thought they were protecting.
Later, in Wisconsin, he spent much of the time and energy of his last years fighting a bitter battle about overpopulation by deer. Like many present-day ecologists, Leopold believed that in the absence of predators, too many deer strip the landscape of vegetation, thereby altering the entire web of life in negative ways.
As his thoughts evolved, they focused more and more on what he called the health of the wild landscape as a whole, which, to him, was the paramount conservation concern. To him, the elimination of wolves and the proliferation of deer degraded the landscape's health, making forceful corrective action necessary.
Leopold's thought was influenced not least by the emergence of ecology as a science, and in particular by two concepts: that nature is an interdependent community of living things, and that an ecosystem is "a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants, and animals."
Leopold took his in-the-round view of nature to the University of Wisconsin, where he became a professor in 1928. In 1935, he and his wife, Estella, bought the 80-acre abandoned farm on which The Shack stands, and there for the next 13 years, on weekends, they and their five children (all of whom later became accomplished naturalists) bonded with the land and used it as their ecology laboratory.
It was also at The Shack that Leopold indulged a pioneering passion for ecological restoration. Many of the trees the family planted on the desolate, played-out land failed to take root at first, and when they did and eventually grew into a thick forest. The result represented an artificial garden as much as it did a restoration of the original prairie-savanna ecosystem.
If Leopold were doing it today, he would undoubtedly do it differently, said Wellington (Buddy) Huffaker, the executive director of the Aldo Leopold Foundation Inc., which now owns the site.
Leopold was also a prime mover in a more accurate, scientifically based effort at the university arboretum in Madison to restore examples of Wisconsin's original ecosystems. There, thick, waving prairie grasses much taller than a man's head testify today to the beginnings of a restoration movement that has grown into a vital and far-flung enterprise across the United States. It is this restorationist impulse, some experts believe today, that holds the most promise for the future of conservation.
But to tinker intelligently with nature, Leopold wrote, it is necessary first to save as many wild species as possible -- "to keep every cog and wheel" of an ecological structure only dimly understood by humans.
As was made clear at the recent Madison conference, Leopold fully recognized that the human mark on the natural world is inevitable and indelible, and must somehow be accommodated. He also believed that despite the establishment of protected public lands, the outcome of the conservation struggle would be determined mostly on private land. Thus, the land ethic. Dr. Freyfogle, an editor of one of the new Leopold books, believes that Leopold came up with the land ethic after finding other arguments and tactics insufficient for protecting private land.
Today, conservationists are largely recapitulating Leopold's progression: while they continue to argue that there are sound economic and utilitarian reasons for insuring a healthy landscape (as did Leopold), they are more and more putting their eggs in the basket of morality -- saving creation.
Leopold's thought needs to be updated, it was suggested in Madison, to take account of ecologists' later insights. For example, it is now clear that nature is usually in a constant state of flux, not static balance, even in the absence of human disturbance. And some participants called for expanding the land ethic to include a new "consumption ethic" that would, for example, make it morally unacceptable to cut down pristine forests to build wasteful, oversized houses.
But the land ethic itself, many say, remains ahead of its time. It has yet to become a general societal norm; land is still viewed mostly as a commodity, as human slaves were before societal ethics were expanded to include them.
As Leopold wrote in "Sand County," "there are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot." In a mechanized, electrified, increasingly virtual world where economic concerns are dominant, many can.
So it remains to be seen whether society at large will ever embrace the simple Leopold proposition that people must pay the rest of nature the same ethical and moral respect that they pay themselves. Leopold's disciples hold that if people cannot live with the rest of nature without destroying it, then modern human society is not a worthy one.

 CORRECTION:
Articles on Tuesday and Thursday about Republican opposition to President Clinton's nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun as Ambassador to New Zealand referred incorrectly to a Confederate flag that was at issue in 1993 when Ms. Moseley-Braun, as Senator from Illinois, persuaded the Senate to reject a renewed patent for an emblem for the United Daughters of the Confederacy. (A similar error occurred in an earlier article, on July 23, 1993.) The emblem included the Stars and Bars, the first national flag of the Confederacy -- not the later Confederate battle flag.

HEADLINE: Celebrating an Ecologist's Eloquence and Vision

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
The onetime chicken coop known almost reverently as The Shack still stands, rough-boarded and stark in the middle of a clearing surrounded by tall pines, oaks and maples planted decades ago by the former occupant and his family.
The cabin's only concession to comfort is a magnificent stone fireplace. Implements for dealing with the land and its wild inhabitants festoon the walls or lie casually about. Saws. Shovels. An auger. A box containing bird-banding equipment. 
 It was at The Shack, in south-central Wisconsin about an hour's drive north of Madison, that the ecologist Aldo Leopold -- one of the half-dozen most influential thinkers of the last 150 years on the relationship of human beings to the rest of nature -- gleaned many of his insights and sharpened his ideas. He collected a lot of his observations and thoughts in a small volume of essays published 50 years ago this month, titled "A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There."
The crowning essay, "The Land Ethic," argued that humans had a moral obligation to respect and protect the rest of the natural world. Human ethics and the human sense of community, he held, should be expanded to include not just people but also the land and its wild inhabitants. This land ethic, he wrote, "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it."
"A thing is right," he wrote, "when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." In one form or another, this idea is at the heart of the modern conservationist's credo.
Leopold may be less than a household word to many Americans, perhaps most. But in the field of conservation he is a titan. "A Sand County Almanac" is a bible of the environmental movement every bit as much as Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." In Washington, where national conservation policy has been going through major changes of philosophy in recent years, his name and ideas are everyday currency.
So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going strong, Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. The Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters recently held a conference here to examine his legacy. And two new books about his work have just been published:
*"Aldo Leopold: For the Health of the Land; Previously Unpublished Essays and Other Writings," edited by Dr. J. Baird Callicott and Dr. Eric T. Freyfogle (Island Press/Shearwater Books).
*"The Essential Aldo Leopold: Quotations and Commentaries," edited by Dr. Curt D. Meine and Dr. Richard L. Knight (University of Wisconsin Press).
The science of ecology has advanced rapidly in the last half century, and some of Leopold's writings are a bit outdated. Nevertheless, the central strains of his thought have remained remarkably durable, said Dr. Meine, a conservation biologist and writer based at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., and an organizer of the Madison conference.
Indeed, virtually every major idea, trend and enterprise in modern conservation, especially in the 1990's, was anticipated or advocated by Leopold: Setting aside protected wilderness. Treating predators not as pests to be eliminated but as essential ecological actors. Deliberately restoring the health of ecosystems degraded by human activity, from replanting prairies to reintroducing wolves. Using fire to regenerate landscapes. Taking entire ecosystems with their full, diverse panoply of species, rather than just individual species, as the main focus of conservation efforts. Treating people and their needs as an integral part of the ecosystem to be protected or restored rather than as something separate from nature.

As Leopold wrote in "Sand County," "there are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot." In a mechanized, electrified, increasingly virtual world where economic concerns are dominant, many can.
So it remains to be seen whether society at large will ever embrace the simple Leopold proposition that people must pay the rest of nature the same ethical and moral respect that they pay themselves. Leopold's disciples hold that if people cannot live with the rest of nature without destroying it, then modern human society is not a worthy one.

 With his book "A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There" (Oxford University Press, 1949), Aldo Leopold laid out a visionary philosophy that has shaped many of today's conservation efforts. Here are some excerpts.
 
 
 On the January Thaw
 A meadow mouse, startled by my approach, darts damply across the skunk track. Why is he abroad in daylight? Probably because he feels grieved about the thaw. Today his maze of secret tunnels, laboriously chewed through the matted grass under the snow, are tunnels no more, but only paths exposed to public view and ridicule. Indeed, the thawing sun has mocked the basic premises of the microtine economic system!
 The mouse is a sober citizen who knows that grass grows in order that mice may store it as underground haystacks, and that snow falls in order that mice may build subways from stack to stack: supply, demand and transport all neatly organized. To the mouse, snow means freedom from want and fear. ...
 A rough-legged hawk comes sailing over the meadow ahead. Now he stops, hovers like a kingfisher, and then drops like a feathered bomb into the marsh. He does not rise again, so I am sure he has caught, and is now eating, some worried mouse-engineer who could not wait until night to inspect the damage to his well-ordered world.
 The rough-leg has no opinion why grass grows, but he is well aware that snow melts in order that hawks may again catch mice. He came down out of the Arctic in the hope of thaws, for to him a thaw means freedom from want and fear.
 
 
 On Shooting Wolves
 We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes - something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view. ...
 Since then I have lived to see state after state extirpate its wolves. I have watched the face of many a newly wolfless mountain, and seen the south-facing slopes wrinkle with a maze of new deer trails. I have seen every edible bush and seedling browsed, first to anaemic desuetude, and then to death. I have seen every edible tree defoliated to the height of a saddlehorn. Such a mountain looks as if someone had given God a new pruning shears, and forbidden Him all other exercise. In the end, the starved bones of the hoped-for deer herd, dead of its own too-much, bleach with the bones of the dead sage, or molder under the high-lined junipers.
 I now suspect that just as a deer herd lives in mortal fear of its wolves, so does a mountain live in mortal fear of its deer. And perhaps with better cause, for while a buck pulled down by wolves can be replaced in two or three years, a range pulled down by too many deer may fail of replacement in as many decades.
 
 On the Land Ethic
 When godlike Odysseus returned from the wars in Troy, he hanged all on one rope a dozen slave-girls of his household whom he suspected of misbehavior during his absence.
 This hanging involved no questio of propriety. The girls were property. The disposal of property was then, as now, a matter of expedience not of right and wrong. ...
 The ethical structure of that day covered wives, but had not yet been extended to human chattels. During the three thousand years which have since elapsed, ethical criteria have been extended to many fields of conduct. ...
 There is as yet no ethic dealing with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it. Land, like Odysseus's slave-girls, is still property. The land-relation is still strictly economic, entailing privileges but not obligations.
The extension of ethics to this third element in human environment is, if I read the evidence correctly, an evolutionary possbility and an ecological necessity. ...
 All ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise: that the individual is a member of a community of interdependent parts. His instincts prompt him to compete for his place in that community, but his ethics prompt him also to cooperate (perhaps in order that there may be a place to compete for).
 The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils waters, plants and animals, or collectively: the land. ...
 In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.

HEADLINE: Some Urban Renewal For Country Music;
A Brash New Yorker Takes On Nashville

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Earlier this month Pat Quigley, the president and chief executive of Capitol Nashville records, sat in his office with a computer printout of the previous week's national CD sales spread across his table.
He had just seen the first-week numbers for Garth Brooks's ambitious new project, an apocryphal greatest-hits rock album released under the pseudonym Chris Gaines, and Mr. Quigley was far from pleased. 
 Mr. Brooks, the Oklahoma-bred superstar, and Mr. Quigley, the brash New Yorker, knew that the Chris Gaines record would hardly sell as well as Mr. Brooks's country albums, which have shattered sales records with as many as a million copies sold in one week. But the label had sent three million copies of the rock album to stores, expecting sales of around 400,000 in its first week. Instead it sold only 262,000 copies, coming in at No. 2 in the pop charts.
"It's our fault," Mr. Quigley muttered. "Fans were confused. We have to do a better job educating them."
For Mr. Quigley's enemies in Nashville, this was a day of celebration. Since he moved here from New York just over two years ago, he has made few friends. Upon his arrival, the local alternative weekly blared a blood-red headline, "The Outsider: Will He Destroy Music Row?," and soon after, The Chicago Tribune dubbed him "the least liked man in Nashville."
Two years later Mr. Quigley has done little to change his status as an outsider. An unapologetic New Yorker, he was wearing a gray East Hampton sweatshirt and instead of beer in his office, there was a glass-front refrigerator full of wine bottles.
"I'm certainly not one of them," he said, referring to the denizens of Music Row. "I don't believe I'll ever be accepted as one of them. They're probably not going to be in my social calendar anyway."
Mr. Quigley is emblematic of the juncture at which Nashville now finds itself, caught between the old small-town, family-style way of doing business and a big-city, results-driven attitude, especially recently as the business has been rocked by cutbacks from the labels' multinational parent companies. It is represented not just in country music, with the taste gap widening between older legends like George Jones and contemporary pop stars like Shania Twain, but in the city itself, where country charm is being paved over to make way for urban sprawl.
The kitschy Opryland amusement park was torn down for a gargantuan mall, and the once-rustic honky-tonk-filled downtown is now overrun by scaffolding and cranes promising a shiny cosmopolitan future. Add to this Dell Computer's recently announced plan to relocate part of its operations to the Nashville area, the construction of a $192 million stadium and $140 million arena (plus N.H.L. and N.F.L. teams to put inside them), and a metro-area population that has boomed past the one million mark, and you have a city with major growing pains.
Mr. Quigley is one of them. He is a strong-willed stranger whose heart and head remain entrenched in New York and his international marketing background, bent on remaking country in his own image.
"I get Town and Country magazine, and it's very elegant magazine," he said, settling into a couch in his office. "Country for me in Manhattan was the Hamptons. Why does country have to be some backwards place in 'Deliverance'?
"As I watch what is selling in country, the superstars making traditional country aren't moving big volume anymore. It's the poppier influenced country music that's really moving the big volume. Look at the statistics: Faith Hill's No. 1 market is New York City; Shania Twain's is New York City; Garth's is either New York, Los Angeles or Chicago. As you start to see the New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles influence, I think country music gets afraid that it's losing its identity."
Doing his part to add to the identity crisis, Mr. Quigley, 49, has registered the words "town and country" as a trademark for music, hoping to dress country up in new clothes that will make it look less rural and more middle-class.
"I own those words for music," he said proudly. "When I do town and country music, it will also be Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, Bob Seger. America is so much better educated than a lot of the music this town makes." Although Mr. Quigley's ambition to think nationally instead of regionally when selling country music (just as the pop-music industry has begun to think internationally instead of just nationally) seems good for the genre, almost every move he has made here has been dogged by protest or controversy. These range from his ascendancy as president of Capitol Nashville (even his supporters say it was a result of a coup engineered by a disgruntled Garth Brooks) to the unorthodox techniques he has used to market his albums. Those include paying radio stations to announce the names of Capitol acts after playing their music, lowering the prices of new records below the industry norm, and taking Mr. Brooks's old albums off the market before releasing a box set of his past music.
In a music scene as tight-knit and familial as Nashville's, Mr. Quigley makes no attempts to be a team player. This is evident in Capitol's absence from the board of the Country Music Association, and in the location of its offices.
While all the other major labels in Nashville are lined up along the parallel streets of town houses and small office buildings known as Music Row, Capitol Nashville sits in an anonymous building more than a mile away. The label's previous president had planned to relocate to Music Row, but one of the first things Mr. Quigley did when he took over was to break the lease, at a loss.
As a result of Capitol's isolationism, other record labels have not been quick to leap to the company's aid. Concerned about the lack of a radio station playing country music in a market as vital as New York, Mr. Quigley once offered to buy half the advertising time of a prospective New York broadcaster if it would take on a country format, but only if the other labels in Nashville agreed to buy the other half. They unanimously declined.
Mr. Quigley probably would have been driven out of town if his label were not doing so well, a success owed to the sales juggernaut that is Mr. Brooks. Even one of Mr. Quigley's detractors on Music Row, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted: "While a lot of the music industry was down on the fact that Pat lowered the price on Garth's CD's, he shipped 32 million units. I don't think anyone has done that before or is likely to do that again."
Last year 1 in every 10 country records that sold was a Brooks album, making Capitol the most profitable label in town. Although rival executives may be impressed, they refer condescendingly to Mr. Quigley as a "Garth robot," a figurehead at a label they say is run by the singer whose album sales pay its bills.
"I read something the other day that called me 'the self-proclaimed yes man of Garth,' " Mr. Quigley said. "I do what he wants -- my way."
Steve Wariner, a respected singer and songwriter since the early 70's who began recording for Capitol Nashville last year, said he had witnessed many arguments between Mr. Quigley and Mr. Brooks. "As far as Pat being a yes man to Garth, that's not true," he said.
Mr. Wariner said one of the reasons he chose to sign with Capitol, besides his friendship with Mr. Brooks, was Mr. Quigley's style. Mr. Wariner recalled his first meeting with Mr. Quigley: "He said: 'I know your name. Garth's talked about you. Some of the people here have talked about you. But I've never heard of you. I don't know any of your music. I don't know anything about you.' I thought it was refreshing, and I loved the honesty of the approach.
"The only thing is, I lean on Pat a little bit because he does not want people in Nashville to like him," Mr. Wariner added. "He makes statements that I wish he wouldn't. I find myself defending him a lot."
Spending time with Mr. Quigley, one realizes that one of the most repeated criticisms about him is true: He is a marketing man, not a music man. With a background of selling everything from skis to watches to beer, he is representative of a new breed of executive in the recording industry, where the music men -- the former songwriters and producers who have dominated the business -- are being replaced by international businessmen who could just as easily be selling Internet stocks.
Mr. Quigley often refers to Capitol Nashville not as a record label but as a marketing company. He is not an executive who uses his ears, but one who uses his eyes, analyzing audience research statistics and sales charts. When playing music from a new album by Keith Urban, who collaborated with the rhythm-and-blues producer Stevie J., Mr. Quigley stopped the CD.
"Listen to that lyric, 'You're the only one,' " he said. "Doesn't everyone want to hear that?"
"I was looking for Keith to get the female agenda and apply it to a sensitive new man," Mr. Quigley said.
In a move that is not too surprising, considering the sudden explosion of all-female country groups, Mr. Quigley has also been looking to create a country equivalent of the Backstreet Boys, or, as he likes to call his pet project, the Backwoods Boys.
"We're deep in the inquiry process," he said. "I want these kids to have something to say to normal people, to America. But they can't talk to the inner city. They have to talk about small-town life. That's where America is, that's where their heart is. Whether you live on 79th Street or Main Street in some small town, you want to care about each other."
"I think it should be the goal of Nashville to have 33 percent of all pop radio air play country, and none of the country air play pop," he continued. "We're culturally important. We're not just dinosaurs here."
So far the Chris Gaines project has been Mr. Quigley's first significant setback in Nashville. Although the album has made Mr. Brooks the butt of many jokes around town, Mr. Quigley remains optimistic about the singer's future. He plans to resuscitate Mr. Brooks's country career quickly with an album of Christmas songs. And rival executives in Nashville will not be too happy about the cutthroat price he plans for the full-length CD: $11.99, or $9.99 with a special offer.
"It's tough on my family sometimes because there's very little positive in this town," Mr. Quigley said. "But they've got a nice house, a nice car and a father who seems to be very happy with what he does. We'll get through it."

HEADLINE: EN ROUTE: Australia;
Sydney's On Top Of the World

SERIES: The second of three reports from Australia.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
PARIS, surely, and New York and probably London, but after that it's hard to think of another city that matches Sydney, the home port of the good life, for the sheer excellence and exuberance of its restaurants.
Fabulous raw materials -- especially fish and shellfish from the unpolluted seas that surround this island continent, and tropical fruits from Queensland -- give Sydney's cooks a head start. Drawn from a polyglot population, they bring the techniques and traditions of China, France, Malaysia, Thailand, Italy and a dozen other nations to their work. 
 You can taste Greece in Janni Kyritsis' food and French Canada in Serge Dansereau's, Japan in Tetsuya Wakuda's and Britain in Daryll Taylor's. Along with home-grown talents like Neil Perry and David Thompson, they are helping to define a national approach to food, rooted in a love of Australian produce.
Sydney attracts great chefs for the same reason that the University of California at San Diego attracts Nobel Prize-winning scientists: they jump at the chance to work alongside talented peers in a benign climate. Once here, they are egged on by a horde of foodies -- prosperous, cosmopolitan folk who think nothing of hopping onto a jet for a weekend in San Francisco or a week in the south of France.
Tens of thousands of American and other foreign visitors will travel here for the 2000 Olympics, the Millennium Games. In the months leading up to the sporting spectacle, which starts in September, Sydney will offer not one but two world-class arts festivals organized by Australia's leading impresario, Leo Schofield. "There is an incredible optimism among restaurateurs in Sydney about what the Olympics will bring us," said Carolyn Lockhart, editor of Australian Gourmet Traveller. "We've been little old deprived Australia for a long time. Now we're stars. It's incredible. I love it."
Many of the foreigners will be surprised to see passion fruit on sale for 15 cents apiece at downtown fruit stands, or to find 800 people jamming a single dim sum restaurant on a Sunday, with 200 more waiting, as my wife, Betsey, and I did not long ago. Most will be astonished by the subtlety and variety of what they find on their own lunch and dinner plates.
UNTIL the late 1970's, eating in Sydney was about as exciting as a two-note symphony. The city had more lager louts than epicures. Most people ate because they had to, and for no other reason. Now even the grace notes are attended to. Salads are perfectly dressed, and good coffee, often from Illy or Lavazza or Segafredo in Italy, has become a national obsession.
The restaurant revolution here has been matched in many other cities, of course. You eat unimaginably better food today in Toronto and Dallas and Munich than you did only a few years ago. But in Sydney the change has penetrated much more deeply into the food culture; it is not just in the most ambitious restaurants that times have changed. Standards have also improved in the corner bistros, neighborhood joints, cafes and delis.
Australian wine has also taken giant steps, and service has kept pace as well. In the United States, we are often told that overfamiliar, underinformed waiters and waitresses are the inevitable products of a classless society. But Australia is at least as egalitarian as we are, if not more so, yet people wait on table with a perfect mixture of good cheer and deep knowledge of what they are serving.
Stodge is out, light is in and the Herculean helpings of old have been banished. In just two years, the compulsion to combine five civilizations and three continents in a soup bowl has eased. But the Asian influence, pervasive if not quite omnipresent, still sets Sydney apart.
"We're just as happy with chopsticks as a knife and fork," says the current edition of The Sydney Morning Herald's comprehensive "Good Food Guide." "To us, the Far East is the Near Northwest, and eating in an Asian manner -- albeit a modernized one -- is as natural as breathing."
ALL by himself, Neil Perry sums up the Sydney food scene. Like Jean-Georges Vongerichten in New York, he speaks many culinary languages, all fluently. Rockpool, his home base, is an oasis of high-tech urban chic in the city's oldest neighborhood, with brushed-steel chairs and lighting cunningly devised to flatter the profiles of the city's beautiful people. But Rockpool draws people from many races, age groups and economic levels, not just the cream of Nescafe society.
Like many of the best Sydney restaurants, Rockpool makes no distinction between starters and main courses; you choose as you like, as if you were in China or Japan. We didn't choose at all. Mr. Perry, who wears a ponytail and is habitually dressed in black when not wearing chef's whites, sent out a series of things he said he felt especially proud of. All showed his special talent for fusing improbably matched ingredients to produce new flavors -- one example after another of the sum's far exceeding its parts.
Examples: a delicate shrimp custard, shimmying on the plate like My Sister Kate, with cauliflower puree and just a filament of spinach oil; translucent slivers of slow-cooked abalone -- often tough and tasteless, here tender and succulent -- with tree mushrooms and a noodle salad, and a plate of new-age surf and turf: a chunk of tuna, cooked Texas-rare, studded with anchovies and roasted garlic, perched on a bed of mashed potatoes, with bone marrow and red wine sauce.
"It all comes back to produce," Mr. Perry said after dinner. "A cook in London uses Asian vegetables flown from Thailand, usually two or three days old. We're more like California, with everything close at hand. Especially fish; Nobu in New York gets some of its fish from my supplier."
Wockpool, a second Perry enterprise, is less formal, more overtly Asian and breathtakingly situated at the edge of Darling Harbor. Two of the best dishes we ate on this latest trip to Sydney -- right up there with the most dazzling creations of David Thompson's Darley Street Thai, which is sadly scheduled to close soon, when Mr. Thompson retires -- came out of the Wockpool kitchen.
A salad including bits of crispy pork, hot chilies, batons of green pawpaw and slices of cucumber was sweet and acid and hot and cool, all at the same time. An irresistible dessert combined layers of ginger ice cream and intensely flavored pineapple sorbet in a crumb crust, with see-through slices of pineapple on top.
Mr. Perry's latest, called Bistro Mars, pays homage to the everyday cooking of provincial France, with solid renditions of dishes like ouefs en meurette -- poached eggs in a red wine sauce, with lardons and tiny onions. The setting is button-bright, with glass-top tables, buttercup-yellow plastic chairs and a giant Moreton Bay fig tree just outside, but the service, to tell the unvarnished truth, reminded us more of Mars than of France.
WHAT Sydney has lacked has been a formal, celebratory space with first-class cooking. None of the Perry operations qualifies, and Tetsuya's, Sydney's shrine of fusion cuisine, where the confit of ocean trout sends many diners into sighs of rapture, is a plain room in a plainer suburb.
Banc has closed the gap. With tall, octagonal marble pillars, Limoges plates and Christofle cutlery, it slips easily into its tony neighborhood, and the food is made for high rollers. I liked a frothy cauliflower soup with beignets, a fine example of how to take a cheap ingredient and turn it into something elegant, and an old favorite given a face lift: tournedos Rossini, with the fillet rolled in truffle oil, left to marinate for a week, grilled stuffed with foie gras and truffles and wrapped in prosciutto.
In the same part of town, Sydney has just acquired a gastrodome on the scale of Dean & DeLuca in New York, Peck in Milan and KaDeWe in Berlin, something it has never had. Simon Johnson, grocer to the city's carriage trade, and Stan Sarris, proprietor of successful coffeehouses and restaurants, including Banc, have filled the entire bottom floor of Sydney's grand old General Post Office with a foodie's fantasy. It includes an enormous selection of meat and cheese, fish and shellfish, fruits and vegetables, along with prepared foods from Australia and overseas and meals to take home. Also a first-class steakhouse (Prime), which meets another need here; a bar called Tank, complete with tapas; a sushi bar (So Su Mi) with a tiny train carrying the goodies to the customers; a crustacean bar; an espresso bar, and a brasserie.
"This is all about theater," Mr. Johnson said. Exotic Australian shellfish, including antipodean specialties like yabbies, marrons and Balmain bugs, are laid out on ice. Sides of beef, lamb and game hang in a glass-sided aging room, and cheeses from Europe and Australia are kept in a walk-in larder at 95 percent humidity.
The whole thing is epic in scale and ambition: 500,000 square feet of black-and-white marble floors, tile, glass and stainless steel, representing an investment of about $3.5 million. What also sets it apart is its location squarely in the city's business center, on a broad pedestrian plaza called Martin Place. It is as if Balducci's were to move to Wall Street. No fewer than 67 banks have offices within a couple of blocks.
IF Banc is Sydney's answer to the Four Seasons, Forty-One is its counterpart to the old Windows on the World. You sit in deep leather chairs, sipping a glass of Krug, eating Tasmanian oysters with a Vietnamese dipping sauce, aquamarine walls behind you, the vast harbor spread out beyond the glass in front of you. That's for starters. Later, a floor higher, you might try Dieter Sawyere's Yamba prawns with Indian spices or crown roast of hare, a masterpiece in miniature.
A Swiss, Mr. Sawyere has no patience with the empty flourish, but his capacity for taking pains with details is vast. "He missed a career in microsurgery," said Mr. Schofield, a gourmand as well as a showman.
The harbor is also part of the charm at the newly refurbished Bathers Pavilion in Balmoral, a close-in suburb. The water lies alluringly just beyond a row of louvered windows, open in good weather (which is to say about 350 days a year), and the day we ate there with Australian friends a whale was cavorting offshore, or so people said. Between bites, they were debating whether it was male or female, Alexander or Alexandra.
Built in 1928, the Pavilion has been transformed by the arrival of Serge Dansereau, a Quebec native who helped reshape Australian cooking during his years at the Regent Hotel in Sydney, persuading farmers to raise crops like fir-apples especially for him. In an improbably green, deliriously delicious pea soup with garlic and sorrel, and a chocolate miroir with blood orange sauce, he uses sharp-tasting secondary ingredients to set off the richness of the primary products.
Like any good eating city, Sydney has its Italian stars. Bob Carr, the premier of New South Wales, took us to one of his favorites, Lucio's, an artists' hangout where Lucio Galletto, who comes from La Spezia, near Genoa, served us a whole fish beautifully roasted in a salt crust. Bel Mondo, more modern and more Milanese in style, serves the best homemade pasta in town, a barbecued duck with balsamic vinegar and superbly chosen wines. But I would give the Mediterranean medal to a master from another peninsula.
Janni Kyritsis, a soft-spoken Greek, used to cook at Bennelong in the spectacular Sydney Opera House when it was the toast of Sydney. Now he cooks in a converted auto showroom called MG Garage, with a real MG on display (and priced on the menu). His food is decidedly Mediterranean, and he uses citrus flavors in many dishes: grilled lemon with a Sicilian-style red mullet, which he stuffs with pine nuts, and a touch of orange in a lip-smacking galantine of suckling pig served with broad beans and lentils.
But he is equally adept at the fusion game. His bone-marrow dumpling is made from Australian beef, marinated in tapenade from southern France, encased in an English dumpling batter, served on wok-fried spinach. It tasted entirely logical, as if it came from some great-aunt's cookbook.
THE influence of modern British cooking is writ large in Sydney, partly because Britain, too, is a kind of gastronomic magpie.
At Jersey Cow, a cozy neighborhood bistro in Victorian Paddington with charming chalk drawings of bemused bovines hanging on the walls, the menu lists things like house-made pork sausages with bean puree, a tomato and caramelized onion tart and Lancashire hot pot. Daryll Taylor cooked at Franco Taruschio's celebrated Walnut Tree Inn in Wales, and a couple of its Italian specialties, like a seafood brodetto, make an appearance as well.
Luke Mangan, another Englishman, and Lucy Allon, an Australian, greet guests at Salt, another of the city's hot new places, with a not-quite-hard-boiled quail egg, rolled in salt and celery salt. Ms. Allon read not long before the restaurant opened that salt symbolized hospitality and friendship in ancient Greece.
The room is lean and mean, with lavender banquettes. The menu is packed with innovations like shredded shoulder of lamb with cabbage, thyme and black olives. But few people can resist, at least on a first visit, Mr. Mangan's trademark rabbit tart: a crust filled with creamy polenta instead of creme patissiere, then topped with strips of slightly gamy roasted rabbit, shiitake mushroom slices and rich juices from the roasting pan.
On top of everything else, Australia has developed a cafe culture to rival Vienna's. Try breakfast at Bill's, a street-corner spot in the trendy Darlinghurst section. You sit around a big square table next to media types, moms with kids in strollers and people from nearby design offices, and you eat: big bowls of sliced tropical fruits, coconut-bread toast, sweet corn fritters, spring onion pancakes with gravlax, ricotta hotcakes with butter and honey. Why doesn't my town, or your town, have something like this?

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS;
A Face Lift For a Polished Performer

BYLINE: By William Grimes 

 BODY:
AUREOLE may be New York's foremost celebrity restaurant. It deserves the title not because celebrities eat there but because, in the classic definition, it is a restaurant famous for being famous. Diners fill Aureole's tables day after day and night after night, partly because it serves very good food but mostly because, like Everest -- the quintessential celebrity mountain -- it is there, and famously there. In the last 10 years, however, the surrounding peaks look a lot higher.
Aureole opened its doors in November 1988 on a swelling wave of expectation. Charlie Palmer, its chef and owner, had earned a warm spot in the hearts of New Yorkers at the River Cafe in Brooklyn, where he specialized in a French-American hybrid style usually described as New American. His new venture, in a self-effacing Upper East Side town house, took off quickly and never slowed down, riding out the recession without a bump. It was awarded three stars by Bryan Miller in The New York Times in 1991 and today, Aureole is still one of the city's most popular and revered restaurants. 
 The reasons are perfectly understandable. Aureole serves appealing food in stylish surroundings. The service is polished, the atmosphere warm. But Manhattan has no shortage of restaurants that could be described in the same way. Very few of them have achieved Aureole's invincible appeal.
It is no coincidence that the restaurant's ascent coincided with the growing influence of the Zagat Survey. Aureole's reputation exemplifies, to an extreme degree, the self-levitating phenomenon that I think of as the Zagat Effect, in which a restaurant, once it has achieved a top rating, continues to do so year after year, regardless of the quality of the food. Diners flock to it, Zagat guide in hand (either literally or metaphorically) and, convinced that they are eating at a top-flight establishment, cannot bring themselves to believe otherwise.
The approach and style that once dazzled New York seem rather commonplace today, however. The rising culinary tide that has made New York such an important international restaurant city has behaved in a peculiar way, lifting most restaurants while leaving others not exactly high and dry, but a little stuck. Aureole, despite a brand-new face lift by the designer Adam Tihany, is one of these.
Mr. Palmer likes big effects. His dishes tend to come on strong, make a big statement and then, as often as not, wear out their welcome, in part because portions are large, in part because his hand can be heavy. Aureole's signature sea scallop sandwich is a good example. The scallops, although rich and flavorful, come surrounded by a nimbus of finely shredded deep-fried potato that makes them look like two tumbleweeds on a plate. It's a sight to see, but a very oily eating experience.
An appetizer of seared foie gras, accompanied by an ingenious round cushion of gingerbread and a caramelized pear, is sweeter than most of the desserts, and the filet mignon also lands with a thud. It's a substantial tower of tender beef accompanied by a fistful of plain haricots verts and what seems to be an enormous charred egg roll, which on closer inspection turns out to be grated potato in a thin potato casing. It has all the subtlety of a blackjack.
When Mr. Palmer pulls it all together, his food has an unfussy, direct appeal that makes other chefs seem neurotic. His stuffed squid, served on a bed of arugula and celery root, is a Mediterranean feast, with crunchy tentacles providing a textural contrast to a smooth, fragrant stuffing of ground shrimp, cod and squid.
The chowder of crab and littleneck clams, a brawny, no-nonsense appetizer, takes an unexpected turn with potato dumplings enriched with braised leeks. A terrine of eggplant caviar, goat cheese and tomato confit, sharpened up with a touch of balsamic vinegar, seems a little austere at first, but Mr. Palmer gives it a touch of distinction by folding in some basil mousse. It's good enough to disguise the fact that like many of the offerings on the menu, it's little more than a fancified bistro dish.
The best entrees, like pan-seared quail with sauteed foie gras, cornbread and chanterelles, have a winning simplicity to them. The flavors are direct and concentrated, and there's an imaginative twist that adds intrigue to what otherwise might be a plodder. Pork tenderloin, for example, comes in a wrapping of prosciutto that gives a salty bite to the meat and brings out the sweetness of the apple jus. Caramelized pork cheeks and a white-bean ragout make the dish a very high-toned blue-plate special.
Two dishes jump off the high dive into sheer indulgence. Braised lobster with lobster ravioli luxuriates in a satiny tarragon-butter sauce that has a Gilded Age opulence to it. Stewed root vegetables add a brilliant common touch, the culinary equivalent of knocking off a top hat with a snowball. The ballottine of duck, another platinum-card dish, pulls no punches. A whole deboned duck, juicy and tender, becomes the very expensive gift wrap for a stuffing of porcini mushrooms, roasted figs and foie gras. The intelligently selected wine list does not have the category "monster reds," but it might be a good idea. This is one occasion when you want a bottle that's led snarling from a cage.
Richard Leach, Aureole's original pastry chef, has long since departed for Park Avenue Cafe, taking his quirky brilliance with him. The restaurant's desserts are rather tame and undistinguished on the whole, although I liked the loose, custardy creme brulee, served in a deep ceramic pot, and the creamy lemon custard, a triple threat served with citrus mousse and lemon creme anglaise.
If diners tend to inflate the Aureole experience, it's not hard to see why. The food comes in a very attractive setting, made more so by Mr. Tihany's subtle but effective makeover. For sentimental reasons, he has left intact a section of white wall with white bas-reliefs of flying ducks, but the rest of the restaurant has been done over in brown, red-orange and beige, warming up the dining rooms and giving them a cozy feel without looking stodgy. Subtle hip-retro touches suggest a showplace modern living room, circa 1959, an effect reinforced by the abstract art borrowed from Pace Prints.
Perhaps most important, Mr. Tihany has eliminated "Siberia," the upstairs section near the kitchen, by installing a divider and a booth that put the kitchen activity at a distance.
Aureole continues to be what it has always been, a very civilized dining spot on the edge of a very tony Upper East Side. It continues to attract, in large numbers, the crowd that it always has. The restaurant has changed very little, in fact, but the world around it has changed a lot.

HEADLINE: A Doyen Endures the Dishing-Out

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Not for 25 years has Schuyler Garrison Chapin endured such indignities -- carping friends, and days of opening the papers to read about when he might be thrown out of his job.
But Mr. Chapin, the city's genteel 76-year-old Cultural Affairs Commissioner, who finds himself in a cross-fire over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's punitive measures against the Brooklyn Museum of Art, is not easily offended. "At my age," he said, citing the late Harold R. Medina, a Federal judge who died in 1990 at 102, "it's very hard to get insulted by anything." 
 Still, critics are trying. Since Oct. 8, when Mr. Chapin politely dissented with the Mayor's cutoff of $7.2 million in city funds over the museum's "Sensation" exhibition and urged him to restore the money, support for his stand from those who oppose the Mayor critics has been tempered by complaints that he spoke out too little too late. Arts groups in particular have maintained a disdainful silence while their members privately deride Mr. Chapin for equivocating and clearing his dissent with City Hall.
"Everyone second-guesses, everyone is gifted with 20-20 hindsight," Mr. Chapin said in a recent interview, while acknowledging that in retrospect he might have handled the matter directly, seeking a meeting with the Mayor to voice his concerns instead of merely transmitting City Hall's message that the Brooklyn Museum either cancel the exhibition or lose city financing. The museum has sued the city in Federal Court in Brooklyn to get its funding back; a decision is expected shortly.
The affair, centering on a painting of the Virgin Mary that Mr. Giuliani denounced as "sick" and insulting to Roman Catholics, sent the usually cheery Mr. Chapin hurtling from initial shock to despondency. "I hoped it would explode and go away," he said. But now, he added, "everybody's emotion is like a tinderbox."
Attired in a crisp blue shirt and print tie impaled with a large safety-pin tie clip -- "I hate a flopping tie," he noted -- with his steel-gray hair swept back into an accustomed pompadour, he said he was committed to staying on as the $133,000-a-year official who coordinates cultural policy for the city's roughly 1,400 art groups and institutions and administers more than 500 cultural service grants. In his one trip to City Hall since his statement he said he detected no signs of hostility from the Mayor.
"The fact that the Mayor agreed to let me be public says a great deal about the relationship I seem to have with him," Mr. Chapin said. In his statement on Oct. 8, Mr. Chapin said that while he personally found many exhibits in the show "distasteful," the city's contribution "is not intended to support any particular exhibit, nor the viewpoint of any particular artist," and he urged the Mayor to restore financing.
He called the restoration of an arts curriculum to the schools after a 25-year absence a high point of the Mayor's achievements, and a goal that Mr. Chapin worked hard to realize. When Mr. Giuliani, crediting Mr. Chapin, announced it at his State of the City speech in 1997, Mr. Chapin recounted unabashedly, "I started to cry." He said that when some friends once assailed Mr. Giuliani as combative, he said he knew there was another side to the Mayor, which included a love for the arts, and he told his friends: "I am the commissioner of his soul."
If Mr. Chapin, a doyen of the arts who makes light of a lineage going back 10 generations to New Amsterdam, cherishes hopes of surviving this crisis, it may be because he has weathered so many others in a career stretching back half a century.
Most painful, although now he jokes about it, was his stormy tenure as general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, a role he was thrust into in 1972 after the newly named successor to Sir Rudolf Bing, Goeran Gentele, died in a car crash. With meager support from the board, he grappled with a financial crisis, a fire that destroyed thousands of costumes in a Bronx warehouse and dilution of his authority in favor of an overseer, Anthony A. Bliss, in the newly created post of executive director. All the while newspapers offered regular accounts of how he was about to be dumped, which he and unceremoniously was, in June 1975.
He became the dean of Columbia University's School of the Arts, although he had never attended college or even finished high school after his father's death left the family in precarious straits. Columbia's president at the time, William J. McGill, glossed over Mr. Chapin's educational shortcomings with the justification, "Oh well, it's the arts."
He went on to write three books and and in 1983 was named by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. He was married for 46 years to Elizabeth Steinway, of the piano family, who died in 1993. In 1995 he married Catia Z. Mortimer in a ceremony at Gracie Mansion, with the Mayor officiating.
Mr. Chapin had set his eyes early on a career in composing, not arts management. But his teacher, the redoubtable Nadia Boulanger, sized him up quickly with the pronouncement, "My dear, you've no talent." After service as a pilot in World War II, he worked for the premier classical music agency, Columbia Artists Management, and then Columbia Records, was hired as vice president for programming for the new Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and became executive producer for Leonard Bernstein's Amberson Productions.
If his administrative skills as an opera manager were sometimes devalued, his character and integrity were not. When he hired John Dexter, the British director, as the Met's production supervisor in 1974, Mr. Dexter said, "I have no contract -- only what used to be called a gentleman's agreement with Schuyler Chapin, which with him means an agreement like iron."
Unlike some other more fearsome arts managers, Mr. Chapin did not give ulcers -- he got them, collapsing in 1977 with an attack requiring an operation called a Billroth II, which he proudly notes was named for a physician friend of Brahms's. It ended his lifelong devotion to vodka martinis, leaving him a happy devotee of La Doucette, his favorite Loire white.
As the Brooklyn Museum controversy swirled recently and he was agonizing over what to do, Mr. Chapin sat in his 14th-floor offices in the old McGraw-Hill Building at 330 West 42d Street, as impeccably groomed as an escapee from the windows of J. Press.
He said he had never met Mr. Giuliani before the 1993 election, but was consulted during the search for a cultural affairs commissioner and resolved, "If this job is offered to me I'm going to take it." It was and he did.
He said that he and the Mayor-elect had hit it off from the outset, although Mr. Chapin confessed that it was he, as manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who had terminally insulted one of Mr. Giuliani's idols, Renata Tebaldi, by suggesting that she seek easier repertory to preserve her declining voice.
But his path as Commissioner was often strewn with boulders, Mr. Chapin acknowledged. In particular, he said, in the administration's first term, he and John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, clashed repeatedly over allocation of the arts budget. Mr. Dyson favored grants to large institutions at the expense of more marginal groups. Mr. Chapin championed a balance, but, undoubtedly more than appointees in the mayor's inner circle, he was frequently bypassed in the decision-making process, a pattern re-enacted in the Brooklyn Museum episode.
Since the issue erupted with a mayoral denunciation on Sept. 22, said Mr. Chapin, he has been deluged with calls and letters. One person who prodded him for a strong response was a longtime friend, Kenneth Dayton, a retired chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest retailer. In an interview, Mr. Dayton said that in a private letter to Mr. Chapin he offered this advice: "As a leading spokesman for the arts he should speak out; if he couldn't he should resign."
Mr. Dayton excoriated arts groups for not speaking out more quickly and forcefully. "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I just couldn't believe that an arts community pictured as not provincial would fall so low as to be silent in the face of this threat to artistic freedom."
Arts groups say they acted swiftly to condemn the Mayor, but waited a day to give the museum and City Hall a chance to quietly resolve their differences.
Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation and a former president of the New York Public Library, said that Mr. Chapin had called him for advice and Mr. Gregorian did not hold back. "Time is of the essence," he said he urged Mr. Chapin. "One way or the other, you either support the Mayor or disassociate yourself from him. You can't do both."
"If you lose the cultural institutions' trust, you're of no use to the Mayor," Mr. Gregorian said he told the Commissioner, adding, "If the Mayor is smart he will recognize you are needed as a bridge of understanding."

HEADLINE: Annan Says Quick Elections in Kosovo May Not Help Tensions

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, warned today that the "built-in tension" between the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo who want independence and the United Nations, which is administering the territory as part of Yugoslavia, would mount as time goes on.
Mr. Annan suggested that he had no immediate solution to the problem but stressed that holding quick elections was not an easy answer. He said he was determined that the United Nations should not repeat what he called the "mistakes" made in Bosnia, where the results of national elections nine months after the Dayton peace accord "legitimized those who caused the war" when hard-line ethnic leaders were voted into office. 
 Speaking to reporters here after his first trip to Kosovo, last week, Mr. Annan said: "We have a mandate to administer the territory as part of sovereign Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. But those we are administering want independence. This ambiguity is going to bring problems down the line."
It well could develop, he said, that the ethnic Albanians who make up an overwhelming proportion of the population regard the United Nations administrators as an "occupation force."
Clinton Administration officials who have recently visited Kosovo acknowledge that relations between the people and the administrators have deteriorated. Some of that problem stems from unrealistic expectations by ethnic Albanians who thought the United Nations would bring instant independence, and some stems from slow progress on rebuilding damaged homes in time for winter.
The atmosphere has not been helped, Administration officials have said, by the continuing high level of ethnic tension between the estimated 97,000 Serbs who have remained in Kosovo and the ethnic Albanians, as well as by tensions between Albanian factions.
Mr. Annan did not commit himself to a date for elections but said he favored holding local elections first. He is to receive an assessment in about two weeks on the technical aspects of holding elections in a place where voter rolls are mostly destroyed and where ethnic Albanians have boycotted elections for more than a decade in a protest against the federal Government.
It is essential, Mr. Annan said, to give time to new political parties to organize so the entrenched forces do not automatically win.
The State Department has said it would like to see municipal elections next spring. But the Balkan Action Council, a nongovernment organization headed by former senior American diplomats, argues that "rolling municipal elections" should start immediately.
With quick registration of voters in one or two towns, there is a chance for new parties, including one formed by a breakaway group from the Kosovo Liberation Army, to gain ground, said James Hooper, executive director of the council.
Mr. Annan said that in administering Kosovo, the United Nations had to tread a fine line between making decisions that would help create an independent entity and relying on the authorities in Serbia and its leader, Slobodan Milosevic. Under the United Nations mandate, Kosovo is to be administered as a self-governing autonomous region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Mr. Annan said that was a difficult task, particularly in building a sustainable economy. For example the mines, traditionally a major employer, are owned by Serbs who now live in Belgrade.

Serb Acquitted of Genocide
 THE HAGUE, Oct. 19 (AP) -- The United Nations war crimes tribunal acquitted a Bosnian Serb of genocide charges today, ruling that the 31 counts of crimes against humanity that he has confessed to do not constitute a campaign of atrocities.
Ending its first genocide trial, the tribunal said the Serb, Goran Jelisic, did not commit crimes consistent with the strict definition of genocide.
"The accused could not be found guilty of genocide," Judge Claude Jorda of France said in reading the verdict.

HEADLINE: Inflation and the Economy

 BODY:
Two recent price reports appear to signal that the hated scourge of inflation may be on the rise. Consumer prices, the government reported yesterday, rose at about a 5 percent annual rate last month, and at a 4 percent rate over the last three months -- about 50 percent faster than in the recent past. Wholesale prices did even worse, rising at about a 10 percent rate in September and at a 7.5 percent rate for the last three months.
Will rising inflation force the Federal Reserve to slam on the monetary brakes and bring the bountiful economy to a threateningly slow gait? Almost certainly not. Recent price spikes remain well within the range that the Federal Reserve can handle without punishing the economy. 
 Consumer prices have picked up because of temporary factors limited to isolated markets. Most prominently, oil prices, after falling steeply last year, are playing catch-up, rising at an annual rate of about 30 percent over the past three months. Excluding oil and food prices, consumer prices have risen by a rate of only about 2.5 percent during the last quarter, slightly faster than last year. Wholesale prices spiked in September after a year of near-stability. If temporary factors keep emerging, it would be unwise to ignore them, but for now it is unwise to hyperventilate about such short-term aberrations.
Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard, like many economists, worries more about recent wage trends. He points to the generous contract with the auto workers that will push up wages by 3 percent more than inflation. Wages generally have been rising at an annual rate of 4 percent. If productivity -- the output workers turn out in an hour -- rises fast, employers can pay the higher wages without raising prices. But fast-rising productivity is far from guaranteed. Even if inflation does pick up slightly, the economy is not doomed. The Federal Reserve has all the tools it needs to bring modest price spikes under control.
So if recent prices are cause for concern but not alarm, is something worse lurking? Judging from his cryptic comments last week, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, appears to think so. For three years he has worried that an inflated stock market might crash, driving investors to take cover and producing billions of dollars of losses that could force consumers to pull back spending. That could be a prescription for recession.
Mr. Greenspan does not worry about falling stock prices if they move gradually. Three years ago he tried to nudge them lower by openly wondering about "irrational exuberance" among investors. Then the Dow was around 7,000. Now it is 3,000 points higher. Mr. Greenspan is still wondering.
There is a debate among economists whether Mr. Greenspan is correct. A best-selling book predicts, on the basis of robust corporate earnings and increased awareness among investors that stocks are as safe as bonds over the long haul, that investors will drive stock prices mightily higher, perhaps to 36,000 or beyond. Most other economists do not agree. One recent analysis says they could drop by a third, after inflation, over the next decade.
But whatever the case, falling or rising stock prices pose no threat to the economy as long as they move gradually. Professor Friedman points out that the Dow has already fallen by 10 percent or more with little impact on spending and could fall another 10 or 15 percent without major incident. Stock prices would remain well above levels of several years ago. Most investors would still feel wealthy and feel no pressure to cut purchases.

HEADLINE: A Larger Legacy May Await Generations X, Y and Z

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Boston College researchers say that the widely cited estimate that $10.4 trillion of wealth will be transferred to younger generations over a half-century is far short of the likely amount. They estimate the wealth transfer will be $41 trillion to $136 trillion.
"It can now be safely said that the forthcoming wealth transfer will be many times larger than anyone has previously estimated," said Paul G. Schervish, director of the Boston College Social Welfare Research Institute, who has spent the last 15 years studying wealth and who created a computer model to study wealth transfers. 
 The new figures suggest that charities, in particular, stand to benefit from a platinum era of giving. Mr. Schervish and John J. Havens, his deputy at the institute, estimated that between now and 2055 charities would receive bequests of $16 trillion to $53 trillion, measured in 1998 dollars, assuming that the estate tax remains unchanged.
The widely cited estimate of $10.4 trillion -- about $13 trillion today adjusted for inflation -- in wealth transfer was made in 1993 by two Cornell University professors, Robert B. Avery and Michael S. Rendall, using data from the Census Bureau and other sources. Their estimate was restricted to households in which the chief wage earner was 50 or older and who had living children; it covered 1990 to 2044.
The Boston College analysis, using a computer simulation model created to estimate wealth transfers, covers all Americans who were at least age 18 in 1998. It estimates wealth transfers from 1998 to 2052, when the youngest of those in the study will turn 73.
The Boston College study is based on modest assumptions about growth in wealth compared with historical experience. The study's low estimate that $41 billion will be transferred between generations by 2055 assumes that the value of all assets, adjusted for inflation, increases at 2 percent annually, while the high estimate assumes 4 percent annual real growth. Another profile assumes 3 percent annual real growth in the value of assets and projects $73 trillion in wealth transfers.
Actual growth in wealth, adjusted for inflation, averaged 5.3 percent annually from 1950 to this year, according to Prof. Edward N. Wolff, a New York University wealth expert.
Total wealth in 1998 was $32 trillion, the Boston College researchers estimated. Professor Wolff, who had not seen the new study, said, "That figure is in the right neighborhood," noting that his own research indicated total wealth of $29.1 trillion today.
The amount of wealth transferred can be greater than current wealth for two reasons. One is economic growth. The other is that over 55 years some fortunes will pass through two -- even three -- generations. Mr. Avery, now an economist with the Federal Reserve, said that while he had some qualms about the techniques used by the Boston College researchers, as described to him in a telephone interview, their estimates sounded reasonable over all.
Mr. Avery warned, however, that while economists could make fairly accurate predictions about death rates far into the future, assumptions about how much wealth people would accumulate were risky, especially looking out a half-century.
"The important message is that there is a lot of wealth in this country," Mr. Avery said.
John J. Havens, a co-author of the Boston College study, said that while he was confident of the economic model he wanted to focus on the low end of the estimate, $41 trillion, because "it helps protect against potential charges of irrational exuberance arising from" the computer model's assuming steady economic growth without a depression or a sustained recession in the first half of the 21st century.
A quarter-century ago Professor Havens developed one of the first computer programs to model economic behavior. The model estimates that for estates of $20 million or more, 39 percent of the money will go to charity, 23 percent to heirs, 34 percent to taxes and 3 percent for fees and burial expenses. Data from the Internal Revenue Service show the same ratios in 1995 for large estates.
For estates of $1 million to just under $5 million, the study assumes that charity will get 8 percent; heirs, 66 percent; taxes, 22 percent, and fees and burial expenses, 4 percent.
For estates of less than $1 million, Professors Schervish and Havens estimated, nearly 90 cents of each dollar would be passed to heirs and little would go to charity or taxes.
One recent analysis found that among estates valued at $600,000 to $1 million in 1997, estate taxes averaged 6 percent, even though the estate tax rate began at 37 percent on amounts above the $600,000 exemption then in effect.
The Boston College study covers what are known as final estates, meaning the death of a single person or the second spouse in a married couple, since bequests to a spouse are tax free. The estimates of how much will be bequeathed to charity may be low, based on I.R.S. data in recent years, which show that growing numbers of people are engaging in estate planning so that more of their money will go to charity after their deaths and less to the Government. The I.R.S. data show that the share of money in estates going to charity is slowly rising, a trend that if continued through 2055 would mean far more for charities than the $16 trillion to $53 trillion cited in the study.
If the estate tax is repealed or significantly reduced, however, as Congress voted to do earlier this year in a bill that President Clinton vetoed, bequests to charities might be smaller than the Boston College model predicted.

HEADLINE: A Suburbiascape Grows In Inner-City Chicago

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 19

 BODY:
It is the familiar mallscape of suburbia, a big supermarket and a strip of gleaming shops behind a parking lot the size of a football field. But it is a stone's throw from a public housing tower.
This is 47th Street in the pockmarked North Kenwood section of Chicago, where the population has dwindled by two-thirds in the last 30 years, with whole blocks sitting vacant, rejected as untouchable by investors who saw more danger than hope. 
 Now investors see an urban Lazarus, a long-moribund neighborhood coming back to life, a striking example of how economic prosperity is changing the face of America. It is also a vivid illustration of how a City Hall, which in Chicago is the landlord for much of the cleared land, can transform a neighborhood by knocking down eyesores, readying parcels and recruiting developers.
"You walk inside this place, and you forget you're on the South Side of Chicago," said Marty Murray, 43, as he marveled at the selection at the Lake Park Pointe Shopping Center, which opened this month. "People out in the suburbs have had this forever. It's just wonderful. You can get everything you need."
Anchored by the big Co-Op Markets supermarket, the $9.1 million shopping center includes a bank, a real-estate office, a drugstore, a dry cleaner and an eyesight clinic.
"A supermarket is the single most important ingredient to betterment of life in poor, urban neighborhoods," said Joe Schwieterman, an urban planner who is director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University.
Supermarkets provide a savings of 15 percent to 20 percent compared with little neighborhood stores, Mr. Schwieterman said. And money spent in supermarkets is turned over in the community perhaps three times, largely because such big grocery stores hire so many local workers. Co-Op Markets, for example, employs more than 200 people.
"It also creates a perception of prosperity or commercial vibrancy," he said. "There's a place to go in the neighborhood where there is the constant movement of people. It also helps give a community a sense of identity."
"What we're seeing here," he added, "is gentrification gradually extending its reach into neighborhoods that had been desolate."
North Kenwood was long been regarded as the poor, sometimes frightening area near Hyde Park, an upscale neighborhood known for its stately stone buildings and its Nobel laureates at the University of Chicago.
"You'd go through Kenwood on the way to a White Sox game and that was about it," said Nancy Kiernan, a city planner. "But its time has come."
In the last six months, residential property costs in the neighborhood have soared to $10 a square foot from $4 a square foot, with a flurry of new construction and remodeling driven largely by demand from affluent young black professionals.
Alderwoman Toni Preckwinkle, whose ward includes the shopping center, said several people had told her, with evident pride, "It's as nice as anything on the North Side."
Ms. Preckwinkle said that for many years developers had seen the neighborhood as "too dicey" for investment, especially with a high crime rate stoked by the illicit drug trade. But the new development, residential and commercial, has chased away many of the outlaws.
"The criminals want peace and quiet and isolation in which to do their business," she said. "Now they've got neighbors who will call the police on them."
Richard Fisk, the general manager of the Co-Op Markets, said he was convinced a few years ago that the neighborhood was a market to be tapped.
"We all seem to eat," Mr. Fisk said. "And there were not too many choices for people to shop."
Mr. Schwieterman, the urban planner at DePaul, said many people in poor urban neighborhoods traveled to inner-ring suburbs to shop for groceries, a hardship for the consumers and a huge loss of potential business for cities.
Officers with the Chicago Police Department have been highly visible around the new shopping center, as City Hall lends its weight to make sure the new venture goes smoothly.
Mr. Fisk, the general manager, said his store had also hired a big complement of security guards, inside and outside the store.
"If people don't feel safe," he said, "they won't come to shop."
One of the hundreds of new jobs spawned by the shopping center belongs to Jeffrey Billips, 17, who now earns $6.31 an hour bagging groceries at Co-Op Markets.
"Some guys my age have gotten into stealing, selling drugs; some of them have even been shot at," said Mr. Billips, the youngest of five children, whose mother died last year of an asthma attack. "This job is going to help me pay for college."

HEADLINE: An October Bust? Not This Time

BYLINE: By Bruce Steinberg; Bruce Steinberg is chief economist for Merrill Lynch.

 BODY:
For those who tirelessly warn that the economic boom is a bubble overdue to burst, these must seem like perilous days. Last week, worries about inflation and possible interest-rate increases sent stock prices into their biggest swoon in a decade -- in what some noted was the week before the anniversary of the infamous Black Monday of 1987. When stocks rebounded this week, after consumer prices showed only a modest increase, there was talk of volatility.
But the doomsayers are looking for signs of disaster where none exist. The American economy has performed better in the 1990's than at any time in history, and there is no end of that success in sight. 
 The bubble theory rests on arguments that the stock market is overvalued, Americans are not saving and the trade deficit is at a dangerous level. Assets are said to have become overvalued, leading to overconsumption and an overheating of the economy that will inevitably end in a violent correction -- a stock market crash. But this argument will not stand up to a careful analysis.
The pessimists' misinterpretations begin with stock prices, which have indeed grown rapidly. Even after a 10 percent correction in the past two months, stocks in the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index are trading, on average, at more than 24 times their 1999 operating earnings per share -- near-record levels. However, values are highest in the sector where growth prospects are highest and demand is accelerating: technology. With the technology stocks excluded, the price-earnings ratio for the rest of the companies in the index is around 19. Adjusted for interest rates, that's comfortably in line with the experience of the past few decades.
Some analysts also think they see a real estate bubble -- a dangerous trend if it were real. Who can forget Japan's bubble economy of the 1980's, when the grounds of the Imperial Palace were supposedly worth as much as California? But in the United States, mortgage borrowing has been relatively weak in the 1990's and, despite dizzying prices in pockets like Manhattan and Silicon Valley, the national median price of existing homes rose just 4.5 percent a year.
The negative national savings rate is another fiction. The official savings rate has plunged from 5 percent at the end of the 1980's to minus-1.5 percent now, leading alarmists to say that Americans are on a spending binge fueled by rising asset prices and excessive borrowing. But the figures are flawed. Wage income has actually grown faster than consumer spending during the past several years. And while total income grew more slowly than spending because interest and dividend income grew slowly during the 1990's, that weak growth was more than offset by the rise in the value of stocks. The official calculations of the savings rate do not count capital gains income -- though Americans who pay taxes on it can attest that it is quite real. When it is included, the savings rate is 8 percent.
As for the trade deficit, it is indeed at a record level, but it doubled during the past two years because weak growth in the rest of the world hurt American exports. Now the world economy is recovering. In September, export orders rose to the highest level in 30 months.
What the unprecedented performance of the American economy in this decade really reflects is a revolution in productivity. Productivity grew during the past five years at double the pace of the prior 25 years. That is what allowed the economy to grow by more than 4 percent last year while the core inflation rate dropped by half a percentage point and the unemployment rate was stable.
The economy may have to slow a bit now to keep the Fed happy. But although the United States will undoubtedly have a recession someday, don't look for it anytime soon.

HEADLINE: NEW ON WEDNESDAY;
National Urgency And a Local Focus

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
AL GORE vows an education revolution if elected President. Bill Gates pledges $1 billion for minority scholarships to college, one of the largest gifts in the history of philanthropy. Voters say education is the top domestic priority.
With the nation sharpening its focus on education, The Times today introduces a new Wednesday Education page. The contents will pair a new national column with a more intense focus on the New York area. 
 The column, called Lessons, will be written every other week by Richard Rothstein, an education researcher in California. In the weeks when he is not writing, the column will be by a member of the Times staff.
Each week's page will include a feature article that looks at an educational institution or figure in or around New York as well as briefer reports, gathered under the rubric Bulletin Board, that will track movements and people in the region's education community. The page will appear in copies of The Times distributed in the New York area. In other regions, The Times will include the Lessons column in the national news pages.
The Times is also increasing its overall coverage of education. Articles on the subject will appear throughout the national, metropolitan and business reports.
At least three factors explain the increased national attention to education.
First, with the military draft gone, the public school classroom is one of the last forums in which large, varied segments of society come together. How and what a nation chooses to teach its young is a reflection not only of who it is but also of who it hopes to be.
Second, with the cold war over and well-being often defined largely through economics, many believe that the nation's future depends specifically on how well it trains its students to foster and manage technical and knowledge-based industries.
Finally, most Americans are persuaded that there is no clearer path to personal prosperity and well-being than through education. As Nicholas Lemann puts it in his new book, "The Big Test" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux): "A thick line runs through the country, with people who have been to college on one side of it and people who haven't on the other. This line gets brighter all the time."
There is a tension between two vital forces in education today: standards and equity. If improved education is really the key to an improved national economy, schools need to be more rigorous or their graduates will be poorly trained and the economy will decline. But if education is really the key to personal prosperity, is there any more vital goal for a nation pledged to equal opportunity than to expand the franchise of education, to make it more fully available to those who have largely been denied it? Can education be made more difficult and more available at the same time?
Education is taking on such a large role in national politics because what purports to be about education is often about something else -- religion, race, technology, economics. The conflict between higher standards and greater educational equity is a proxy for a debate over race and class.
Even issues that seem at first purely pedagogical -- how to teach reading or mathematics, for example -- are often stand-ins for philosophical disputes like whether children are best viewed as flowers to be cultivated or beasts to be tamed.
Education in America is increasingly about money, not only how much to spend, or how much can be made by those who graduate, but also, for the first time, how much can be made by those who provide it. Learning, even elementary-school learning, is now seen as a profit center for some large companies setting up for-profit schools, universities and training centers. Higher standards lead inexorably to more tests, and tests are often provided by private companies. And so the links between education and the economy grow tighter, creating a nexus of relationships requiring close scrutiny.
The goal of this page will be to contribute to that scrutiny. ETHAN BRONNER (Education Editor)

HEADLINE: U.S. Bishops Urging Catholics To Be Politically Involved

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Calling the election year 2000 both a "great spiritual milestone" and an "important civic challenge," the nation's Roman Catholic bishops are to issue a statement today saying participation in the political process is a moral obligation for Catholics and asking them to reflect on how politics can be used to advance church principles like stopping abortion, helping poor children, protecting immigrants' rights and providing families affordable housing.
The statement, "Faithful Citizenship: Civic Responsibility for a New Millennium," is directed at the United States' 61 million baptized Catholics, who, accounting for nearly a quarter of the population, are the country's largest single religious group, once strongly Democratic, now far more politically divided. 
 The document, which the National Conference of Catholic Bishops will send to all 19,000 American parishes in January, is carefully nonpartisan in tone. It explicitly disavows any intention by the bishops to try to create "a religious voting block" -- an effort that would most likely be doomed from the outset anyway, given how socially and ethnically diverse the American Catholic population has become.
Still, its central point -- that major church teachings should be considered in the voting booth -- may carry important weight among churchgoing Catholics with no firm commitment to either Democrats or Republicans.
"In the Catholic tradition," the statement says, "responsible citizenship is a virtue; participation in the political process is a moral obligation." It also says Catholics ought to measure candidates and political platforms by "whether they enhance or diminish human life, dignity and human rights; and how they advance the common good."
Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, chairman of the bishops' International Policy Committee, who had a major hand in developing the document, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the bishops viewed it as a way to convey the practical implications of the church's social teachings.
"It's an attempt to speak to the questions that are around today," Archbishop McCarrick said.
The bishops have a tradition, dating from 1975, of issuing statements on Catholics' civic responsibility in the autumn before a Presidential election year. But the new document differs from its predecessors in that it is more plainly written and, at 17 pages, considerably shorter, and in that it urges Catholics to steer clear of political cynicism -- an implicit recognition of how politics has been roiled by President Clinton's impeachment, and of the bishops' disappointment over the failure of recent efforts to enact legislation curbing a late-term abortion procedure.
"Sometimes it seems few candidates and no party fully reflect our values," the statement says. "But now is not a time for retreat. The new millennium should be an opportunity for renewed participation."
The statement places the church's teachings against abortion and physician-assisted suicide at the top of a list of concerns that also include protection of the environment and workers' rights. Unlike its predecessors, the statement gives a high profile as well to certain other issues, like opposition to the death penalty and support for efforts to relieve poor nations of their foreign debt, that have drawn particular attention from Pope John Paul II and the bishops this year.
Once a fairly reliable Democratic constituency, Catholics have become a far more difficult group to categorize politically since the 1960's, populating as they do all economic classes and including a large and growing number of immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Within this diverse population, however, the group that political scientists describe as white, non-Hispanic moderates -- about one-third of all Catholics, and 7 percent to 8 percent of the electorate -- may be most moved by the bishops' statement. In its politics, this group is "genuinely ambivalent" with regard to party affiliation, said Prof. John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
Professor Green said surveys showed that moderate Catholics had been politically mobile during the last five years. A majority voted Republican in 1994, helping that party capture control of Congress. But they split their ballots in 1996, supporting both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans, and last year they sided largely with the Democrats, helping the minority to pick up House seats.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Canadian Union Reach Tentative Agreement

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Dodging a threatened strike, the General Motors Corporation reached a tentative contract agreement tonight with the Canadian Auto Workers union that will provide generous raises to the company's 21,000 Canadian factory workers even as it allows the company to continue to downsize.
"It is an excellent agreement," said Basil E. Hargrove, the union's president. "It recognizes the contribution our workers have made to General Motors' profits." 
 Under the three-year agreement, G.M.'s Canadian workers will receive annual raises of 3 percent in addition to inflation adjustments. In addition, they will receive a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus and an annual holiday bonus of $1,200 (Canadian). And each year, they will receive an additional week of paid time off, improved pension benefits, a $2,000 (Canadian) child care subsidy for children younger than 5 and an $800 (Canadian) tuition refund for workers with children in college.
With the agreement, the auto industry breathed a collective sigh of relief. The Canadian labor deal with G.M. wrapped up this fall's rush of negotiations between G.M., the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. and their American and Canadian unions. Both unions negotiated hefty raises for the more than 450,000 auto factory workers, sending some of the record profits the auto industry has been earning to the pockets of its workers.
The Canadian union had threatened a strike after G.M. proposed eliminating 1,300 jobs. G.M. reversed course, promising to invest $1.1 billion (Canadian) in various factories. "We're saving lots of jobs here," Mr. Hargrove said. Still, G.M. is expected to downsize through attrition.
G.M. may close a Canadian factory in the fall of 2002. Workers in St. Therese, Quebec, now build Pontiac Firebirds and Chevrolet Camaros, but that production is scheduled to end in September 2002. G.M. agreed only to study the feasibility of building a niche vehicle in the factory after work on the Firebirds and Camaros ends.
The Canadian union took a different approach to a challenge faced by the United Automobile Workers. The Canadian union agreed to allow G.M. to use "modular" factories, in which suppliers assemble large pieces of the vehicle, which are then shipped to unionized assembly factories and pieced together into cars and trucks.
The American union vehemently opposed the approach, arguing that work done by its well-paid members would be lost to lower-paying suppliers. The Canadian union simply stipulated that if G.M. plans such moves, the workers in the parts factories must be covered under the agreement with the union. That would effectively force G.M. to favor sending work to Delphi Automotive Systems, the auto parts unit it spun off in May.

HEADLINE: Long Line in the Bronx, but for Jobs, Not the Yankees

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
By 9 A.M. yesterday, the line snaked around three sides of the Bronx County Building. Was someone giving away World Series tickets?
No, it was jobs that were being offered -- or at least the hope of them. More than 40 employers were inside at a job fair, trying to fill positions from sales clerk to registered nurse. 
 About 5,000 potential job candidates -- from welfare mothers to recent college graduates -- showed up, some waiting more than three hours to get into the fair.
A few said they were curious; some said they wanted to see if they could get a better-paying job. But most said they were drawn by desperation.
While the economy may be soaring, many said, in their lives the economic boom has a hollow echo.
Unemployment in the Bronx has dropped significantly -- to 8.2 percent in August, compared with 11.4 percent in August 1997 -- but it is still double the national average. It is also higher than in the city as a whole, which had 6.7 percent unemployment in August.
There are a variety of reasons, from the decline of manufacturing to the Bronx's high population of young people, among whom unemployment rates tend to be higher. There is also poverty, which translates into fewer skills and fewer options.
Many of those in line yesterday, some of whom had come from Manhattan, said they had been looking for work, most often entry-level clerical positions, for months.
Hassan Kelliehan, 25, said he has been on the hunt since March, when he lost the job he had had for two and a half years at Caldor's, the retailer that is now in bankruptcy. "I send my resume," he said, "but there's no response."
The economy is booming all over, said Jose Ithier, the president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which co-sponsored the fair with the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "But maybe," Mr. Ithier said, "the world needs to see the people lined up here looking for a job."
Looking for work is hard and humbling: trudging to offices, filling out applications, being told to await calls that never come. But yesterday, for just one day, potential employers eagerly accepted resumes, showed friendly faces and offered words of encouragement. The aspirants collected business cards, filled out applications, and in some cases signed up for job-training programs.
But as the stack of resumes grew higher at each table, it became clear that each job-seeker's chances grew slimmer.
"I've never seen a job fair this well attended," said Lucy Mayo, an employment specialist. "There is a huge pool of people with entry-level skills and not enough jobs for them."
Those jobs that are available, Ms. Mayo continued, offer low pay and no benefits.
For example, Barnes & Noble -- which is scheduled to open a new bookstore at Bay Plaza in the Bronx in early December and has 50 to 75 jobs to fill -- pays $7.25 an hour for starting jobs, which are all part-time with no benefits.
Some jobs, at Jacobi and Montefiore Medical Centers, for example, pay better, and the Correctional Services Corporation, one of the employers at the fair, offers benefits after six months.
And at least, Mr. Ithier and others said, jobs are being created in the Bronx -- some 2,600 last year alone, mostly in retail and construction. Still, 250,000 Bronx residents work outside the borough.
That takes a toll in time and money. Anthony Uribe, 25, said he had left his last manufacturing job, in Chatham, N.J., because the transportation was eating up half of his $7 hourly pay. With two children to support, he had been looking for work for six months.
Many of those in line and inside were on public assistance, and in many cases were trying to get off it after years out of the work force. Teodora Brea, 45, one of many single mothers at the fair, said she had been on public assistance for 10 years and was now struggling to move back into the workplace in anticipation of time limits on her benefits.
Carlos Herrera, a recent immigrant from Peru who lacks working papers as well as English, said: "I need help urgently. I need money to buy clothes for the cold."
He and his fellow unemployed share an experience that Jeffrey Winn, 39, likened to what he imagined being locked up would feel like: "No control."
Mr. Winn, 39, has been looking for work for 10 months, since cutbacks at the shipping and receiving department at Oxford Health Plan. He has four children, and counts himself lucky because his wife has a job.
"Being out of work -- I wouldn't recommend it to anyone," he said as he waited near the end of the line.

HEADLINE: Political Stalemate Continues Over Banking Bill

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Senate Republicans and senior officials in the Clinton Administration failed to agree today on legislation to overhaul the nation's financial system, and said they would resume negotiations on Wednesday.
The lawmakers are nearing completion of a bill that would repeal more than 60 years of laws that restrict the ability of banks, insurance companies and securities firms to expand into each other's industries. 
 Over the last week, the differences between the White House and the Republicans have substantially narrowed, raising the prospects for legislation that Congress has tried unsuccessfully to adopt for more than 20 years.
The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said today that the Administration was satisfied with the law's provisions on consumer privacy. Consumer and privacy groups said, however, the measure would do little to protect customers from having their confidential information disclosed.
Despite the progress in resolving most differences over the legislation, strong disagreements remain between Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and President Clinton over the measure's treatment of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending.
Mr. Clinton has stood strongly behind civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus, which was a crucial ally in the Presidential impeachment proceedings. The President's top aides have denounced provisions of the legislation that they contend would make damaging changes to the Community Reinvestment Act.
Mr. Gramm has maintained that the act is unduly burdensome on small institutions and that the changes he has suggested would not undermine it.
These are the Community Reinvestment Act issues in dispute:
*Whether a new kind of financial business known as wholesale financial institutions -- and nicknamed woofies -- must meet the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The new institutions take deposits of more than $100,000 and are not subject to many of the regulations that affect traditional banks. The legislation produced by the conference committee would authorizes companies to set up woofies but would exempt them from the act. That has raised concerns that woofies would create large new loopholes, allowing traditional institutions to avoid compliance with the act.
*Whether community groups, which often make deals with banks about their community lending practices, must make such arrangements public.
*Whether the examination cycle for small and rural banks for compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act should be less frequent, as Senator Gramm contends, or remain the same, as the Administration wants.
*Whether banks entering new lines of business need to maintain satisfactory ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act.
In talks at the Capitol today, Mr. Gramm; Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Secretary, and Gene Sperling, the President's top economic adviser, failed to resolve the differences.
In recent days Mr. Sperling has met regularly with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been critical of the banking legislation. Mr. Jackson contends the legislation fails to provide adequate protection for minorities and others historically denied access to credit.
Lobbyists from the financial services industry said they expected that a deal could ultimately be reached. Nonetheless, they were concerned that differences remained between the White House and Senate Republicans.
"It's so frustrating because we're very very close and have not gotten the ball over the finish line," said Tom Block, a senior vice president in charge of Federal relations for Chase Manhattan Bank.
"We've come so close and solved so many of the issues," he added. "We can't be this close and not solve the problem, but crazier things have happened. It is a highly charged political issue that is hard for some to negotiate on. C.R.A. should be resolvable. The banks have learned to live with C.R.A."

A Platinum Era of Giving Is Foreseen by Researchers
Far more wealth will be transferred to younger generations over a half-century than the $10.4 trillion previously thought, Boston College researchers say. They put the amount at $41 trillion to $136 trillion.
The new figures suggest that charities stand to benefit from a platinum era of giving with bequests of $16 trillion to $53 trillion between now and 2055. Page C2. 

Drug Makers' Profits and Shares Up
Continuing the drug industry's strong quarter, Pfizer, maker of the impotency pill Viagra, surprised analysts by announcing a 36 percent earnings increase, while Johnson & Johnson reported a 14.4 percent gain and Bristol-Myers Squibb posted a 14 percent advance. Shares of all three climbed, with Johnson & Johnson's stock up 5.5 percent. C6.
 
McDonnell Douglas Is Indicted
A Federal grand jury indicted McDonnell Douglas, a unit of Boeing, and a state-owned aerospace company in China on charges of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale of American machining equipment. A1.

I.B.M. to Stress Internet Sales
I.B.M., which lost $1 billion on personal computers last year, said that it would sell its Aptiva desktop machines, which are intended for home use, only on the Internet after Christmas. Its Thinkpad laptops will continue to be sold in retail stores. C6.
 
Bell Atlantic Gains on Long Distance
Bell Atlantic appeared likely to become the first regional Bell to succeed in its bid to sell long-distance services as the New York State Public Service Commission told Federal regulators that the company had opened its local networks to competitors. C11.
 
Harold Evans to Leave Daily News
Harold Evans, the editorial director of The Daily News and U.S. News & World Report, said that he would leave the post at the end of the year to work on two book projects that are likely to become television documentaries.

HEADLINE: Lifting Spirits On Wall Street, Microsoft Profit Beats Forecasts

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation reported quarterly earnings yesterday that convincingly surpassed Wall Street's expectations and reflected strong demand for personal computers and their software.
Analysts said the encouraging report from Microsoft, the world's leading software maker, is likely to lift investors' confidence in the shares of high-technology companies, which have recently fallen sharply. "This will probably be a bullish signal for the beaten-down technology stocks," said Rick Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 In after-hours trading, Microsoft shares jumped more than $3 on news of the strong earnings report. They had declined $1.5625, to $86.3125, in the regular session.
Both Dell Computer and Intel have recently issued warnings of slimmer profits. Both companies attributed the expected slippage to temporary circumstances like higher memory-chip prices and supply disruptions caused by the earthquake in Taiwan. But the announcements raised fears of a fundamental weakness in the technology sector, which has fueled the United States economy's growth and the stock market's ascent for years.
Microsoft executives sought to quash those wider concerns yesterday. Their tone was more forcefully optimistic than in previous earnings announcements, a practiced quarterly ritual in which Microsoft reports extraordinary profit figures accompanied by guarded commentary about the many challenges the company faces in the months ahead.
Yesterday, however, a press release announcing the earnings carried the headline, "Awesome PC Demand Drives Outstanding Microsoft Quarterly Results." In an interview, Gregory B. Maffei, the chief financial officer, described the financial performance as "a really big quarter" and later "a great quarter."
Microsoft's earnings per share, after excluding the gain from the sale of one business, rose 36 percent, to 38 cents a share. The consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts had been for profit of 34 cents a share for the quarter, which ended on Sept. 30. The result was ahead, as well, of the so-called whisper number of 35 cents a share, the estimate analysts mention to favored clients, which may differ from their published earnings projections.
Microsoft's revenue increased 28 percent, to $5.38 billion, up from $4.19 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Including a $156 million gain from the sale of the entertainment city-guide portion of its MSN Sidewalk on-line service, Microsoft's net income rose more than 30 percent, to $2.19 billion, up from $1.68 billion a year earlier. The 1998 results had included a $160 million gain from the sale of a software subsidiary, Softimage.
Company executives were sharply questioned about one balance-sheet item: a decline of $110 million from the June quarter in deferred revenue, to just under $4.13 billion. The reason analysts focus on this item is that they regard it as a financial cushion: the time when Microsoft recognizes revenue on its software licenses to corporations can sharply affect the quarterly earnings. Recognizing more revenue in a particular quarter can give a one-time lift to that quarter's earnings. Mr. Maffei said the drop from the June quarter reflected seasonality in the business.
Microsoft's quarterly statements, and the follow-up conference call with securities analysts and reporters, are scrutinized as much for nuance as for numbers. The performance this time was intended to emphasize that the company is successfully making the transition to becoming an Internet software company.
The personal computer, Microsoft points out, remains the main conduit people use to get onto the Internet. And its Windows NT server software, which runs on hub computers that send World Wide Web pages to users, is becoming increasingly popular among Internet service providers and "dot.com" Internet start-ups, according to Microsoft.
"We're getting an enormous kick from the Internet," Mr. Maffei said.
Microsoft is unquestionably a beneficiary of the Internet, analysts agree. But they say a question remains as to how successful Microsoft will be in competing against Sun Microsystems, I.B.M. and others in supplying the industrial-strength software required to run big central data centers, which are proliferating because of the Internet.
The long-delayed new upgrade of Windows NT, called Windows 2000, is the operating system that Microsoft is betting on to move into the markets for heavyweight corporate computing and data centers. In its conference call, the company reiterated that it expects to release Windows 2000 later this year.
Microsoft also said that there was little evidence yet that concerns about the Year 2000 software problem, or Y2K, were causing a halt in computer buying. The fear had been that corporate customers would spend all their information technology budgets on fixing Y2K problems in existing computers instead of buying new ones.
By region, the biggest rise in sales was in Asia, where revenue increased 82 percent compared with the 1998 quarter. Japan accounts for about 80 percent of sales in the Asian region. A stronger Japanese economy and a rising yen helped lift the result, Mr. Maffei noted, but the global spread of the Internet phenomenon was also a big factor. "Japan is getting very focused on the Internet," he said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Benefits Are Set to Rise by 2.4%

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Beginning in January, retirees will get the biggest cost-of-living increase in their Social Security checks in three years, an average of $19 a month.
The 2.4 percent increase, announced today by the Social Security Administration, will be nearly twice the 1.3 percent rise of this year, largely because of a recent spike in energy prices. 
 With overall inflation remaining relatively tame, however, the 2000 Social Security adjustment will continue a 1990's trend in which the increases were modest in historical terms.
Monthly checks from Social Security, the Government's biggest benefit program, with 44.2 million Americans on the rolls, are adjusted annually to keep rising prices from eroding beneficiaries' buying power.
Since 1975, the adjustment has been automatic, requiring no vote by Congress. It is based on the change in the Consumer Price Index, the Government's inflation yardstick, from the third quarter of one year to the corresponding quarter of the next.
Because of low inflation, the yearly benefit increases have been below 3 percent since 1994. The only previous time the automatic adjustment had slipped under that level was in 1987, when it hit a record low of 1.3 percent, a figure matched in 1999.
The 2000 adjustment, the biggest since 2.9 percent in 1997, will bring the average monthly check for retirees to $804, from $785. Social Security payments will also rise for disabled workers and for families whose breadwinners have died, and 6.6 million low-income people receiving Supplemental Security Income will get the increase as well.
Some economists argue that Government statistics overstate inflation. As a result, lawmakers have suggested reducing the annual adjustments to help avert a financial crisis that, in the absence of a change in law, is expected to besiege Social Security after baby boomers begin retiring.
Many current retirees, however, complain that the modest adjustments of recent years have not kept up with increases in their day-to-day expenses.
"You get an increase, but your rent goes up, your gas goes up and even your phone bill," said Edith Bailey, 79, among those interviewed at a senior citizens expo near Baltimore earlier this month.
Indeed, advocates for the elderly say that while the smaller adjustments of recent years do track standard measures of inflation, they may nevertheless seem inadequate to the aged, who have special purchasing needs.
For example, though overall prices have been rising at a 2.8 percent annual rate this year, the cost of medical care is rising at a 3.7 percent rate, and prescription drug prices are climbing at a 6.2 percent rate.
While benefits rise next year, so will Social Security taxes. For 148 million working Americans, the maximum annual earnings subject to the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax will increase to $76,200 from $72,600. Thus, the maximum Social Security tax paid by workers will be $4,724.

HEADLINE: House Approves Medicare Extension for the Disabled

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
With an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives today passed a bill expanding Medicaid and Medicare so that hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities could return to work and keep their health insurance coverage.
Under existing law, when disabled people return to work, they often lose Medicaid and Medicare, and without such coverage, they cannot obtain the health care or medical equipment they need to retain their jobs. 
 The bill sailed through the House on a vote of 412 to 9. All the opponents were Republicans. The Senate passed a similar bill, 99 to 0, in June.
Supporters say the legislation is the most important step to help the disabled since passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990.
President Clinton said tonight that he was "extremely pleased" with the House vote. But he asserted that the House bill "has flaws," including limits on the health insurance options for disabled workers. Mr. Clinton also said he disliked some proposed financing for the new benefits, including a provision that affects student loans.
Mr. Clinton said he hoped that negotiators from the House and Senate would address those issues when they met to work out their differences. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a co-author of the Senate bill, said he hoped Congress would send "this landmark legislation" to the President before adjourning this year.
Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Long Island Republican who is chief sponsor of the House bill, said, "Our economy needs Americans with disabilities in the work force."
But, Mr. Lazio said, they are discouraged from working because under current Federal rules, "people with disabilities must get poor and stay poor if they're going to retain their health benefits."
The legislation has been been carried on a bipartisan tide, extremely unusual in this Congress.
Liberal Democrats have long championed the rights of the disabled and want to expand Federal health programs to cover more people.
Republicans are eager to minimize the use of many Federal benefit programs and want to encourage work effort by people who now rely on the Government for most of their income.
Members of both parties said they had heard many appeals from disabled people who want to work.
"Rarely do we have a group of people who come to us saying, 'We want to be taxpayers, we want to be productive,' " said Representative Kenny Hulshof, a Missouri Republican and co-author of the House bill. "Our message to the disabled is that we hear you, and we want to provide more opportunities."
The cost of the Senate and House bills is roughly $750 million in the first five years and slightly more than $1 billion in the next five years, for a total of $1.8 billion from 2000 to 2009.
The Senate did not specify how to pay or offset these costs. And House Republicans said the Clinton Administration had provided little assistance.
Mr. Lazio said the Senate did not propose "one dime of offsets" to the cost of the legislation. Moreover, he said, "we got zero help from the White House" in finding ways to pay for it.
Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said those assertions were "patently false." Other Democrats said House Republicans had rejected various methods of financing proposed by the White House.
The House and Senate bills would help disabled people in these ways:
*People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability benefits because they return to work could keep their Medicare coverage.
*People with disabilities could buy Medicaid coverage even if they took jobs and earned income that would otherwise disqualify them.
*States could provide Medicaid to workers who are not actually disabled, but have physical or mental impairments that are "reasonably expected" to become severe disabilities in the absence of medical treatment.
This provision could help people who have been infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but have not developed symptoms of the disease. With Medicaid coverage, they could obtain the expensive prescription drugs they need to fight off the disease and continue working.
Lawmakers said this provision would also help people with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
Agenda of Budget Fight Turns Largely on Politics

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
In this year's version of their annual budget showdown, President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress are fighting over how much money the Federal Government should spend to hire teachers and police officers.
They are battling over how much money the United States should pay to support the Middle East peace plan. They are at odds over whether mining companies should be able to dump unlimited quantities of waste on public land. 
 But their bitter standoff is about more than those issues or the taxpayer dollars they represent. It is about seeking political advantage as they enter an election year in which the White House and control of the House are up for grabs. It is about fundamental ideological differences over the size and role of the Federal Government. And it is about the accumulated hostility between Mr. Clinton and Republicans who fear the President as much as they loathe him.
"The budget battle is to some degree a symbol of the hostility, magnified by the fight for control of the House," said Thomas Kahn, the Democratic staff director of the House Budget Committee. "Having said that, it's a mistake to underestimate the significance of the fundamental philosophical differences between the parties."
The two sides met this evening at the White House in a first high-level effort to bridge the differences, and both said afterward that they were off to a good start. Specifically, Republicans said, both sides have affirmed their commitment not to dip into the Social Security surplus to pay for any programs.
Still, Mr. Clinton is unlikely to rush into a deal. If the last several years are any guide, the Republicans will grow increasingly eager as the fall goes on to adjourn and go home, and will prove willing to meet Mr. Clinton's main demands to do so. Republicans, some of whom attribute their disappointing showing in last year's Congressional elections to giving in to Mr. Clinton's budget priorities, ruefully refer to it as an exit fee -- the levy, in concessions on spending, that Mr. Clinton will charge to let them out of Washington.
"Ultimately, the President is going to get most of what he wants, and it's going to look like a Democratic victory," said Stanley E. Collender, managing director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at Fleishman Hillard, the public relations firm. "The question is whether the Republicans can do it in a way that doesn't annoy the Republican base like it did a year ago."
It does not hurt Mr. Clinton that Republicans are stalled in their efforts to complete work on the budget for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Every day that Congress remains in session is another day in which newspaper headlines will inform voters of the gimmicks Republicans are adopting to pass spending bills (Thirteen-Month Fiscal Years! The 2000 Census: The Fiscal "Emergency" No One Saw Coming!).
But having been repeatedly burned by Mr. Clinton in past budget negotiations, Republicans have a strategy this year. They say that every dollar Mr. Clinton wants to add to spending bills will come out of the portion of the budget surplus generated by Social Security, a new and somewhat arbitrary standard of fiscal discipline, but one with undoubted political resonance.
In one sense, Republicans have already won that fight. At the beginning of this year, Mr. Clinton was proposing to spend some of the Social Security surplus. Under pressure from Republicans, he adopted their position this summer.
"This is a huge victory for every American who sends money to Washington from every paycheck and expects that money to be saved for their retirement," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
In fact, spending some or all of the Social Security surplus -- something that Washington has done for decades -- has no direct effect on the retirement system's finances and is a separate subject from efforts to extend the system's solvency.
But the Republican shorthand -- that spending the money amounts to a "raid" on Social Security -- is already being used by the party in advertising directed toward vulnerable incumbent House Democrats.
The problem for Republicans is that they have yet to show they can meet their own standard. Despite using every budget trick they can think up, Republicans are still billions of dollars short in their efforts to pass all the spending bills without using Social Security money. They are down to some last-ditch options, including an across the board reduction in all spending, a meat cleaver approach that leaves Republicans vulnerable to accusations from Democrats of gutting popular programs.
For his part, Mr. Clinton would rely on increased cigarette taxes and other tax increases to provide the money for his spending priorities. But the tobacco tax is anathema to Republicans and has critics even among Democrats, and without it Mr. Clinton is in the same spot as the Republicans, claiming a level of fiscal virtue he cannot live up to.
In a friendlier political atmosphere, Mr. Clinton and the Republican leadership would probably sit down and agree to take joint responsibility for spending some of the Social Security surplus one last time. But given the almost total lack of trust between them, they seem more intent on maneuvering to assure that the other guy takes the political hit.
"The game is really about which side gets blamed for fiscal malfeasance," said Thomas D. Gallagher, a political analyst with the International Strategy and Investment Group.
Yet by the standards of the last two decades, when the mounting budget deficit was one of the most serious economic and political problems facing the country, there will be no fiscal malfeasance. Even if spending amounted to tens of billions of dollars more than either side currently contemplates, the Government would still run a large Social Security surplus this year and reduce the national debt by at least $100 billion.

HEADLINE: CUNY Students Ask Regents To Keep Remedial Program

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
They chanted no slogans and carried no placards, but a panel of students from the City University of New York yesterday urged New York's Regents to vote no on CUNY's plan to phase out remedial education at its four-year colleges.
"Improving standards and having remediation are two separate issues," said Edward Ellis, a Baruch College student dressed in a gray suit. "But if there is a problem with remediation, the logical step would be to improve remediation." 
 Maryana Zubok, a Queens College student in a black turtleneck shirt and gray knit pants, rapidly ticked off her objections to CUNY's plan: "It is racially and economically discriminatory. The timetable is unreasonable. It is unfair to the community colleges."
Besides, she added, "Why segregate these students? It's like saying you can ride in the bus, but you have to sit in the back."
The students were the first of four panels the Regents consulted yesterday at the Schomburg Center in Harlem. They will decide in November whether to allow CUNY to proceed with its plan to remove remedial students from its bachelor's degree programs beginning in January. Other panels included CUNY officials and faculty members, representatives from New York businesses, and higher education experts.
The students drew the admiration of the Regents, who commented several times on how impressive and articulate the students were. Although the six students reflected CUNY's diverse student body, all but one opposed CUNY's plan.
"I probably look like the type who would look at remediation with disdain, and that was true when I first attended Hunter," said Aliyah Khan, a Hunter sophomore who graduated from Stuyvesant High School with a 95 average and SAT scores of 1460 and chose Hunter for financial reasons and because she wanted to stay in New York.
But she said she had come to appreciate the college's diversity and feared it would be lost under the remedial plan. "This is a cosmetic solution," she said. "You might get a few more students who would not have come before. But you will also deny education to those who need it most."
Only Deena New, the president of the premedical society at CUNY's College of Staten Island, suggested that CUNY should be more restrictive so it could maintain quality. But Ms. New, who has been accepted to SUNY Downstate medical college, said the education she is receiving "is as good as any student at Harvard."
Cristina Cocheo, a City College senior, offered her sympathies to the Regents, but told them to reject CUNY's plan.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Penny Pinchers

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
You can think about the tug of war between the Republicans and President Clinton over the State Department's budget in a lot of ways. I prefer to think about it like this: Out of every dollar spent by the U.S. government each year, about one penny goes to pay for our embassies and diplomats abroad, democracy support programs, denuclearizing Russia, foreign loans and foreign aid. One penny. The Republicans now want to take that penny and cut it back more.
One might have understood this if the U.S. economy were doing poorly or if the U.S. were not the keystone of the whole international system. And one might have understood this if the Republicans were acting out of some coherent global strategy. But they aren't. Rather, the Republicans' drive to cut the foreign operations budget by 15 percent, or $2 billion, below what Mr. Clinton is seeking (he vetoed their budget Monday) is all part of a cheap gimmick led by the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, and his merry band of right-wing nuts, whose only guiding principle in world affairs is: "Dumb as we wanna be." 
 Think about it for a second. What possible foreign policy strategy would prompt a Republican lawmaker to want to reduce by some $300 million the amount of money the U.S. spends on its Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, which pays for taking apart Russian nukes and chemical weapons and employing Russian nuclear scientists in commercial fields so they won't go to work for Iran or Iraq?
What possible foreign policy strategy would prompt him to want to reduce by 37 percent the funds the U.S. deposits in the global development banks, which are promoting capitalism in Africa and Latin America by lending to small businesses so they become America's customers?
What possible foreign policy strategy would say, "Let's help Israelis and Palestinians reach an agreement at Wye, but then not give them the money we promised to help them institute it -- even though we know, as Mr. Clinton said, that the cheapest Mideast war would cost us far more than the most expensive peace"?
It's no wonder that pro-Israel lobbies on Capitol Hill are deeply distraught about where the Republican Party is heading today, since the G.O.P. seems determined to shrink the foreign operations budget. The Republican strategy is to silence the Jews by giving Israel its full foreign aid allotment (but not the Wye supplement) and cutting everyone else. But Jewish groups understand that this will only isolate Israel and eventually imperil its aid too.
The fact is, DeLay & Co. have no adult supervision anymore. Republican internationalists like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich are gone; Trent Lott and Dennis Hastert together don't add up to zero; George W. is still learning basic geography; and Ronald Reagan, who built up our foreign affairs budget because he knew how critical it was, is now a fading memory. The G.O.P. is led by people with no sense of how important America is to the world, both as an example and as a stabilizer. Bill Clinton has made the Republicans crazy.
So to embarrass Mr. Clinton, the Republicans have decided to pit the State Department budget against Social Security and to say that if you are for giving money to Ghana you are for taking it away from Grandma. The foreign operations budget, says Mr. DeLay, "will come straight out of the pockets of American seniors." Hogwash. There is no more direct connection between Social Security and foreign aid than there is between Social Security and the Marine Band.
But who cares? As Representative Sonny Callahan said during the House debate, back home in Alabama "when I say, 'Folks, I voted against increasing foreign aid,' they seem to like that."
Yes sir, I bet they do. But when the next Alabama exporter shows up in some country and needs help from the embassy commercial officer but the job has been cut; when the next U.S. embassy gets blown up because the world despises an America that tells everyone what to do but won't pay its U.N. dues; when a Russian-designed nuke shows up in Iran; when an environmental disaster in Mexico washes up on Alabama's shores, we'll see how much the people of Alabama like that.
They might just say: "You mean we could have prevented this with just one penny out of every budget dollar, and we cut the penny? Who was the idiot who did that?"

HEADLINE: Hollywood, City Hall and a Production Deal That Wasn't

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Robert De Niro, a star in two of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's all-time favorite films -- "The Godfather Part II" and "Analyze This" -- came to Gracie Mansion last spring to flesh out his proposal to build film studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The meeting went well enough for the Mayor to perform his Godfather routine for the accomplished actor.
When Mr. De Niro, his partner, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films, and several city officials left the mansion that day in late April, they thought they had a deal in progress, even without something in writing. And a week later they stood alongside Mr. Giuliani at a giddy news conference at which Mr. Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, teased the Mayor about a future in film. 
 But their laughs and tolerance for amateur imitations ended last week when the city and the Navy Yard chose another set of developers to build the studios. Mr. De Niro and his partners quickly charged that the Giuliani administration had lured them into considering the Navy Yard as a site for their studios, only to suddenly double-cross them.
The city's official response is: Tough luck; the other development team had offered the city a better deal. Unofficially, though, city officials say Mr. Giuliani did not know of the final deal until after it was signed, irking the Mayor and revealing a kink in the administration's well-honed ability to maintain a united front.
A primary reason appears to be a disagreement between two deputy mayors.
Randy L. Levine, the Deputy Mayor responsible for economic development, had cast his lot with the De Niro group, figuring that it had the wherewithal to build film studios. But Rudy Washington, the Deputy Mayor for business services, had sided with the other group: two entrepreneurs who originally proposed the idea for film studios at the Navy Yard and their financial backer, a New Jersey firm called Steiner Equities.
In the end, the confusion that ensued from having two deputy mayors -- both of whom declined to comment -- working at cross purposes resulted in a miffed Mayor, an embarrassed administration, an angry couple of Hollywood power brokers and lingering questions within the administration about the successful bidder's ability to bring the project to fruition.
One high-ranking member of the administration said the case signaled that the Mayor's "early-warning system" -- vital to a candidate poised to begin a campaign for the Senate in the next few months -- had broken down. "We're not happy," the official said.
For all the internal intrigue, city officials say -- on paper at least -- that the deal struck with Steiner Equities would reap millions of dollars more for the city. And the city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, said that members of the Steiner group had signed an agreement with the city in 1998 that could have led to a lawsuit if the city had chosen the De Niro group.
Mr. De Niro and Miramax "never had anything in writing," Mr. Hess said. "They had nothing. They had a press conference."
Spokesmen for Miramax and Mr. De Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, declined to comment. But an associate of the partners with knowledge of the negotiations said the news conference on May 3 -- in which Mayor Giuliani took part and which was held at the city-controlled Navy Yard -- had come after an agreement to do a deal.
"We clearly thought this deal was going to happen," the associate said. "And we clearly had a different impression of what a deal is."
That would explain the dual personality of the press release that the Mayor's office issued to trumpet the news conference with Mr. De Niro. It repeatedly said the city would "explore" a deal. But its headline also implied a done deal:
"Mayor Giuliani Announces Major Film and Television Production Facility to Be Built At The Brooklyn Navy Yard -- Facility to Serve as Pre-eminent East Coast Film and Television Production Studio and Create Thousands of Film, Television and Construction Jobs."
Plans to build a production complex on a part of the Navy Yard were first raised by Cary Dean Hart, a movie-set designer, and Louis Madigan, a computer consultant. In the summer of 1998, the two entrepreneurs signed an agreement with the city's Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency that manages the former shipbuilding site, to construct a $160 million complex.
But as Mr. Hart and Mr. Madigan struggled to secure financing for their ambitious plan, people close to the negotiations say, the Giuliani administration invited TriBeCa Productions, owned by Mr. De Niro and Jane Rosenthal, to consider building a production site at the Navy Yard. That raised the poignant possibility that the originators of a plan for redevelopment of the yard might be cut out of their own proposal.
The movie producers soon enlisted Mr. Weinstein and Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, to invest in a $150 million plan to convert 15 acres into a production center that would include 12 sound stages and create thousands of jobs.
But there remained the matter of Mr. Madigan and Mr. Hart, who eventually were included in the new calculations, but in a much smaller capacity. "Nobody wanted to cut anybody out," one city official explained.
For a while it appeared that Mr. Levine had won his subtle battle with Mr. Washington. There was the Gracie Mansion meeting between the Mayor and Mr. De Niro, followed a week later by the press conference charged with Hollywood glamour. Mr. Madigan and Mr. Hart stood glumly at the back of the dais as Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Weinstein joked before the cameras. The best that Mr. Washington could do was suggest that Mr. Madigan and Mr. Hart represented "the American dream."
Shortly afterward, the two entrepreneurs notified the city that they wanted no part of the De Niro deal. Instead they would be resurrecting their own proposal with the backing of Steiner Equities. They also reminded city officials that a lawsuit was possible.
That split led to a long summer for Mr. Washington and Mr. Levine and particularly for Mr. Hess, who was assigned by the Mayor to choose the best offer. "There were phone calls back and forth, tit for tat," Mr. Hess said.
Throughout, an associate of the De Niro group said, Mr. De Niro and his partners thought that negotiations were well past mere exploration. With Mr. Levine as their City Hall advocate, they believed they could wait out the Steiner group until its agreement with the Navy Yard lapsed or until it simply backed out. There was even talk of buying out the other set of developers.
And when they kept hearing rumors earlier this month that the city was closing the deal with the Steiner group, they received assurances from city officials that no agreement could be reached without the knowledge of the administration's top people, according to people involved in the negotiations.
Finally, last week, Mr. Hess concluded that the Steiner group's offer was superior -- "on paper," a distinction that he and other city officials repeatedly cite. The De Niro group insisted that its project had to be supported by a $25 million loan from the city, and said that it could not begin construction for at least six months. The Steiner group needed no public assistance, offered millions of dollars more in rent and promised to break ground in 30 days, Mr. Hess said in explanation for his decision. The threat of a lawsuit also figured in his decision.
The afternoon of Oct. 12, Mr. Hess notified the De Niro group of his decision -- a call that flabbergasted its members. Mr. Hess then forwarded a written legal opinion to Mr. Washington, the Mayor's representative on the board of the Navy Yard corporation. According to one side in the dispute, Mr. Washington interpreted the letter to mean that the deal had the Mayor's approval. He immediately alerted the other members of the board, and within an hour or two an agreement was signed with the Steiner group.
When Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Levine learned that night that a deal had been struck without their knowledge, they fumed. According to one City Hall official, Mr. Giuliani kept asking, "Why? Why? Why?"
At the very least, two city officials said, a meeting should have been held first to apprise the Mayor and discuss the implications of the legal opinion.
When told that Mr. De Niro, a star of his favorite films, had felt double-crossed, Mr. Giuliani answered: "Well, that's some other world. That's some other world, other than the world of equity, fairness."

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Governor Faces Senators Over Firing Range

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
In a standoff with powerful senators, the Governor of Puerto Rico told a Congressional committee today that the United States military should never resume live firing exercises on the territory's island of Vieques, despite the recommendation of a Presidential panel that the exercises resume.
"Not one bomb?" asked Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, which held the hearing on the issue. 
 "No," answered Pedro J. Rossello, the Governor.
Despite Governor Rossello's strong words, President Clinton will ultimately decide whether any more live ammunition is fired on the range, which is the property of the Navy and takes up nearly two-thirds of the 20-mile-long island. The four-member Presidential panel recommended on Monday that the United States military be permitted to resume the exercises but that the range be shut down within five years. Since April, when a Marine pilot killed a Puerto Rican guard in a bombing accident there, Puerto Rican protesters have occupied it and prevented any firing exercises.
Several senators said today that they feared that political calculations would take precedence over the report's recommendations. Vieques is a major issue for Puerto Ricans, who are unusually united against the firing range and are using their electoral strength to lobby Democratic candidates. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is considering a run for the United States Senate in New York, said on Monday that she opposed resumption of the exercises there.
At today's hearing, Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican on the committee, said the firing range should be reopened immediately. He said it was the only site on the East Coast where American sailors and marines preparing for deployment over the next few months could engage in live firing exercises critical in preparing for combat.
But the panel's report said the Navy should be able to find alternatives in the next five years.
The committee also heard testimony from members of the Presidential panel, who criticized the Navy for creating this crisis by failing to address long-held grievances of the people of Vieques. They said the range was largely responsible for an unemployment rate of 25 percent on the island, which might otherwise be a desirable tourist spot, and environmental and health problems.
"We feel the Navy has lost the respect and confidence of the people of Puerto Rico and Vieques," said Gen. Richard I. Neal, a panel member who is retired from the Marine Corps and who admitted under questioning that he was an official in the Marines when the situation deteriorated in Vieques.
Richard Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, testified today that he had accepted several recommendations of the panel and would appoint an admiral to begin improving relations between the Navy and Vieques.
Admiral Jay L. Johnson, chief of naval operations, argued at the hearing for reopening the range by pointing out that in Operation Desert Fox against Iraq, pilots who had trained at Vieques were nearly 20 percent more effective in hitting targets than those who had not trained there.
While insisting that Puerto Rico was a friend of the Navy, Governor Rossello said the Vieques firing range had to be closed.
"The bottom line is that the Navy has repeatedly been a shabby steward of the delicate ecology of what was once one of the most uniformly beautiful islands in the Caribbean Sea," the Governor said.

HEADLINE: Rate Debate Heats Up on Rise in Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of one percent in September, the biggest monthly increase since April, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But only petroleum prices exerted any lasting inflationary pressure.
Still, the fully expected and essentially mild inflation report seemed to stoke rather than settle a debate over what the Federal Reserve should do next: raise interest rates to pre-emptively stifle inflation or leave rates alone and avoid the risk of slowing the economy unnecessarily. 
 Although the stock market dropped sharply last week in part because investors were concerned that the Fed might raise rates, some Wall Street economists and forecasters are worried the Fed is not acting quickly enough. They are actually pushing for a rate increase, preferably at the Fed's next policy meeting, on Nov. 16, and then are looking for a signal from the central bank that no more increases are in the offing. In their view, that would help to stabilize the market.
"When the Fed is in a tightening mode, the markets are always looking for a signal that the tightening is over, and right now they don't have that signal," said Joshua Fineman, chief economist for Deutsche Asset Management, referring to the Fed's announced stance in favor of raising rates, if any action is taken at all.
Taking the opposite tack, two powerful representatives of the companies that make and sell the nation's goods and services -- the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers -- urged the Fed to leave rates alone. They insist that inflation is nowhere on the horizon and higher rates will slow the economy unnecessarily, hurting business -- just when the economy may be slowing on its own.
"Rate increases at this juncture might be a situation of piling on too much downward pressure," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the Chamber of Commerce. He noted, for example, that retail sales eased off in September. Housing starts also fell, by 3.2 percent, to 1.618 million, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The two sides agreed on one point: that inflation, as measured by the latest Consumer Price Index report, is not accelerating quickly. The index has risen by 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, slightly faster than last spring. But with food and energy removed, the so-called core inflation rate rose three-tenths of a percent in September and has gone up 2 percent over the last year -- a rate that is down slightly from last spring.
"To our way of thinking, there has not been any clear upside breakout in underlying inflation," said John Youngdahl, a senior money market economist at Goldman, Sachs.
"But that said," he added, "the big issue for the markets is whether we are at an inflection point, at which labor costs or prices or both will begin to rise."
Investors, pleased at first by the mild inflation report, pushed up the Dow Jones industrial average by more than 200 points in early trading. But then they let prices fall, and the Dow closed up 88.65 points, at 10,204.93. Bond traders, in a similar reaction, drove down interest rates and then let them rise as the concern about inflation reasserted itself -- and with it, the pressure from Wall Street for an interest rate increase.
"The markets are starting to perceive that the Fed could be falling slightly behind the curve and, to catch up, should raise rates at the November meeting," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a bond trading house.
The excitement level on Wall Street rose considerably last Friday when the Labor Department announced a 1.1 percent jump in the Producer Price Index for September. Those are the prices that manufacturers charge for their finished products. But the producer price jump did not carry through to the much broader Consumer Price Index, which measures what the public pays not only for goods but also for services.
More than half of the September increase in the C.P.I. came from higher prices for cigarettes (20 percent of the total increase), hotel rooms (13 percent), apparel (14 percent) and petroleum products (20 percent), the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Cigarette prices jumped in response to a recent increase imposed by the manufacturers. Apparel prices climbed 1.2 percent, apparently reflecting the introduction of winter clothing. And hotel room rates rose sharply in September because the bureau has not yet adjusted its formulas to a change in the way hotels price their rooms from season to season.
None of those prices are likely to post similar increases this month, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist in the bureau division that calculates the consumer index. And there are no signs of inflationary pressures in other key categories that turned in mild performances in September.
Home prices, for example, are rising smartly in many parts of the country, but in the bureau's eyes, the purchase of a home is an investment, not a cost of living. What the C.P.I. calculates is the "consumption cost" of operating a home from month to month. That monthly consumption cost was up only 2.5 percent over the last year, including less than three-tenths of a percent last month.
Medical care costs continued their unexpectedly mild rise -- three-tenths of a percent in September and 3.4 percent over the last 12 months. And prices of new vehicles, up sharply in September at the producer price level, rose only two-tenths of a percent in the showrooms, mainly because of differences in the ways factory and retail prices are calculated for new models. Over the last 12 months, vehicle prices at the producer and consumer levels have paralleled each other, Mr. Jackman said, and they are both down five-tenths of a percent.
Petroleum prices are another matter. As long as the main oil-producing nations continue to restrict their output, gasoline and heating oil prices are likely to continue rising, analysts say. In time, there should be secondary effects, pushing up airline fares, for example, or food and apparel costs once truck shipping rates rise in response to higher fuel prices.
"These secondary effects have not shown up yet, or they may be muted by other factors," Mr. Jackman said. "Airline fares, for example, fell in September. One of the arguments in airline fares is that the airlines have more flights and more seats available and they have to fill those seats."
Excess capacity in many industries appears to play a role in holding down prices. The percentage of industrial capacity needed to meet demand, for example, fell in September to the low rate of 80.3 percent.
"The markets expect a rate increase from the Fed," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, "but the fact that the inflation data remain benign gives them encouragement that there won't be a series of tightenings."

HEADLINE: Usual, and Unusual, Offers of Help to Flood's Victims

 BODY:
After weeks of complaints that flood relief was slow in coming, efforts to help pay for damage and dislocation from Tropical Storm Floyd have picked up some speed this week in Washington, Trenton and, of all places, Atlantic City.
President Clinton announced Monday that next month, the Federal Department of Housing and Economic Development would release $43 million in Community Development Block Grant money for New Jersey that otherwise would not have been distributed until next year. The money will be distributed to nine counties -- Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Morris, Somerset, Union, Hunterdon, Mercer and Passaic -- as well as the state government. 
 Mr. Clinton also authorized the Department of Health and Human Services to provide $5 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to victims of the flooding that followed the storm last month.
For the first time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency began offering qualified recipients of its rental assistance program the option of receiving a lump sum of up to $10,000 in cash, said Mary Margaret Walker, an agency spokeswoman. Ordinarily, the program makes quarterly payments for up to 18 months, she said.
In the New Jersey Legislature, the budget committees of the Senate and Assembly approved a bill on Monday that would provide $50 million in grants and loans to flood victims, plus $10 million to reimburse public agencies for overtime, supplies and other flood-related expenses. Both chambers have scheduled a full vote on the proposal for Monday.
Another bill awaiting action would use $50 million in state open space bond money to buy flood-prone properties. The intent is to avoid repeated bailouts every time a flood occurs.
And New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, which typically uses casino tax money to build housing in Atlantic County, voted yesterday to contribute $100,000 to flood victims in Bound Brook, about 100 miles away in Somerset County. "We'll grab it -- I'll go to Atlantic City tomorrow," said Mayor Frank Gilly of Bound Brook, which was hard hit by the storm and was loud in protesting the pace and size of the official response.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman supports the flood relief bill and the casino agency's plan, but she has not taken a position on the buyout bill, said Steffanie Bell, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman.
Russ Edmunston, a spokesman for the emergency agency, said that by yesterday, 17,470 callers had registered for some kind of home or business assistance on the agency's automated help line (800-462-9029). So far, he said, the emergency management agency has awarded $18.7 million in housing assistance grants, and the Small Business Administration had made $14.1 million in business loans. The deadline to call for assistance is Nov. 17, he said.
The acceleration of HUD grant money, distributed by counties, comes as good news to nonprofit organizations, which use it for projects like low-cost housing, counseling or food and shelter for the poor. A spokeswoman for HUD, Debbie Pickford, said that the same types of services provided by organizations that usually receive block grants are in stronger demand because of the flood.
Rosalee Yurasko, director of community development for Somerset County, said that normally, the county would award year 2000 block grants in September, when the money becomes available.
She said that applications were normally due in March but that she had not received guidelines on how to accelerate the process and get the money to the agencies that were already inquiring about it yesterday. "A lot of people have been calling and saying, 'Where's the money?' " she said.

HEADLINE: A New Universal Language;
In Class of Many Tongues, Computer Skills Are Focus

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
For generations, Henry Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, has been a first stop for immigrants learning to adjust to America. At settlement houses, churches and community centers, newcomers from Europe and Asia all learned the skills -- and the language -- they would need to survive in the new world.
So perhaps it is not surprising that in a church basement on Henry Street last month, a group of women from Ghana and Lebanon, Hong Kong and Brazil (as well as three of the boroughs) were learning the new language they need to survive: Microsoft Powerpoint. 
 Their situation says much about the changing nature of work and unemployment, and the new challenges of job training and job seeking, in New York City near the close of 1999. The 10 women in this class are all experienced office employees, energetic, ambitious and charming. And they have all been out of work for months, despite the booming economy and the plunging unemployment rate.
Though each of their stories is different, their problems boil down to one thing, they say: technology. "I wanted to find a job, but most of the jobs require computer knowledge," said Marie Ceran, 32, who spent years working as an office manager at Caldor before the bankrupt retailer started closing its stores in January.
And employers do not just want familiarity with a computer; they are demanding up-to-the-minute skills in the most current software. "It seemed like computers came up at every last interview," said Sheron Mickie, 23, the youngest student in the class. "I'd say, 'I learned the Word Perfect version from 1990,' and they'd say, 'We'll call you.' "
All this helps explain why the Chinatown Manpower Project, which in the past has focused on teaching unemployed people English and business skills, this year switched to straight computer instruction. The program, for workers who have been "downsized" or unemployed for a long time, is financed by the Federal Government and administered through the New York City Department of Employment, which sponsors about 16 computer skills programs for adults.
There is a certain "only in New York" quality to the class: where else would women born in six countries, speaking half a dozen languages, take computer lessons from a man with a strong Chinese accent? And in their ambitions, their pride and their strong personalities, these women struck even their teachers as unusual, though their lack of software skills is common.
In fact, economists and labor experts say that in many ways, the experience of these women reflects the situation across the country, now and in the future. Technology has become so pervasive in the workplace that at least half the entry-level jobs for people who have not graduated from college involve computer use, said Harry J. Holzer, the chief economist for the Federal Department of Labor. And that was several years ago, when Mr. Holzer surveyed 3,200 businesses in four cities.
"Futurework," a report issued last month by the Labor Department, predicts that within a few years, "Most workers will need basic computer skills to enter their chosen occupations and additional specialized training in field-specific applications to advance."
The world is already rewarding workers who can use computers. Mr. Holzer found that all else being equal, entry-level workers who use computers on the job make 5 to 10 percent more than those who do not.
And for experienced employees, the premiums may be much greater. Wendy Alfus Rothman, managing partner of Advantage Human Resourcing, a placement agency, said she might pay 50 percent more for someone who has mastered the "holy trinity" of Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel.
"I can get that person a job in 10 minutes," she said.
The job market is also penalizing workers who do not have the necessary computer skills, according to Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton economist. "Skill mismatches," Professor Krueger said last week, are one reason that those who are unemployed today tend to be out of work a long time. Further reducing the unemployment rate, which nationally hovers around 4 percent, "will mean lowering long-term unemployment, which will require more retraining," he said.
Short-term unemployment has declined, Professor Krueger said, in part because of the rise of temporary help agencies, which have been booming in New York and across the country.
At Henry Street, several of the older women, like Aida Spielmann and Shelley Haynes, who spent most of their careers with one employer, said they wanted to work at temporary assignments to "test the waters a little bit and observe a company from the inside," as Ms. Haynes put it.
Ms. Haynes, an elegant, soft-spoken woman of 39, still seems a little shell-shocked after the company where she worked for more than 15 years closed two offices and laid off many employees, including her. "It's like a woman who got married and had kids and her husband passes away, and she has to go out into the working world," said Ms. Haynes, who was born in Barbados.
Temporary agencies pay premiums for workers who have mastered software programs, but jobs in every industry call for computer skills these days.
That is what Frances-Odessa Davis found out when she was forced to look for a new job. Ms. Davis, who is in her 30's, spent more than six years in the Navy and then worked for an airline and for a carnival. She returned to Queens from Hawaii in 1991 and, until a year ago, worked at a medical bookstore while going to York College to get a degree in psychology and special education.
But then, Ms. Davis hurt her back. She decided to look for an office job while she continued her studies -- and ran into the computer problem. "I'm a college student; we use computers," she said. "But they would ask me, 'Do you know Excel?' and I was like, 'Huh?' "
To get into the class, all of the women had to have some familiarity with computers. The city government judges the program on how successful it is in placing graduates in jobs that pay at least $11 an hour, or about $22,000 a year, well below the citywide average of $47,000.
To try to maintain its high success rate, the program does not accept technological neophytes, and it takes a maximum of 16 students for every three-month session.
Those limits frustrate Bing Chen, the class's chief instructor, who has been working for Chinatown Manpower since 1996. "We're here to help people," he said. "Let them come."
Only one of the women in the class was from the neighborhood (and ethnic background) that Chinatown Manpower has traditionally served. Luckie Ko, whose parents brought her here from Hong Kong when she was 3, spent six years as a data analyst for a financial information company; she used a computer but, she said, did not really understand how it worked.
Last spring, the company moved her department to Ohio. Ms. Ko, who is married to a trucker and whose mother helps care for her five children, ranging in age from 18 months to 21 years, decided not to move. "I have a lot of baggage to carry," she said dryly.
Like most of the women in the class, Ms. Ko would ultimately like to have her own business, perhaps running a day care center. In the meantime, she said, "I just want to go back to doing what I was doing before."
That desire is common -- and it is frustrating for the trainers. The problem, they say, is that many workers cannot accept the fact that they are basically starting over. They want the same salaries, benefits and titles that they had before. "We get you jobs," said Cassie S. Young, the program's job counselor. "We don't get you what you want."
Her big success story in this group, she said, is Lisa Marie Caruso, 27, who lost her job as an executive secretary in April and was recently divorced.
"I feel old sometimes," Ms. Caruso said with a sigh, adding that she had been desperately seeking work and could find only receptionist jobs. And though she has an associate's degree from Kingsborough Community College, she did not score well on the tests administered by employment agencies.
After six weeks of class, Ms. Caruso's skills -- and her self-confidence -- improved a lot. She started doing temporary work right away. But Ms. Caruso has been in the job market for only four years, and her goals are relatively modest (move out of her mother's house in Bay Ridge, for example).
The training was much less satisfying for some of the older, more experienced and more ambitious women, like Emelia Benin, 42. Smart, serious and slightly prickly, Ms. Benin came to the United States from Ghana to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology in 1979. She spent more than a dozen years working for a lingerie company, where she was in charge of shipping.
Her old employer used a Unix operating system, and Ms. Benin was determined to learn Windows. Once she got into the class, she studied hard; some of her fellow students said she was a whiz.
Yet she was also frustrated by the experience, as were some of the other women. The program was not well organized, they said, and could not give them the same kinds of tests the agencies used. And several said they found the attitude of some of the staff disrespectful.
A fabulous baker (her poppy seed cake is scrumptious), Ms. Benin hopes someday to go to the French Culinary Institute and to open her own small cafe. "It would be nice to know I did something I love," she said.
Meaningful work and dignity can be hard to come by, even for women who have mastered computer skills. Safa Hadla, 35, is an ebullient and dynamic woman who made a big impression on her classmates (Ms. Caruso said she wants to name a daughter Safa). She also speaks five languages, and she spent several years managing doctors' offices in New York.
But she complains about the rudeness and disrespectful treatment she receives at employment agencies here. "In other countries, they don't see you just as a skill machine," said Ms. Hadla, who was born in Lebanon and lived and worked in Venezuela and France before she "met my Prince Charming in Queens."
Still, Ms. Hadla has already found a new job, at a bank. (She started on Monday.) So has Ms. Davis, the former Navy seaman, who is now working for an Internet start-up company as a receptionist. Ms. Benin found a job for herself and referred another potential employer to Ms. Ceran, the former Caldor worker, who was hired on the spot as an assistant office manager.
And as they leave the program, a new group of women is eager to replace them. Mira Kreposter, who came to the United States from Baku, Azerbaijan, 12 years ago, worked for a financial company that merged and closed her department. Explaining why she wanted to take the computer training, she said, "At the end of this century and the portal of the next, we need to know everything of the highest technology."

HEADLINE: U.S. Indicts McDonnell Douglas And Chinese in Equipment Deal

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury indicted the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and a powerful state-owned aerospace company in China today on charges of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale of American machining equipment, some of which was diverted to a Chinese military site.
The case could complicate relations between Beijing and Washington just as China and the United States are trying to complete one of the biggest trade agreements in history: China's entry into the World Trade Organization, American and Chinese officials said. 
 Bonni Tischler, the assistant commissioner for investigations for the United States Customs Service, said at a news briefing today that the indictment was the "first time a Chinese Government entity has been indicted for violations of U.S. export laws."
The indictment charges McDonnell Douglas, a unit of the Boeing Company, and the Douglas Aircraft Company with 13 counts, including conspiracy, false statements and misrepresentations in connection with a 1994 export license to sell 13 pieces of machining equipment to China. It also contains 12 charges against the buyer of the equipment, the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation, or Catic, and Catic affiliates in Beijing and California.
Two Chinese nationals employed by Catic were also indicted, as was a mid-level McDonnell Douglas employee, Robert J. Hitt, the director of the China Program Office at Douglas Aircraft in California.
Both Boeing and Catic representatives denied any wrongdoing and vowed to contest the charges.
"McDonnell Douglas Corporation did not commit any criminal violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to the People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend against the charges brought by the United States Attorney's Office," Boeing said in a statement. "It is unfortunate that the prosecutors have apparently not taken the time to learn the facts and gain a full understanding of a rather complicated matter."
Fred F. Fielding, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wiley, Rein & Fielding who represents Catic and its affiliates, said: "Catic has cooperated fully with the Government investigation and has strongly maintained throughout that it has never intentionally violated any U.S. laws. This is a commercial transaction involving the sale of used machinery, and the Government's position that this is a criminal or national security case is absurd."
But Ms. Tischler said the diversion of civilian technology for military uses by China was a top priority for investigators.
At issue is whether McDonnell Douglas knew or should have known that the equipment was likely to be used for something other than the intended commercial purpose.
Boeing also released a lengthy background paper that suggested that one of the company's defenses is that top Clinton Administration officials knew important details of the deal, so they could not have been misled.
The criminal investigation began in 1996. Lengthy plea-bargain negotiations between defense lawyers, and Lisa Prager, the Assistant United States Attorney who handled the inquiry, broke down Monday night, lawyers said.
Catic bought the machining equipment, which is used to bend steel in manufacturing aircraft, for $5 million. But the sale was part of a billion-dollar deal in which McDonnell Douglas was to build trunkliner, or middle-size commuter, aircraft in China.
The indictment cites an October 1993 meeting of Douglas executives in which they discussed the machining equipment sale as being part of "the pending $1 billion trunkliner program," in which the equipment was to be used to manufacture the commuter aircraft.
A few months after the sale, McDonnell Douglas discovered that some of the equipment had not gone to the intended destination, a civilian site in Beijing, but instead wound up 800 miles away, at a military site in Nanchang that makes surface-to-surface missiles and fighter aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas reported the diversion in 1995, before the equipment had been put to use. The giant machines, which are still in China, were later moved to a civilian location, and the equipment was never used for any military purpose. Meanwhile, the airliner deal, which President Clinton hailed on the eve of the 1994 election as a job-rich program for 20 planes, has produced only one plane, according to the indictment.
The airliner deal was promoted by Mr. Clinton and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996, as a centerpiece of the Administration's commercial diplomacy, the policy of using economic engagement to broaden ties with Beijing and promote exports. On the eve of a trip to China in 1994, Mr. Brown wrote a letter to China's vice premier about the airliner deal based on a draft letter from McDonnell Douglas, according to Boeing's background paper. The machining equipment export license was issued soon after Mr. Brown returned from Beijing.
State Department cables obtained by defense lawyers in the case show that Administration officials delayed seeking timely assurances from Catic on how it planned to use the machining equipment so as not to disrupt Mr. Brown's announcement about the airliner deal in China, according to lawyers and officials who have read the cables.
The indictment accuses Catic officials of being responsible for the diversion of six of the machines to Nanchang. It also charges that McDonnell Douglas officials concealed or failed to disclose important information to Commerce Department licensing officials, including that the airliner deal was in jeopardy. If the deal was in jeopardy, it could be less likely that the equipment would be used for its intended commercial purposes.
The indictment also says that McDonnell Douglas, which was bought by Boeing in 1997, concealed its hiring of a "high ranking former Government official and his consulting firm" that was paid $4 million "to intercede with Catic" and China "because the trunkliner negotiations were stalled."
Lawyers involved in the case said the former official referred to in the indictment was Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former Secretary of State. Woody Goldberg, a spokesman for Mr. Haig's firm, confirmed their representation of McDonnell Douglas on the China airliner deal.

Alexander's to Get Loan for Old Store

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Vornado Realty Trust agreed to lend $50 million to the real estate developer Alexander's Inc. to finance development costs at the site of its former flagship store in midtown Manhattan and at a Brooklyn shopping center.
The companies, both based in Saddle Brook, N.J., said the loan will be under the same terms as a $45 million loan from Vornado made in March 1995. That loan carries an interest rate of 14.18 percent, according to a recent regulatory filing. Vornado owns 29.3 percent of the common stock of Alexander's and manages, develops and leases its properties. 
 Alexander's, a former retailer, owns the site of its old store on the block between 58th and 59th Streets on Lexington Avenue in midtown. In 1998, the company also became the sole owner of Kings Plaza Shopping Center in Brooklyn.
The Manhattan site is one of the few spaces open for development in midtown, where vacancy rates are at their lowest levels in 17 years.

HEADLINE: Car Artists Make Their Every Trip A Traveling Show

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
ON a recent, drizzly Friday, a navy blue '85 Impala cruised slowly down a leafy street in suburban Clifton, N.J. The passenger window framed a grin of pure delight directed toward Stephen Hooper's driveway. The Impala circled around and crept to a halt. From the driver's side beamed another enchanted smile.
"I get this all the time," said Mr. Hooper, who prefers to be known as Hoop, as he stood at the door of his garage. "I'm like my own museum." 
 Behind him was a peculiar sculpture that looked something like his own head, oversized front teeth, scraggly red beard and all. It was about the size of a small car. In fact, underneath the felt and fake fur was a small car, a rare 1961 British Trojan that opened from the front like a refrigerator.
That wasn't all the Impala was there to gawk at. In the driveway was the Can-vertible, a 1972 Fiat covered with crushed cans, and a 1941 Packard hearse wrapped in black and tan fur with giant fingerprints. At the curb was a van with two front ends; one side, layered with glued-on timepieces, was labeled "Millennium Machine."
Hoop's fleet, unique as it is, is part of a phenomenon that has been taking shape and rolling onto the roadways of America for the last 20 years. The art car -- its roots tangled in everything from the proselytizing chariots of traveling preachers to the billboard-style signs on delivery trucks to the tie-dyed school buses of hippiedom -- seems to have been invented in dozens of places simultaneously.
"A lot of people who do this don't know about anyone else when they start," Hoop said. He certainly didn't in the early 1980's, when he banged a dent out of his 1958 Isetta, covered it in fake fur and hit the New York club scene.
One result is the extreme diversity of the cars. If the Fords, Saturns, Chevies and Hondas sparkling in dealers' lots are so many streamlined Rockettes in a perfect kick line, art cars form more of a riotous mosh pit.
A Volkswagen Beetle in California is mosaicked in marbles. A 1970 Oldsmobile 98 in Montana is covered with mirrors. A draftsman in Hackensack, N.J., painstakingly painted his 1985 Buick Skyhawk a fine red plaid, and a musician in nearby Montclair drives a 1991 Toyota pickup that has an earth goddess on the rear door. Kelly Lyles, a Seattle artist, not only drives an art car -- a Subaru station wagon done up like a leopard -- but she also paints formal portraits of them. In New York City, 53 television sets stud Dan Lohaus's 1992 Toyota pickup and several hundred remote controls plaster its hood.
And Phillip Treuvey, a professional spackler who lives near Wayne, N.J., has been adding layers of images onto his Volkswagen bus for the last nine years, using found objects -- fly swatters, key chains, flowers -- as stencils.
Getting a convincing explanation for these efforts is not easy. Tim McNally, who has spent more than 300 hours on his Plaidmobile, said he began after reading a letter from a friend enthusing about her new car, which was a special blue color.
"I thought it would be fun to write back that my car is plaid," he said.
Perhaps the clearest explanation comes from Harrod Blank, a Berkeley, Calif., artist, who has written books and made films about the phenomenon of the art car. "It's a personal totem, a shrine on wheels," said Mr. Blank. "Something you put love and time into, to transform it from something that's mere transportation to something that's special. Because you spend so much time in it, you want it to be you. It's like taking refuge in your room. Same kind of energy, just a bit more extreme."
Some art cars are subtle. A man in Houston glued a beer can, upright, onto the roof of his car and drives around delightedly eliciting yells from the helpful: "Hey, you got a beer on your car!"
"It's like the Wright brothers," said Gene Pool -- his legal name -- a New Yorker once famous for growing fields of living grass on automobiles. "There are all these people trying to fly at the same time."
Now that such vehicles -- once the provenance of individual oddballs, determined artists and Deadheads -- show up regularly in the rearview mirrors of sedate sedans and rugged suburban sport utility vehicles, there is an explosion of events focused on them.
There are established art-car festivals and parades in Houston; San Francisco; Minneapolis; Baltimore (where there are actually two); Key West, Fla.; Decatur, Ill., and Lawrence, Kan., to name just a few. Some attract a handful of odd cars, others draw hundreds of art-car pilgrims from across the country.
Mr. Blank has even found he can eke out part of his living by acting as an agent for artists willing to hire their cars out for advertising or movie work. (For instance, he has arranged for art cars to appear in a Hewlett-Packard advertisement for a printer and on a French billboard for an insurance company.) "That's the only way I can survive," he said.
Mr. Pool said the trend is evidence of the strength of the nation's individualism. "The people who do this get sick of being just another car," he said.
But it also testifies to the relatively open laws of the American road. Japanese and German visitors ooh and ah over the cars, then ask if they are legal. And the trend is also a product of the economy of the automobile market, where new cars regularly cost $20,000, while battered but serviceable and insurable junkers trade hands for no more than a few hundred dollars.
And it's not just about getting attention. "It's not, 'Look at me!' " Hoop said. "It's like, 'How do you like this?' "
Tim McNally, the painter of the Plaidmobile, said that his car spreads a little cheer. "Especially on the road," he said, "where a lot of people need cheering up."
Philo Northrup, an artist who, with Mr. Blank, founded the Artcar Fest in San Francisco, which held its third gathering last month, said that art cars address a gap in American culture: "The institutions for art and religion are not meeting the needs that are out there. I think you've got a population that has as much spiritual and creative energy as any other, but the churches, synagogues and museums are all talking to each other -- they're not talking to us."
Still, even the art world no longer considers art cars only as outsider art or folk art. On Saturday, the Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara, Calif., will open a show dedicated to art cars made by Californians. The Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center is exhibiting the "Inside-Out Car" -- a '79 Volkswagen Rabbit that Dan Devine, a New York artist, cut apart, turned inside out, and rewelded and reupholstered. (If more proof of art-world recognition is needed, consider this: There is no Blue Book listing for a Rabbit that old. Mr. Devine's price tag is about $40,000.)
In a most human sign that the art-car phenomenon has really arrived, it is already showing signs of factionalization. The granddaddy of art-car events, the Orange Show Foundation Art Car Weekend, held in Houston every spring for the last 12 years, attracts creators from around the country. Perhaps a third of the scores of cars are made specifically for the parade and are stored or disassembled in between.
In contrast, the San Francisco festival focuses on cars that Mr. Blank refers to proudly as daily drivers.
But some art-car creators think even that kind of festival strays too far from normal driving, ruining the point as they see it -- to bring a surprising dash of art into everyday life. As Hoop put it, "I have my own art-car parade every time I go to the grocery."
 
Parade Routes
ART-CAR festivals and parades occur around the country at all times of the year. Many are listed on the Art Cars in Cyberspace Web site at www.artcars.com. In testament to the grass-roots nature of the phenomenon, most of the festivals take place in smaller cities; none are scheduled for urban strongholds like New York, Chicago or Washington.
Nearby suburban areas, though, seem to be fertile art-car soil. In the New York area, for example, Jan Loe, a musician and artist who lives in Montclair, N.J., expects to put together her fourth art-car parade next summer. (For information, telephone (973) 746-1412.) Past parades have drawn a dozen or so of the region's eclectic cars, including the Plaidmobile, by Tim McNally, of Hackensack, N.J.
The oldest and largest of the nation's festivals is the Orange Show Foundation's weekend event in Houston. It has been held for 12 years and usually includes more than 200 hot rods, low riders, classic cars and what the organizers call "artist-built rolling contraptions." Next year, the festival, officially the Pennzoil Art Car Weekend, is scheduled to run April 14 and 15. For information, send E-mail messages to orange@insync.net or telephone (713) 926-6368.
A Baltimore artist, Conrad Jay Bladey, is trying to organize a cyberfestival in the next month. Mr. Bladey has invited art-car owners, via an E-mail list-serve, to register their location on Nov. 6 at a Web site (www.geocities .com/MotorCity/Garage/1329 /artcarshow.html). Would-be spectators can visit the site to see whether any art cars are in their vicinity.

How Nascar's Power Figure Keeps Everybody Happy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
PLAYERS' UNIONS and egotistical team owners in most sports have turned the iron-fisted commissioner into a rusty relic. So why, then, has everyone in stock-car racing been so eager to submit to the near-dictatorial control of one man?
Probably because that man, William C. France, is making them wealthy. Mr. France, 66, is the president of the No. 1 race organizing group in the United States: the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing, better known as Nascar. He also heads the International Speedway Corporation, which owns many of the tracks where Nascar drivers compete. And if that leaves any authority unexercised, there is his wife, Betty Jane; their children, Brian and Lesa; and Mr. France's brother, James -- all of whom are top executives in Nascar, International Speedway or both. 
 Mr. France's father, William H. G. France, created Nascar 51 years ago from what was little more than some moonshine runners getting together on Saturday night to see who had the fastest hot rod. Today, the Frances control a sport whose top division, the Winston Cup series, surpasses the regular-season television ratings of every other professional sport except the National Football League; its top 20 money winners, almost position for position, are ahead of the top 20 golfers on the P.G.A. Tour.
The sport's appeal is manifold. The noise, speed, color and spectacle are unlike anything except perhaps a Super Bowl or big heavyweight fight. And as in boxing, there is the element of physical peril.
In a sport with plenty of grease, Nascar's star drivers assiduously maintain squeaky-clean images -- a change that may cause old-timers to grumble about the loss of whisky-watered roots, but that is essential to the sport's growth as family fare. "They're accessible, they're open, they're modest, and they come out of a Southern culture that's respectful," Neal Pilson, a former CBS Sports executive, once said. Antisocial behavior, the bane of other pro sports, is almost unheard of.
 Nascar has also done something no other auto racing group has done: it has relegated the cars to a supporting role and made people the stars -- the drivers (the cream of the circuit, like Rusty Wallace, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt), the chief mechanics, even the tire changers on pit crews. You don't have to be a gearhead to understand Nascar, because a stock car is quite unsophisticated technologically, to a degree that a typical microchip-laden luxury sedan makes it seem like a cannon in an age of cruise missiles. It uses a carburetor, long eclipsed by electronic fuel-injection in passenger cars, and a pushrod engine instead of the more common overhead cam engine. Independent rear suspensions and on-board computers are banned.
Stock-car racing had plenty of outlaws in the 1950's and 60's -- hard drinkers like Curtis Turner, who once landed his plane on a town street and parked a rental car in a motel pool -- but no more.
"Well, we're not the Wild West, like we used to be, but then, the Wild West is not the Wild West like it was 80, 90 years ago," Mr. France says to those who complain that the sport's old romance is gone. "If we were real rough-and-tumble, I doubt we'd be doing this interview now."
By wiping the blood off its knuckles and cleaning the grease from under its fingernails, stock-car racing has attracted blue-chip nonautomotive sponsors, like Mattel, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Home Depot. "I like to say that we were the leaders compared to other sports in sponsorships and so forth," Mr. France said. "Now, the colleges and universities are doing it. For a long time we were criticized for it, but we were just ahead of our time."
Things were plenty rough-and-tumble when Mr. France's father (known as Big Bill) arrived with his wife, Anne, and their 2-year-old son, Bill, in Daytona Beach, Fla., from Washington in 1934, looking for work as a mechanic. "He figured if he was going to work on cars, he might as well do it where it was warm," said Mr. France, who is known as Bill France Jr. (although Jr. is not part of his legal name).
Back then, Big Bill drove in the races run along the hard-packed sand of Daytona Beach (motorists can still drive onto the beach). But stock-car racing, then confined to the rural Southeast, suffered from two plagues: rampant cheating, and race promoters who ran off with the prize money. So Big Bill gathered some partners at the Streamline Motel in Daytona Beach in 1947, where Nascar was created to address those abuses.
He and his wife established their dominion over stock-car racing when they built the two-and-a-half-mile Daytona International Speedway (there are bronze statues of them outside its offices). When it opened, in 1959, no one had ever seen anything like its sweeping, towering turns, banked at 31 degrees.
"One of the key things I learned from him was evaluating the long-term benefit against the short-term negative and also the reverse," Mr. France said about his father, "and then trying to rationalize whether you are better off to take the hit now because it makes sense tomorrow, or take the good today and worry when tomorrow comes."
THE Streamline Motel "office" has been replaced by a suite at Nascar's New York branch. Mr. France, sitting in a corner office overlooking Park Avenue recently, was wearing a business suit, looking not nearly as streamlined as the young man in a photograph taken in July 1958 during the construction of Daytona. There, operating a road grader, in a white T-shirt and work pants, is Bill France Jr. -- trim and looking happy in his labors.
That photo helps explain how he came to earn his authority as much as he inherited it after his father died in 1992. "He's done everything in the sport," said Chip Williams, a former Nascar public relations director. "He's driven race cars, he's dug post holes, he's parked cars, he's sold programs."
Big Bill may have been an unashamed despot, but the philosophy of his son's regime is summed up by Mr. Williams, "Essentially, he's a dictator, but in fact he rules by consensus." Before turning over the day-to-day operations of Nascar racing to Mike Helton in February, Mr. France was noted for his willingness to listen to drivers, car owners, race promoters and sponsors.
He explained how he has managed to keep all the track owners and car owners in his camp. "Right now, we've got just about all of them making money," he said. "There's nothing like making money to be happy. Sometimes they're not happy because they think they should be making more, but usually they're more happy if they're making money than if they're not making any."
Track owners have benefited from attendance figures that have risen an average of 7 percent annually from 1992 through 1998. Last year, average weekend attendance for one of the 33 Winston Cup races was 190,940. With attendance that high, the cost of building one new seat -- by various estimates, $350 to $380, including ancillary amenities -- can be amortized in two to five years.
This has fueled an unprecedented boom in track construction and expansion, with much of the capital coming from equity sales. Individual investors can buy shares in both Mr. France's International Speedway Corporation -- which after recently acquiring Roger Penske's speedways, now owns nine major tracks and the operating contract for another -- and in Speedway Motorsports, which owns six major tracks. An analysis by Bear, Stearns in August estimated that a Winston Cup race at a 100,000-seat track yields a $7.7 million profit.
A new television contract should increase earnings. For years, spotty network interest in auto racing made it more profitable for each Winston Cup track to deal directly with broadcast or cable outlets. When ESPN was created 20 years ago, it needed programming to fill its 24-hours-a-day sports schedule, and Winston Cup races soon became a staple that helped both Nascar and ESPN to grow.
"It's been reciprocal," said Mark Quenzel, the vice president for programming at ESPN, which showed its first Winston Cup race in 1981 and at one point televised 20 Cup races a year. "I think had we not gotten together, Nascar would still exist and ESPN would still exist, but neither group would be where it is today."
With the growth in ratings, Nascar recently asked all its track operators to cede their television rights starting in 2001. The owners gladly agreed -- including the one person outside the France family with the wealth and influence to rival them, O. Bruton Smith, the chairman of Speedway Motorsports.
"It surprised me, given the politics of the sport," said Neal Pilson, who brought the Daytona 500 to CBS for the first time in 1979 and who now works as a broadcast consultant to Nascar. "It's hard for Bruton and Bill to be on the same wavelength. But if you look at the economics, with every example you see that where you have a single seller, like the N.F.L., and many buyers, you can achieve the best price.
"Plus there's a confidence among all the track owners in the fairness of the process, and that goes back to Bill France."
Mr. Pilson is helping to shop the television rights to the major networks. "Where we are today is about $100 million a year," he said. "Although nothing is certain, I've seen estimates that I'm not going to quarrel with that we can triple that."
The sport's appeal has been built on one fundamental principle: accessibility of the drivers to the fans. But the popularity boom threatens to turn this into a myth.
"You used to literally be able to make every fan at the track happy," said Darrell Waltrip, the 1989 Daytona 500 winner and one of Nascar's most successful drivers ever. "You could autograph everything they wanted you to sign. Today, you can take care of about 10 percent. So now, 90 percent of the people you come into contact with don't have the same opinion of you when they leave the track that they had when they came in."
Life isn't easier as a racing mechanic. The current schedule of 34 Winston Cup races means that pit-crew members are kept away from their families for 34 weekends a year. And the pressure to increase the number of races is growing as tracks have opened in major population areas and more are on the way.
Mr. France suggested that the secret to expanding the Winston Cup schedule is to increase team owners' earnings enough to allow them to hire an extra crew of mechanics. The new television contract will help do that (under Nascar rules, 25 percent of TV money must be distributed as prize money). The car owners would also like to see Nascar more fully exploit the Winston Cup's drawing power by moving races out of smaller, older tracks in rural areas and into its larger tracks near big cities.
But that touches upon a thorny issue: which tracks get Winston Cup races. The oldest tracks, a few of them owned by International Speedway, continue to have two Cup races annually, a legacy of the days when Nascar went begging for places to race. Now, the newest tracks, although bigger and much closer to major cities, must make do with only one race a year. It's as if the N.F.L. continued to play in Canton, Ohio, because that's where it began.
Mr. Waltrip points out that it's harder to ask sponsors to invest $8 million to $10 million a year when the tracks in small towns like Darlington, S.C., and Rockingham, N.C., (both owned by Mr. France's International Speedway) each have two Winston Cup races, while those near Las Vegas, Nev., and Fort Worth, owned by Mr. Smith's Speedway Motorsports, have only one race a year.
With about 168,000 seats, far more than in either Darlington or Rockingham, the Fort Worth track can afford to pay more prize money. This year, its one race awarded about as much money to competitors as the two races at Darlington combined.
"I know I have taken more financial risk than anyone in this sport to help Nascar grow," Mr. Smith said. His tracks near Las Vegas, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., are showcases for modern racing, with luxury boxes and trackside condominiums.
Yet Mr. Smith says he cannot get Nascar to grant him a second lucrative Winston Cup race each year for Fort Worth. "We've been promised for three years that we will get a second date for Texas, and that's a promise that should be kept," he said. In fact, Nascar has never granted any Winston Cup race to the Texas track -- Mr. Smith had to buy the race he has there now from another track.
LIKE Mr. France, Mr. Smith is the head of a publicly traded company, so he seems to understand that Mr. France would face angry shareholders if he took away a Winston Cup race from an International Speedway track. "I don't think any track should be asked to give up a Winston Cup date," Mr. Smith said. "I think that would be cruel."
But if and when the Winston Cup schedule is again expanded, it may very well be to accommodate tracks that Mr. France's company is building near Kansas City, Kan., and Chicago -- and Mr. Smith doesn't think that would be fair, either. "If you own a track like Rockingham and you build a track in Kansas City, you should take a date from Rockingham," Mr. Smith said. "But I don't think you should add to the schedule unless you consider Texas first."
Mr. France answers those who see a conflict between his ability to distribute Winston Cup races as Nascar's leader and his ability to profit from them as International Speedway's leader by noting that three of his nine tracks have only one Winston Cup race a year, including the fancy new California Speedway near Los Angeles. And besides International Speedway, a number of independent track owners who have stuck with Nascar through the lean years have been allowed to hold on to their two Winston Cup races.
"The other track owners should be glad we're involved as track owners, because we know the trials and tribulations that a promoter goes through," Mr. France said.
While saying that "I think Bill has done a great job in bringing better management to Nascar," Mr. Smith nevertheless suggested that Mr. France follow the example of one Nascar sponsor.
"If you built an exemplary McDonald's," he said, "I believe McDonald's would send you a few extra hamburgers."

HEADLINE: Five Commutes That Make You Feel Better About Yours

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
IT wasn't long after workers jumped off their horses and into trains, buses and cars that commuting became a small American obsession. Few people really enjoyed it. Even 30 years ago, when more people commuted by public transit and highways weren't nearly as crowded, train delays, bus breakdowns and traffic jams marred many a family dinner.
Today, commuting is often the most distressing part of working. 
 American communities are much more spread out than they were 30 years ago. More people commute by car, and they are more often alone. Since 1960 the vehicle population has grown seven times faster than the human one. Traffic jams that once were a headache are now a migraine.
And while in one sense a backup is a backup is a backup, every traffic nightmare has its own set of nightmarish details. Here are some of the nation's worst commutes and the reasons they are so bad.
 
Silicon Valley
Even in California, where traffic jams are a familiar symbol of a car-crazy culture, the rush-hour commute over the Sunol Grade -- at an average speed of 17 miles an hour -- is so bad it may be the worst in the state, and just possibly the nation.
It's 35 miles from Livermore, Calif., to the heart of Silicon Valley in Santa Clara County. But for computer workers who aren't up before the sun, the commute south on Interstate 680 over the Sunol Grade, a series of hills, has become an infernal mess.
"You can't believe it," said Constance Allen, a video conference specialist at the Amdahl Corporation, a software company in Sunnyvale. "If you leave before 5 A.M., it takes 45 minutes. If you leave at 5:15, you can count on 90 minutes to 2 hours."
As Santa Clara made the transition from orchards to computer chips, housing prices rose so high that most of the industry's workers could not afford to live near their offices. Tens of thousands of them now descend from distant counties.
Last year, to begin easing congestion, a commuter rail started service from Stockton to San Jose. The 85-mile, $54 million Altamont Commuter Express serves 1,100 people a day, a small slice of the 24,000 vehicles that crawl through the grade each morning. Its two trains stop in nine communities, including Livermore. The line is so popular that a third train will be added next year.
Among the most ardent supporters of the train is Ms. Allen, who climbs aboard weekday mornings at 5:30 or 6:38 for the hourlong trip to Santa Clara, where she takes a free shuttle to her job. "I moved here in 1970, and you could drive between San Jose and San Francisco in 22 minutes," Ms. Allen said. "Nowadays, forget it. Even on Saturdays, you're in traffic that's backed up."
 
Aspen, Colo.
Here, too, economics is a force behind the daily traffic jam. With average home prices in Aspen in the $1 million range, most of the city's work force lives in the seven small towns served by the Roaring Fork Valley's one-way-in-one-way-out Highway 82.
But geography is also a factor. Mountain peaks and valleys produce exhilarating views, but are tough places to build highways.
Even though the Colorado Department of Transportation has widened parts of the road to four lanes and introduced high-occupancy-vehicle lanes, the road's tight curves and two-lane stretches can make the 40-mile trip from Glenwood Springs to Aspen a two-hour ordeal. Alice Hubbard commuted for two years from Basalt to Aspen, a 17-mile trip that often took 60 minutes. "The highway is so full that traffic just can't move," Ms. Hubbard said.
In 1996, Aspen and its neighboring towns formed the Roaring Fork Railroad Holding Authority to buy 33 miles of railroad right of way. The authority is studying whether to re-establish passenger train service that was halted in the late 1960's. Ms. Hubbard is the authority's public involvement director. "We want to recreate what was here 100 years ago," she said, referring to the Glenwood Springs to Aspen line that carried silver for the mining industry and passengers.
"People will use the train. I think of all the parents who spend so much time commuting. They get home angry, tired, stressed out."
 
Detroit
Motown's culture and economy have been distilled by its experience with roads and cars, and now it is paying an unexpected bill. Detroit is the largest metropolitan region in the nation without light rail, subway or commuter rail service. And the bus service is unreliable.
The absence of convenient alternatives has also accelerated the deterioration of Detroit's highway system. As a result, the Detroit region is entering a generational transition not of highway construction but of continuing, disruptive and expensive repairs and rebuilding. Commutes, for instance, from Lake Orion in suburban Oakland County to Detroit that once took 40 minutes now take twice as long.
The repair costs, 80 percent of which are paid by the Federal Government, are astonishing. The state transportation department is considering rebuilding 11 miles of Interstate 94 in Detroit, including four miles of interchanges with two other freeways. The estimated cost -- $1.3 billion -- places the job among the most expensive highway rebuilding projects in the country, highway engineers in other states said.
As much as 20 percent of the project's budget, or $260 million, would be spent just to manage traffic during construction -- twice what it would cost to build a commuter rail network in Detroit with 100 miles of track and 30 stations, a recent state transportation department study said. Such a system, the study said, could serve 20,000 passengers a day.
 
Atlanta
Urban sprawl might have been invented in Los Angeles. But Atlanta seems determined to perfect it.
Since 1990, the 10 counties around Atlanta have added 602,000 residents, many drawn by its reputation for quality of life, bringing the population to 3.11 million. In 1990, the region considered to fall within the metropolis was 65 miles from north to south. Today it is 110 miles.
The result is a city where it is almost always drive time. Atlantans drive an average of 34.9 miles round trip to work, more than commuters in any other American city. The average is 20 miles.
Air pollution is so serious that the Federal Government told state officials they could not have more money to build highways until they reduced it. Last year the city's once-vaunted reputation as a place to do business was damaged when the Hewlett-Packard Company said it was reconsidering plans to expand in suburban Atlanta because its employees were complaining about declining quality of life.
All these issues helped Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who campaigned last year on a promise to address congestion, to push a bill through the Legislature in March that established the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, a superagency with authority to improve public transit, direct local governments to curb sprawl and decide on other steps to ease congestion.
Angel Torres, a city planner and adjunct professor at Clark Atlanta University, said he had commuted by bicycle, bus and car in Atlanta and had found all of the commutes to be terrible. "Ever since the Olympics in 1996, you could see the traffic get worse and worse," Mr. Torres said. "We thought all these people would go home. They never did. It's bad everywhere. It doesn't matter where you go, and it almost doesn't matter what time you go."
 
Northern Virginia
Rush hour used to refer to the rush into and then out of a city center. But suburb-to-suburb commutes also create bottlenecks. The Washington area boasts a superb regional subway system, yet congestion is getting worse as more of the region's population shifts to its edges, and commuting patterns become a crazy weave of personal routes all over the region.
No matter how many destinations commuters have, there are only so many major roads, and the points where they intersect can be trouble even far from downtown.
This year, the Virginia Department of Transportation started a $350 million, eight-year project to speed traffic on Interstate 95 and the Capital Beltway by expanding the interchange where the two highways meet in northern Virginia, about 15 miles from the White House. The interchange, known as the Mixing Bowl, is the region's busiest and most dangerous, handling 375,000 vehicles a day.
Last spring, when a gunpowder truck overturned and authorities closed the Mixing Bowl during rush hours, motorists gained a clear understanding of the interchange's importance. Traffic stopped for hours on every highway in the area, and on the side streets that served as exits and entrances. Tens of thousands of employees never made it to work.
Stacy Luks, a consultant for management and organizational development at the American Red Cross, negotiates the Mixing Bowl on her regular 18-mile commute from Woodbridge to Falls Church. On good days, she makes the drive in 45 minutes to an hour. On bad days, the drive can take twice as long.
Ms. Luks says she misses the Monica Lewinsky scandal, especially the impeachment hearings on public radio, because it provided "constant interesting fodder to keep your mind alert while you were driving."

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Has Many Selling Points, but Few Buyers

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL; Dan Neil is a contributing editor at Car and Driver magazine.

 BODY:
WHAT if there was a fuel that was cheap, limitless and clean-burning? A fuel whose supply and price were strategically secure, free from the caprice of oil-producing nations? A fuel that relied on engineering fundamentally no more esoteric than that of a restaurant stove?
It sounds like an environmentalist's giddiest daydream. Yet such a fuel is natural gas -- simple, guileless methane, the perfume of the plains. It even comes in two flavors: compressed natural gas (C.N.G. for short) and its cryogenic cousin, liquefied natural gas (L.N.G.). It is a fuel with a host of attributes, a seemingly elegant solution to issues as diverse as air pollution and trade imbalances. 
 Yet even its most ardent supporters concede that compressed natural gas will probably never be more than a niche source of energy, one best suited to large fleets of buses, cabs and delivery trucks, which can be fueled at a central location. The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, which speaks for the industry, has all but given up hope that large numbers of compressed natural-gas stations will ever be built.
At best, it appears, C.N.G. vehicles will account for a small part of America's rolling stock in the next decade. At worst, they may be stalled for the foreseeable future.
Either way, the recent history of compressed natural gas is an object lesson in the difficulties facing alternative transportation energy, and how hard it is to displace gasoline as the fuel of choice.
Certainly, recent events have seemed favorable for an alternative fuel. Two years ago, Congress approved the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to ratchet up pollution standards on oxides of nitrogen and diesel particulate matter, the city-choking residue of automobiles and trucks burning gasoline and diesel fuel.
Last spring, the E.P.A. proposed new tailpipe-emission standards that would essentially federalize California's stringent standards. The agency's so-called Tier Two rules also call for refineries to produce cleaner-burning low-sulfur gasoline, a provision opposed by the petroleum industry.
Diesel fuel, gasoline's grimy sibling, is also under attack. In a move that could have far-reaching consequences, both California and the E.P.A. have declared diesel particulate -- a k a soot -- a toxic substance.
Natural gas, by comparison, is clean. Compared with gasoline vehicles, C.N.G. vehicles emit 70 percent less carbon monoxide, 87 percent less nitrogen oxide (a principal culprit in smog) and 87 percent less nonmethane volatile organic compounds. Because natural gas contains less carbon than other fossil fuels, it contributes significantly less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Meanwhile, gasoline is becoming more vulnerable on price. Oil-exporting nations crimped the petroleum pipeline to the United States just in time for the summer travel season. From a historic low of $9.84 a barrel in December 1998, crude oil prices had risen to $22.78 in early October.
In California, where supply problems this year have added to the price increase, gasoline was up $1.48 a gallon in early October; a gasoline gallon equivalent of compressed natural gas is about $1.
ASIGNIFICANT price disparity should be good news for natural-gas advocates. So should the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act, which Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, introduced in early May. (A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in June.) If the act is passed, it would give sellers of clean-burning fuels a tax credit of 50 cents a gasoline-gallon equivalent, radically changing the economics of alternative fuels, particularly natural gas. The legislation has been caught up in the tax-cut dispute between the White House and Congress and is still pending. "If we get that, it's very likely that we'll see prices in the range of 55 cents" a gasoline-gallon equivalent, said Richard R. Kolodziej, the president of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition. "Then I think you are going to see people say: 'I like this. I want to do it.' "
The Rockefeller-Hatch bill is opposed by the petroleum industry, which has defeated similar initiatives in state legislatures. "We feel that no fuel ought to be disadvantaged or advantaged by tax subsidies," said Bill O'Keefe, the executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute. "Let the market decide."
But the bill, should it pass, would signal a renaissance in vehicles that burn natural gas.
So, what could be wrong? One word: range. Most gasoline cars can go 300 miles or more on a tank of fuel. When they run low, they pull into a gas station to fill up.
Natural-gas vehicles typically can go about half that distance, and when they run out of fuel, there are few places to fill up. That's why these vehicles work best -- indeed, almost exclusively -- for fleets, like buses, cabs and delivery trucks, in which high-mileage users travel regular, local routes and return to a central refueling point.
"We recognized that our business will be built up not by going after a few vehicles in a large population, but a larger percentage of a small population," Mr. Kolodziej said. "It doesn't mean that others are going to be ignored -- early adopters, environmentalists and so on."
But that is often the message. In January, I was part of a team from Car and Driver magazine that tried to cross the country in a compressed natural-gas vehicle using the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition's guide to refueling stations. Many stations, listed as public, were inaccessible, or had no means to measure out quantities of gas or accept payment for it, or kept irregular hours, or had been abandoned.
While companies in the West and Northeast have built chains of C.N.G. refueling stations, real growth awaits a better market or Government incentives. Stations, it seems, are costly to build and operate, primarily because they require large compressors capable of supplying the industry standard of 3,000 pounds a square inch of pressure on demand, around the clock.
The Rockefeller-Hatch bill offers a $30,000 tax deduction toward the installation costs of alternative fueling stations. "For too long, we have been caught in a chicken-and-egg cycle, with the infrastructure not available to support alternative-fuel vehicles and consumers not interested in the vehicles because there is no support infrastructure," Senator Rockefeller said.
For determined environmentalists, there is another way. Fuelmaker, a Canadian company, sells home fueling stations that can be plumbed directly into a home's natural-gas supply. C.N.G.-powered cars can then be refueled in the driveway. Fuelmaker units cost about $2,500, and some manufacturers offer rebates on purchases. The Rockefeller-Hatch bill would grant the same tax credit to home refuelers, who could deduct costs up to $100,000 from their Federal taxes.
But the oil industry, which controls 60 percent of America's natural-gas reserves, is the least interested in building a C.N.G. infrastructure. On the face of it, it seems odd that the industry would not be eager to sell its wares to the public. Why not build the C.N.G. stations, and let them come?
It doesn't work that way, said Mr. O'Keefe of the American Petroleum Institute. "My members are in the business of providing what consumers want," he explained. "Right now the consumers want S.U.V.'s, not C.N.G.'s. Supply follows demand."
Mr. Kolodziej said the institute's members "would like to sell more natural gas, but not to cannibalize their transportation market." They have billions tied up in refineries, pipelines and service stations designed to deliver a liquid petroleum product, he said.
For their part, auto makers are wading into the C.N.G. market, despite lackluster consumer demand. The reason? The E.P.A.'s Corporate Average Fuel Economy rule, in which every alternative-fuel vehicle sold is calculated to get 120 miles a gallon. This gives car makers considerable slack on their big-selling low-mileage vehicles. More than a dozen light-duty compressed natural-gas models are on the market, and more are on the way. At the North American International Auto Expo in Detroit in January, DaimlerChrysler displayed a 325-horsepower Dodge Charger concept car that employed a new compact storage system and a range, it said, of up to 300 miles.
A sister project using the Plymouth Breeze/Dodge Stratus as a platform yielded a C.N.G. car virtually indistinguishable from its gasoline-powered twin. "Our goal was to find C.N.G. technology that was transparent to the driver, so he wouldn't even be aware that he was driving a C.N.G. vehicle," said John Wozniak, the project manager for the Applied Physics Laboratory. "That's the only way C.N.G. is going to make real progress."
But there have been unexpected complications. In Seattle, government administrators abandoned plans to expand the city's C.N.G. fleet after determining that such an expansion would require extensive garage renovations.
THE course of any technology never did run true. By the time compressed natural-gas technology sorts itself out, it may be superseded by another technology, the hydrogen-driven fuel cell, which has the petroleum industry's support. Fuel cells catalyze fuels instead of burning them, so they produce only oxygen and water as byproducts.
Dave Lefever, the executive director of the National Association of Fleet Administrators, said that what car manufacturers are telling the fleet managers "is that all these alternative and flex-fuel approaches are basically interim approaches until they get the fuel-cell technology up and running," perhaps in 10 years' time.
But compressed natural-gas advocates remain hopeful. Noting that hydrogen and C.N.G. are both compressed gases, Mr. Kolodziej of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition said: "The same infrastructure that delivers C.N.G. can deliver hydrogen in the future. We are the logical bridge between petroleum and hydrogen."

HEADLINE: He Sets the Values Car Makers Live By

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
FAR from the nation's automotive capital toils a respected analyst who influences one in every three new cars driven off dealer lots. That totes up to $80 billion in purchasing each year.
Part soothsayer and part statistician, Doug Aiken, along with his 25 employees, forecasts what cars will fetch at wholesale auto auctions once their leases end. He publishes his predictions every other month in specialized guidebooks that are regarded by auto makers, consumer lenders and Wall Street investment bankers as the industry benchmark. 
 An unknown outside the world of automotive finance, Mr. Aiken and his Automotive Lease Guide, known almost universally as A.L.G., are both revered and feared in Detroit's corridors of power. His relationship with the major car makers is a love-hate affair, because, aside from fickle consumer tastes, perhaps no other independent factor can ignite car sales like the pocket-sized guide.
Though competition has emerged in recent years, the Automotive Lease Guide is considered the voice of authority. The finance divisions of Ford and General Motors use it exclusively to predict residual values, an all-important figure indicating a vehicle's worth after its lease lapses in two to five years. That value is a critical figure to new-car dealers, who use it to calculate a buyer's monthly lease payments. Leased cars now account for a third of the 12 million new cars sold domestically, a percentage that has grown by leaps and bounds in 20 years.
Because payments are lower on leased cars that best retain their value in the used-car market, Mr. Aiken is under unremitting pressure from auto executives to "enhance" the guide's figures to spur sales. Pushing back are lenders' insurers, who reserve capital against leases and want the figures to be low to insure profits.
"If they're all mad at us, then we're probably at the right mix," said the 48-year-old Mr. Aiken, who wears a close-cropped beard and appears unaffected by his clout with auto titans. He is dispassionate about cars (as opposed to golf). That detachment and his analytical bent overcome the best efforts of auto makers to dazzle him.
And try they do. Like automotive editors from the trade press, Mr. Aiken is treated royally, receiving all-expenses-paid trips to new-model introductions and test drives at factories and proving grounds around the world. As a measure of its importance, Automotive Lease Guide is sometimes invited exclusively. Every few months, a new set of models -- from Kias to BMW's -- are parked behind the guidebook's inconspicuous office, ready for the 10-person editorial staff to try out, gratis.
"They've not abused their position regardless of our efforts to present information that's favorable," said John T. Treter, the rental sales manager for Ford fleet leasing in Dearborn, Mich.
IN the boardrooms of major auto makers, Mr. Aiken, who appears as patient as a schoolteacher, has defended his method in person to top-level managers, who over the years have fumed in disagreement with his guide's findings. "There's not a lot of people willing to be called on the carpet," Mr. Treter said.
Because of his willingness to be accountable and his guide's unyielding conservative approach, Mr. Aiken's stature has evolved from bit player to industry sage. He is now sought for "fireside chats," when senior automotive executives enlist his opinions, which only enhances his guide's dominance of its arcane niche. "There isn't another guidebook that has availability to the top auto management of the world," Mr. Treter said.
Mr. Aiken owes his place in the catbird's seat to his father, James, now 83, a former Oldsmobile dealer in Los Angeles, who is a seminal figure in automobile leasing. In the 1960's, the elder Mr. Aiken persuaded some of his dealer friends to help him start a leasing company after banks refused to carry auto leases on their books. With borrowed capital, customized accounting software and a mimeographed list of residuals on 20 domestic makes, the Automotive Leasing Group became the dealers' bank of choice.
By 1972, the group had 5,000 leases from 250 Western dealers. The strategy gained legitimacy when Security Pacific, the California lender, acquired the portfolio, becoming the country's first bank to offer auto leases. The leasing group's founders retained rights to its software and residual guide. The younger Mr. Aiken, a mathematics whiz who studied economics at Arizona State University, spent five years installing computer systems for bank clients before persuading his father to sell him the lease guide.
"Over the course of a year, I developed programs to mimic what I was doing on mainframes," said Mr. Aiken, who started on a Radio Shack computer.
His timing was perfect. Leasing accelerated early in the 80's, thanks to the expansion of a Federal tax credit on business equipment and a favorable ruling by bank regulators. It helped that the G.M. finance unit, the first auto maker to offer leases, pegged them to Automotive Lease Guide. "It gave our book a lot of credibility," Mr. Aiken said.
Randall McCathren, a Nashville lease consultant, said, "Doug Aiken had the wisdom to go out and market these as national data."
Eager to stand apart from competitors, lenders clamored for their own private-label guides. Thanks to Mr. Aiken's computer proficiency, he could blend the Automotive Lease Guide's benchmarks with specialized criteria important to lenders -- for example, a dealer option like gold trim to a lease's cost.
The basic guide predicts values for 1,200 different models five years in the future. The figures are distilled from 15 years of dealer and auction sales' records, along with demographic and economic data. They are weighted by the staff's "historical insights," said John Blair, the guide's president and Mr. Aiken's business partner, who refused to divulge proprietary details. The sort of questions the staff debates is whether antilock brakes have become so prevalent that they no longer add to a used car's value.
"They do as good a job as any in anticipating the market," said Richard T. Schliesmann, the executive vice president of Wells Fargo's leasing division in San Francisco. The guidebook says that on any car, its figures are accurate within two to three percentage points.
Sometimes, to popularize a model or gain new customers, auto makers' captive finance companies and some traditional lenders take a calculated risk and disregard the guide's benchmarks. They inflate their own residual values to gain more business. That's what Chrysler, then financially strapped, did early in the 90's with its Jeep Grand Cherokee, a bet that eventually went wrong as prices on used sport utility vehicles fell when the market became crowded with competing models.
Losses could have gone higher and the credibility of leasing could have eroded had the Automotive Lease Guide followed the crowd, said R. W. Christiansen Jr., the chief executive of Westar Financial Services, a leasing company in Olympia, Wash. "Doug didn't bend. He helped maintain discipline in the industry. Those who have stood with him have benefited."
Automotive Lease Guide has two rivals: the Black Book, published in Gainesville, Ga., and owned by the Hearst Corporation; and the Kelley Blue Book, published in Irvine, Calif. Both started as publishers of used-car price guides for dealers and have tried with little success to expand into residual guides.
Next year, a third rival is expected. The National Automotive Dealers Association, based in McLean, Va., plans a guide that emphasizes demographic trends.
"It's been interesting to me to witness Doug's transition from hanger-on to being the point person for information," conceded Charles J. Vogelheim, a Kelley Blue Book editor, with a hint of professional jealousy. "It's a known fact," he added, tongue-in-cheek, "if he was in Boise, he'd be zero."
Golf-crazy auto executives who like to leave snowy Michigan in the dead of winter keep flocking to Mr. Aiken's spare offices in sunny Santa Barbara. So do insurers and Wall Street analysts, who ask Automotive Lease Guide for a pulse on lenders' portfolio risks. Many of them seem happy to lose $3 bets to Mr. Aiken at La Cumbre, a favorite course near his home near the Santa Barbara waterfront. Given he has a 2 handicap, it's a sucker bet.
In the beginning, when Mr. Aiken was the guide's sole employee, he did everything from stuffing envelopes to calling past-due subscribers. Now, he is considering expanding abroad, and demands for custom analyses have required the addition of more workers and a partner, John Blair.
The division of labor suits him. "I'm making the snowballs now," Mr. Aiken said, "and he's throwing them."

HEADLINE: At Rallies in Europe, Africa and Asia, Pocket Rockets Rule

BYLINE: By JACK SMITH 

 BODY:
TO most Americans, motor sports mean big, V8-powered mutants thundering along Nascar ovals or sleek, needle-nosed Indy cars or Ferraris and Porsches streaking along impeccably smooth concrete and blacktop tracks. But the world's most popular form of auto racing, rallying, is populated by names synonymous with economical transportation: Subaru, Mitsubishi and even that Czech-built anomaly, Skoda.
They are the ultimate pocket rockets, high-powered, lightweight coupes and sedans built for the World Rally Championship series, an event that takes place in 10 countries on real roads replete with bumps and potholes and, sometimes, on terrain barely suited for hiking. 
 "It's totally different from circuit racing in the states," said David Richards, the chairman of Pro-Drive, the Subaru factory team. "One minute you're running along paved roads; the next you'll be in mud or sand. If you see kangaroos in the distance, you know you're in Australia. If you see lions and giraffes, you're in Kenya. If you're racing in England, there are days when you can barely see the side of the road for the fog."
Here is where the co-driver comes in. The driver is usually "flying by instruments," outrunning his line of sight along a course whose hairpin turns, dips, ruts or icy patches may be obscured by darkness, sandstorms or spectators (drivers call them the "human guardrail") within an arm's length of the race cars.
The driver gets data from the co-driver, who rarely looks up while shouting instructions from notes -- often hundreds of pages compiled during reconnaissance runs conducted before the race. Not surprisingly, drivers' and co-drivers' heart rates are reported to rise two to three times their normal rate during competition.
Most manufacturers here don't like to talk about rally cars. "Rallying is too disconnected from the American market," said one rally official who asked not to be identified. "It's the second biggest sport in the world behind soccer, but Americans know nothing about it."
 
SUBARU IMPREZA
One of the only car makers eager to chat about rallying is Subaru, the winner of World Rally championships in 1995, 1996 and 1997. "We like rallying because the cars and the conditions are the closest thing in racing to real life," said Alex Fedorak, a Subaru spokesman. "The competition car looks just like the showroom Impreza, it has the same wheelbase as the Impreza and it uses the same suspension as the Impreza." The racing version, however, is clad in a welded body shell with protective roll cage and honeycomb side panels of aluminum and carbon fiber for lightness.
The 2-liter engine is based on the Subaru's horizontally opposed four-cylinder "boxer" power plant, turbocharged and intercooled to produce 300 horsepower with 347 foot-pounds of torque. As does every Subaru, the rallying Impreza features all-wheel drive; a viscous, limited-slip rear differential enables the rally car to alter side-to-side power distribution.
This Impreza also costs more than its more docile siblings; exactly how much more, Subaru won't say, but a used rally car can be had for a mere $280,000.
 
FORD FOCUS
 Ford entered the rally fray this year with an all-new, European-built World Rally Championship Focus, some 30 percent more rigid than the older W.R.C. Escort and, it says, 15 percent stiffer than any of its competitors.
Based on the three-door Focus, the all-wheel-drive rally car retains the look of the street car except for the 45 meters of steel tubing that is the roll cage.
The rally car is designed to concentrate the weight of components like the engine and transmission as low and as far within the wheelbase as possible for stability, while the rear differential is intended to give as much ground clearance as possible. One unusual feature is the six-speed gear lever mounted on the dash by the driver's right hand to minimize "hands off the wheel" time. The Focus uses 18-inch wheels on asphalt courses and 15-inch wheels for gravel events, while distribution of braking force may be adjusted from the cockpit.
There is a little wing over the rear hatchback window and a ballistic (high-velocity) carbon-composite under tray to protect its belly from those moments when the car goes . . . uh, ballistic.
 
MITSUBISHI LANCER
Mitsubishi won the World Rally Championship manufacturer's title for the first time last year and claims cult object status for its newest entry, the Lancer GSR Evolution VI, which in street trim sells in Japan for 3.3 million yen (about $30,355). A Mitsubishi spokesman said that the factory-sponsored race cars were not for sale, but he estimated they would cost well over $1 million.
Though competition figures are not available, the garden-variety Lancer is no slouch; its 2-liter, four-cylinder engine is turbocharged and intercooled to produce 280 horsepower.
Mitsubishi's attention to detail is evident in the car maker's claim that performance -- specifically engine cooling and aerodynamics -- have been enhanced by changing the position of the license plate on the front bumper. The car rides on 17-inch Oz alloy wheels and stops on oversize Brembo brakes. Its gaping maw of a radiator grille and twin rear spoilers are designed to conform to 1999 World Rally Championship regulations rather than esthetics.

HEADLINE: With Rover, BMW Got More and Less Than It Asked For

BYLINE: By RICHARD FEAST; Richard Feast is editor at large of Financial Times Automotive World in London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
BMW of Germany is one of the world's great automotive icons. Its cars ooze class, sophistication and engineering excellence. Land Rover, the British sport utility vehicles made by the BMW-owned Rover Group, enjoys a similar profile in another part of the motoring firmament.
The appeal of these two big names is evident in showrooms around the world. Both are heading for global sales records once more this year. In the United States, for example, in the first eight months of 1999, BMW sales were up 19 percent, and Land Rover's soared by 35 percent. 
 From an outside point of view, then, the union of BMW and Rover probably looks like the perfect marriage.
But appearances can be deceptive.
While BMW and Land Rover have never been in better shape, the Rover brand of passenger cars (which are not sold in the United States) has been a continuous drain on the overall health of BMW A.G. In Germany these days, Rover is known as "The English Patient."
In early 1994, BMW paid the equivalent of $1.35 billion for the Rover Group, and it has nearly doubled that figure in subsequent investment. For what? For BMW, Rover's poor productivity, so-so quality and rapidly declining sales were like handicapping an Olympic sprinter with winter boots.
So what looked like a bargain -- Ford paid $2.4 billion for the much smaller Jaguar company -- was actually a liability. For the first time in nearly four decades, BMW looked vulnerable, and it was all because of the Rover purchase. BMW's main shareholders, the Quandt family (which owns 46 percent of the stock), began to question the wisdom of the deal.
The situation resulted in a sudden reverse in strategy last fall, when Rover lost all its operating autonomy. That led to the departure of Walter Hasselkus, the BMW-appointed chairman of Rover. A few months later, in February, Bernd Pischetsrieder, the chairman of BMW A.G., and his heir apparent, Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's engineering director, left abruptly.
What made it worse was that Mr. Reitzle, the man responsible for the design and development of so many cars used as benchmarks by other auto makers, quickly landed the key job in charge of Ford's newly created Premier Automotive Group, made up of Aston Martin, Jaguar, Lincoln and Volvo.
It all began with BMW's recognition that, like its rival, Mercedes-Benz, it needed to find greater economies of scale. As Mercedes expanded organically with additional models -- the merger with the Chrysler Corporation came later -- BMW decided on growth by acquisition. In 1994, it bought Rover from British Aerospace and the Honda Motor Company.
The purchase was seen at the time as a dazzling move by a company that could do no wrong. The German auto maker had chalked up three decades of increasing sales, profits and dividends, transforming itself from a maker of micro cars into a worthy competitor for Mercedes-Benz. In the process, it made the already wealthy Quandt family, which gambled on the near-bankrupt BMW in 1959, even richer.
BMW was not prepared for Rover, however. It failed to study the postwar history of Britain's automotive industry, which had been in terminal decline. In 1952, Rover was the fourth-largest auto maker in the world (after Detroit's Big Three); four decades later it had dropped to 20th.
Over the years Rover had demonstrated an alarming appetite to consume cash. Taxpayers in Britain knew only too well about its performance, because it was under state ownership until Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sold the majority shares -- for a pittance -- to British Aerospace in 1988. Rover, known variously over the years as BMC (British Motor Corporation), British Leyland or BL, was a byword for unreliable products, late deliveries and inefficiency. Its anarchic labor relations were largely responsible for what became known in the rest of the world as "the British disease."
By the time BMW took over, Rover was a smaller, better-focused group following various company selloffs, factory closings and terminations. And in spite of this, labor relations were good. Technology transfer agreements with Honda had helped Rover improve its products and manufacturing, though investments were paltry by international standards when the state and British Aerospace were in control.
BMW decided that, given proper financing and supervision, Rover knew how to get the job done. It doubled investment in Rover, established broad strategy and left its British subsidiary to get on with its own models, engineering, purchasing, production, sales and distribution.
BMW and Rover were separate companies under the ownership of one of them.
That turned out to be a mistake.
The reluctance to take a heavy hand was understandable given the histories of Britain and Germany during this century. Rover was all that remained of the once-extensive British auto industry. Having it run by an "enemy" it had helped to defeat in two terrible world wars would require careful public relations in Britain.
In the mid-1980's, Mrs. Thatcher was desperate to give up state ownership of BL. She encouraged Ford to take over the passenger-car group (then called Austin-Morris) and General Motors to buy the Land Rover and Leyland truck businesses. The deals were almost done when the Prime Minister uncharacteristically reversed position in response to anti-American protest from her own supporters and from the opposition.
Ford and G.M. were squeezed out. Mrs. Thatcher then found a safe national savior in British Aerospace. It was clearly a political solution rather than an industrial one. Yet, six years later, there was curiously little opposition when Rover was sold to a German company. What had happened before, though, made BMW sensitive to the nationality issue. It kept Rover at arm's length.
At his first press conference last March, Joachim Milberg, who took over as BMW chairman in February, said: "The multibrand strategy which was pursued was right in principle. The type of group leadership, however, proved to be wrong." It was an oblique reference to the dissenting Mr. Reitzle, who wanted to abandon the ailing Rover car brand.
During the press conference, Mr. Milberg also said, "Our strategy is the strategy of the entire BMW board of management. And since this is demonstrated by all of us, you will not see any of us developing and announcing his own strategies."
That grand plan amounts to a more sophisticated, high-end version of the seminal one defined in the 1920's by Alfred P. Sloan Jr. for General Motors: a car for every purse and purpose. In BMW's case, its portfolio of brands would occupy the upper niche (translation: fat profits) of each market segment while collectively providing a full range of products.
The company has its successes, of course. BMW and Land Rover are flourishing. The MG name was successfully revived with the introduction of a midengine roadster (not sold in the United States).
This summer the flagship 75, a luxury Rover sedan, was introduced in Europe to favorable notices, and executives of both companies have pointed to the car as a sign of things to come. "Anybody who has driven the 75 will know that Rover is capable, with BMW's help, of designing and engineering some of the best cars in the world," Bernard Carey, a Rover spokesman, said earlier this year.
Helmut Panke, BMW's chief financial officer, said he expects the 75 to provide a boost to Rover's worldwide sales, which were down 33 percent in the first half of this year. In the meantime, however, new versions of the aging 200 and 400 midlevel models will not be ready until 2002 at the earliest. Given the quality of the competition, many auto analysts believe, that's a long time to wait.
The combination of the sales slide and the $2.8 billion investment that BMW has committed to developing new models and rebuilding the main factory in Birmingham means that Rover will be a continuing financial burden on the company for a long time.
It's a good thing those BMW's and Land Rovers are so popular.

HEADLINE: CURRENTS: ARCHITECTURE;
Minimalism Still Finds Shelter in the West

BYLINE: By Frances Anderton

 BODY:

Los Angeles design ranges from the neo-Baroque to neo-Pop, but there is still a taste for the minimalism and economy of materials that characterize prewar and postwar Modernist architecture.
Koning Eizenberg Architecture and Daly, Genik, two contemporary Los Angeles practices, are keeping the minimalist tradition alive. Daly, Genik has done residences like the Valley Center House in north San Diego County (inset top). Another stringent design is its slender family house (top), called the Slot/Box House, which is tucked discreetly into a yard set back from a street in Santa Monica. The Slot/Box House cost just over $200,000 to build and is 2,000 square feet. It consists of two and a half levels over an open garage, with bedrooms on the opaque upper level and public areas on the lower levels behind floor-to-ceiling translucent polycarbonate panels that open the interior of the house to the outside. Daly, Genik acted as contractors on the house, which is made of steel frame and concrete block, with surfaces of plaster and birch. 
 In another corner of Santa Monica is Pluralistic School 1, a private school for children from kindergarten through the sixth grade (left), which was designed by Koning Eizenberg Architecture. The building is intended to express the philosophy of the school, which Julie Eizenberg, a partner in the firm, said empowers the children to think in a noninstitutional environment.
To this end, she said, there are "no cute icons of school," like gable roofs or primary colors. Instead there is a bracing composition, in exposed concrete, steel and wood, of two linear buildings with walkways. And natural light beams in through large windows.

No Slouching, Please, Toward a Well-Tailored Millennium

BYLINE: By Liz Seymour

DATELINE: HIGH POINT, N.C., Oct. 16

 BODY:
Once upon a time, everybody wanted to be in pictures. Now, every able-bodied celebrity or demi-celebrity wants to be in the furniture business.
Christopher Forbes, the vice chairman of Forbes, the magazine publishing company, was here to introduce furniture, lamps, rugs and bedding from a variety of makers inspired by the domestic trappings of his father, Malcolm S. Forbes, the Tangier-living, Elizabeth Taylor-squiring, Harley-Davidson-riding millionaire, who died in 1990. 
 A few blocks away, at Vanguard Furniture, Kathy Ireland -- the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model and "a modern Renaissance woman" who is "one of America's most respected women of achievement," in the words of the company's news release -- conducted tours of a 3,000-square-foot display dedicated to a furniture collection bearing her name. (She already lends her wholesome good looks to a signature clothing line for Kmart, which Women's Wear Daily has declared the seventh-most-popular brand of women's clothing in the country.)
Elsewhere, Jack Palance, the great B-movie actor, was touting the virtues of Action Lane's reclining leather chairs and sofas. It was one of this furniture season's most inspired pairings: limber upholstered pieces and the septuagenarian actor, who dropped to the stage of the Oscar ceremonies a few years back to execute a flurry of one-handed push-ups like a demonic Jack LaLanne.
Even the trend forecaster Faith Popcorn, who has long scolded the male-dominated furniture industry for giving short shrift to its largely female consumers, put her money where her mouth is: her own home office collection for Hooker Furniture designed to appeal to women.
"Business is just real good right now," said Jerry Epperson, a financial analyst with Mann Armistead & Epperson, an investment banking firm. The combination of a strong economy and the steady march of baby boomers toward midlife affluence was projected by the American Furniture Manufacturers Association to bump consumer demand for furniture to $61.1 billion in 1999, an increase of 5.5 percent over 1998. With 2,400 exhibitors and eight million square feet of showroom space -- and another million square feet to be added in the next six months -- the twice-a-year International Home Furnishing Market is the biggest wholesale furniture market in the world. It opened last Thursday and runs through tomorrow.
The mood in the opening days of the market was as buoyant as Mr. Forbes's on-site accessory, a Faberge-egg-shaped hot-air balloon that bobbed in the sky above a weedy vacant lot where Mr. Forbes made his presentation (bejeweled Faberge eggs were one of his father's passions). After years of grumbling about sluggish sales and thin margins, manufacturers were worrying about meeting demand. Few of them were rocking the boat with startling new products, however, preferring to concentrate instead on what was already selling. "There's more merchandise being deleted than being added," Mr. Epperson said. "Why change?"
Showroom building corridors were filled not just with furniture buyers, but with buyers from office supply stores, home improvement stores and home electronics stores as well. (In one odd-couple matchup, Bose, the maker of high-end audio equipment, will start carrying Mitchell Gold furniture in some of its mall stores this fall.) Catalogue companies like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel were given credit for rehabbing furniture's dowdy image among consumers.
"All of a sudden there started being all this good stuff available through catalogues," said Thomas O'Brien, 38, a cofounder of the hip SoHo design firm Aero Studios, who was introducing a resolutely modern-minded collection for Hickory Chair, for 99 years a bastion of traditionalism. Mount Vernon reproductions, Mark Hampton historicism.
In general, two nearly antithetical style directions vied for attention, sometimes side by side in the same showroom. On the one hand, sophisticated retro-modern design continued to gain strength, and dark woods, especially mahogany, had all but displaced the light birch and ash of just a couple of markets ago.
Mr. O'Brien's vision for the millennium is sleekly elegant eclecticism with a gentle Mixmaster edge: a bit of 1940's Chinese here, some embossed velvet there, a slipper chair with an exaggerated towering back, a seriously scholastic scroll-arm chair based on a Greek Revival original that Mr. O'Brien has owned since he was in college. Even Stanley Furniture got into the modernist act. Its Reflections of the 20th Century collection was similar in feeling to Mr. O'Brien's serene chic -- but priced to reach the midmarket consumer rather than Hickory Chair's typical posse of well-heeled suburbanites.
The prevalence of clean lines, tight upholstery, exposed legs, sexy little ottomans and silvery hardware at almost every price level proved that modern design had lost its shock value. Or just maybe, the American consumer, though still in love with tradition, has begun to accept the obvious -- that it is 1999, not 1799.
The entire second floor of Mitchell Gold's cobalt-blue headquarters, once the epicenter of the slouchy slipcover look, was devoted to severe tailoring. "I wouldn't make them if they didn't sell," said Mr. Gold, the president of the company, whose stylish upholstery is a staple at Crate and Barrel and other outlets.
Other introductions, however, took a distinctly baroque route. Thomasville's Bellasera, Stanley's Coronation, Lexington's California Legacy, and Bernhardt's Coronado were Euro inspired and heavily ornamented, combining metal, stone and glass with light woods and painted finishes. The pieces were also scaled to behemoth proportions, aimed at consumers with bodacious suburban homes to fill and a weakness for flashy effects. It could have been called "Married to the Mob."
Despite Ms. Ireland's pronouncement that she was "making it safe for people to take risks," she gamely trotted out furniture that was neither controversial nor new: a bun-foot damask sofa, a whitewashed side table with barley-twist legs and nonthreatening rattan dining chairs.
By contrast, Baker's Continental Collection was a quietly elegant treat. Culled from surprisingly diverse sources -- Baltic manor houses, anyone? -- the 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century designs proved that clean, crisp design knows no era. The Biedermeier-style center table, for example, could be pure Eames.
The most notable Euro-style holdout was Lane Furniture, which introduced Colonial Williamsburg designs. But the introduction had more to do with marketing savvy than a devotion to history. In making the move from Baker, which had been licensed to produce high-priced reproductions for a small and rarefied market, to Lane, whose new "interpretative" pieces are priced to appeal to a much larger audience, Colonial Williamsburg joined a mainstream trend: aggressive licensing.
In an industry notably short on household-word brands, an increasing number of companies hoped that a borrowed name -- whether of a museum, a designer or simply a celebrity, even a dead one, like Thomasville's Ernest Hemingway range, released last spring to consumer acclaim and critical drubbing -- would help create instant recognition. "Branded furniture stores such as Ethan Allen are doing very well," Mr. Epperson said. "It's logical that brands would become more important in the future."
If so, the industry will have to grapple with another challenge: how to sell brand names over the Internet. In an industry traditionally fiercely protective of sales territories, the Internet's borderless markets are both attractive and threatening. Nonetheless, a growing number of furniture companies gingerly crossed the line between E-information and E-commerce.
Directions, a Georgia-based manufacturer of contemporary upholstered and occasional furniture, maintains its own Web sit and is selling selected products through an E-retailer called Living.com. "If we're going to jump into it, this is the time to jump into it," said Al Lewinger, president of Directions. "We're ready."
Although on-line retailing still accounts for less than 1 percent of all furniture sales, representatives of Internet companies set up tables and monitors in every available space.
"The furniture industry is highly fragmented and a little primitive," said Linda Lewi, vice president of marketing for Home Portfolio, a Web site (www.homeportfolio.com) that offers access to a wide range of home products, from kitchen appliances to paint. "But there's a vortex of energy out there right now. Something's happening in furniture."

HEADLINE: Creator of the Fantastic Four Is Ready to Spin More Tales on Line

BYLINE: By FRANK HOUSTON

 BODY:
NEXT to his superheroes, Stan Lee has the most recognizable name in comic books. The longtime writer and editor for Marvel Comics helped create, among others, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Silver Surfer and the X-Men. In his 60-year career, he has become perhaps one of the best-read authors in the United States.
But ask Mr. Lee about his effect on popular culture, not to mention his influence on the literacy of a couple of generations' worth of comic-book readers, and his voice takes on a hushed, disbelieving tone. "I'm constantly amazed to meet people who grew up reading these things," he said. 
 Now, at age 76, Mr. Lee wants to spin his own Web. In December, his site will introduce a new comic-style story called "The Seventh Portal," Mr. Lee's first new series since assuming the publisher's seat at Marvel in 1972 (www.stanlee.net).
Mr. Lee, who is writing all the plot lines for "The Seventh Portal," said that the five-minute episodes would offer "the equivalent of a 10-page comic, but with a lot more detail and a lot more going on." The series is about an international team of beta-testers who are transported through the Internet into another dimension, where they gain superhero powers and battle the evil Mongorr.
"The idea is that there are seven portals that lead to other dimensions," Mr. Lee explained. "Mongorr has conquered the other six; the seventh leads to Earth. It's up to these heroes to keep him from finding it."
Mr. Lee made his career in pen and ink, and he hopes that his on-line comics stimulate renewed interest in the paper kind, too. Comics publishers could use the help. Marvel's bankruptcy, in 1996, was only one symptom of an industrywide slump, which occurred after a brief speculative boom in the early 90's. Sales are back to where they were 10 years ago, but most observers agree that comic books have been hurt -- and even supplanted -- by home video games and the arrival of the Internet, technologies that are aimed squarely at comics' core audience.
Like Slate and Salon, original magazines that first appeared on the Web, comic books have been quietly developing on line since 1996, with artists and writers experimenting with the form in a variety of ways. The Web comics range from reproductions to blends of comics and animation, but few have thus far attracted much notice.
"The nice thing about it is that it's a wide-open field," said Buddy Scalera, the on-line editor of Wizard, a comic book fan magazine. "Nobody has come out on line with the definitively must-read comic book that everybody is talking about. If anybody could do it, it probably would be Stan Lee."
Marvel's characters landed on America Online in 1996 in a series of weekly Cybercomics, and the stories have evolved on the Web with tales of Spider-Man, Wolverine and several others. (Cybercomics are also available, after free registration, at www.marvelzone.com.) New episodes were recently scaled back to a monthly basis, said Marvel's president and chief executive, Peter Cuneo, and will be tied in more directly with Marvel's newsstand offerings.
Part of the difficulty facing writers and artists who produce on-line comics is recreating the comic book's particular blend of words and pictures. Utilizing Macromedia's Shockwave software, Marvel's Cybercomics have the polish of comic books. Readers guide the action by clicking through word balloons and following panels.
Although complete with animation, sound effects and music, the Cyber-comics "are still very much in the comic book or strip genre," Mr. Cuneo said. The result is a cross between comics and animation.
For example, in a panel from "Doom Control," a Marvel series currently running on Macromedia's Shockwave site (www.shockwave.com), Dr. Doom's "mechanism for seizing mental control" takes over the roof of the Chrysler Building. The building juts into the frame at an off-angle, and weird electrical impulses are seen and heard crackling from the device.
Ron Mann, director of the documentary film "Comic Book Confidential," said he was very interested to see the development of on-line art and storytelling. "The page is completely different on a computer screen," he said. "You can endlessly scroll down. The screen itself is a frame."
Mr. Mann has experimented with rendering comic book panels on line. The CD-ROM version of "Comic Book Confidential" includes reproductions of seminal comic books on big pages that can be moved for different views, as well as background information on major artists, including Mr. Lee and his long-time collaborator, Jack Kirby.
Still, Mr. Mann said, "because there are too many bad comics on line, it is harder to find the good comics." One Web-only comic that has sparked interest within the comics industry is a companion site to the film "The Matrix" (www.whatisthematrix.com /cmp/comic_index.html). Comic-book-style stories are evolving in the gap between the hit movie and its planned sequels. Current tales are by writers and artists from Dark Horse, DC and Marvel.
Scott McCloud, a comics creator, theorist and author of "Understanding Comics," a comic book about comic books, has created several strips on line (www.scottmccloud .com) that explore the outer reaches of single Web pages, including Choose Your Own Carl, a reader-guided comic strip long on nonlinear narrative and short on flash.
"Comics are a kind of temporal map," Mr. McCloud said. "As you move from one inch to the next, you're actually moving from one moment to the next. That's a really powerful idea, and a really simple one." It's also one that may not be preserved in on-line comics, he said. "The moment you have broadband, you can have full animation," he said.
Can on-line comics ever match the vitality that sprang from Mr. Lee's dialogue and Mr. Kirby's panels? No matter how close they come, of course, the industry feels secure with its books. "A computerized piece of art is going to appeal to different senses," said John Jackson Miller, editor of Comics Retailer. "It almost takes you out of the realm of literature. Getting comics to work on the screen takes a transformation of what the thing is into something different."

HEADLINE: Darkly Mythic World Arrives From Japan;
Master of Animation Tries Hollywood

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Admirers of Japanese animation, including many of the leading figures in the American animation community, get a certain catch in their voices when they mention the name Hayao Miyazaki, as though describing someone not quite human, like one of the ghostly forest spirits who populate his work.
"From a pure filmmaking standpoint, his staging, his cutting, his action scenes are some of the best ever put on film, whether animated or not," said John Lasseter, director of "Toy Story," "A Bug's Life" and the upcoming "Toy Story 2." "Watching one of his films is the best medicine when you have writer's block. When we at Pixar feel that we're beating our heads against the wall, we go in the screening room and put on a laser disc and watch one of his films and it's like, whoa, look what he did. It's inspiration to power through that brick wall." 
 Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, co-directors of the Disney animated feature "Mulan," said simply in a recent tribute: "Miyazaki is like a god to us."
So it's a little disconcerting to find the great man himself, seated quietly on an outdoor patio at the Four Seasons Hotel, a pack of cigarettes nearby, his plain dress shirt open at the collar, a cascade of salt-and-pepper hair hanging across his forehead and an oblique grin on his face. A translator is nearby, as are three or four aides (their faces and numbers shift as they blend in and out of the surrounding tropical foliage) and a handful of publicists and representatives from Miramax, the company that will distribute "Princess Mononoke," the legendary animator's latest work.
"I believe that we must betray the expectations of the audience in order to keep them," Mr. Miyazaki said as those around him hung on every word. "The best thing is to try to make a movie that you don't have a clue how to make."
"Princess Mononoke," which opened in Japan in 1997, earned more than $150 million and became the most popular Japanese film ever to be released in that country and second only to "Titanic" on Japan's all-time box-office list. It was only the latest in a string of critical and popular successes for Mr. Miyazaki, 58.
Yet Mr. Miyazaki is largely unknown in the United States, outside of a small, cultlike following, most likely because until recently his films could be obtained only with difficulty and only in the original Japanese. Recent efforts to introduce the films of Studio Ghibli, the animation company that Mr. Miyazaki founded with his longtime associate, Isao Takahata, in 1985, in English-dubbed versions have begun to lift the veil.
Now, many admirers are hoping that the release of "Princess Mononoke" with a new English script and a major American distributor will finally get Mr. Miyazaki the wider recognition he deserves when the film opens on Oct. 29 in New York and three other cities. Wider distribution is to follow on Nov. 5.
Miramax certainly has high hopes for the release of this dubbed "Mononoke" -- especially with its English-language script by Neil Gaiman, a novelist and author of adult-oriented comic books and himself a highly respected figure in the animation world, and the participation of such actors as Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton and Gillian Anderson. But no one expects that it will turn into the smash phenomenon that it was in Japan.
Like most of Mr. Miyazaki's work, it is too long, too sprawling, too darkly nuanced and, ultimately, too unresolved for that. "It does not have the cathartic ending where the hero conquers the villain and justice wins the day," Mr. Miyazaki said. "And it is too long, more than two hours, which is difficult, no matter how brilliant you make it. I tried, but the film would not allow me to make it shorter."
Still, there are hopes that the film, even if it is not a commercial blockbuster, will expand the audience for sophisticated Japanese animation in the United States and maybe even lure people into sampling the rest of Mr. Miyazaki's work.
"Whether it's going to be a commercial success, I don't know and I don't care," Mr. Gaiman said. "I'm just proud of being a part of it."
Mr. Gaiman said his goal for the "Mononoke" script was dialogue "that didn't sound like Saturday morning cartoons" and that gave American audiences as close as possible the richly textured experience that Japanese audiences had. The challenge was to match his dialogue to a finished film: he tried to be scrupulous about writing lines that required no more mouth movements than were in the movie. Normally, dialogue is recorded before a film is animated so that the drawings can match the sound, but with a dubbed version this is not possible.
"Sometimes, I would come up with a really beautiful line that would take four or five mouth movements and I would only have three," he sighed. "So it had to go."
Mr. Gaiman said he did all of this without meeting the animator. Indeed, the two did not meet until last month, in New York. "I nervously went over and asked him for his autograph," Mr. Gaiman said. "He gave me a hug and told me how pleased he was."
Nervous? Why was he nervous?
"Actually, I was terrified," Mr. Gaiman said. "Why? Because he is Miyazaki."
Mr. Miyazaki's work is praised not merely for its scope and ambitious themes, but also for its filmmaking virtuosity, the way it subtly expands upon the conventions of live-action filmmaking, especially in his action scenes (he is particularly famous for his flying sequences), which rush across the screen with a vertiginous, roller-coaster intensity.
And there is also the simple issue of artistry. "People ask me what my favorite moment is in 'Princess Mononoke,' and I tell them it's when you see a rock and a raindrop hits it, and then another raindrop and then another and then it's slick with water and it's a moment of simply unutterable beauty," Mr. Gaiman said. "Sometimes the point of what you are seeing is simply that what you are seeing is beautiful."
Mr. Miyazaki was born in 1941 to a well-to-do family. His father was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, which made rudders and wing tips for Japanese Zero fighters. He remembers making drawing after drawing of airplanes and battleships as a youth, but when he began to seriously entertain the idea of becoming an animator he found that he was clumsy at drawing people.
S, he became a political science and economics major at Gakushuin University, where he also became a Marxist, remaining there until the late 1980's. In 1957 he saw his first Japanese animated feature and decided that this was what he wanted to do. After graduating in 1963, he joined the staff at Toei Doga, the largest animation studio in Asia.
Eventually Mr. Miyazaki left Toei, first to join another company, then to try to start his own, all the while building his reputation as an animator until, in 1984, with "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind," he drew serious international recognition. The story, set in a future where the world has been poisoned by industrial waste and other ecological horrors, is about a young girl in the wilderness fighting giant insects and clashing tribes. (As a tribute, the makers of the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" named one of their alien races Nausicaans.) On the strength of the film's success, Mr. Miyazaki helped found Studio Ghibli, where except for one brief and unsuccessful attempt to retire, he has worked ever since.
"Nausicaa" was followed in 1986 by "Laputa: The Castle in the Sky," a science-fiction adventure with some stunning action sequences. Then, in 1986, he released "My Neighbor Totoro," about a pair of Japanese children who move to the countryside when their mother falls ill (Mr. Miyazaki's own mother was bedridden for nine years) and who discover a world of forest spirits. His 1989 action-adventure, "Kiki's Delivery Service," was the biggest box office hit of the year in Japan, but an even bigger success was 1992's "Porco Rosso," a strange adventure about a biplane pilot with the face of a pig (Mr. Miyazaki often draws himself with a pig's face) who battles smugglers in the skies over the Mediterranean.
And then "Princess Mononoke" in 1997. A sprawling adventure that runs for more than two hours, it is Mr. Miyazaki's first Japanese period piece, set during the Muromachi period (1392-1573) and drawing on the era's folk tales, though its central characters are outcasts and working people rather than the samurai and village elders that normally populate such stories. The film's hero is a young prince forced into exile who comes to the edge of a wilderness where a fortresslike community of iron forgers is in conflict with the aging animal spirits in the surrounding forest. There, he meets Mononoke, a wild-child who lives with the animal spirits and is a kind of echo of the young girl in "Nausicaa."
At first, the animator said, it was he who resisted the idea of allowing someone to write an English script for a dubbed version. He was not convinced that the film's strong Japanese elements would translate for American audiences. "All I have is a vague sense of the lives and dreams that American children have," he said. he was also uncertain that young American audiences, accustomed to lighter fare, would be willing to embrace a film that is, at its deepest level, somewhat despairing.
"I think that if you are very genuine in doing films for young children, you must aim for their heads, not deciding for them what will be too much for them to handle," Mr. Miyazaki said. "What we found was that the children actually understood the movie and what we were trying to say more than the adults."
In Japan, he said, "Mononoke" was never sold as a children's film, though he envisioned his ideal audience as anyone over the age of 10. The downbeat tone is a mirror of the world children actually face, he said. "I wanted to be honest with the young audience, to tell them that human society is not fundamentally blessed," he said. "I do this not out of a desire to reassure children, just to say that this is the world that we all live in, children and adult, that we share this despair."
That oblique smile again.
He hopes American audiences will embrace "Mononoke" and, perhaps, develop an appetite for more sophisticated animation. "But you know, I hope the same thing for Japanese audiences," he said. Bad animation is a problem the world over, he said.
Why is that? He shrugged.
"There are too many animators making junk," he said. "And too many people who want to see junk."

HEADLINE: S. L. Dritz, 88, Retooler of Zipper And Other Handy Sewing Items

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Stanley L. Dritz, the last of four brothers whose gadgets made their family name a household word for generations of people who sew, died Saturday at the White Plains Hospital. He was 88.
Mr. Dritz had lived in Palm Beach, Fla., since his retirement more than 30 years ago. 
 When he was president of John Dritz & Sons, the company catalogue listed hundreds of items, ranging from hooks, snaps, buttons, pins and needles of all shapes and sizes to a see-through plastic T-square ruler with slots that allowed the user to make precise markings before cutting fabric.
Retailers like J. C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck mounted lavish displays of Dritz products in their stores. Among the most popular were the seam ripper, which made quick work of unwanted stitches and was much safer to use than a razor blade, and the electric scissors, an egg-shaped instrument that fit snugly in the palm of the hand. The scissors sold for $9.95 in 1953.
Toward the end of his life, Mr. Dritz told members of his family that to promote sales of a type of fastener he had first seen in Britain, he coined the word "zipper."
"The scientific name was hookless fastener, but he knew that term was awkward," said his wife, Dorothy. "He said it made a zipping sound and that's how he made up the name."
Others have also claimed to have named the zipper. No less a figure than the industrialist B. F. Goodrich is credited with using it for the Zipper Boots he sold in 1923, according to "Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things" by Charles Panati (Harper & Row, 1987).
But it was Mr. Dritz who helped heighten the consumer appeal of the zipper by making it of plastic and rust-proof metals and by creating attractive packaging and displays.
He promoted his business by introducing high school teachers of home economics to new techniques and products -- from Dritz.
Stanley Leon Dritz was born on June 15, 1911, in New York City. After graduating from Syracuse University, he joined the business founded by his father, John Dritz. The venture focused on the production and sale of beaded handbags.
Eventually, the family business included Mr. Dritz's brothers, Lawrence, Eugene and Arthur. Together, they brought an extensive array of products to home sewers.
In the 1960's, Mr. Dritz served as president of the National Notion Association, an industry trade organization, which sponsored the semi-annual Notion and Novelty Market Show in New York City.
Mr. Dritz was president of the family business in the 1950's and 60's. The company was sold when he retired. It is now owned by the Prym Dritz Corporation of Spartanburg, S.C., a division of Prym, of Stolberg, Germany.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Dritz is survived by a son, James Dritz of Armonk, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Population and Anarchy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Weakness in Numbers" (Op-Ed, Oct. 18): 
 I disagree with Robert D. Kaplan's argument that high population growth makes many countries "increasingly hard to govern except through tyrannical means."
Why, despite the tremendous growth in world population, has the standard of living of most people in the world (including India and China) increased?
And despite its being the most populous country, why is China on the road to becoming one of the world's most powerful economies?
Anarchy is not caused by increasing population, but largely has to do with a country's willingness to give its people opportunities to make their lives better.

HEADLINE: How Congress Was Cornered

BYLINE: By Leon E. Panetta; Leon E. Panetta served as President Clinton's chief of staff, director of the Office of Management and Budget and chairman of the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Congressional budget process has been in place for 25 years. For those of us who have worked on Federal budgets during that time, there is one unavoidable lesson: No budget is effective if it has no support, and no budget will have support unless it is credible.
This is a lesson the present leadership in Washington refuses to learn. The problem today is that the leadership wants to spend more than it is willing to admit to the public. Rather than being honest about this reality, it is trying to bluff its way through the budget process. 
 How? Congress and President Clinton are hiding behind budget caps. In the 1990 budget agreement, spending caps were established as a way to control the total amount that could be spent for discretionary programs like education and defense. If appropriations bills exceeded these caps, across-the-board cuts would automatically bring down discretionary spending. (Emergency spending -- usually for disaster relief or wars -- was not to be counted against these limits, and they did not affect spending that isn't discretionary, like Social Security payouts or interest on the national debt.) Congress and the President could change the caps, but they would have to change the law to do so.
In 1997, they did just that. In that year's balanced budget agreement, new, more restrictive caps were adopted, calling for drastic reductions in spending, totaling $775 billion over 10 years, with the first $25 billion cut due in fiscal year 2000. It was acknowledged at the time that these targets would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve and would most likely have to be revised.
Unfortunately, both the President's budget and the Congressional budget stuck to the caps, and the country's leaders painted themselves into a corner: They would not support credible revisions in the caps, but at the same time, they wanted to spend more for their own priorities.
Congress has tried to drive a $30 billion to $40 billion spending truck through the budget walls, increasing financing for the military and veterans' programs, among other things. President Clinton is urging increased spending for education and law enforcement.
Given the caps, there is no way to increase this spending without using every possible gimmick. Everything from financing for the 2000 census to home-heating assistance to the maintenance and operations portion of the defense budget is now labeled emergency financing. Congress is relying on the lowest spending estimates it can find. And it is using accounting sleight of hand to spread this year's budget into next year's.
The result is that the Congress is making a mockery of the Federal budget.
In the past, the budget process succeeded because there were those who were willing to provide leadership and to take the risks necessary to do the right thing. President George Bush was right to agree to the 1990 budget agreement, even though it may have contributed to his defeat in the 1992 election. President Clinton was right to push through his economic plan in 1993, even though it may have cost him a Democratic Congress in 1994. That is the price of leadership.
Today, members of Congress are ducking their responsibility -- hoping they can sneak out of town without having to face the tough choices necessary to enforce a credible budget. Instead of using gimmicks, they should vote to change the spending caps. They should be willing to vote for the taxes and spending cuts necessary to pay for additional spending.
While members of Congress may convince themselves that they are trying to adhere to the caps, all they are doing is passing responsibility on to the next President and the next Congress. The tragedy is that they believe they can fool the American people. In the end, they can only fool themselves.

HEADLINE: Albright Vows To Increase Aid to Nigeria

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright praised the five-month-old democratic Government of Nigeria today and pledged more financial support for the nation.
Dr. Albright, who is on a weeklong visit to Africa, said Nigeria was undergoing a historic transformation that could potentially rank alongside "the Czechoslovak 'Velvet Revolution' and South Africa's long walk to freedom." 
 The United States, she said, will try to insure that democratic change continues in Nigeria, which has emerged from 16 years of military rule. She proposed raising aid to the country threefold or fourfold from its current level of $27 million a year.
Early this week, President Clinton vetoed a $12.6 billion foreign aid bill passed by the Republican-led House. The amount was $2 billion less than the President requested.
Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and supplies 8 percent of United States oil imports.
In her tour of Africa so far, Dr. Albright has also pledged $55 million in aid to Sierra Leone, where a agreement has been signed to end an eight-year-old civil war. The Clinton Administration has been accused of neglecting Africa while responding quickly to Kosovo and East Timor.
Dr. Albright arrived here late Tuesday and held a two-hour meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is to visit the White House next week.
A State Department official who attended the meeting said President Obasanjo pledged to pursue an aggressive campaign against corruption no matter "whose goat is gored." Cronies of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha are already targets of the anticorruption drive.
President Obasanjo also said he expected a "democracy dividend" in the form of debt relief, according to the official. Nigeria's shaky economy cannot get back on its feet and its leaders will find it hard to sustain democracy if the country has to spend more than 30 percent of its export revenues to service its $30 billion debt, the official reported him as saying.
The Obasanjo Government has "already done much to restore Nigeria's democratic institutions," Dr. Albright said in a speech here to a West African economic organization. But she said the Government still needed to repeal repressive laws and to reform its judiciary and military fully.

HEADLINE: Airlines Continue to Report Weak Quarterly Profits

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
The nation's airlines continued to report weakened third-quarter earnings yesterday as rising fuel prices, the growing number of airplane seats and bad weather helped to reduce profits from last year's record highs.
US Airways, Trans World Airlines, and the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, all disappointed Wall Street, while the AMR Corporation, the owner of American Airlines, was the lone bright spot. 
 After four consecutive years of record profits, many airline executives contended they had finally learned how to increase profits consistently in the notoriously cyclical industry. But even as the domestic economy remains strong, carriers are having difficulty maintaining past earnings levels. Third-quarter profits were also down at some other major carriers. Part of the problem is that the number of new seats is growing faster than the number of new passengers.
"It's frustrating in a reasonably good operating environment, year over year, that we haven't been able to keep our shareholder returns up," Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, told reporters yesterday.
UAL said its net income fell to $456 million, or $3.75 a share, from $516 million, or $4.02 a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenue rose 1.3 percent, to $4.85 billion from $4.78 billion. UAL, which is the nation's largest employee-owned company, reports results as if all employee shares have been distributed.
The earnings just missed the $3.76 a share average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said the performance of United, which is the world's largest airline, was strong in July and August. But last month, Hurricane Floyd forced the airline to cancel 750 flights, costing it $15 million. Revenue per seat declined 3 percent domestically during the quarter, while it rose 12 percent overseas. The airline's costs were up 3 percent, mainly because of higher wages and salaries, Mr. Dutta said.
AMR said Hurricane Floyd cost it $17 million after it canceled 700 flights. But a hurricane also upset American's operations last year, neutralizing the effect of Floyd on this year's earnings.
Profits declined 36 percent during the quarter to $279 million, or $1.76 a share, from $433 million, or $2.49 a share in the third quarter last year. Revenue rose 2.1 percent, to $5.1 billion from $5.05 billion last year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was $1.69 a share.
Mr. Arpey of AMR said the average cost of jet fuel had risen 3 cents, to 56 cents a gallon, in the quarter.
Separately, Mr. Arpey said an offer made on Monday by Air Canada to buy the rival Canadian Airlines with the financial backing of UAL and Deutsche Lufthansa A.G. was not credible. The Air Canada bid counters an offer, backed by AMR, from the Onex Corporation, a Canadian buyout specialist.
"There is nothing in it for any of the Canadian constituencies," Mr. Arpey said of the Air Canada proposal, "and there is certainly nothing in it for AMR shareholders."
US Airways, which is the nation's sixth-largest airline and has struggled all year, continued to disappoint Wall Street. It lost $85 million, or $1.19 a share, during the quarter in contrast to a profit of $142 million, or $1.51 a share, in the period last year. Revenue fell to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion last year. Analysts had predicted a 33-cent loss.
"These results are clearly unacceptable," said Rakesh Gangwal, the president and chief executive of US Airways. "Our operational difficulties during this quarter have taken a significant toll on our financial performance."
In addition to Hurricane Floyd, which forced the airline to cancel 1,500 flights, US Airways suffered from shortages of pilots and airplanes because of slowdowns in its training and maintenance operations. As a result, the capacity, or number of seats, fell 6.6 percent. Its costs, which were already the highest in the industry, soared to 13.51 cents per seat-mile flown from 12.26 cents in the third quarter of 1998.
T.W.A. said it had suffered from rising fuel costs and the threat of a strike by its flight attendants and machinists. Its loss widened to $36.2 million, or 61 cents a share, from $923,000, or 11 cents a share, in the period last year. Revenue rose 1.5 percent, to $876 million from $863 million in 1998. Analysts polled by First Call had expected T.W.A. to lose 52 cents during the quarter.

HEADLINE: Unesco's New Director Is Envoy From Japan, Its Biggest Donor

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The Unesco executive board today chose Japan's Ambassador to France, Koichiro Matsuura, as director general of the organization. Mr. Matsuura's nomination for a six-year term is expected to be confirmed by 186-nation general conference of Unesco when it meets here on Nov. 12.
The Japanese diplomat had long been considered a strong contender, because Japan is the largest contributor to the $544 million biannual budget of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. He also benefited from intense lobbying by his Government, which has in recent years been seeking a higher profile in international organizations. 
 Mr. Matsuura, 62, the front-runner in the first two ballots conducted by the 58-nation executive board this week, won a majority, with 34 votes. Ghazi Algosaibi, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to London, was second, with 13. This election was the most open to date. But the outcome was no less conventional than in previous years.
In recent weeks, the Unesco headquarters here has been buzzing with rumors that the Japanese and Saudi Governments had promised generous aid packages to several third world countries in exchange for their votes. Japanese and Saudi diplomats strongly denied engaging in such "checkbook diplomacy."
The election has nonetheless brought to the surface widespread unhappiness with the way Unesco and its 2,326-member staff have been run by its current director general, Federico Mayor Zaragoza of Spain.
Mr. Mayor promised sweeping change in 1987, when he succeeded Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, whose left-leaning scandal-ridden tenure prompted a walkout in 1985 by the United States and Britain.
But in recent years, Mr. Mayor has come under increasing criticism. An external audit requested by Canada last year said Unesco was wracked by inefficiency and nepotism.
Although candidates to succeed Mr. Mayor did not directly attack his administration, some made it clear that they believed that Unesco needed a thorough shake-up.
Mr. Matsuura, though, was decidedly more cautious, noting in a campaign statement that "I hope to make it a more dynamic, efficient and harmonious organization" and to win recognition of Unesco's "usefulness and dynamic potential."
In an apparent reference to the United States, where he studied economics at Haverford College in Pennsylvania in the late 1950's, Mr. Matsuura also said he would extend an invitation to nonmember states to join. Although Britain returned after Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Government took office in 1997, Congressional hostility toward Unesco still appears to stand in the way of the United States' rejoining in the near future.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Jack of All Trades, Master of Treasure Hunts

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
AT a table at the Avenue of the Americas flea market, Alan Boss spotted a hefty down payment for his children's college tuition. He paid $3,000 for two engraved silver peace medals, commissioned by President Washington in 1793. Several years later at a Sotheby's auction, a medal identical to one of Mr. Boss's sold for $50,000.
From this we learn that: (1) Mr. Boss has a sharp shopper's eye and (2) Mr. Boss can afford to plonk down that kind of money to an outdoor vendor. 
 Both make more sense when one learns that Mr. Boss is the president of the Annex Antique Fair and Flea Market, which is a fancy way of saying he's the guy who in 1976 had the bright idea of renting an outdoor parking lot on the Avenue of the Americas on otherwise quiet Sundays. He then rented tables to dealers of antiques and collectibles ("whatever that means," he says with a shrug). His now-famous weekend markets are home to upward of 700 vendors.
He also coordinates the 70 sidewalk vendors who sell 24-7 outside the Coliseum at Columbus Circle. It's they who are tugging at his heartstrings at the moment, because today finishes Mr. Boss's lease on their behalf with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has sold the property to developers.
"One poor African guy just came and implored us to find him another place to sell," Mr. Boss says. "But we have to close up, lock, stock and barrel. Kaput."
In truth, Mr. Boss, 59, doesn't seem so perturbed over his vendors' plight. That's because he hopes to find another location. But he's also a scrappy sort, son of a Bronx corner grocer, who reinvented himself from failure many times over, with bluster, brio and a willingness to try just about anything to make money, as long as he didn't have to wear a suit to work.
Here is how Mr. Boss talks: "I've been to Fidel. Fidel knows who I am."
Quizzical eyebrow.
"It's Dec. 20, 1998, and I'm in Havana at a synagogue Hanukkah party and Fidel walks in," to address the congregation, it turns out, during which Mr. Castro happens to shake Mr. Boss's hand.
But within the bluster are nuggets of bluntness: "It's 1969, I'm living on the Lower East Side" -- which had a sizable Eastern European population -- "and I'm seeing hand-crocheted peasant blouses from the Ukraine and Poland. I decide to knock them off." The young Mr. Boss, armed with an economics degree from City College and a talented girlfriend, imitates the design, starts a sweatshop, makes a burst of money, and then gets muscled out of the garment district and loses everything.
MORE adventures of the flea king, recounted at his Cuban art and ephemera-filled Chelsea office, which houses his latest gamble:
After blouses, an East Village macrobiotic restaurant with a Japanese friend: "I was the do guy, he was the cook guy. But I had a short attention span."
Next, hauling furniture with a moving van, till his back gave out.
Next, managing a fruit and vegetable stand.
Next, a failed attempt at an antiques market under the Brooklyn Bridge.
By now, Mr. Boss is in his late 30's, a bachelor still, annoyed he hasn't shown his worried family and the world that his restless nuttiness and entrepreneurial zeal will amount to something. He's coming home at 5 A.M. -- hey, it's the 70's -- to his loft on the Avenue of the Americas at 24th Street just as the flower vendors arrive. He looks up the avenue and notices the vacant parking lots. He thinks. He talks. He rents one for $75 for a Sunday.
"We started with 11 vendors and, with my great marketing abilities, we attracted at least 9 or 10 customers," Mr. Boss says.
It took several years for the shoppers and antiques vendors to bond, and a few more for the markets to become, despite the rezoning and development of Chelsea, a tour book stop, with three lots, an indoor garage and, soon, several storefronts.
"I'm there almost every Sunday," Mr. Boss says. "I've seen Brooke Shields, Gloria Vanderbilt, Goldie Hawn, Barbra Streisand, Matt Dillon and Queen Sofia of Spain. Michael Jackson has been there. Catherine Deneuve is a regular." (Remember the Fidel factor. Discount accordingly.) Nearly five years ago, Mr. Boss was the logical choice when the M.T.A. sought a coordinator for a vendor market outside the Coliseum.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Boss has restored antique furniture and now collects Plains Indians artifacts and 18th-century Japanese ceramics. His relationship with his good friend Fidel dates to the late 50's when, as a lifeguard in a Borscht Belt hotel, Mr. Boss heard a Cuban dance band and become a lifelong collector of the music.
The treasure hunt business has been very good to him. This year, he plowed $2 million of his and the bank's money into 30,000 square feet of raw space in a Chelsea loft building, which he rents for conferences and events.
When he was 46, he decided he had earned enough money and had enough therapy, so he allowed himself to marry Annette Kurek, a former actress who collects angels and reads everything about Robert E. Lee. The couple adopted two children from India and live in Park Slope.
Mr. Boss pronounces himself pleased at last. "I'm a New York boy," he says. "I learned how to survive. I even survived myself."

HEADLINE: Passivity Is the Word On Year 2000 Marketing;
Most Big Companies Playing It Low Key

SERIES: COUNTING TO 2000: The soft sell

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Considering the once-in-a-millennium marketing opportunity that potential Year 2000 computer malfunctions present, the nation's large manufacturers and retailers of consumer products -- even many that stand to benefit from fears of disruption -- have been remarkably restrained.
"We are not going to exploit this," said William J. Spain, a senior vice president for public affairs at Del Monte, the largest producer of canned fruits and vegetables. "We don't think that's responsible." 
Even companies that have enjoyed soaring demand from the limited ranks of consumers who appear to be stockpiling goods in advance of what many now refer to as Y2K have been strikingly passive.
"We have never mentioned Y2K on our Web site or in marketing letters," said David R. Kauntarich, president of Crown Point, a packager of ready-to-eat meals in Mullins, S.C., whose main customer is the United States military. Mr. Kauntarich said he was happy to see commercial sales for Crown Point, which is part of the Unaka Corporation, rocket up from an average of about 7,000 cases a month to a peak of 42,000 in March, mostly on the strength of Year 2000 advertising by independent distributors. But he did nothing to try to reverse the subsequent slide back to the current level of about 12,000.
"We don't want people to say we were fanning the flames, and I don't want to be labeled as a Y2K product," Mr. Kauntarich said.
To be sure, legions of entrepreneurs at the fringe of the economy have avidly promoted products like dried foods and home power generators that might help people through potential disruptions. And a few subsidiaries of major companies have been aggressively trying to persuade consumers -- or at least the retailers that sell to them -- that the potential for Year 2000 disruptions justifies loading up on their wares.
"Y2K is a marketers' dream, an opportunity created by the media and a date change," said Edward C. Brice, director of business development for Sony Media Solutions, a unit of the Sony Corporation that is based in Oradell, N.J., and makes data storage products. Mr. Brice says he has been working with wholesalers and retailers to "get Y2K on people's minds."
And in recent weeks, some big names like Staples Inc., the nation's largest office supply chain, and the Eveready Battery Company, the Ralston Purina unit that makes Eveready and Energizer batteries, have begun promotional campaigns highlighting how their services and products can help protect consumers from Year 2000 troubles.
Such steps are still unusual, though, and most companies with Y2K-linked promotions have been careful to make it clear that they are not predicting how the transition to next year will unfold.
Among those taking this low-key approach is Giant Food, a supermarket chain that serves the Washington and Baltimore areas. The company, a subsidiary of the Dutch supermarket giant Royal Ahold, has sponsored radio messages proclaiming its readiness for Year 2000 and is providing customers with lists of items the American Red Cross recommends for Y2K preparedness, like batteries and bottled water for use in the event of utility failures.
"We're not telling people to buy it now, but, if you're worried, it's available," said Barry S. Scher, Giant Food's spokesman.
The Year 2000 problem stems from the inability of many computers to handle year 2000 dates. Preparedness advocates argue that an accumulation of foul-ups, most of them tiny, could shut down some crucial services like electrical power and gum up others next year. The risk of last-minute panic buying, these advocates say, increases as major companies shun aggressive marketing of products that consumers might want in the event of shutdowns.
"People aren't going to panic if they are prepared," said Paloma O'Riley, a preparedness advocate based in Louisville, Colo. Consumers are more likely to stock up gradually and sensibly if retailers raise Y2K awareness, she said.
Perhaps, but there is scant evidence of that so far. The Hannaford Brothers Company, which has 155 supermarkets from South Carolina to Maine, began adding inventories of items on the Red Cross preparedness list this summer and displaying them at the ends of aisles with preparedness information.
"It came in handy when Hurricane Floyd hit," said William L. Homa, Hannaford's chief information officer. But aside from the run on such items in the North Carolina stores when the storm struck last month, sales of such items have not significantly increased.
That could change if the number of reported computer failures involving dates rises noticeably this fall, a development that consultants like the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., say is likely.
For now, even though many companies are preparing contingency plans for serious disruptions, betting on such trouble looks like a no-win situation to many corporate marketers. Most agree with the Government's current view that the computer date problems are unlikely to produce more than minor, short-lived problems around most of the country. That makes pushing the sale of preparedness products seem like a high-risk strategy.
The risks are partly a matter of corporate reputation. If a last-minute wave of panic leads to food hoarding, runs on banks or other chaotic behavior, companies with advertising programs reinforcing the climate of fear will be branded as reckless and greedy. And consumers faced with bare shelves might focus their blame on companies that had advertised themselves as sellers of Year 2000 preparedness.
Many companies say that financial considerations also point to a cautious approach. Consumers may well stay calm and leave merchants who fill their shelves with Year 2000 goods choked with inventory at the end of December, when taxes on everything they own are calculated. And most retailers do not want to do anything that adds to the seasonal problems of handling Christmas exchanges.
"What if customers load up on Y2K merchandise in December and then bring it back in January?" said Janice R. Drummond, a spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck.
Sears recently began telling purchasers of home generators that they will have to pay a "restocking fee" of 20 percent of the sale price if they return the generators next year.
Returns are a major concern for smaller retailers. McGuckin Hardware, a family-owned store in Boulder, Colo., has sold several hundred kerosene heaters so far this year, up from just a handful two years ago. The heaters and other big-ticket Y2K items like generators carry "no refund, no return" stickers.
"There is no way I can take hundreds of heaters back," said Harry Ransom, the assistant store manager in charge of McGuckin's Y2K program. The store has set aside a Y2K section with ready-to-eat foods, heating and lighting equipment and even theme T-shirts.
Reluctance to exploit Y2K fears does not mean that retailers and manufacturers have not thought long and hard about how consumer behavior might change as the rollover approaches.
Some are taking the approach of banks, which have made arrangements to refill automated teller machines more quickly than usual if consumers begin withdrawing large amounts of cash as the New Year weekend approaches.
The bottled-water businesses of Nestle, including brands like Perrier and Poland Spring, have begun increasing production and shipments to handle post-Christmas sales that some in the industry expect to surge 25 percent, to peak summer levels. But a rival, Groupe Danone, maker of Evian, is still searching for signs that such a demand spike is coming.
"Behavior assumptions can be very tricky," said Michael J. Neuwirth, a spokesman for Danone's North American water operations.
Wall Street is certainly not expecting any spectacular financial returns as a result of Y2K-inspired consumer-goods purchases. The industry leaders for many of the products on popular preparedness lists are units of large, diversified multinationals. A major jump in end-of-year disposable diaper sales, for example, would not move the Procter & Gamble battleship much. The same might be said of the Gillette Company and its Duracell batteries or Eli Lilly & Company and insulin for diabetics. In addition, analysts expect that most of the extra purchases in 1999 will reduce demand for such products early next year.
Still, some major companies are beginning to back modest marketing efforts. Last month, Staples announced a program for both Y2K preparations and "sound record-keeping practice at the end of every year." Staples, which is based in Framingham, Mass., is waiving fees through Dec. 31 for downloading and reading computer files that small- business owners and home office workers send to its copy centers for backup.
And Eveready recently sponsored advertising inserts in newspapers to start an $11 million campaign highlighting the advice by the American Red Cross to set aside three days' to a week's worth of supplies -- including batteries -- for Y2K, treating it like a major storm. It is also donating $100,000 worth of batteries to local Red Cross units.
The working assumption for most merchants is that any surge will begin after Thanksgiving and hit hardest after Christmas. A few companies say they are gearing up already to court such business. The 7-Eleven Company, which normally runs monthlong advertising promotions for its 5,000 stores, is currently leaning toward introducing banners promoting Y2K preparedness products along with its New Year's party goods on Dec. 26. It has also added Sony Walkman radios to its inventory in part because portable radios are on most Y2K preparation lists.
"It's a great opportunity to deliver on our promise of convenience," said Margaret A. Chabris, a spokeswoman for the company.
Much of the planning is mere guesswork, though. After all, American business has little incentive to do much research.
"There's no ongoing return for learning how to do this," said Robert C. Blattberg, a marketing professor in the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. "It's a one-time event."

HEADLINE: A Tolerant and Inclusive Muslim Tradition Thrives

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The election of Indonesia's most important Muslim religious leader as its first democratically chosen President was welcomed today by Western Governments and human rights advocates. They describe the new leader as a champion of human rights and religious tolerance.
Islam as practiced by the new President -- Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of what amounts to the largest Muslim political party in Indonesia -- is a faith in which religious and cultural differences between neighbors are carefully respected and in which free speech is a right. 
 His rise to power puts human rights groups in an unusual -- and, they said, welcome -- position, greeting the rise of a foreign religious leader.
Human rights advocates often cringe when religious leaders control a government, fearing the intolerance of Muslim-governed nations like Iran or Afghanistan or recalling the first months after Hindu nationalists took office last year in India and were accused of orchestrating violence against Muslims and Christians.
"This is going to be very important in terms of showing the rest of the world such a tolerant Muslim leader," said an Indonesia specialist, Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch.
Although she is critical of some of Mr. Wahid's alliances, Ms. Jones said that he "has personally been a staunch defender of human rights" and that his election begins "an experiment to see whether an overwhelmingly Muslim country can be a true democracy."
"People despair of that ever happening," she said. "Maybe Indonesia will be the first."
With 220 million people, 90 percent of whom describe themselves as Muslim, Indonesia is home to more followers of Islam than the Middle East.
The faith found its way to Indonesia beginning in the 13th century aboard the trading ships from the Indian subcontinent. Islam was not forced on the population, and it did not replace traditional Indonesian spirit worship and mysticism. Rather, it was layered on Hindu and Buddhist practices.
For most Indonesians, the fact that they are Muslims is just one element of their identity, and not necessarily the first to come to mind.
"Islam in Indonesia has never been an extreme orthodoxy," said James Clad, a professor of Southeast Asian politics at Georgetown University who recently returned from Indonesia. "It's a religion there that has been in tune with traditions that are open to tolerance and a willingness to disagree. Broadly speaking, this is a place where Islamic fundamentalism finds the soil pretty thin."
When Muslim political parties were first formed in Indonesia early this century, few called for an Islamic state. Instead, historians say, they reflected a desire to defend their basic political and economic rights from encroachments by the Dutch colonialists.
When Indonesia won its independence in 1949, its Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion, and Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity are widely and openly practiced.
In recent decades, no one has been a more important champion of religious and cultural tolerance than Mr. Wahid, leader of the Council of Islamic Scholars.
In the 80's and early 90's, Mr. Wahid was outspoken in his condemnation of human rights abuses by the Indonesian Army in East Timor.
"The richness of Indonesia, its diversity, is also its weakness," he said in an interview in 1993. "Look at what has happened in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. That's what I'm afraid of in Indonesia -- disintegration."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrowed in August as Exports Grew

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Reflecting some long-awaited gains from economic recovery abroad, the huge American trade deficit narrowed in August for the first time in four months as exports rose faster than imports.
Financial markets reacted calmly to yesterday's Government report, a sharp contrast to the previous month, when currency and bond markets fell after the Commerce Department reported a large increase in the trade gap at a time when Japanese authorities were doing little to reverse a worrisome rise in the yen. Indeed, indications that the trade gap may no longer be widening appear to have contributed to a powerful rally in stocks. 
 The latest tally showed a gap between exports and imports of $24.1 billion, down from $24.9 billion in July.
With economies in Asia, Latin America and Europe on the mend, demand for American exports of goods and services is finally improving. But some experts worry that such gains will only further stoke a United States economy that is already operating at a pace that leaves the Federal Reserve nervous about revived inflation.
"This confirms that economic growth overseas is taking hold," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis. Noting a near-doubling of American exports of aircraft, he added, "Asian airlines are buying again because their traffic has built tremendously."
At the same time, however, the United States deficit with China soared to $6.9 billion, the largest ever with any country, from $6.3 billion in July.
This prompted a fresh expression of unhappiness in Washington, where support for China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization seem to be fading. "U.S.-China trade remains a troubling story," William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, said yesterday.
American imports from China exceeded exports by an additional $6 billion so far this year compared with the similar period in 1998. Mr. Daley said that at talks set in Seattle next month he would keep pressing the Chinese to remove obstacles to American companies seeking to do business there.
"Everywhere you look, you see stuff made in China," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Securities, adding that the primary "culprit" causing the widening of the nation's trade imbalance in previous months was recession in Asia rather than any lack of competitiveness on the part of American business, as was the case in the 1980's.
The Government's statistics on trade between individual countries, which are not adjusted for normal seasonal variation, also showed that the deficit with Japan shrank in August to $6.4 billion, from $6.8 billion in July.
Over all, the report showed, exports climbed $2.9 billion in August, to $82 billion, while imports rose $2.1 billion, to $106.1 billion. That reduced the trade gap $800 million, with July's gap, upon revision, moderately lower than first reported.
This was the eighth consecutive monthly rise in imports, reflecting the continued domestic boom and by far the largest of three consecutive gains in exports.
"We're starting to see evidence of global healing," Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, said.
Still, while encouraged by rising exports, he said the trade deficit could easily expand again in coming months since exports must grow 30 percent faster than imports at current levels merely to keep it steady.
James E. Annable, chief economist at Wingspanbank.com, also expressed concern about the impact of American consumers' strong demand for foreign goods. If this doesn't subside, he said, the deficit could swell enough that the dollar would weaken, tending to bring inflation, higher interest rates or both.
For now, though, the deficit raises far fewer alarms than it did in the 1980's; it is less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, about half a percentage point less than a decade ago.
That is largely because American industry is making immense investments in new equipment that should raise productivity. Moreover, consumers are likely to slow spending since rising interest rates have nearly ended home refinancings which, along with the stock market, had helped fuel the current binge.
"We're not in the worst of all worlds yet," Mr. Annable said.
The United States's trade deficit with Canada, muddied by border-area production for tax reasons and other issues, climbed to $3.5 billion in August, from $3.1 billion while the deficit with Mexico was essentially unchanged at $2.2 billion. The American deficit with Western Europe narrowed to $4.4 billion, from $6.1 billion.
For the industrialized countries of the Far East -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- the gap shrank to $1.7 billion, from $2.5 billion.
The biggest rise in imports in August was for industrial supplies and materials -- mainly crude petroleum that has risen sharply in price this year. Petroleum imports rose to $5 billion, from $4.44 billion in July as the price for a barrel jumped to $17.40, the highest level since March 1997.

Ventures Feed The Pleasures Of Indolence

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
IF you are a New Yorker whose favorite cooking appliance is the telephone, or if you can't make it as far as the corner to pick up your dry cleaning, then you are already part of what Ross Stevens calls the city's "delivery culture." But your indolent pleasures have only just begun.
Suppose that one evening you are overcome with the urge to watch "This Is Spinal Tap" accompanied by popcorn and soda, or to read E. B. White's "This Is New York" while eating ice cream and listening to Marc Anthony's latest CD. With one phone call or a few clicks of a mouse, you can have it all delivered within an hour for no more than you'd spend if you schlepped to all the stores. 
 You can order directly from kozmo.com, a company in Greenwich Village that started last year and now sends its blue-uniformed messengers on several thousand deliveries a day from its two warehouses in Manhattan. Operating from 10 A.M. until 1 A.M., the messengers go out on bikes and motor scooters to rent videos and sell books, CD's, magazines, Krispy Kreme doughnuts and assorted other snacks.
Or you can order from Dr. Stevens's new company, urbanfetch.com, which started delivering last weekend throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights. Besides matching kozmo.com's guarantee of delivery within an hour, urbanfetch.com is offering round-the-clock service and a revolutionary innovation: delivery guys who refuse tips.
That might sound incredible -- I stood dumbfounded in the doorway the first time the green-uniformed courier waved away the cash and said, "No, the tips are already built into my salary" -- but after three tests I have yet to find an urbanfetch.com courier who can be bribed. There may be no free lunch, but there does seem to be free delivery -- and free pickup, too, when you're finished with the video.
"There are such efficiencies in our business that we can afford to pay our couriers well above the market wages," said Dr. Stevens, a former hedge fund manager with a doctorate in finance and statistics. "We've eliminated tipping because it's a source of anxiety -- how much do I tip the guy? -- and it can be a significant extra expense if all you're ordering is a $4 movie rental and a Coke."
Both companies are touting their large inventories -- hundreds of magazines, thousands of books and CD's, more than 15,000 movies -- and frantically expanding their offerings. Soon, they promise, their couriers will be delivering sandwiches, liquor, flowers, medicines, toiletries, and electronic items ranging from Palm Pilots to VCR's. They expect a brisk demand for emergency gifts wrapped and delivered within an hour.
"In our research with focus groups," Dr. Stevens said, "the number one word that was used by New Yorkers to describe their lives was 'hectic.' The New York spirit was summed up by one woman in a sentence: 'If I could get everything delivered, I would.' "
MR. PARK, a former investment banker, came up with the idea for kozmo.com (named for the "Seinfeld" character) from his own frustration at waiting for books from Amazon.com. "Our business marries the economic advantages of Amazon.com with the instant gratification of local commerce," he said. "We're the Polaroid of E-commerce."
Although he and Dr. Stevens don't claim to be making money yet, they both insist that they can provide free instant delivery while still operating more cheaply than traditional stores. "Unlike a brick-and-mortar retailer, we don't have to pay to be in lots of prime real estate locations," Dr. Stevens said. "We can serve all Manhattan and Brooklyn from two locations. And we can fit the inventory of a Virgin megastore in a warehouse one-hundredth the area."
But how does it get from a shelf in the warehouse to someone's door so quickly? Neither Dr. Stevens nor Mr. Park will say. They won't even disclose where their warehouses are.
"It's basically a localized same-day Fed-Ex system," Mr. Park said. "Everything is tied to the integrated data pipeline connected to the Web."
Dr. Stevens puts it just as opaquely: "We have a hub-and-spoke network. The heavy lifting in this business is in designing the internal fulfillment and external distribution systems, and ours is proprietary. We have heavy-duty algorithms that route orders in optimal fashion."
Whatever that means, it seems to work in less than an hour.

HEADLINE: A New Inflexibilityin Overhauling U.S. Financial Laws

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
After more than 20 years of battles, truces and unholy alliances over legislation to reshape the nation's financial system, the measure's fate rests on what has turned into a bitter and perhaps symbolic political fight between President Clinton and Senator Phil Gramm.
More than seven hours of negotiations today involving Mr. Gramm, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, and Gene Sperling, the President's top economic adviser, inched closer to a resolution. But the talks failed to yield agreement on the proposed legislation's effect on a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending. 
 Tonight the Treasury Department issued a statement indicating that the negotiations had broken down. The statement said, "No proposal has yet been put forward that the President can accept." It also said that the legislation was deficient because it permitted banks to expand into new areas of business even if they had poor records of making loans to the disadvantaged.
The statement, and an earlier one by Mr. Gramm, suggested that the two sides had begun to harden their stances over the merits and shortcomings of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. As a result, legislative prospects for overhauling the banking system have begun to fade.
Both sides seem to recognize political benefits in standing firm as the 2000 election cycle begins, even as the most powerful financial interests in the country clamor for a new law. Mr. Gramm and other Republicans would undoubtedly blame the White House for failing to approve a bill long sought by Wall Street and corporate America. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore might similarly assail the Republicans, accusing them of retarding decades of progress in civil rights.
"When symbolic politics begins to get elevated, it gets harder to make a deal," said a Democratic Senator who wants to see the financial overhaul measure signed into law.
Lobbyists who champion the legislation agreed. "If there is not a bill," said Paul A. Equale, a lobbyist for the Independent Insurance Agents of America, "it will be because the White House and the Treasury Department feel very strongly about the Community Reinvestment Act, and Senator Gramm feels equally strongly, and both sides think they will win the White House next term and can get a better bill."
Already today, there was talk on both sides that foreshadowed what may be to come. "The array of anti-minority sentiment expressed almost each week now by Republicans is historic," said Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, citing Mr. Gramm's view on the Community Reinvestment Act, among other things. "I have never seen a party become this defiant when it comes to protecting minority rights in my time in public life."
The political parties exchanged accusations over race as these related to several issues. Page A18.
Mr. Gramm said that "in the end the Administration has to decide if they want a bill or not."
"It may be that we have to wait 15 months for a new Administration to approve this bill," he said.
The long history of the banking legislation has read like a plot line from "The Perils of Pauline," and it is impossible to accurately handicap the outcome of the negotiations.
For years, efforts to overhaul the financial system failed in Congress because three of Washington's most powerful lobbying interests -- banks, insurers and securities firms -- were at war, each pressing to defeat the interests of others. Their efforts led to many stalemates, but ultimately the three became allies, as the distinctions between the financial products they offered began to blur.
Still, the prospects for the legislation remained dim because of a turf war between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve over which agency should oversee the new financial conglomerates. Last week, the Fed and the Treasury reached an agreement to share that authority, and the mood brightened considerably among advocates for wholesale change in the 66 years worth of laws that have made it difficult for banks to expand into securities and insurance.
Now, the partisan fight remains between Democrats and Republicans over the meaning of community lending and the philosophy behind the Community Reinvestment Act, a law intended to eradicate red-lining and other forms of economic discrimination.
While the provisions under debate apply to relatively obscure elements of the act, they are powerfully symbolic, affecting core constituencies of both parties. Mr. Gramm has repeatedly criticized the way regulators have interpreted the act, saying that the Government should not be in the business of "reallocating capital" and that the law imposes unnecessary and burdensome requirements on small banks and savings associations.
His critics say that the Financial Services Act of 1999, as his bill is called, would roll back the Community Reinvestment Act. Those critics include the Congressional Black Caucus, a group that helped save Mr. Clinton's Presidency during the Senate trial proceedings early this year.
There were fresh signs today that Democrats and Republicans were hardening their views. Nine Republicans sent a letter to Mr. Gramm urging him to hold the line and not make any significant concessions on the issue. At the same time, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said in an interview that he was urging the White House to hold firm and that a compromise on the Community Reinvestment Act would undermine the President's commitment to raising capital in poor areas.
Some Democrats criticized the White House today, saying it had caved in to industry pressure by abandoning the fight to put provisions in the legislation that would make it harder for financial conglomerates to share confidential customer information with other businesses and telemarketers.
"They inexplicably pulled the rug out from underneath us," said Senator Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, who had been leading an effort in the Senate for provisions that would have strengthened the privacy-protection elements of the legislation.

HEADLINE: In America;
Bradley's Poverty Push

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Bill Bradley, eschewing small themes in favor of a grander vision of America, will argue today, at a speech in Brooklyn, that the United States has a moral obligation to do what it can to lift as many children as possible from the punishing confines of poverty.
"We are in a time of unprecedented prosperity," he said in an interview, "and yet there are still nearly 14 million children who live in poverty. I think there is a broad consensus that we need to change that." 
 Mr. Bradley said he planned to "lay out a broad goal to reduce child poverty by a specific amount at a specific time." And he will detail what he described as the initial steps, or "down payment," needed to move toward that goal.
The speech is scheduled for this morning at the Concord Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant. And like his proposal to make health care available to virtually all uninsured Americans, and his insistence that a Bradley administration would work constantly to break down racial barriers, his approach to child poverty appears to be far more ambitious than the terminally incremental initiatives that have plagued the country since the Clinton health plan imploded.
Mr. Bradley said his speech would address the following: "How do we increase income for people who are poor? How do we provide child care for people who are poor? How do we generate hope in the lives of people who have had very little hope in their lives?"
This antipoverty initiative is linked both literally and symbolically to Mr. Bradley's desire to forge a more tolerant and unified society. He noted that 36 percent of the poor children in the U.S. are white, about 30 percent are black, and 22 percent are Latino. "What I see as a possibility," he said, "is a multiracial coalition that would rekindle the same kind of purposefulness as the civil rights revolution in the 1960's."
Most politicians have run like rabbits from that kind of talk. Grand visions, idealism, kind words about the 60's -- all have been anathema in the 90's. But Mr. Bradley, quietly, almost serenely, has been saying the nation is ready once again to assert its better self.
"I think we still have a lot of catching up to do in terms of our commitments to each other and our commitments to children who are poor," he said.
Mr. Bradley acknowledged that inroads against poverty had been made as the economy has improved over the past few years, but he said that was not enough.
"Poverty dropped, I think, 1 percent last year," he said. "I'd rather have that happen than not happen. But it is still higher than it was in 1989 and far higher than it was in 1970."
Mr. Bradley voted against the so-called welfare reform legislation that Bill Clinton signed into law in 1996. "I didn't think the federal government should cut off its commitment to individual children who are poor," he said, adding, "I didn't think the answer to the problem of children in poverty was to have a group of federal politicians take a pot of money and send it to the state politicians and say, 'Handle this problem as best you can.' "
Mr. Bradley said some of the more objectionable aspects of the law had been modified, but more changes were needed.
The Bradley campaign has been on a roll lately. He has raised more money than expected, is doing better in the polls than expected, and is planning a Madison Square Garden fund-raiser for mid-November that will feature many of his big-name pals from professional basketball.
The campaign of Vice President Al Gore has been thrown on the defensive, and Mr. Gore has been insisting he is now the underdog. I asked Mr. Bradley for his view. He laughed and said: "I'm running against entrenched power. Anytime someone has the support of the President of the United States, who is loyal to you because you've been loyal to him; anytime someone has essentially the Democratic National Committee and its leadership; anytime somebody has all the big Democratic fund-raisers; anytime somebody arrives in Air Force 2 -- that's entrenched power.
"What I have are the people. And what I have is going out and telling them what I want to do, and what I believe -- and just trying to be who I am. And I think up to now, that's why we're making progress."

HEADLINE: Fearing Isolation in Old Age, Gay Generation Seeks Haven

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 20

 BODY:
David Krongelb, a Fort Lauderdale businessman, came out of the closet in his 20's and believed that the door would never close on him again. He is 50 now, and wonders if he will need that secret place once more when he grows old.
"When you're old," he said, "the last thing that you want to do is to have to hide." 
 Many Americans who, like Mr. Krongelb, have lived openly as homosexuals well into middle age are now worried that discrimination will have them retreating into secrecy if they enter retirement communities or nursing homes. As independent adults, they have been able to pick their neighbors; as aged people needing care, their choices would be limited. And where many have been able to defy bias and so lead prosperous and rewarding lives, they wonder whether their strength in old age will allow them to continue doing so, and even whether they will be denied adequate care if their orientation is known.
Now, as the first openly gay generation grows grayer and contemplates retirement, developers around the country are planning retirement communities and assisted-care complexes marketed specifically to homosexuals, places that will allow them to grow old surrounded by other homosexuals, where they do not have to live, and ultimately die, amid lingering condemnation.
In Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta and other cities, these developers -- many of them gay themselves, who have their own fears of old age -- are promising a haven for those who will become old and infirm, frequently without the support of children or other relatives.
For gay men in particular, the ones who have lived into middle age with the stigma of AIDS and talk of shortened lives, the idea of living too long once seemed novel. But homosexuals and lesbians around the country say retirement has been dinner-table conversation for the last few years, and the talk is growing more urgent as they grow older.
"We always ask, 'What are we going to do?' " said Jeffrey Dillon, 37, who, along with another gay man, John DeLeo, 54, is developing a 270-unit assisted-care high-rise in downtown Fort Lauderdale.
Mr. DeLeo and Mr. Dillon envision a community where gay couples can live together in peace, where loneliness can be staved off and the residents insulated from the meanness outside.
Scott Schieman, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Miami, who specializes in aging, said such developments could become more than just places to grow old among people with similar pasts and similar stories.
"What defines later life for gays?" Mr. Schieman said. "Many of them have not formed any kind of nest."
"Gay men in particular," he said, "saw a truncated life," because of AIDS, and spoke more of dying young than of growing old. "They deal with a lot of loss, loss of partners, and loss of friends."
The survivors often find themselves with an isolation that is complete, or almost so, when they finally enter retirement homes for the general population.
Of the gay-only retirement developments, Mr. Schieman said, "Here, you have a new form of self-segregation." But it is one many homosexuals say they would find far preferable to fighting old battles -- or hiding -- amid a colony of elderly strangers.
One woman who has hidden is Evelyn Kinser, a 76-year-old resident of a Los Angeles retirement home. Her life now, she says, is like being a girl again, made to feel ashamed again.
"A sad world to live in," she said.
Ms. Kinser came out when she was 12, a pioneer of sorts. Like Mr. Krongelb, she thought she was out for good. But now, living in the home for the elderly, she hides her sexual orientation, out of fear that she will be ridiculed or isolated.
"This is a hard way to live, having to be someone you're not," she said. "I don't talk to my neighbors about much of anything. Except sports. That's a safe topic."
Although Ms. Kinser has never told other residents of the home that she is a lesbian, she knows that they know she is different.
"I've seen that look in their eye," she said.
Even friends who give her that look are better than no friends, and so she remains quiet. But she is tired of doing so.
"I'm closeted again," she said. "I hate it."
Advocates of special housing for elderly homosexuals cite a number of incidents as evidence of a need for it. In 1996, for instance, a lesbian couple who had shared a home for years were forbidden to stay together in an assisted-living center in Northern California, said Doni Gewirtzman of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the gay rights group.
And some years back, a nursing home employee refused to give a resident a bath after learning that she was a lesbian, according to the New York chapter of Senior Action in a Gay Environment.
"It's very daunting, especially for those people who have been out a long time," said Sandy Warshaw, director of policy education and community outreach for that organization.
Max Weatherly, 78, lives in public housing in Delray Beach, Fla., amid neighbors who are not unkind to him but with whom he has little in common. To him, a self-contained, gay-only retirement home would be a utopia.
"People like my grandfather told me I would turn out to be no good," Mr. Weatherly said. "I would play the piano and read books, but they thought I was a sissy because I couldn't get on a horse."
He would like to spend his last years among people who nod their heads in understanding when they hear that story.
It is not unusual for a homosexual to walk the corridors of a nursing home or an assisted-living center and find himself, even among so many people, completely alone, said Veronica St. Claire, chief executive of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Retiring Persons, in Los Angeles.
Ms. St. Claire knows one man -- a retired teacher who developed Parkinson's disease -- who went to live in an assisted-care home and found that he was the only gay man there.
"He can't have his books out," she said, "or his magazines. He felt his care would be compromised if they knew."
But while homosexuals his age see special retirement housing as something akin to a dream, those of the baby-boomer generation will demand that kind of retirement, some experts say.
"They're the first to come forward," as a generation with an openly gay life style, said Stephen Golant, a gerontologist at the University of Florida.
And those who helped create thriving gay communities in American cities will insist on living that way, if at a somewhat slower pace, in retirement, say developers in Boston, Fort Lauderdale and other cities.
"It's a healthy phenomenon," said Mr. Golant, who sees plans for the developments as proof that a generation of homosexuals have the social and economic power to carry it off.
"They're willing to define themselves as old and gay," he said. "These are big self-identity issues. They're saying: 'We're not afraid of who we are. I'm proud of who I am, and I'm going to stand by it.' "
The idea of creating communities specifically for gay people is really not new, said Mr. Dillon, one developer of the Fort Lauderdale high-rise. Rather, this is simply the first time the concept has been applied with older homosexuals in mind.
"Since we don't have big families, we tend to think of our friends as family, and our neighbors become our friends," he said. "So they become like our family. This way, we're surrounded by family."
Developers say they would not undertake such projects if they did not think they could sell the resulting residences, and they have certainly been undertaking them.
In Boston, for instance, there are plans for gay retirement residences, in or near the city's downtown section, that will be called the Stonewall Communities -- named for the gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village where clashes with the police in 1969 generally marks the beginning of the modern gay rights movement.
And the Gay and Lesbian Association of Retiring Persons, the Los Angeles group, is in the process of financing and designing a retirement community on 19 acres near Palm Springs that, like the high-rise in Fort Lauderdale, will offer both assisted living and nursing care. Another feature: vistas of the Santa Rosa Mountains.
In Fort Lauderdale, the project is past the planning stage, and awaiting financing. If the financing continues on schedule -- Mr. DeLeo said he did not expect any problem -- then construction, estimated to cost $40 million to $60 million, should begin within the coming year.
Living there will not be cheap. Buyers will pay $235,000 or more for one- and two-bedroom apartments, and a monthly fee of $2,000 to $4,000, depending, Mr. DeLeo and Mr. Dillon said, on how much care the resident needs.
Besides a nursing staff and in-house health care, the high-rise will have its own theater, where independent films could debut; its own art gallery; a market with specialty foods, and restaurants. The developers say it will be the first of many, and plan others in Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They picked Fort Lauderdale to be first, they say, because it has a history as a gay-friendly city.
"Some people will support it, some people will oppose it," said Mayor Jim Knaugle. "I think it could be a successful project."
Jack Latona, a Fort Lauderdale city commissioner, said he doubted that the construction would become an issue. "We have a substantial gay community that is well received," Mr. Latona said.
But would not a retirement community intended specifically for homosexuals be guilty of unlawful exclusion?
The developers say not: while it is designed with homosexuals in mind, they say, it will be open to anyone.
It makes sense that any straight people who want to live in a place intended mostly for homosexuals would not be the kind to be hurtful. They would just be neighbors.
"There will always be homophobes out there," Mr. Krongelb said. "But we've come too far to suffer like that again."

BIG WHOLESALE GROCERYOPERATION TO ELIMINATE JOBS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Fleming Companies, one of the biggest United States wholesale grocery operations, plans to cut 700 jobs, or almost 2 percent of its work force, to cut costs. Fleming, which has about 39,000 employees, said it would make the cuts the next 18 months as it centralizes its corporate functions in two national centers, in Dallas and Oklahoma City. The job cuts follow Fleming's announcement in January that it would cut 220 jobs, or 12 percent of its corporate staff, to streamline its business and improve profit margins. In December the company said it would take a $627 million charge to restructure. The shares of Fleming, based in Oklahoma City, rose $1.75, to $11.25. Fleming supplies about 3,000 supermarkets in 41 states and owns about 250 stores.

Dow Gains on Better-Than-Expected Microsoft Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks had their best day in almost seven weeks yesterday as better-than-expected earnings from the No. 1 software maker, Microsoft, led to gains in computer-related shares.
"Earnings are surprisingly strong, and it's been almost across the board," said Michael Manns, who helps manage $8 billion at American Express Asset Management in Minneapolis. "Microsoft put up extremely good numbers," giving people confidence that technology will provide leadership in the market, he said. 
 The Nasdaq composite index soared 99.87, or 3.7 percent, to 2,788.05, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 28.11, or 2.2 percent, to 1,289.43. Microsoft, the largest company by market value, contributed most to both gains, jumping 5 15/16, to 92 1/4; it was the most-active stock.
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 187.43, or 1.8 percent, to 10,392.36, led by I.B.M., which rose during the day in expectations of strong earnings, only to edge down 1/8 to 107 at the close and fall further in after-hours trading. The company warned of disappointments ahead.
All three indexes had their biggest gains since Sept. 3. Eight stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
The rally, which included the Dow's first three-day winning streak in more than two months, continued a rebound from last week, when signs of rising inflation sent the Dow and S.& P. 500 to their biggest weekly losses in a decade.
After the close, America Online reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of 14 cents a share, beating the consensus estimate by a penny. The stock of the company, an Internet access provider, rose 2 3/4, to 118.
Some 918 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, up from the three-month daily average of 760 million.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial expect third-quarter profit growth from the S.& P. 500 companies to be 20.7 percent, the largest gain since the second quarter of 1995.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation rose 4 11/16, to 75 13/16, after reporting third-quarter profit from operations of $1.37 a share, exceeding the $1.32 average estimate, on rising investment banking fees and trading revenue. Citigroup Inc., was up 1 5/16, to 46 1/4.
Computer Associates International, the country's No. 4 software maker, gained 3 3/4, to 58 1/4, after reporting that profit in the quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to 60 cents a share, compared with a 59-cent average expected by analysts.
Eli Lilly & Company sank 4 1/4, to 65 5/8, after the maker of the world's top-selling antidepressant, Prozac, said it made 62 cents a share, matching analysts' expectations. Lilly shares have dropped 21 percent this year as Prozac sales have fallen 13 percent.
The United Technologies Corporation, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average, gained 2 3/8, to 56, after a Merrill Lynch analyst, Jeanne Terrile, raised the company -- the world's No. 1 maker of air-conditioners and elevators-- to "buy" from "accumulate." She cited cost-cutting, improved management and better global growth.
Crossroads Systems Inc., which makes high-speed storage devices, more than quadrupled, rising 60 23/32 to 78 23/32, in its first day of trading. The company sold shares to the public for the first time yesterday at 18.
Tobacco stocks fell after a Florida appeals court ruled that Philip Morris and other tobacco companies could face a lump-sum damage award in a class-action lawsuit. Philip Morris fell 3 5/8, to 27; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. fell 3, to 22 15/16, and Loews declined 2 1/4, to 67 3/4.
In the Treasury market, bond prices rose for the first time in three sessions yesterday as the highest yields in two years enticed some investors.
"Yields are fairly attractive where they are now," said Roger Bayston, who oversees $10 billion in fixed-income debt at Franklin Templeton Group in San Mateo, Calif.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32, to 97 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.33 percent from 6.35 percent.
Gains were capped on concern that signs of growth and faster inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, perhaps as soon as next month.
"The Fed is going to have to tap the brakes," and that could result in further losses for bonds, said Thomas Donne, who handles $1.9 billion in fixed-income securities at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
Adding to investor concerns, a Government report showed that exports and imports rose to record levels in August, a further sign of growth that could lead to a Fed rate increase.

HEADLINE: Getting Power to the People: The North American Electricity Grid

BYLINE: By SALLY McGRANE

 BODY:
YOU go home, unlock the front door and flip a switch, and your hallway lights up.
 It may seem like a simple thing, turning on that 60-watt bulb. But that bulb is actually part of a web of generators, power lines and other people's bulbs that are interconnected in a complex electrical network known as the North American power grid. It stretches from one end of the United States to the other and includes parts of Canada and Mexico, with more than 700,000 miles of high-tension lines. 
 Within the grid are three interconnected divisions; within each one, the amount of electricity used must equal the amount of electricity produced at every given instant. Because the alternating current in your electrical lines travels at virtually the speed of light and cannot be stored, every time you turn on a reading lamp, a generator somewhere in the grid has to provide a tiny bit more power to the entire system.
 The electricity travels long distances over circuitous routes, following paths of least resistance. It's like the flow of traffic into a city: if one freeway is jammed, cars will use alternate routes.
 Take power shipped from Portland, Ore., to Los Angeles, for example: some 30 percent of that shipment will probably flow through Utah en route. Meanwhile in the East, if a Canadian hydropower plant is fueling someone's midnight repast in New York, the electricity could flow as far west as Ohio and as far south as Virginia -- nearly instantly -- before reaching the house where it is needed.
 If a lightning storm knocks out one line in the grid, or a generator stops working unexpectedly, the rest of the grid is affected. Other lines handle more power to make up for the downed line, or other generators work harder. Every part of the system is sensitive to changes in any other part of the system.
 While the system uses alternating current, or AC, the three divisions are connected by direct current, or DC, lines, which are easier to control. So in an emergency, power can be transferred from one connection to another, but power failures will not spread.
 The power grid has evolved over the last hundred years or more. Gene Gorzelnik, director of communications at the North American Electric Reliability Council, said that 138 "control areas" monitored the modern grid, using computer systems to predict energy flow and anticipate reactions to power failures.
 John Casazza, author of "The Development of Electric Power Transmission" (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 1993), remembers a simpler time. Mr. Casazza recalls working with an early analog computer, built in 1927, that used electric components to reproduce an electric system in miniature. Such early devices, each big enough to fill a large living room, were used until the 60's to simulate the impact of various events on the grid. In the 60's, electric companies switched to digital computers.
 The first commercial power plant opened in San Francisco in 1879. That was followed in 1882 by Thomas Edison's better known Pearl Street station in New York, which delivered electric power using DC lines. In 1893, AC lines were displayed at the Chicago World's Fair, and in 1896, AC lines delivered energy harnessed at Niagara Falls some 20 miles to Buffalo, setting today's AC-line standard.
 The latest change in the power system is deregulation, which has occurred in California and went into effect in the New York area this month. Instead of having a utility that owns the generator, transmission lines, substations and distribution lines, deregulation will result in separate ownership for various segments of the grid. Electric utilities bid for electricity from various generators in two auctions, one that happens the day before the power is scheduled to be used and another that happens an hour before.
 That requires very detailed monitoring, which in turn requires an advanced, complex system. Critics of deregulation, like Mr. Casazza, say that the complexity of the grid, compounded by a proliferation of auction data, will lead to an increase in the number of blackouts, like the infamous 1965 New York City blackout that left 30 million people in the Northeast and Canada without power and led to a Federal push for more reliable power.
 Professor Carl Blumstein, a research associate at the University of California's Energy Institute, said he doubted that the number of blackouts would increase with deregulation, but he added, "We'll just have to wait and see if there's a difference."

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "Flip That Switch, And a Generator Works A Little Harder"
The complex network that puts electricity where it needs to be -- and does it in less than a wink -- is a model of cooperation. Transformers are used throughout the grid to increase voltage for transmission over long distances or reduce it for local distribution.
 
THE GENERATOR
The most common types of electrical generators use coal, natural gas, oil, falling water or nuclear energy to produce electricity. But garbage and other waste products can also be burned to produce electrical energy, and generators can harness wind or solar power. Total generator output has to rise and fall to meet the total demands on the electric system, and a combination of types of generating units is used to match the demand. Economic considerations, environmental constraints and availability determine which units supply power at a given time. Different combinations of these power sources are most economical under different conditions, like the time of year. In the fall, for example, hydroelectric reservoirs tend to be depleted, so hydroelectric power is less readily available. Generators usually produce electricity at 7 kilovolts (a kilovolt is a thousand volts) to 25 kilovolts; transformers at the generators step up the voltage, to 60 kilovolts to 500 kilovolts, before sending the power into the grid.
 
TRANSMISSION SUBSTATION
Transmission substations act as way stations that link various lines for increased reliability. They can also step up the voltage again, depending on how far the electricity needs to travel.
 
TRANSMISSION LINES
High-tension lines are more efficient for transmitting power. Raising the voltage lowers the current, and since wires waste power in proportion to the square of the current, that results in less power loss. Even so, substantial amounts of power are lost over long-distance lines. (Those orange balls occasionally seen on high-tension lines, by the way, are to warn off aircraft.)
 
DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATION
At distribution substations, the electricity is stepped back down for customers, usually to between 12 kilovolts and 35 kilovolts, depending on how the individual system was designed.
 
DISTRIBUTION LINES
When the electricity is sent from a distribution line to a house, field transformers step down the power to 120-240 volts (the voltage that comes out of the plug in your wall). In commercial areas, the power may be stepped down to voltages higher than those for houses.
 
INSIDE A TRANSFORMER
A final step-down transformer, often located on a utility pole or in a vault under a city street, decreases the voltage to the 120-240 volts used in most homes. A transformer consists of two wires wound around a metal core. Power enters the first, or primary, coil and induces a magnetic field in the core, like an electromagnet. As the current alternates, the magnetic field reverses, creating an electric field that induces a current in the secondary coil. The ratio of the number of turns in the two coils determines the voltage change. If the secondary coil has half the turns of the primary, the voltage is stepped down by half; if it has twice the turns, the voltage is doubled.

HEADLINE: Castle First, Prince Later: Marketing to Ms.

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
THE words ring with romantic promise: "Evenings in front of the fireplace, and a morning jog along secluded pathways with familiar footsteps at my side. . . ."
No, it's not a personal ad. It's the come-on of a Colorado home builder making a sales pitch to single women. 
 So what if those familiar footsteps belong to the dog cuddling in the arms of a smiling, 20-something bachelorette. The message is clear: Why wait for your prince to come? You can afford a home now -- and "Woof! woof!" surely beats a husbandly whine.
Last month, Owens Corning Inc., a Chicago-based manufacturer of building materials, introduced a television ad campaign called "Siding Beauty" in which a damsel awakens after 100 years to find that the vinyl siding covering her palace has outlasted them all.
Subliminal message: Men may come and go, but good siding is hard to find.
These scenarios were not scripted by writers of "Sex and the City," but by savvy marketers trying to reckon with the fastest-growing buying force -- the single American woman.
The statistics are head-turners. Thanks to delayed marriages, profitable careers, higher divorce rates and longer lives, the number of women living alone has increased by more than a third in the last 15 years, to 30 million, according to the Census Bureau. Nearly 57 percent of single women now own their own homes, throwing cold dishwater on the accepted wisdom that homes are the exclusive territory of couples with children.
Most houses are still purchased by couples, but women living alone, or who are single heads of household, increased as a share of total home buyers, from 10 percent in 1985, to 15 percent in 1997. "That's a huge number, very dramatic," said Kermit Baker, an economist at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. For 1996 and 1997, single women outpaced single men in buying houses.
In the home-improvement arena, the weekend warrior is a she, taking on small fix-its that once fell to the now-vanishing handyman. At the Home Depot in Clifton, N.J., last week, Denise Ramos, 36, was carrying a bundle of uncut trim she needed to finish the porch of a new house she had bought three months ago for $133,000. To pay for the house, Ms. Ramos, who is divorced and has three children, holds down two jobs. "I wanted more space and a better life for my children and for myself," she said.
A half million people tune in weekly to PBS's "Handy Ma'am," starring Beverly DeJulio, a divorced mom and former dressmaker in Chicago. The magazine This Old House, a hammer-thumping bible for the mustard-stained T-shirt set, is undergoing its own renovation: a new editor, Donna Sapolin, wants to transform it into a guidebook for do-it-yourself lovebirds.
Remember when hardware stores sold tools packaged with pictures of scantily clad lovelies? Now, women in hard hats adorn the labels, women are likely to be buying the tools and women are often even running the stores. At Ace Hardware, the international chain, more and more women own or manage its stores.
With their "Siding Beauty" ad campaign, Owens Corning was acting on a company survey on the next generation's home ownership priorities; 70 percent of female respondents between ages 23 and 35 claimed owning a home was their highest priority, above buying a car and paying off debts.
"We have seen a tremendous shift in women's roles in home improvement over the last 20 years," said Jerry Oleshansky, the company's vice president of marketing. "Just like their baby boomer mothers, these Gen X and Gen Y women are taking a hands-on approach, doing everything from planning the project to buying the products and doing the actual work."
And that's changing the industry down to its subflooring. Eight years ago, Nancy Stoner, a divorced mother of two, tried to build a home for herself and her sons in Lexington, Ky., but was forced to give up her dream when financing fell through. "Back then, it felt like the way car dealers used to treat women by asking, 'So where's your husband?' " said Ms. Stoner, a 49-year old schoolteacher. "I couldn't go through with it."
Her father, who built several houses when she was growing up, inspired her to keep trying. Today, Ms. Stoner is customizing a $120,000 carriage house with Ball Homes of Lexington. She's removed walls between rooms, added bigger windows and requested a walk-out basement that works as a separate entrance for her boys, who are now in college.
"This time was a lot different," she said. "Everyone accepted me as I was, a single woman."
Donald Ball, the co-founder of Ball Homes, said about 30 percent of his business is selling to single women. "They seem to like our garden-type houses with the smaller backyards walled-in.," he said. "They like the security."
In Detroit, Bernard Glieberman, the president of Crosswinds Communities, called single women "probably the fastest growing segment of the buying public in the last five years." He said, "The only thing we can figure is that young males think they're invincible and don't bother much about living arrangements, while young women think, 'I need some security,' and buy a home."
While the company, which builds 700 houses a year, has sold frequently to single women, it does not create plans specifically for that market. "We haven't changed anything," Mr. Glieberman said.
It was the industry's impassive attitude -- acknowledging that single women are buying homes in droves, while not doing much to appease them -- that finally drove David Miles, a real estate consultant, to create his ad featuring the young woman with her trusty dog for McStain Enterprises of Denver.
"It is becoming obvious that single professional women have a different time line for their lives than men," he said. "As they begin to make more money and become self-sufficient, they're less willing to commit to relationships until they're very sure of themselves. But they still want that home." Builders have been slow to design specifically for single women, Mr. Miles contends, because "most builders are small local companies, and they don't understand who their customers are."
"They've only just figured out the market for empty-nesters," he continued. "They're going to need at least three to five years of media attention to get this trend."
The ad for McStain did the job, and then some. The company received calls not only from single women interested in buying, but also from men wanting to know if that girl really lived in that house because they'd like to meet her.
If builders are late to the party, home-store retailers are eager to get women on their dance card now. Research has told them that women make 50 percent of the purchases in the $30.2 billion hardware and home renovation industry. Taking note, Ace Hardware changed its motto from "The helpful handy guys" to "The helpful handy folks." Too subtle? They also added softer lighting, browser displays and hunter-green decor to stores, in place of bare concrete walls. Seminars for staff on how to relate to women customers have put Ace in touch with its inner handy gal, said Ann Marie Hickey, a spokeswoman at Ace headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill.
The nation's largest home improvement chain, Home Depot, has set out in earnest to woo women to the warehouse. In 1998, the company settled a blistering lawsuit, in which 7,000 of its female employees claimed discrimination in hiring, pay and promotions, and paid out $65 million. The company recently began Home Depot University, with seminars for renovation neophytes, from installing vinyl flooring to reroofing. About 50 percent of the student body are women, said John Simley, the chain's Northeast spokesman.
Though Mr. Simley said the store didn't carry gender-geared products, "we do carry Ralph Lauren paint," he admitted, adding, "I, as an ordinary guy, don't give two hoots about it, but a woman may respond to a name brand."
Marian Salzman, 40 and single, is a co-author, with Ira Matathia, of "Next: Trends for the Near-Future" (Overlook Press, 1999), a study that identified single women as a retailing force to reckon with on an international scale.
"Companies have traditionally only sold to single women in the woe-is-me category, with low-cal diets and single-portion meals, based on the idea that if a woman is not in a relationship, she must be doing everything possible to land one," said Ms. Salzman, a trend spotter for Young & Rubicam. "There's no celebration of the single woman as a satisfied consumer, who is buying not in a must-have mode but a would-like-to-have style," she added. "It's a very different situation, and we're going to see a lot of changes in the market place."
In the suburbs, where the handyman has disappeared from under the sink, often heading for greener pastures as a contractor, women are picking up the slack. "Can't get a small-job person anymore," Lois Slocum said, with good-natured resignation. Mrs. Slocum, 62, and her family have taken over the neighborhood family store, Handyman Hardware, in Stamford, Conn., ever since her husband contracted severe Lyme disease 14 years ago. It's a traditional outfit with a nontraditional staff: her daughters, Nancy Ligi, 37, and Michelle Arvan, 28.
The women (Jessica, 11, Mrs. Slocum's granddaughter, helps out on weekends) cut keys, repair chain saws, rewire lamps and swap sports scores with the male clientele. From Mrs. Slocum's vantage point, "Men don't have an idea how to fix a toilet, so it's the wife who's stuck at home who has to learn how." She added: "Women seem to learn the proper way. They read the directions. Men jury-rig."
Bonnie Burkert, 35, is her own handyman. A record company executive who shares an apartment with a roommate in Greenwich Village, Ms. Burkert has a toolbox that her mother helped her stock. "Those gruff guys at the hardware store looked us up and down as if we didn't know anything. And then my mother pulled her list out with the size of the nails, the grade of the sandpaper and all the right screwdrivers with their own screw heads, and she had them running all over the store."
This Gen X bachelorette calls her apartment the Den of the Goddesses, and has furnished it with tapestries and candles. She likes it so much, she said, that when Mr. Right comes along, "he can move in."
Ms. Burkert was recently featured in "On the Loose" (William Morrow, 1999) by Melissa Roth, an account of a year in the life of three women in their late 20's and early 30's. Ms. Roth, 32, has spent considerable time studying women in what she calls "the panic years" and has noticed that retailers market to her age group "as if all we do is buy clothes." She added: "But that's only true for the first 25 years. After that, you realize that you're not seeing your clothes, you're looking at your crummy couch most of the time."
Last weekend, Ms. Roth, a Manhattanite, went to Janovic Plaza where she said she encountered "nothing but single women shopping for paint."
"Here we all are," she said, "ready to commit, maybe not to a man, but definitely to a place of our own."
Virginia Woolf had it wrong. Why settle for a room, when you can have the whole house?

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Design;
G.M. Offers a Sneak Preview of Its Cars of Tomorrow

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich.

 BODY:
DETERMINED not to be a wallflower at next year's big parties, General Motors is trying on a rack of new outfits in an effort to bedazzle those who haven't been asking for a dance.
In a move unprecedented in the auto industry, G.M. gave the press a peek last week at nine so-called concept vehicles that it will display at the industry's equivalent of debutante balls, the auto shows in Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago and Geneva in the first half of next year. And next week, G.M. will give journalists a preview of its glitzy display for the North American International Auto Show on Jan. 15-23 in Detroit. 
 G.M. executives felt humbled at the 1999 show by an extravagant, multi-level Ford Motor Company exhibit that dominated the convention hall and included products from the company's newly enlarged stable of international brands. And the Chrysler Corporation, now DaimlerChrysler, has for years staged splashy product introductions with, literally, rolls of thunder, flashes of lightning and even minivans that played leapfrog on elaborate sets.
G.M., meanwhile, suffered a drought of new products that began earlier in the decade as serious financial problems brought the company close to bankruptcy. New car lines were canceled, and at auto shows G.M. unveiled relatively few -- and fairly modest -- concept cars, the vehicles that designers create to show off new ideas or signal future trends in styling and packaging.
Now, with a healthy balance sheet, G.M. wants the world to know it is pumping money into new vehicles and taking some risks.
G.M.'s nine concept vehicles were shown to reporters as three-dimensional computerized images at the company's virtual reality design studio here in suburban Detroit. Although the images looked like real vehicles, they existed only in digital form and were viewed through special eyeglasses.
Wayne Cherry, vice president for design and portfolio development, said at the briefing that G.M. wanted to be the industry leader in product innovation, "and nothing stimulates creativity more than generating concept vehicles to translate ideas into forms."
The concept cars showed styling features specific to each brand and pointed to G.M.'s future direction in design. "All of the concept vehicles were developed in our advanced concept center, but all are based on architecture we are looking at for the future or that we currently use," Mr. Cherry said.
These are the vehicles G.M. showed, in the order in which they will publicly appear:
 
SATURN CV1 -- Saturn's first-ever concept vehicle will make its debut at the Los Angeles auto show on Jan. 8-16. A cross of a minivan, station wagon and sport utility, the CV1 seats up to seven people, including two on rear-facing jump seats that fold out of the front seatbacks. The rear seats also slide and fold to form a flat cargo floor. There are large windows for a panoramic view, and bi-fold doors that slide along tracks and can be opened at the front or the rear.
 The CV1 will have an ultra-low-emission four-cylinder engine, a continuously variable transmission for high fuel economy and all-wheel drive. Body panels will be plastic, as they are on other Saturns.
 
OLDSMOBILE PROFILE -- G.M. calls this wagonlike vehicle a new type of sports sedan. Along with Olds styling characteristics like the long, narrow headlamps of the Aurora, Alero and Intrigue, the Profile has power sliding rear doors, sliding flat-folding split rear seats and a mobile communication center that could provide real-time traffic reports, voicemail and E-mail.
 The Profile, which is also to be shown in Los Angeles, will have a supercharged twin-cam 3.5-liter V6, all-wheel drive, an all-electronic "shift by wire" transmission and a stability-control system.
 
BUICK LaCROSSE -- This luxury sedan, which will be displayed on Jan. 15-23 at the Detroit show, blends a futuristic look with traditional Buick touches, including stylized portholes on the fenders. But it also has a pickup bed under a rear hatch.
 The electronic hatch, tailgate and doors open or close in response to spoken commands. Because all functions are controlled by voice or by a trackball, there are no visible gauges or controls other than the accelerator, brake pedal and steering wheel. Occupants would sit on leather club chairs.
 
GMC TERRADYNE -- Also to be unveiled in Detroit, the GMC Terradyne has an extended truck cab that is pushed far forward to make room for five passengers. As the sliding doors open, a step automatically lowers. The truck bed can be expanded to 8 feet, from 6, by pulling out a drawer-like tailgate; lockable trunks line the sides of the bed. The Terradyne uses industrial materials like stainless steel for a look of industrial precision, and it has an on-board generator that could send power to a home in a blackout.
 
CHEVROLET SSR -- G.M. hopes that this hybrid of sports convertible and pickup will be a show-stopper in Detroit. With its prominent fender flares, the styling evokes Chevy pickups of the 40's and 50's. Inside, the SSR has a divided cockpit like those of early Corvettes, but there is space in the center for a third person or a child seat. A retractable power top drops behind the seats for open-air motoring.
 
OPEL CVC -- This concept vehicle from G.M.'s European unit is based on the successful Zafira minivan and is set to make its debut in Detroit. The compact five-door van is outfitted for wintry regions with permanent four-wheel drive, high ground clearance, a roof rack for winter gear and a plastic hatch lid that doubles as a toboggan. The CCV seats six and the seats can be moved to different positions. The roof is glass, and there are airliner-style bins along the sides as well as heated rear cup holders. The CCV has a prototype direct-injection, four-cylinder gasoline engine.
 
CHEVROLET TRAVERSE -- The Traverse, a family sedan built on pickup truck architecture, will appear at the Chicago auto show, Feb. 11-20. The five occupants sit up high with a view of all four corners of the car. The rear seats slide forward and backward to add more cargo or passenger room. The seats also fold for a flat cargo floor, and the tailgate drops and the hatch lifts skyward.
 The Traverse comes with all-wheel drive and a 4.5-liter V6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission with push-button electronic controls. Like the SSR, the Traverse will have a twin-cockpit design and Internet access.
 
PONTIAC PIRANHA -- Intended to be an affordable sports car with extra room and practicality, the Piranha has a mini-pickup bed under a rear hatch that pulls out for loading items like skis. The mesh seats can be removed and taken to the beach.
 Interior fabrics zip on and off for customization -- buyers could select denim, leather or jersey, for instance. The roof panels open sideways for open-air motoring; pop-up racks offer another way to carry skis and snowboards. The front-drive Piranha will have a supercharged four-cylinder engine and a five-speed transmission that would be shifted by flicking paddles.
 
CADILLAC CONCEPT -- Next March 2-12 in Geneva, Cadillac will show a yet-unnamed vehicle that will apply the division's "Art and Science" theme -- first used on the Evoq roadster this year -- to a luxury sedan. The four-seat design will have the Evoq's crisp look and many gadgets, including information and entertainment screens built into the seats. The show car will have an infrared Night Vision camera like that on the 2000 DeVille; all-wheel drive, and a supercharged version of the Northstar V8 that produces an impressive 450 horsepower.

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: NETANYAHU ON THE SPOT -- The police questioned former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, left, in a fraud investigation room in Bat Yam, outside Tel Aviv, a day after raiding his home and office. It was the latest chapter in an inquiry that began with bribery allegations involving Mr. Netanyahu's relationship with a contractor who worked in his home. The contractor, Avner Amadi, has turned state's witness, according to local news reports. Mr. Netanyahu's friends say he is the victim of a political vendetta. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: RABIN REMEMBERED -- On a warm autumn day at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, Israeli officials marked the fourth anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, which is observed here by the Jewish calendar. Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who sees himself as following in Mr. Rabin's path as a warrior-turned-peacemaker, said: "We are continuing exactly from the point where it all was stopped by three bullets." Deborah Sontag (NYT) 

UNITED NATIONS
 
ABM TREATY CHANGES OPPOSED -- China joined Russia and Belarus in asking the General Assembly to demand that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty between Moscow and Washington not be amended, as the United States proposes to do to deploy more missile defenses. Hu Xiaodi, deputy director general of China's Arms Control and Disarmament Department, told reporters the treaty's fate affected all nations. "The preservation of the treaty, the integrity of the treaty, is of utmost importance," he said. Barbara Crossette (NYT)

MALAYSIA: REPORTER DROPS APPEAL -- A Canadian reporter who served four weeks in jail for contempt of court has decided to drop an appeal filed with Malaysia's highest court. A federal court ruled on Wednesday that Murray Hiebert, former Malaysia bureau chief for the Far Eastern Economic Review, could appeal his conviction and sentence if he returned to Malaysia for the hearings. Mr. Hiebert left the country after his release from jail for a new job as the magazine's bureau chief in Washington. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: ANGER OVER BUDGET -- President Ernesto Zedillo presented to the Congress a $120 billion draft budget for 2000, provoking an outcry from opposition lawmakers over the $9 billion to be spent to service the debt derived from a Government bank bailout. The $9 billion is twice what Mexico spent last year on all anti-poverty programs. The Government said it would try to achieve a growth rate of 4 percent to 5 percent in 2000 while holding inflation to 10 percent. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
VENEZUELA: FORMER LEADERS FACE PROSECUTION -- The Supreme Court has ruled that corruption charges against former President Jaime Lusinchi can be revived, overturning a lower court decision that the statute of limitations had expired. Mr. Lusinchi, who served between 1984 and 1989, has condemned the action as politically motivated. The announcement came after President Hugo Chavez said Mr. Lusinchi and another former President, Carlos Andres Perez, should "both go to jail and be sentenced to many years of imprisonment for their crimes."

RUSSIA: A HIGH-LEVEL SNUB -- Former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov refused an invitation to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, citing policy differences. Mr. Primakov, whom Mr. Yeltsin ousted from his post in May, has emerged as a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Yeltsin. Though he did not provide details, Mr. Primakov has opposed an all-out ground invasion of Chechnya. Michael R. Gordon (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: FAYED LOSES BATTLE -- Mohamed al-Fayed, 66, the Egyptian-born businessman who owns Harrods, lost another battle in his four-year campaign for a British passport when the High Court turned down his latest appeal as "devoid of substance." Mr. Fayed, left, had argued that Home Secretary Jack Straw was "inappropriately draconian" in deciding in May that he lacked the "good character" to become a British citizen. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: PESSIMISM ON PEACE -- Ulster's politicians entered the final phase of former Senator George J. Mitchell's seven-week attempt to rescue the faltering peace settlement in Belfast today in an atmosphere of growing pessimism. In an overnight visit to New York, Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political representative of the I.R.A., told a fund-raising dinner, "I think on balance that the Mitchell review will probably not succeed." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
FRANCE: BAN ON HEAD SCARFS -- Ruling on an issue that has become extremely sensitive in a country where four million Muslims now live, France's highest administrative court reaffirmed a ban on wearing Islamic head scarfs in public schools. A lower court had reinstated a Muslim girl who had been expelled from a school in Nancy for refusing to take off her scarf. The Council of State, however, ruled that schools had the right to insist that pupils dress in a way that allowed the proper functioning of the class. Suzanne Daley (NYT)

SIERRA LEONE: EX-REBELS JOIN GOVERNMENT -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah gave Cabinet posts to four former rebels who fought an eight-year civil war, state radio reported.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Leaders Appoint Regional Governors

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Pakistan's new military rulers today named three retired military officers and a judge to govern the country's provinces after the dismissal of central and provincial governments in the coup last week.
The appointments were the first since Gen. Pervez Musharraf ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12, suspended the Constitution and said the army would rule until it was no longer necessary to oversee the cleanup of corruption. 
 The names were announced by the state-controlled news media after General Musharraf, the chief executive of the administration that succeeded Mr. Sharif's Government, held a meeting of senior military officers and financial and political experts to discuss the woeful economic situation. The Governors are Lieut. Gen. Mohammad in Punjab, Air Marshal Mohammad Azim Daudpota in Sind, Lieut. Gen. Mohammad Shafiq in North Western Frontier and Justice Amirul Mulk Mengal in Baluchistan.
Under the suspended Constitution, governors were appointed by the central Government and enjoy wide powers as the representatives of the ruling party and the Prime Minister.
General Musharraf's choices were in keeping with a pledge to mix the army with civilian representatives.
He has promised to install "real democracy." But the United States and the European Union have lamented General Musharraf's failure to say when democracy might return and have threatened to block loans from the International Monetary Fund unless progress is made toward satisfying their demands on democracy.
During the meeting today, General Musharraf underlined his determination to crack down on a political elite that plundered banks for cheap loans and then refused to repay, and on tax evaders, the official A.P.P. news agency reported.
The army has ordered the suspension of the bank accounts of prominent politicians in one of its first acts and has begun a purge of high-ranking officials who are thought to owe the banks close to $5 billion.

HEADLINE: Soft Money and Hard Bargains

BYLINE: By Edward A. Kangas; Edward A. Kangas is the chairman of the global board of directors of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

 BODY:
You could almost hear the laughter coming from board rooms and executive suites all over the country when Senate opponents of campaign-finance reform expressed dismay that anyone could think big political contributions are corrupting elections and government. On Tuesday, those opponents prevailed, blocking a final vote this year on banning soft-money contributions. But the innocent and benign system described by the Senators arguing against reform hardly passed the laugh test for those of us on the receiving end of the soft-money shakedown.
For a growing number of executives, there's no question that the unrelenting pressure for five- and six-figure political contributions amounts to influence peddling and a corrupting influence. What has been called legalized bribery looks like extortion to us. The Senators who oppose reform would be far more credible and receive a sympathetic ear if they admitted the high cost of campaigns force them to focus on large contributors, rather than defending the system. 
 Congress passed laws that would put corporate executives in jail for offering money to a foreign official in the course of commerce. Now some of its members express bewilderment when people note that there is something unseemly about making large payments to the campaign committees of American elected officials.
I know from personal experience and from other executives that it's not easy saying no to appeals for cash from powerful members of Congress or their operatives. Congress can have a major impact on businesses. The solicitors know it, and we know it. The threat may be veiled, but the message is clear: failing to donate could hurt your company. You must weigh whether you meet your responsibility to your shareholders better by investing the money in the company or by sending it to Washington.
Increasingly, fund-raisers also make sure you know that your competitors have contributed, implying that you should pay a toll in Washington to stay competitive.
Unlike individual donations, most large corporate contributions aren't made as gestures of good will or for ideological reasons. Corporations are thinking of the bottom line. Will the contribution help or hurt the company? Despite the protestations of some Senators, everyone knows big checks get noticed.
Like most Americans, corporate executives also now the issue isn't really free speech. (You'll notice that the First Amendment argument is more often made by the listeners, the politicians, than by the speakers.) Companies don't question their ability to speak forcefully. We have lobbyists and trade associations, and we provide many jobs -- all of which help us to be heard. And, as salesmen, we resent the idea that the only way we can get a chance to make an effective pitch about legislation is to pay a large fee.
One clear sign of the growing dissatisfaction of corporate leaders with this pressure is the endorsement by more than 200 business and civic leaders of a campaign finance reform plan made by the Committee for Economic Development, a group of chief executives and academic leaders. This group, of which I am a member, is not saying that all political contributions are bad or corrupting. We know campaigns cost money.
But we see what should be obvious to everyone. There's a big difference between a $1,000 contribution -- the current limit on individuals' donations to a campaign -- and a $50,000 or $1 million check filtered through a party as "soft money." The potential for corruption is minimal at $1,000, or even at the $3,000 level to which our reform plan would raise individual contribution limits. But the unlimited amounts that pour through the soft-money loophole are dangerous.
Americans understand the influence of money. It's time to give elections back to democracy's shareholders -- the voters.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Earnings Slid 11.4% in Quarter

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
In a performance that indicated improving sales but not better profits, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 11.4 percent but that revenue rose 9.4 percent.
The company reported net income of $787 million, or 32 cents a diluted share, compared with $888 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. That quarter, plagued by volume declines stemming from the Russian economic crisis, continued sluggishness in Japan and other disappointments around the globe, was the start of a decline that the soft-drink giant has struggled to reverse. 
Analysts had expected Coca-Cola to earn 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. In September, Coke said its earnings would drop to 33 cents a share or less, thus failing to meet the estimates of 36 cents at the time.
Revenue rose 9 percent, to $5.2 billion, the company said. At the same time, costs rose, including a 16 percent jump in Coke's selling, administrative and general expenses. Part of that increase came from efforts to market products in Europe after a recall there in June that was the biggest in the company's history.
The effect on after-tax earnings in the quarter was 2 to 3 cents a share. Second-quarter earnings also lost 2 to 3 cents a share because of the recall.
Volume worldwide, measured in cases sold, rose 3.5 percent, though about one point of that growth came from Cadbury Schweppes brands that Coke acquired in July. The company had forecast an increase of 2 percent, so its volume results were slightly better than expected.
Analysts had awaited this particular earnings report eagerly to determine if Coca-Cola's fortunes had begun to improve; yesterday, they had mixed reactions. "These aren't exactly heroic numbers, but they sure look better than the first half of the year," said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said, "It's the fifth consecutive quarter of lower operating profits at Coke, and that certainly suggests that things have not yet begun to turn."
In a statement, the company's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, said: "This past year has not been what the company's shareowners or its management, most especially me, want or expect. Both our volume and profit results and our stock price have disappointed us all, even recognizing the difficult circumstances."
He added, however, that he was "optimistic about the long-term outlook for the global economy, and thus our ability to deliver on our stated long-term volume and earnings objectives."
Share of Coca-Cola rose $1.5625 yesterday, to $54.3125.
In the United States, where Coke bottlers, like their rivals at Pepsi, raised prices at the retail level earlier this year, volume rose 2 percent, compared with 4 percent in the period a year earlier. But concentrate shipments fell 1 percent.
Japan provided a surprising 10 percent increase in volume, the first rise in several quarters. The company attributed the improvement to a variety of factors, including its marketing, vending acquisitions, an introduction of a new half-liter plastic bottle and the "slightly improving economic conditions," as well as the growth from Cadbury brands.
Volume also rose 10 percent in Germany, another big Coca-Cola market. "Germany benefited from a very strong month of September resulting from integrated media and marketing programs focused on building long-term brand equity of both Coca-Cola and Fanta," the company said in its statement.
Currency exchange rates cost the company 6 percent in earnings. And equity income, or the income Coke derives from investments in its bottlers, was just $11 million, compared with $51 million in the third quarter a year ago. In the last nine months, equity loss has totaled $72 million, in contrast to income of $103 million in the same period last year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Acall for restrictions on psychological research by advertisers into products for children.

BYLINE: By Constance L. Hays 

 BODY:
DEPLORING what they see as an unfair and conflict-ridden manipulation of the young, a group of psychologists and other professionals has called on the American Psychological Association to restrict the use of psychological research by advertisers pitching toys, video games, snack food and other products to children.
The letter, written by Gary Ruskin, who heads Commercial Alert, a Washington-based advocacy group, and Allen D. Kanner, a clinical psychologist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, Calif., was sent to the association's president late last month. It urges the association to issue a formal denunciation of the use of psychological techniques in marketing and advertising to children, and asks for amendments to the association's code of ethics that would address the issue. 
 The letter, which was signed by 60 psychologists and other professionals with affiliations ranging from Sonoma State University to Harvard Medical School, also calls for "an ongoing campaign to probe, review and confront the use of psychological research in advertising and marketing to children," which would include promoting strategies to shield children from "commercial manipulation and exploitation" by psychologists.
"Regrettably, a large gap has arisen between A.P.A.'s mission and the drift of the profession into helping corporations influence children for the purpose of selling products to them," the letter stated.
A spokeswoman for the association said the matter had been referred to its internal board on children, youth and family issues, and that the board was scheduled to meet in March.
"Certainly there's no mention of the issue in our code of conduct," said the spokeswoman, Rhea K. Farberman, adding that the points raised in the letter had not been brought before the association before.
Dr. Kanner said he wrote the letter after becoming concerned, through his own conversations with children and teen-age patients, that they were, as a group, blatantly materialistic. "I'll ask kids what they want to do when they grow up, and lots of times they'll tell me, 'Make money,' " he said.
As for psychologists' role in that, he said research conducted at the university level was frequently deployed in developing commercials and other pitches to children. Since the stated mission of the American Psychological Association is "to improve the condition of both the individual and society," he concluded that permitting research to be used in advertising to children presented a conflict.
"They are taking this very sophisticated understanding of children's relationships and what they respond to, and then really tailoring it to the advertisement and refining it," he said. "There's no indication that it's helping kids with their relationships at all, but rather that it's manipulating them."
Timothy J. Kasser, an associate professor of psychology at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., who signed the letter, said he did so because he saw "a great deal of collusion between some members of psychology and marketing, advertising and entrepreneurial firms that are working together to try to understand how best to sell things to kids."
Dr. Kasser said his research with a colleague, Richard Ryan of the University of Rochester, had concluded that people who value goals like money, fame and beauty are not only more depressed than others, but also report more behavioral problems and physical discomfort, as well as scoring lower on measures of vitality and self-actualization.
For children, the consequences can be similarly damaging, Dr. Kasser said. "When advertisers are using psychological principles to sell products to children, they are not only selling that product, but they are also selling a larger value system that says making money and using your money for the purchase of material things will make you happy," he said. "That's what is really behind almost every commercial message, that this product will make you feel happy, or loved, or safe and secure. My feeling is that it is manipulation to use children's needs to get them to buy these products."
Not every psychologist feels the same way. "The whole point is, if you're going to market to kids, do it responsibly and there are a whole lot of opportunities to make a positive difference," said Dan S. Acuff, who holds a doctorate in psychology and runs a company called Youth Market Systems Consulting in Sherman Oaks, Calif.
Dr. Acuff, who called the goals stated in the letter "anti-free enterprise," published a book titled "What Kids Buy and Why" in 1997 that offers insights into how to create a successful children's product. Included are discussions of neocortical development, in which children start to rely more on intellect, logic and reasoning and less on fantasy for their decision making. That, Dr. Acuff notes, in italics, "has critical implications for product and program development as well as marketing and advertising to kids in the 8-through-12 age range."
But there is a line psychologists should draw, he added this week. "We turn down opportunities that would be damaging to kids," he said, "like toys with serious weapons in them -- guns, bombs, rifles and things like that." Fantasy weapons, like those carried by He-Man and Star Wars figures, were acceptable to him, he added, but those based on "modern technological weapons" were not.
Ms. Farberman, the association's spokeswoman, said psychological techniques were also being used for "socially redeeming issues," like advertising campaigns to urge people not to drink and drive. "It's important not to lose sight of that," she said.
Julie A. Halpin, the chief executive of Geppetto Group, which specializes in children's advertising, said psychologists were important in helping her company understand children and their capabilities. "For example, we learned that 6- and 7-year-olds don't understand double-entendres," she said. "They are simply trying to learn one meaning of a word at that age. So advertising copy that uses double-entendres as a clever device would not be appropriate, or effective. It's things like that that help us do the best job we can do."
Still, Dr. Kasser raised a question: "Maybe we're helping the economy, but is that our mission as a discipline?"

HEADLINE: Colgate Net Up 12% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Colgate-Palmolive Company, the world's largest toothpaste maker, said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent as it sold more products in North America and Asia and cut costs.
Net income for the company, which makes Total toothpaste, Mennen deodorant and other consumer products, rose to $239.7 million, or 38 cents a share, from $214.9 million, or 33 cents, a year ago. Sales increased 2.1 percent, to $2.31 billion, from $2.27 billion. 
 New York-based Colgate, which gets a quarter of its sales in Latin America, was hurt by Brazil's balky economy and falling currency, while helped by new products like Total gel toothpaste in North America. The company also pared costs by using fewer suppliers and package sizes. Colgate rose $3.75, to $57.75, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
The New York-based company had been expected to earn 37 cents, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Drops 94.67 After an Earnings Warning by I.B.M.

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday as I.B.M. was punished after warning about future earnings, but other technology stocks refused to be drawn into the slide.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 94.67 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 10,297.69, after an early loss of more than 200 points reversed Wednesday's gain of 187 points. 
 In the broader market, declines swamped advances 1,888 to 1,162 on the New York Stock Exchange, on active volume of 1.01 billion shares.
But the Nasdaq composite index rallied late to close with a gain of 13.82 points, a half-percent, to 2,801.95, rebounding from an early loss of nearly 65 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 5.82 points, or nearly a half-percent, to 1,283.61.
Wall Street was stunned by the warning from the International Business Machines Corporation, the world's biggest computer maker, late Wednesday that it would have a disappointing fourth quarter and first quarter of 2000. I.B.M., one of the 30 Dow component issues, slumped 16 a share, or 15 percent, to 91. The company posted mixed third-quarter results, citing slower spending as big clients made fixes related to computer problems associated with the year 2000.
Shares of another Dow component, Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, fell 3 3/8, to 23 5/8, after a Florida court refused to shelter tobacco companies from punitive damages in a case involving sick smokers. Shares of other tobacco companies also plummeted.
At a gathering of analysts, a Federal Reserve governor, Edward Kelley, said that the Fed's primary responsibility was to tailor its interest-rate policy to conditions in the overall economy; focusing on asset prices, he said, was "not the business that we're in."
His comment "suggests the market doesn't have to worry about Fed tightening if the market goes higher," said Dan Ascani, president and director of research at Global Market Strategists Inc. "It probably helped the market. The Nasdaq just didn't want to give up its gains."
Still, one factor pressing on some stocks was the 30-year Treasury bond's rising yield. The benchmark long bond's price slipped 10/32 yesterday, sending the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, to 6.35 percent, up from 6.33 percent on Wednesday.
Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, said, "The damage outside of I.B.M. is relatively limited."
The technology sector had some gainers. The chip giant, Intel, rose 1 3/4 a share, to 71 11/16, after Aware Inc. said Intel would license Aware's telecommunications technology. Aware shares jumped 11 5/8, to 32 1/2.
Microsoft shares gained 13/16, to 93 1/16, as the software company continued to benefit from news this week of strong earnings.
Aside from I.B.M., five other Dow components posted earnings. McDonald's beat expectations, but its shares fell 1 13/16, to 42 5/16. Sears, Roebuck posted lower earnings that still beat analyst expectations; its stock slipped 7/8 a share, to 28 1/8.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber said its quarterly profits fell; its shares slipped 1/2, to 44 5/16.
Coca-Cola, after a summer contamination scare in Belgium and France, posted an 11.4 percent drop in earnings that met lowered expectations; its stock rose 1 9/16, to 54 5/16.
Merck gained 2 15/16 a share, to 78 5/8, after reporting higher sales of key medicines and earnings that matched estimates.
Other companies reporting earnings included Viacom Inc., the owner of MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures. It said profit fell after a large restructuring charge from its Spelling Entertainment business; its shares rose 1/16, to 41 3/16.
America Online shares rose 4 1/4, at 122 1/4, after posting higher earnings late Wednesday. The Internet service provider also reported alliances with Gateway, the computer maker, and Stamps.com.

HEADLINE: Loggers Find Canada Rain Forest Flush With Foes

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: BELLA BELLA, British Columbia

 BODY:
Disembarking from an inflatable boat at James Bay, a party of eco-tourists hiked one recent morning into a primeval cathedral of the world's largest temperate rain forest.
Wreaths of mist lifted from moss-draped cedar trees, revealing stream banks strewn with salmon carcasses, their copper-colored skins freshly punctured by black bears. Sailing low overhead, bald eagles patrolled, beating the humid air with their wings. Once, the stillness of a forest glade echoed with the distant howling of a wolf pack. 
 The only discordant note was a string of construction flags marking roads and a log dump for the day next spring when James Bay is to be logged, when its ancient western red cedars are to be converted to window sills and decks for American houses.
After cutting 70 percent of the old-growth forest from Vancouver Island -- forest that has never been logged -- Canadian logging companies are now moving into what environmentalists call "the Brazil of the north" -- a vast, barely disturbed sea of trees, one-quarter of the world's remaining temperate rain forest. Over the next 25 years, 50 of the coastal forest's largest valleys are to be logged.
Now, a collision of powerful forces is taking shape on this remote coast, an archipelago where 4,500 people live, largely in Indian villages, sprinkled over a land area larger than Massachusetts and New Hampshire combined.
On one side is the logging industry of Canada, the world's largest exporter of timber, pulp and newsprint. Half of the nation's timber cut, or harvest, comes from British Columbia. Here, Canada's largest trees grow in forests where 15 feet of rain can fall in a year. But after suffering the nation's worst economic performance last year, British Columbia has slashed logging royalties to jump-start the cut.
Although King Timber still rules Canada's Far West, logging companies now face a trio of new players determined to defend what many call the Great Bear Rain Forest: tour operators, Indian tribes and a cross-border alliance of environmentalists.
With three tourists visiting British Columbia for each of its four million residents, tourism now employs more people -- albeit at lower wages -- than the forest products industry. With half a million tourists, largely Americans, taking cruises every summer up the inland passage from Vancouver to Anchorage, logging companies have been forced to leave "beauty fringes," or waterfront skirts of trees that create illusions of deep forest.
"This is one of the last great intact ecosystems of the world, and more and more people want to see it," said Eric Boyum, the captain of Ocean Light I, as he piloted his 67-foot cutter from James Bay, where sea otters slipped off rocks, to open waters where porpoises arced playfully. "Our bookings are up 20 percent over last year."
Opposition to wholesale logging also is emerging from many of British Columbia's 47 Indian tribes, which have long seemed to be spectators to economic development. By one survey, 90 percent of logging company workers are flown in from the southern part of the province. In Bella Bella, the rundown waterfront capital of the Heilstuk Nation, only 20 local men have been hired for logging jobs. Here, as elsewhere, natives have little legal access to trees they consider their own.
"It is hard for our people to see so many of our resources sailing by, when our treaty has not been settled, while there are so many unemployed," Phil Hogan, a tribal treaty negotiator, said of barges that pass, stacked with logs. Peace treaties were never signed with American Indian tribes west of the Continental Divide because the tribes were never considered conquered.
 On Thursday Parliament started debate on approval of a treaty with the Nisga'a tribe, the first land-rights treaty reached with a British Columbia tribe in this century.
In a move strengthening Indian forest claims, the Supreme Court ruled two years ago that in areas where no treaties had been signed, tribes retained proprietary interest in the land and resources. Impatient with the slow pace of treaty negotiations, one interior tribe, the Westbank Nation, started logging Sept. 7 on Government land without provincial consent. Half a dozen other tribes have since started logging Government land, and several called for "an international consumer boycott of companies who are destroying forest resources with destructive logging of aboriginal title lands."
But for logging companies on the coast, the most threatening boycott campaign is being waged by environmentalists who have made successful appeals to companies in the United States, the largest consumer of Canadian forest products.
Traditionally, Canadian environmentalists tried to slow rain forest destruction by focusing on Government officials. In 1993, in the largest demonstration of civil disobedience in modern Canadian history, 856 people were arrested for blocking a logging road on Vancouver Island.
But in a province where forest products account for 1 in 17 jobs, politicians have long been swayed by the industry, either by powerful companies or by powerful unions. Glen Clark, the provincial premier who resigned in August, once called environmentalists "enemies of British Columbia." His successor, Dan Miller, a former millworker from the north coast, used the term "Soviet-style" to describe Government lumber policies and called for privatizing provincial lands.
Environmentalists have long suspected that the public was more sympathetic to their cause than the politicians. Last fall a poll of provincial residents found that 70 percent opposed clear-cutting on the central coast and that 74 percent said they would pay more for paper or wood if they knew that the trees had been harvested in a "sustainable" way -- without lasting harm to the forest.
In a poll of Americans this year by Yankelovich Partners pollsters, 62.5 percent of respondents said companies should not use or sell products made from old-growth wood, 58.5 percent said they supported legislation to end old-growth logging, and 43.5 percent said they would be less likely to do business with a company using old-growth wood.
"The Government is irrelevant; it is the marketplace," said Merran Smith, a forest campaigner for the Sierra Club of British Columbia. "We give Home Depot 25,000 postcards. Home Depot responds."
In a major victory for the boycott campaign, Home Depot, the vast home improvement retailer, announced on Aug. 26 that it would phase out sales of wood from endangered forests by 2002. With 856 stores worldwide, the Atlanta-based chain says it is the largest wood retailer in the world, selling about 10 percent of the world's marketed supply.
The chain's turnaround came after environmentalists, led by the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, deluged the company with postcards, sent a Great Bear Rain Forest exhibit bus to a shareholder meeting and erected a Home Depot protest billboard over a clear-cut patch near Vancouver.
"The Government didn't listen, so we realized that the only way to turn the situation around was to go directly to consumers," said Tamara Stark, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace in Vancouver. After making inroads in Europe, Greenpeace has won pledges in the last year to phase out use of old-growth wood from 20 Japanese companies and from 27 United States-based Fortune 500 companies.
In a new phase this fall, the Sierra Club is campaigning for city ordinances in New York and Los Angeles that would phase out purchases of wood from old-growth forests that is not harvested in a sustainable way.
"Government purchasing accounts for 20 percent of wood consumption in the U.S.," said Susan Holmes, the New York City-based director of the club's Buy Good Wood campaign. "In Riverside Park, they are creating a bikeway-walkway that is using hemlock from the coast of British Columbia."
A. Gifford Miller, a Democratic City Councilman in New York and sponsor of the "selective purchasing" legislation, said by telephone: "If Home Depot can do it, we can, too. New Yorkers would be horrified to learn that the park benches they sit on, the boardwalks they walk on, are constructed at the expense of beautiful old-growth forest that can never be replaced."
The message is rattling Vancouver's largest lumber companies. Over the last decade, the provincial tree harvest has dropped by one-quarter, depressed by Asia's economic contraction and by growing consumer resistance.
"It used to be, you harvest a tree, you cut it into lumber, and you put it on a boat; the customer was pretty abstract," said Tom Stephens, president of MacMillan Bloedel, long a leading timber company here. But, he added, "if customer attitudes change, we have to change too."
Last year, MacMillan Bloedel broke ranks with other companies in the province and promised to phase out clear-cutting by 2002. This year, about half the company's harvest is by "variable retention," a new sustainable system that relies on thinning or cutting small patches.
To minimize the destruction caused by logging roads, the company increasingly uses helicopters to pull high-value trees from the forest. Mr. Stephens has consulted extensively with environmentalists. "The company that is not sensitive to those issues simply will not be in business very long," he said.
The Weyerhaeuser Company, which is considering a proposal to buy McMillan Bloedel, has said it will honor the promise to phase out clear-cutting.
MacMillan Bloedel and two other major companies want to defuse the boycott by winning certification from the Forest Stewardship Council, a Mexico-based group founded six years ago by environmental and social groups. But the council is not expected to develop harvesting standards for the rain forest here until the end of next year.
With profits low in the timber industry here, most companies refuse to abandon clear-cutting. Bill Dumont, the chief forester for Western Forest Products, which wants to log James Bay next year, said, "We have tried to come to an agreement with the greens, but we are not going to put ourselves out of business."
On Sept. 15, in the provincial interior, dozens of angry loggers burned a protesters' camp, smashed video equipment, and beat up several environmentalists. Most of the loggers worked for International Forest Products, which has cut its timber harvest -- and its payroll -- by one-quarter in the 1990's.
Understanding came from Ted Plosz, a logger here who said he is counting on working next year at James Bay. "Most of us were working only three or four months last year," he added.
On the coast, green groups want companies to adopt less destructive logging practices, methods that usually cost more money. They want to place 41 watersheds permanently off-limits to logging.
Officials of British Columbia, which owns 95 percent of the province's land, note that about 300 parks have been added here in the 1990's, preserving 15,400 square miles.
"There are a lot of valley bottoms that will not be logged," David Zirnhelt, the provincial Minister of Forests, said in an interview. Noting that the allowable cut from the midcoast forest has been reduced by one-third, he added, "Two-thirds of the old growth that is on the landscape today will be there 200 years from now."
But Canadian environmentalists demand more forest protection, dismissing many of the new parks here as protection for "rocks and ice."
Protecting trees costs money, however. In early September, the provincial government agreed to pay MacMillan Bloedel $70 million for the loss of cutting rights on 162 square miles of land set aside for parks on Vancouver Island. The government had resisted paying cash because it faces a $600 million budget deficit this year.
But defenders of the forest say there is economic value to standing trees, and the wildlife they support.
On a recent afternoon, the Queen of the North, a province-run ferry, steamed up the inland passage, gliding by forest-cloaked fjords and waterfalls. Passing Princess Royal Island, the ship seemed to list to port as tourists with binoculars clogged upper and lower decks. There, in the shade of an old-growth cedar, stood a rare white Kermode, or "spirit bear," crunching on a freshly caught salmon, its cream-colored jowls streaked red with blood.

HEADLINE: Kashmiris to Press Case, Trying Not to Be Forgotten

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
As the United Nations drew up plans in recent weeks to take over East Timor, a lonely band of Kashmiris was in the shadows, trying to make a case that their region, like East Timor, is still unfinished business for the United Nations and deserves more international attention.
More than half a century ago, on April 28, 1948, a Security Council resolution called for a plebiscite on the territory's future after India and Pakistan both claimed Kashmir, an autonomous kingdom left in limbo by the British when their colonial rule ended. 
 The plebiscite was never held, and therefore the United Nations does not recognize Indian occupation of the Kashmir valley and Jammu, or the Pakistani occupation of the rest of Kashmir.
Diplomats say the two cases illustrate the role of outside political pressure in determining the extent of United Nations involvement in regional conflicts.
"As a politician who has to get up every day in Parliament to answer questions," the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, said in an interview, "I can tell you that constant pressure has been for 20 years on East Timor -- highly organized, articulate lobby groups, churches. I can go from one year to the next and never hear a peep about Kashmir."
The East Timorese, 890,000 predominantly Christian people in Islamic Indonesia, have been buttressed by support from Portugal, the country that abandoned them in 1974 and opened the way to an Indonesian invasion, as well as from the Roman Catholic Church and various leftist and international human rights groups.
Kashmiris in India -- more than four million Muslims in a predominantly Hindu country -- do not have an effective international support network outside their own community abroad. They find it hard, therefore, to muster political or diplomatic leverage against India, which calls their rebellion an Islamic war created and sustained by Pakistan.
Although some international human rights groups have made clandestine visits to Kashmir and issued reports of atrocities, such organizations are not permitted to monitor the territory openly.
Last month, Indian officials took two spokesmen for the Kashmiri cause, Umar Farooq and Abbas Ansari of the All Parties' Freedom Conference, off a flight from New Delhi to New York, where they wanted to make their case to world leaders who were attending the United Nations General Assembly. Their passports were confiscated.
Although Kashmiris have not always been barred from leaving India, this year only the founder of the All Parties' Freedom Conference, Abdul Gani Lone, 73, was permitted to go, ostensibly for medical treatment for a heart condition. His Indian passport was endorsed for travel solely to the United States.
The Indian Foreign Minister, Jaswant Singh, said in an interview here that he knew nothing of the Kashmiris' travel problems and could not explain why they were prohibited from traveling to New York.
India has more than 500,000 troops and paramilitaries in the Kashmir valley. Independent outsiders estimate that up to 20,000 people have been killed since an independence movement armed itself 10 years ago, after what Kashmiri leaders call decades of political and economic suppression by successive Congress Party governments in New Delhi.
With Congress now defeated decisively in a national election and a strengthened Bharatiya Janata Party returned to power, Kashmiris may find that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee will have a freer hand in finding political solutions for Kashmir, a flash point for war between India and Pakistan, said David L. Phillips, director of the conflict resolution program at Columbia University.
Mr. Phillips said in an interview, however, that the world had less leverage to bring to bear on India over Kashmir than on Indonesia over East Timor. India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris need to look for new ideas themselves, he said.
Mr. Lone, the Kashmiri advocate, is a former member of the state assembly but now rejects involvement in any form of Indian politics. An election boycott last month led by his organization was widely followed and raised questions in New Delhi about India's policy to date.
"By refusing to take part in the election, voters in the Srinagar constituency are trying to say something," The Times of India said in an editorial. "The state and union governments must try and understand what that message is."

HEADLINE: Close, but No Banking Cigar;
A Heavily Political Issue Holds Up an Effort at Change

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
After a week of difficult negotiations among Senator Phil Gramm and President Clinton's top economic advisers over a bill to overhaul the nation's financial system, it became evident today that there would be no new law unless an agreement can be reached over the legislation's effect on rules that encourage banks to make loans to the poor.
As has been the case all week, Democrats and Republicans appeared to be engaged in a political exercise today fraught with heavy symbolism over the effects of the legislation on the two parties' traditional constituencies. At its core, some Republicans want to ease the burdens on banks, while Democrats want to see something in the legislation for minorities, farmers and the poor. 
 What makes the exercise so unusual is that there is overwhelming support among both Democrats and Republicans for virtually all of the substance of the legislation, which would repeal Depression-era laws that have made it expensive and difficult for banks to enter the securities and insurance businesses. Moreover, the effort by Mr. Gramm to limit the community lending laws does not appear to have the support of the majority of the banking community, which has profited handsomely from making loans to the disadvantaged and underserved, but is based on the banking chairman's view that the current law has led to unnecessary excesses and burdens. Page C8.
The financial services measure, which was making great strides in recent weeks after a 20-year struggle over its passage, stalled today when Senator Gramm, a Republican of Texas, failed to gain even a majority of his Senate colleagues to support what he has said was a fair compromise on the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law intended to encourage extending credit to minorities, the disadvantaged and farmers.
By a vote of 10 to 10, the senators on the conference committee defeated an amendment by Mr. Gramm that was essentially the same as the proposal the White House rejected Wednesday night.
The vote fell almost entirely on party lines. Senator Richard Shelby, a Republican of Alabama, joined the Democrats because he said the amendment would ultimately be used as a vehicle to expand the application of the Community Reinvestment Act.
After the White House rejected Mr. Gramm's proposal, Mr. Gramm responded today by saying that it would not be so bad if there were no bill at all this year because he was confident he would have a better one next year after George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, was elected President.
"Grown men argue over periods and commas and clauses because when you're talking about literally tens of billions of dollars, it makes a difference," Mr. Gramm said. "I hope the President will sign our bill. But if he doesn't, we will have a new bill in 15 months. I know who the President will be, and I believe it will be a different bill."
For the last four days, Mr. Gramm, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and Gene Sperling, the President's economic adviser, have talked for hours about whether the legislation should require that banks expanding into new businesses maintain adequate lending practices under the Community Reinvestment Act.
Hoping to break the impasse between Mr. Gramm and the White House, other Republicans and Democrats today began attempts at putting provisions in the act that would be able to both satisfy the White House and garner enough moderates.
But there were signs today that Mr. Gramm's position on the community lending had hardened and that it might be difficult to revive the legislation.
Of the White House's insistence that the legislation not roll back the Community Reinvestment Act, Mr. Gramm said: "There's an old saying where I come from -- don't take a hostage you're not willing to shoot," Mr. Gramm said at an afternoon news conference. "I don't take hostages I'm not willing to shoot."
Mr. Gramm made the same comment last year soon before he killed a similar bill supported by the White House proposed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.
A passionate critic of the act, Mr. Gramm has opposed any effort to expand it into new areas. The White House and Democrats in Congress say that the financial legislation, with benefits for the biggest and most powerful corporations in America, ought to at least have something for the poor, and that at a minimum the price for allowing banks to expand into the insurance and securities business should be a requirement that those banks have satisfactory ratings under the act.
"The banks and insurers and securities firms will be very happy with this legislation, they have done more than O.K.," said Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California. "I don't understand why it is that we have done nothing for the people, though."
Other Democrats and lobbyists said that in opposing the Community Reinvestment Act, Mr. Gramm was handing his opposition a strong political argument in the coming election that the Republican party is largely unsympathetic to the plight of the disadvantaged, and members of minority groups in particular.
"Gramm is the Democratic Party's single best unifier," one longtime financial services lobbyist said.
Caught in the middle of the dispute between Mr. Gramm and the White House are the three industries, which have tried for the last few years to get legislation that would repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and other laws that have limited the ability of banks, securities companies and insurance firms from entering into one another's businesses.
Fearful of a train wreck that would derail the legislation, a parade of lobbyists from the banking, securities and insurance industries who have championed the measure trooped to Capitol Hill today to implore Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, and Trent Lott of Mississippi, his counterpart in the Senate, to put off any final votes by the conference committee until an adequate agreement could be reached with the White House.
The lobbyists emerged from the discussions expressing hope that there would be no final votes until a deal could be reached on the Community Reinvestment Act.

Chrart: "A Chronology of Financial Regulation"
 
1929 -- The Depression that followed the stock market crash causes a lot of banks to fail, with the risks that banks took in the market getting some of the blame.
1933 -- The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from underwriting stocks or bonds.
1956 -- The Bank Holding Company Act further restricts the activities of banking companies.
1960's and 1970's -- Banks fail to persuade Congress to allow them to enter the municipal bond market.
1977 -- The Community Reinvestment Act is passed to encourage banks to lend more in low-income areas.
1983 -- The Federal Reserve allows BankAmerica to buy Charles Schwab, the large discount broker.
1984 -- The Senate passes a bill allowing banks to trade revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper. The bill is defeated in the House, partly because of insurance industry objections.
1987 -- BankAmerica sells Charles Schwab back to its founder.
1990 -- J.P. Morgan is first bank to receive permission from the Federal Reserve to underwrite securities, but business may not exceed 10 percent of revenue.
1991 -- The Bush Administration proposes repealing Glass-Steagall, House and Senate banking committees concur. The full House defeats the bill.
1995 -- The House and Senate banking committees approve different versions of bills repealing Glass-Steagall. Efforts to work out a compromise break down.
1996 -- The Fed increases the amount of revenue banks can derive from underwriting to 25 percent from 10.
1997 -- Bankers Trust buys Alex. Brown, becoming the first U.S. bank to acquire a brokerage engaged in underwriting.
1998 -- Travelers Group and Citicorp announce a merger that requires changes in Glass-Steagall for complete approval.
1999 -- House and Senate each approve separate bills repealing Glass-Steagall, but final passage appears bleak because of a dispute over how to change the Community Reinvestment Act.

HEADLINE: Fed Learns Bartenders Are More Popular T han Bouncers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IS Alan Greenspan yesterday's hero?
It was only eight months ago that Mr. Greenspan was on the cover of Time as the most prominent member of "The Committee to Save the World," a man who had prevented a global economic meltdown by reducing interest rates. Politicians fell all over themselves to praise the Federal Reserve chairman while interpreting his sometimes Delphic words as an endorsement of their views. 
 But now his halo is slipping, and the muttering is increasing. How dare he raise interest rates? Who is he to question the stock market's valuation?
William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed chairman during the great economic expansion of the 1950's and 1960's, once said that the role of the Fed was "to take away the punch bowl just when the party gets going." Mr. Greenspan is learning what happens to Fed officials who wait too long to try to grab the bowl. The revelers resent it.
Deep into the longest peacetime recovery in American history, business feels it has a right to continued economic growth more or less forever. Deep into the biggest bull market ever, more and more investors believe that 20 percent-plus annual stock market gains are a birthright.
Seventy years ago, another generation of Fed officials learned the same lesson. In 1929, the Fed had the gall to tell banks to reduce lending to stock speculators. The stock market plunged, only to rally after Charles Mitchell, the president of National City Bank, a predecessor of today's Citibank, defied the Fed and said lending would continue. Mitchell "saved the day" and averted calamity, said The Financial Chronicle, a Wall Street publication. The Fed, it added, "can act the part of a bull in a china shop and cause a lot of destruction and damage, or, Samson-like, it can pull the whole financial structure down about its head. But that is no reason why it should not be checked in the attempt by those who would be involved in the ruin."
That Fed quickly lost its nerve. The stock market rallied more than 30 percent from the March lows brought on by the Fed's effort to slow speculation. Then it crashed.
Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed face a difficult situation now. There is scattered evidence that the economy is slowing, and there is reason to believe that the current rate of growth is overstated because it reflects inventory accumulation by people and companies fearful of Year 2000 glitches. Both are reasons not to raise rates. On the other side, there is equally scattered evidence that inflation is rising, and there is concern over the soaring current account deficit. A failure to act could cause stock prices to rise to completely unreasonable levels, making an eventual crash more likely. Action, on the other hand, might scare jittery investors and bring on a crash.
Back when people remembered 1929, it was taken for granted that the Fed should act to rein in a frothy stock market. It raised the margin requirement -- the amount investors had to put down to buy stocks -- when markets were high, and cut it when share prices were depressed. The last change, from 65 percent to 50 percent in 1974, came during a severe bear market.
Because it no longer pays attention to margins, the Fed has created the impression that stock prices are irrelevant and that inflation is the only reason to apply economic brakes. Without clear evidence of inflation, Mr. Greenspan risks losing popularity if he keeps raising rates.
Seventy years ago, the Fed backed down under attack from the party crowd. Will Mr. Greenspan do the same?

HEADLINE: Benno C. Schmidt, Financier, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Benno C. Schmidt, the right-hand man of the financier John Hay Whitney and a pioneering venture capitalist who became an important backer of biotechnology ventures, a New York civic leader and the head of the Federal Government's war on cancer, died yesterday at his home in New York. He was 86.
The cause was heart failure, said his son, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the former president of Yale University who is now chairman of the for-profit Edison Schools Inc. 
 Mr. Schmidt came to national prominence in the 1970's, when he was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to serve as chairman of the President's Cancer Panel. He was also a longtime chairman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and served as an informal health-policy adviser to several Presidents.
But he had a larger impact as an early venture capitalist, a forerunner of a relatively new breed of investor who provided much of the seed money for technology and biotechnology industries by financing risky start-up companies with the knowledge that most would fail but that some would be big successes.
Mr. Schmidt's successful record at Mr. Whitney's firm, J. H. Whitney & Company of New York, including an early deal to stake Minute Maid orange juice, encouraged other investors to back similar investments. According to several accounts, Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Whitney, who later became editor in chief and publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, even coined the term venture capital by shortening "adventure" to describe their business.
Late in life, Benno Charles Schmidt spoke of a privileged childhood made possible by his mother and aunt, who emphasized the importance of education. But by the standards of most, his was a hardscrabble upbringing in Abilene, Tex. He was born Jan. 10, 1913, and his father died when he was 12. His mother worked as a secretary at the county welfare association to support the family. Growing up, Mr. Schmidt attended church three or four times a week and spent his free time building bridges and oil derricks.
At the University of Texas, where he also attended law school, he was quickly marked for greatness, capturing the attention of professors and administrators. In a recent publication by the law school, he was described as "one of our legendary graduates." It said that his academic achievements "have never been excelled." When Mr. Schmidt received his first-year grades, he called his mother to say that he was not only first in his class but had also scored the highest academic average in the school's history. As he read off his numerical averages, including his lowest, in criminal law, his mother asked her exasperated son, "What was the matter with criminal law?"
After graduating, Mr. Schmidt joined the Texas law school faculty, and then spent a year teaching at Harvard Law School. Before World War II broke out, he was recruited to the War Production Board to help increase the nation's industrial capacity. After Pearl Harbor, he joined the Army, where he quickly rose to colonel and won a number of medals, including the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star. After the war, he spent a year as general counsel to the State Department's economics division, helping oversee economic relations with Britain and other allies.
Then one day he got a call from Mr. Whitney, one of the wealthiest men in the country. Mr. Whitney wanted to stake a new firm with $10 million to finance young companies in new industries.
Mr. Schmidt informed Mr. Whitney that he had no business experience whatsoever. According to Walter Curley, a longtime friend of Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Whitney replied: "I'm not looking for somebody who has a lot of business experience. I'm looking for someone who has had a lot of experience with life." With that, Mr. Schmidt signed on, serving as a partner for 52 years, and as managing partner from 1960 to 1992.
The firm's early investments included sums to finance the Spencer Chemical Company, a fertilizer and agricultural chemicals concern that returned a more than twentyfold profit, and Minute Maid, an investment that Mr. Schmidt encouraged despite Mr. Whitney's initial observation that the juice concentrate tasted "tinny."
"That life of venture capital fitted Benno Schmidt like a glove, because it embodied all the things he had: curiosity, compassion, love of life, and intelligence," said Mr. Curley, who worked with Mr. Schmidt at J. H. Whitney and later served as Ambassador to Ireland and France.
In the 60's, Mr. Schmidt became heavily involved in New York civic affairs, as a trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art, chairman of the Fund for the City of New York, chairman of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corporation, and later, chairman of Memorial Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Franklin A. Thomas, the former chief executive of the Ford Foundation, said Mr. Schmidt was the "animating spirit" of the Bedford-Stuyvesant effort, which sought to improve the Brooklyn community.
In addition to the cancer panel, Mr. Schmidt also served in the mid-70's as a member of the President's Biomedical Research Panel, and later, at J. H. Whitney, he pushed the firm to invest in new biotechnology ventures. As an acknowledged leader in both the private and public sector efforts, he had such a huge influence on the course of medical research and investment that the writer Barry Werth described him in 1994 as "the senior gatekeeper of biomedical innovation in the United States."
Mr. Schmidt's survivors include four sons, Benno Jr., Ralph and John, all of New York, and William, of Sarasota, Fla.; three stepchildren, Ruth Fleischmann and Stephen Fleischmann, both of New York, and James, of Philadelphia; 15 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. A fifth son, Thomas, died in 1966. His second wife, Nancy Montgomery Fleischmann, died earlier this year. His first wife, Martha Chastain, also died this year; their marriage ended in 1962.

HEADLINE: Urban Sprawl Benefits Dairies in California

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: CHINO, Calif.

 BODY:
Nearly four decades ago, Gennie DeBoer was one of many dairy farmers forced by relentless urbanization to flee the farmland in Los Angeles County where her immigrant parents had settled, to build a new life elsewhere. Though a challenge, the move turned out to be a blessing.
Mrs. DeBoer and many of the other dairy refugees eventually built state-of-the-art milking operations here in what was then a sun-baked wasteland, 40 miles east of the spires of downtown Los Angeles. In short order, they helped transform the near desert into something few outside the area had a clue about: one of the most densely worked and productive dairy regions in the country. 
 The huge, computerized dairy farms shoehorned into a relatively small area in the Chino Valley in San Bernardino County would come to play a major role in California's little-known leap ahead of Wisconsin several years ago as the country's largest milk-producing state, a marvel of automation and high yields. But as Mrs. DeBoer recounted her success recently and drove a visitor past one giant herd after another in her Lexus, the air redolent of the aromas generated by tens of thousands of Holsteins in close quarters, she said with only a touch of nostalgia, and even a sense of relief, that it was all about to vanish, driven away yet again by Southern California's urban sprawl, present in the form of new shopping centers and subdivisions within sight of the barns.
In Southern California sprawl has been such a constant dynamic in the area's restless geometry of growth, especially in the post-war era, that it is not always an enemy to many of those whose lives are uprooted by it.
In the case of the Chino Valley dairy farmers, the surge of new subdivisions is actually injecting new vitality into one of the state's largest industries. Many of the farmers here are selling outmoded facilities and their valuable tracts of land, and are using the ample profits to build even larger and more efficient operations in more bucolic areas.
Indeed, the big increase in land values as demand for new housing soars is financing a transition that will result for most people not in broken dreams or the end of a way of life, but in a new generation of highly efficient dairies. As a result, California seems likely to substantially widen its lead over Wisconsin and the No. 3 dairy state, New York.
"Yeah, everything here is outdated," Mrs. DeBoer said, as she strolled through a barn that held the sweet-sour smell of fresh milk and equipment that was up-to-the-minute 20 years ago. "In this business, you have to go forward or you're going backward. You have to keep growing. You have to strive to get better."
Mrs. DeBoer is planning to sell her 200 acres, estimated to be worth $100,000 an acre, and move her 2,000 cows to an efficient new farm she owns with a son about 180 miles north in Tulare County, which is the state's fastest-growing dairy region. The 2,000 acres they own there, she said, cost only about $2,500 an acre.
"What made all this possible in the Chino Valley was the money the farmers got from selling their land in Los Angeles," said Robert Feenstra, the son of a Los Angeles dairyman and the executive director of the Milk Producers Council, the industry trade group here. "The process of urbanization in Los Angeles pushed the land prices up so much that it accelerated the growth of the industry out here. The farmers came with the capital to build these really efficient operations."
Mr. Feenstra pointed to a new addition to his office wall, a map of Tulare County freckled with red dots representing dairy farms, and added, "They're doing the same thing all over again."
The nearby city of Ontario is about to complete the annexation of much of this area in the Chino Valley next month and press ahead with the construction of subdivisions named, in a touch of fanciful marketing, for the properties they are replacing, like Cloverdale Farms and Archibald Ranch. The farmers are looking to the future, and even many of those who say they intend to stay are generally unsentimental.
"People here see it as part of the business process," said Fred Aguiar, a former Mayor of Chino who moved here from a dairy in Los Angeles County four decades ago and is now a San Bernardino County supervisor. "Where you have half a million animals now there will be 100,000 or so people in a few years. We all understand progress."
Gene Koopman, who sold his farm here last year and now spends a week a month on a big dairy he partly owns in New Mexico, agreed. "It'll be a little sad to see everyone go," Mr. Koopman said, "but it makes sense from a business and environmental perspective."
There is even a sense among some farmers that, good as Chino has been to them economically, the growth of the dairy business was too concentrated without enough planning. The current ratio of about 25 cows to an acre here is among the highest in the world. That has created environmental concerns that at least some of the farmers will be glad to leave behind for more spacious farms that, for now at least, are miles from the nearest subdivision.
"None of these farms ever should have been here really," said Mrs. DeBoer, as she pointed to the berms thrown up around many of the fields in an effort to contain the dangerous wash of manure and water spread by winter floods. "No one ever thought about the future. It was way too dense. What happened here will never happen again, anywhere in the world. The county closed their eyes to what was happening in the valley."
Before the development of modern refrigeration, processing and filtration methods, dairy farms needed to be closer to their markets, and so in the early part of the century a big arc in southeastern Los Angeles County became home to a cluster of farms feeding the appetites of a rapidly growing metropolis.
Dairying became so important to the local economy that when a Los Angeles county seal was created in the 1950's, the business was honored on the emblem. On the seal were figures representing the pillars of the local economy, including, among other things, an oil well and a cow.
In addition to its density, another quirk of the dairy industry here was that it was operated almost entirely by immigrants. The largest group were Dutch, many of whom came before and just after World War II and quickly adapted their northern European techniques to the hot, dry climate. There were also many Portuguese, mostly from the Azores, and a handful of French Basque farmers.
These days, many farmers, like Mrs. DeBoer and her husband, Fred, still speak Dutch and visit relatives in their homeland periodically. They also have built extremely tight-knit communities, with their own churches and Christian schools. To this day, the industry in Southern California is dominated by the Dutch, and the dairy industry in northern California, toward the top of the Central Valley, is dominated by Portuguese families.
The last time the industry was forced to move, it also pulled up stakes in a hurry. Joel Splansky, a professor of geography at California State University at Long Beach and the author of a history of the dairy business here, said that as recently as 1962 the town of Dairy Valley, one of the centers of the industry in Los Angeles County, had 3,505 people and 85,000 cows.
It was not long after that that rising taxes, changing policies regarding the use of land and environmental concerns over growing manure piles forced the farmers to build their larger and more efficient operations in the Chino Valley. Today, the town of Dairy Valley is called Cerritos. It has a population of 53,240 people, and no cows.
Initially, the growth of the industry in the Chino Valley was encouraged. There are now about 880 cows on average on each farm in Chino, with many having 2,000 or so, compared with a national average of fewer than 50 cows per farm.
The farms are operated with machine-like precision and a pure business philosophy. Asked if their cows had names, the farmers here chuckled.
"On a lot of those farms in the Midwest and back East, every cow has a name," Mr. Koopman said. "They're sort of pets. It's not like that here. A cow's a piece of machinery. If it's broke, we try to fix it, and if we can't, it gets replaced.
"Today, every cow has a number and a page on the computer."
Mrs. DeBoer said she had never milked a cow by hand, and never expected to. In the factory that is her barn, the employees, almost entirely Latino, manage the machinery.
"It's just a factory is what it is," she said. "If the cows don't produce milk, they go to beef."
One result is a conspicuous flow of wealth to the north. Milking plants cost about $5 million to build in Tulare, but the farmers, and their bankers, think nothing of constructing them.
"These are some of the most profitable times ever," said Larry Zivelonghi, manager of agricultural lending at the Citizens Business Bank, the biggest local farm lender here.
Farms here, Mr. Zivelonghi said, usually generate $250,000 to $300,000 a month in milk sales, and loan default rates have been minimal.
But now the barns are being replaced with handsomely designed entry gates topped with sales banners and signs offering houses at $200,000 and up.
A huge billboard, in front of a 360-acre spread bulldozed smooth, proclaims: "The Corona Valley. Worth the Wait." The former dairy is being turned into a planned community.
Dairy farming is "a way of life for these people," said Mr. Feenstra, of the Milk Producers Council. "It's a gene. But it's not the land, it's the business they love."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Mixed Results In Reducing Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
About a third of the people who left New Jersey's shrinking welfare rolls since 1997 found jobs and managed to support themselves a year after their public assistance ended, a new study commissioned by the state found.
But two-thirds of all those who were receiving welfare when the study began in 1997 remain below the Federal poverty level of $19,000 per year, and half have experienced serious housing problems and been evicted, forced to stay in homeless shelters or moved in with friends or family members. 
 The study, conducted by a private research firm using state data, also found that 27 percent of all recipients had left welfare without finding work, and are subsisting on a meager income of less than $650 a month in benefits from food stamps, unemployment and other government programs.
The study, which will continue for the next three years, is the most detailed analysis to date of the 42,000 New Jersey residents who have left the welfare rolls since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman began the Work First New Jersey program in 1997. To comply with a Federal mandate, many states have enacted similar programs designed to reduce welfare rolls by limiting benefits to five years and offering an assortment of health care, transportation and child care subsidies to ease the transition back to the workplace.
Results of the study, which tracked the work history and living conditions of 1,400 New Jersey welfare recipients and is to continue for the next three years, suggest that the performance of the Whitman administration's program has been similar to those in many other states.
"New Jersey is just like everybody else, making some progress getting people back to work," said Jack Tweedie, an expert on welfare policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "But there are significant numbers where there is not work and significant numbers where there is not new income. You have to make as much progress as you can right now, while the economy is strong, because that will help you down the road when the economy declines."
Governor Whitman said today that she was encouraged that New Jersey's attempt at welfare reform, which has reduced the case load from 96,000 in 1997 to 55,000 today, had nudged thousands of state residents back to work. The Governor's spokesman also said that the new information about those who remain on welfare would help state officials direct their resources.
"We are very close to the hard core, the toughest group of people to move off of the welfare rolls," said Pete McDonough, the Governor's director of communications. "In many cases it's a drug or alcohol problem. We're now trying to use the block grant money, nearly $20 million to address those substance abuse problems."
Ninety-six percent of the welfare recipients studied were women, and half had no prior work experience, said Anu Rangarajan, a researcher for Mathematica Policy Research, which conducted the study. Most of those who found work took clerical jobs or positions as health-care aides or in sales. They reported an average wage of $7.30 per hour. Many lost or left their jobs quickly, Ms. Rangarajan said, apparently because the jobs were entry-level positions and had few benefits.
But nearly 30 percent of those who stayed in their jobs and off welfare remained in poverty.
"The greatest challenge for people on welfare, obviously, is to raise themselves out of poverty," Ms. Rangarajan said.
Michele Guhl, Commissioner of Human Services, said state officials were surprised that 40 percent of those who did not find work reported having significant health problems or the responsibility of caring for a sick relative. Ms. Guhl said the next phase of the study would focus on collecting detailed information about those health issues. Meanwhile, caseworkers will be trained to help the seriously disabled apply for Social Security, which does not place a time limit on benefits to people who have medical problems that prevent them from working.
During the next phase of the study, researchers will also focus on the 27 percent of welfare recipients who stopped receiving public assistance but say they have not found work. Preliminary evidence suggests that a third of those people live with an employed friend, spouse or relative. But half of those who left the welfare rolls without finding work do not live with any employed adults, the study found, and are at the greatest risk of poverty.
"We want to know, are these people in real trouble or are they waiting tables and just don't want to report the income?" Ms. Guhl said.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Casts Shadow on Agency Meant to Help New York Revival

BYLINE: By KEVIN FLYNN and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
For five years, the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency charged with fostering a climate conducive to business, has been credited with helping to rejuvenate New York with its efforts to create jobs, eliminate red tape and direct ambitious projects like the redevelopment of Times Square.
But since last fall, the corporation has been buffeted by a criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office that has examined everything from the agency's role in multimillion-dollar development deals to the travel logs of its high-profile chairman, Charles A. Gargano. 
 Month after month, the agency has been beset by subpoenas for documents, and more than 10 current and former staff members have been interviewed by investigators and a grand jury that is examining the process by which state grants and contracts were awarded.
Subpoenas have also been served on companies that received aid from the agency, restaurants that catered state-organized functions and institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art that held agency receptions.
Despite the intensity of the investigation, its progress remains unclear: prosecutors will not discuss their inquiry, which to date has resulted in a just a single attempted bribery charge against a deputy commissioner, Paolo Palombo.
To the agency's defenders, the very breadth and length of the inquiry is evidence that the investigation is little more than a fishing expedition initiated on the basis of vague whispers of misconduct.
But the constant scrutiny has become an undeniable distraction at the agency, where staff members say they fear that even an unproductive investigation may tarnish the agency's record.
The inquiry also threatens to take a toll on Mr. Gargano, a wealthy former construction executive who rose to political prominence because of his success as a Republican fund-raiser. Mr. Gargano took office in 1995, fending off accusations that he would use the state agency that distributes business grants to reward campaign contributors.
Now the inquiry, which has included an examination of his phone logs, his business holdings and a trip he took to Italy last year, threatens to delay, and could derail, his appointment to a prominent position within the Presidential campaign of George W. Bush.
A month ago, Mr. Gargano told friends he expected to leave the agency in early October for the Bush campaign. But the campaign has yet to create a spot for Mr. Gargano, and he was all but invisible during Mr. Bush's recent two-day campaign swing through New York City.
Mr. Gargano's allies say his appointment is still imminent, although there is some talk of naming him to a lower-profile state party campaign post. A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Scott McClellan, said, "We have not made any decision on our New York leadership, with the exception of Governor Pataki."
The District Attorney's investigation began last year as a modest inquiry into whether agency officials misspent funds from annual state receptions to honor Italian-Americans. Within months, it had evolved into a broad exploration of issues as diverse as the pending sale of state land on Long Island to purchasers who include Republican campaign contributors, and the nature of state-sponsored development deals in Westchester.
"They're looking at everything," said an official who worked on one of the deals under scrutiny and said that Mr. Gargano's role was negligible. "He's been around the block. He wouldn't allow himself to get hooked into anything that'll cause him a problem. He's been pretty tough on deals, in my experience."
Mr. Gargano, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, declined to be interviewed. Maura Gallucci, his spokeswoman, said the agency was cooperating fully.
"Everything done here at E.S.D.C. and by Charles Gargano is completely appropriate and above reproach," Ms. Gallucci said. "Is the D.A.'s office using the investigation into Palombo as an opportunity to randomly look into activities at E.S.D.C. and Charles Gargano? I don't know the answer, but I hope not."
One of the subpoenas, for example, requested records on the state subsidies given to Nine West, a shoe manufacturer that was persuaded to move its headquarters from Connecticut to Westchester in 1996.
Two weeks before Gov. George E. Pataki announced the deal, in which state and local governments provided the company with incentives worth $7 million, the company's chief executive officer at the time donated $15,000 to the Republican State Committee.
The investigation's focus was much narrower last fall when prosecutors first began to hear complaints that bills from state-sponsored Italian heritage celebrations had gone unpaid despite the fact that various corporations like Coca-Cola and Banco di Napoli had stepped in to help underwrite the affairs.
The huge receptions, intended to honor Italian-Americans and foster business and cultural ties with Italy, were held each year at the Boathouse in Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum and other reception sites that could accommodate 1,500 business leaders and politicians.
Mr. Gargano at times made the initial contact to arrange for the affairs, according to people who helped arrange the events. He left the details like raising the money or booking the caterers to Mr. Palombo, an old friend whom he had appointed the agency's deputy commissioner for international business.
Mr. Palombo and Mr. Gargano had known each other for two decades, their lives entwined by a mutual interest in all things Italian. Mr. Palombo was a talkative former baker and professor of Italian literature at Fordham University who liked to be referred to as Il Professore.
Mr. Gargano, who hired Mr. Palombo in 1995, relied on him not only to lure foreign investment to New York, but also to write his speeches in Italian, associates of the two men said.
When vendors from the Italian heritage events began complaining about unpaid bills, prosecutors began exploring how Mr. Palombo had spent some of the money he had raised, according to people who have been interviewed by investigators.
One company, Roma View Catering of Queens, which had catered an event aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid in 1997, threatened to sue the state because its $9,000 bill had gone unpaid for nine months. The agency arranged to pay the bill as year after the events.
Prosecutors also questioned whether Mr. Palombo had siphoned money from a 1988 trade show for Italian artisans that had been held at Cipriani Wall Street, a Manhattan catering site, according to those interviewed. Mr. Palombo had helped to arrange the event. Mr. Gargano had promoted it as one of the fruits of the state's expanded business relationship with Italy. A friend of Mr. Palombo's had been hired as the general contractor who oversaw the budget for the show.
Ultimately, last June, after being questioned about these events, Mr. Palombo agreed to plead guilty to a bribery charge. The complaint said that he had agreed to accept $30,000 from the manager for an Italian sculptor who had sought Mr. Palombo's help in getting one of the artist's statues, a bronze depiction of Ulysses, placed on state property at Battery Park City.
Friends of Mr. Palombo say he used the money not for his own purposes, but to pay expenses from one of the Italian heritage receptions. Nonetheless, he was forced to resign from his $91,877 a year state job in July.
As the investigation continued, Mr. Palombo told prosecutors he had used $6,000 of the money taken from the trade show to buy first-class plane tickets to Italy for Mr. Gargano and the former Miss America Phyllis George, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Prosecutors have a copy of a $6,000 check, drawn on a Palombo family bakery account, that Mr. Palombo said he used to pay for the trip last summer, the people familiar with the case said.
Neither Mr. Gargano nor Ms. George would discuss the trip or how it was financed.
It is not clear that accepting such tickets violates the state law that governs the conduct of public officials. The law prohibits officials from accepting gifts of more than $75 if it can be inferred that the gift was given to influence the official in the performance of his duties.
There is no provision that bars a supervisor from accepting a gift from a subordinate, unless the gift could be shown to have been given as an inducement of some kind.
However, the law requiring officials to report all gifts of more than $1,000 is quite clear. Mr. Gargano did not list any tickets or gifts from Mr. Palombo on his state financial disclosure form for 1998.
Mr. Gargano's allies contend that Mr. Palombo is trying to divert attention from himself. "It is unfortunate, but not unusual, that someone in his position would try to save himself by attempting to point a finger at others," Ms. Gallucci said.
In recent months, however, the investigation has roamed far from areas where Mr. Palombo had a role. The Nine West package, for example, was arranged by another division of the agency in 1996 to spur job growth in Westchester County and to stabilize the commercial real estate market in White Plains, where a third of the buildings were vacant.
The move by Nine West from Stamford to White Plains brought 1,200 jobs to the state and provided a new tenant for one of Westchester's largest office complexes. But prosecutors have subpoenaed the records of the deal from both the state and the company.
"We did receive a subpoena, and we responded to it," said Jeff Howald, the company's chief financial officer. He declined to discuss the deal further.
At the time the deal was announced, the company's chief executive officer at the time, Vincent Camuto, said Mr. Gargano's personal intercession had helped persuade the company to make the move. Mr. Camuto, who gave $15,000 to the state Republican Party 13 days before the deal was announced, did not return calls seeking comment.
The District Attorney has subpoenaed records on other deals as well, including the pending $50.3 million sale of three parcels of surplus state land on Long Island. The prospective purchaser of one of the parcels is Arlen Contracting, whose principal, Alvin Benjamin, is a veteran Republican contributor.
Prosecutors have also sought records on the construction of Mr. Gargano's new million-dollar home in Bridgehampton, his son's construction company, which built the home, the redevelopment deal for downtown New Rochelle, and a casino company, Alpha Hospitality, in which Mr. Gargano once owned stock and served as a director.
The continuing barrage of subpoenas has left some executives at the state agency exhausted and bewildered. Last April, when yet one more request for records arrived at the agency, an executive circulated an internal memo to top staff.
"I need your collective assistance," the memo said, "in responding to a grand jury subpoena (yes, another subpoena) that E.S.D.C. has received from the Manhattan District Attorney."

HEADLINE: Bradley Challenges Nation To Eliminate Child Poverty

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Describing poverty as a "slow motion national disaster," former Senator Bill Bradley called yesterday for reducing the number of poor children by half over the coming decade by raising the minimum wage, increasing spending on child care programs and providing an array of tax benefits to poor parents who work.
Evoking the Depression and the race to the Moon as challenges the nation had overcome through ingenuity and strong will, Mr. Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination, said it was morally unacceptable for a prosperous America to allow 1 in 5 of its children to live in dire need. 
 "I am issuing a simple challenge today," the former Senator from New Jersey said in a speech at the Concord Baptist Church in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. "If we can achieve the kind of prosperity we have, if we can change the world through our ideas and inventions, if we can muster the will and create the technology to put a man on the Moon in a decade, then surely by all that we hold dear as Americans we can eliminate child poverty as we know it."
Though he has been an outspoken critic of the sweeping welfare changes enacted by Congress in 1996, his last year in the Senate, Mr. Bradley did not propose rolling back that law's major provisions, which include time limits on benefits and work requirements for recipients.
Instead, he outlined a menu of programs that he said would cost the Government $14 billion a year and lift seven million children out of poverty over eight years. He said his proposals could be financed using the portion of the Federal surplus not earmarked for Social Security, projected to be more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
Most of Mr. Bradley's proposals are intended to help families in which at least one parent is employed and that live near or below the poverty line. He would increase the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour, over two years, and require that it automatically go up with inflation. He would increase the earned-income tax credit for families with three or more children and reduce marginal tax rates on families that receive the credit.
Mr. Bradley said he would also raise Federal spending on Head Start, the preschool program for low-income children, to $8.7 billion a year, which would be enough, he asserted, to reach every eligible child. And he would spend $1.3 billion a year to help pay off the student loans of 50,000 college graduates who agree to teach in low-income areas.
Like his call for making health insurance available to virtually all Americans, Mr. Bradley's poverty proposals offered a somewhat more expansive vision for government than had been proposed by Mr. Gore. As such, Mr. Bradley's proposals provided further evidence of his efforts to win over his party's liberal wing, a large, vociferous and energetic faction that often dominates primary elections.
The Vice President announced his own antipoverty program on Wednesday, calling for increasing the minimum wage, cracking down on parents who do not make child support payments and making the earned income tax credit available to more families. In the past, Mr. Gore has also called for universal pre-kindergarten programs and for financing scholarships for 10,000 new teachers.
Yesterday, Mr. Gore's aides said Mr. Bradley had done little to advance the Vice President's ideas.
"It turns out Senator Bradley's big ideas are Gore ideas," said Kiki Moore, Mr. Gore's campaign spokeswoman.
But Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University, said he considered it significant that Mr. Bradley had set clear goals for reducing poverty.
"I can't point to a Presidential candidate in 30 years who has said, 'Let's reduce poverty by this amount,' " said Mr. Aber, who attended Mr. Bradley's speech yesterday but is not supporting any Presidential candidate. "Gore has not put himself in that position yet."
But Susan Eckerly, the chief Senate lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents 600,000 small-business owners, said Mr. Bradley's minimum wage proposal would do little to help the poor because most of the 12 million people earning the minimum wage are teen-agers living at home or single adults. She added that increasing the minimum wage discouraged small companies from hiring young people.
"This is a very blunt instrument to use to get at child poverty," Ms. Eckerly said.
Mr. Bradley's aides said his minimum wage and tax proposals would typically increase the incomes of working-poor families by $2,000 to $3,000 a year. Poverty is defined as earning less than $16,400 a year for a family of four.
Authorities on poverty said the most important element of Mr. Bradley's plan was his proposal to expand the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to encourage poor parents to work. Under current policy, a refundable credit of up to $3,816 a year is given to families with two or more children. The credit is gradually phased out for families earning $12,400 to $30,580 a year.
Mr. Bradley would give larger families more money: $4,500 a year for families with three or more children. He would also phase out the credit at a slower rate, so that families earning higher incomes could keep more of it. And he would eliminate a glitch in the policy that reduces the credit for married couples filing joint tax returns.
Among other elements of Mr. Bradley's plan are these:
*An increase in Federal subsidies for day care by $1 billion a year, enough to provide care for an additional 420,000 low-income children.
*A proposal to make an existing tax credit for child care expenses refundable, so that low-income families with no tax liabilities would receive Government checks to cover their costs for day care and other family expenses.
*A program to create 2,000 community centers, at a cost of $1 billion a year, to provide after-school services and activities for latch-key children.
Mr. Bradley also said he would spend $300 million a year to create 550 group homes for poor teen-age girls during their pregnancies and for one year after childbirth.

HEADLINE: GORE VOWS TO BAN NEW OIL DRILLING ALONG TWO COASTS

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RYE, N.H., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore said today that as President he would ban any new offshore drilling for oil and gas along the California and Florida coasts.
President Clinton last year extended a moratorium on drilling first imposed by President Bush. But the proposal by Mr. Gore, who is battling his Presidential rival, Bill Bradley, for the support of environmental groups, would go beyond that to apply to companies that have already bought billions of dollars worth of leases but have not yet started drilling. 
 Such a ban could be implemented by executive order, but it would immediately set the stage for major legal challenges to a Gore Administration. There are 36 existing leases off California, 146 off Florida.
The ban would not cover drilling in Gulf Coast states other than Florida, where oil and gas exploration is central to the economy and more accepted by government officials and residents, or off the Alaskan coast.
Mr. Gore portrayed his proposal, for which he said he expected to be "attacked," as being part of a bold environmental agenda that he promised would be the centerpiece of his Presidential campaign. The campaign was preparing to broadcast in California tonight a new 30-second commercial on the drilling issue.
"I don't want to worry about oil washing up on the shores of Santa Barbara or Monterey or on any coast, east or west, or on the coast of Florida," he said in a speech to environmentalists here that was also carried via satellite to a group in California.
Mr. Gore's pledge to limit drilling is part of an urgent effort by his campaign to capture the support of the nation's major environmental groups, which so far have not endorsed anyone. This is a blow to the Vice President, a longtime environmentalist whom many perceive as a natural ally of the environmental movement.
By playing hard to get, the groups have forced Mr. Gore to make promises that go beyond the Clinton Administration's policies. It is a tactic that organized labor also used before the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed the Vice President at its annual meeting earlier this month.
Environmentalists have been reluctant to jump behind Mr. Gore in part because of what many see as the Administration's mixed record. They complain that over the years, the White House has not done enough to fight global warming or restrict logging on public lands.
Some environmentalists also consider Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore's sole rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination, a staunch ally. Mr. Bradley, in fact, received higher ratings in the Senate for his work on environmental issues than Mr. Gore did when he served there.
There is also concern among environmentalists, as there is more broadly among Democrats, that Mr. Gore may not be able to win a general election against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, and so they would be better off not making an endorsement.
The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, the nation's top two mainstream politically active environmental groups, have not rallied behind the Vice President. The groups' top officials, some of whom privately back Mr. Gore, say that they have never endorsed candidates during the Democratic primary process.
A third national environmental group active in politics, Friends of the Earth, has endorsed Mr. Bradley.
"We're seeing the major party candidates fighting to capture our hearts," said Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters.
Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said that neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bradley had articulated a comprehensive vision for the future. "The differences in their records doesn't warrant our making a choice between them," he said.
Polls show that the environment is a central issue with many voters, especially swing voters in the suburbs and women.
Mr. Bradley has a lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters of 84 percent, a reflection mainly of his work on environmental problems in New Jersey, which he represented in the Senate for 18 years.
Mr. Gore had a rating of 64 percent, which reflected several absences from votes during his career, the large number of toxic Superfund sites in Tennessee that have not been cleaned up, as well as Mr. Gore's father's position on the boards of coal companies that were involved in strip-mining.
Even Mr. Gore acknowledged today that Mr. Bradley had a strong record. "I haven't challenged his commitment to the environment," Mr. Gore said. "I think he has a pretty good voting record on the environment."
Mr. Gore said that the difference between them was that he was a leader on various environmental issues, citing his role in passing the law to clean up Superfund sites and his campaign against global warming.
But officials from the environmental groups are skeptical.
"Many environmentalists feel Clinton-Gore have been lax in leading on global-climate issues," Ms. Callahan told an audience in New York on Tuesday night that included Mr. Bradley.
Mr. Pope said that Mr. Bradley's problem was that he had not made clear how central the environment was to his candidacy.
He said Mr. Gore's problem was that "because he has said so much on the environment in the past, it will be hard for him to say something bold and new."
Mr. Gore's other big task, Mr. Pope said, is to re-establish his environmental credentials, because "Bill Clinton has diminished Gore's environmental reputation over the last seven years."
Mr. Gore seemed to be addressing some of these concerns today. He was more assertive than he has been so far about staking his candidacy on environmental issues.
He noted that he was going further -- "significantly further" -- than the Clinton Administration in banning the use of future drilling leases.
His statement brought swift reaction from the oil and gas industries, which promised to keep pushing to drill in new areas.
"There is a long way between now and Al Gore's inauguration," said Robert Stewart, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group for offshore contractors.
The industry is already embroiled in a dispute over an existing lease off Florida owned by Chevron, which has asked Commerce Secretary William M. Daley to overturn Florida's efforts to block the company's drilling plan. Mr. Daley's decision could come early next year.
Mr. Gore mentioned the Florida conflict but did not give his view on what Mr. Daley should do. A spokeswoman said the Vice President thought it would be "inappropriate to interfere in the existing process."
But Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said the Vice President's position "sends a loud message to the Commerce Department: reject Chevron's offshore drilling application."
Mr. Gore's proposal could have the broadest impact on drilling off California, where various companies have obtained 40 leases near the Central Coast, many off southern San Luis Obispo County.
There are indications of vast deposits of oil under the sea bed, perhaps up to one billion barrels. The rights, valued at about $1.2 billion, were obtained from 1968 to 1984. They have remained undeveloped so far.
Mr. Gore said that the benefits to all citizens of fishing, tourism and appreciation of beautiful vistas "far outweigh" any monetary benefits to the oil industry from "the tiny little bit of extra oil" that would come from drilling.

HEADLINE: COURT ORDERS CITY TO ALLOW PROTEST BY KU KLUX KLAN

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
A Federal court ruled last night that the Ku Klux Klan must be allowed to demonstrate in lower Manhattan this weekend, saying that the Giuliani administration had violated the group's First Amendment rights by refusing to permit the rally if Klan members wore their traditional masks.
In ordering that the protest could proceed tomorrow afternoon, a special two-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan also elicited a promise from a top city lawyer that the Klan members would not be arrested at the demonstration for wearing masks, which is against state law. 
 In issuing their ruling, the judges did not go as far as the Klan had sought, which was to declare the state's antimask law unconstitutional in all cases. The Klan has sought to overturn such laws across the country and has been successful in some cases, including in towns in Indiana and Pennsylvania.
After the hearing, city officials said they would file an appeal this morning with the United States Court of Appeals, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani issued a statement sharply critical of the ruling. "This is another example of the ideology extended from the 60's," Mr. Giuliani said. "This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for what they say or what they do, even as they support organizations that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and hatred."
The judges also rejected a claim that the First Amendment rights of a group of Klan opponents had been violated when they were turned down by the police after seeking to stage a rally to drown out the Klan demonstration.
The Klan sued the city on Tuesday after its organizers were told by the police that they could not hold their rally, which was expected to draw between 50 and 80 Klan members, if they insisted on wearing their masks along with their traditional robes and pointed hoods. The group had said it chose New York City in part to challenge its antimask law.
Two leaders of the group, the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, testified at yesterday's packed hearing. Jeffery L. Berry, the leader, or national imperial wizard, of the group, acknowledged in court that his rallies have often drawn violent reactions from protesters, who throw bottles, rocks and other objects at Klan members.
After the decision, Mr. Berry said: "The Constitution was there. The judges are sworn to uphold the Constitution. And they done it."
The Giuliani administration has denied rally permits to other contentious groups and fought losing court battles to keep them from demonstrating.
In this case, the city had argued in court that the mask law was intended not to stifle unpopular speech but to enable the Police Department to do its job at rallies where the potential for violence existed. In explaining the reason for the city's appeal today, Michael D. Hess, New York City's Corporation Counsel, cited the violence seen at Klan rallies that Mr. Berry testified about in court.
"When we as a city are faced with this type of violence," Mr. Hess said, it was important for the police "that the identity of every individual be known. We want to discourage violence, and one way to discourage violence is to know who you're faced with," he said. "The court, we feel, erred in saying that masks can be used because that takes away from the Police Department's ability to identify people and hold them responsible for their actions if there is violence."
But the judges, Harold Baer Jr. and Alvin K. Hellerstein, while sympathizing with the department's predicament, said there had been no testimony suggesting that the Klan members were likely to engage in violence themselves. Citing Supreme Court decisions that protect certain forms of conduct or expression under the First Amendment, the judges said they agreed with the Klan's position that the masks afforded the group's members anonymity and protection from potential retaliation in their home communities or jobs.
"Masks have a -- perhaps tortured is a good word to use -- history in the United States," Judge Hellerstein said, "creating fear, and fear of physical violence on the part of one group of our citizens, and creating the message of hate and spite and everything that America does not stand for." But, he said, masks also reflect "a fear of people who express themselves in various parts of our society, including the society of New York, that they may be subject to harm, both physical and economic, if they are unmasked and their identities are known."
Judge Baer quoted Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, saying, "I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country."
The judges' decision could be upheld today by the appeals court, or overturned, which could make Klan members subject to arrest if they held the rally in masks.
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Klan, said his clients planned to keep trying to overturn the mask law.
In a second ruling, the judges turned down a claim from an anti-Klan group, the Partisan Defense Committee, which said the police had violated its First Amendment rights by rejecting its request for a permit for a rally with sound amplification during the Klan march.
Rachel H. Wolkenstein, a lawyer for the committee, told the judges that the group had wanted to demonstrate at the same time and place as the Klan, in front of the State Supreme Court at 60 Centre Street. She said that amplified sound was an integral part of the group's strategy, which was to gather in large numbers and try to drown out the Klan members, or even discourage them from appearing in the first place.
But Judge Hellerstein said he and Judge Baer had concluded that the "very purpose of this counterdemonstration is to snuff out the free speech of perhaps a very hateful group, but nevertheless a group intent on using the First Amendment to express itself and for others to come to listen to that expression."
Ms. Wolkenstein said that her group would also appeal today.
In defending the mask law, another city lawyer, Daniel S. Connolly, told the judges that the police would have a more difficult task when facing a crowd of masked demonstrators who, "emboldened by the shield of anonymity," could break the law, knowing it would be hard for them to be identified.
But Mr. Berry, in his testimony, said his five-year-old group differed from the Klan of the past. Calling the American Knights a "nonviolent Christian white civil rights group," he rejected the idea that he belonged to "a hate group" that would use violence. "I have never hung anybody," he said. "I have never killed anybody. And I have never beaten up anybody because of their religious beliefs or the color of their skin."
Later, in an assertion that drew an audible gasp from spectators, he added: "This is the 90's. Like Rodney King said, 'Why can't we all get along?' "

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the city increased to 7.2 percent in September from 6.9 percent in August. Unemployment in September 1998 was 7.9 percent. 
 The seasonally adjusted number for the state last month was 5.3 percent, up from 5.1 percent in August. The rate for September last year was 5.5 percent. The national unemployment rate last month was 4.2 percent. The state rate excluding New York City was 4.1 percent.
The number of private sector jobs in the state has grown by 1.9 percent since September 1998. There were 6.97 million private sector jobs last month, the highest seasonally adjusted level ever recorded.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
Suffragists Slept Here And Roused a Nation

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
"I am at the boiling point!" Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote to Susan B. Anthony about the fledging women's rights movement in the spring of 1852. "If I do not find some day the use of my tongue on this question, I shall die of an intellectual repression, a woman's rights convulsion! Oh, Susan! Susan! Susan! You must manage to spend a week with me before the Rochester convention, for I am afraid that I cannot attend it. . . . How much I do long to be free from housekeeping and children, so as to have some time to read and think and write."
Stanton's cry of frustration was sent from Seneca Falls, N.Y., her unhappy home on the outskirts of what was then a depressing 19th-century mill town. Anthony, who would be her friend and collaborator in the fight for suffrage over the next half century, was in Rochester in a prosperous neighborhood of merchants and bankers, an enormous psychic distance but only 50 miles on the map. Jane Hunt, who was the host of the 1848 tea party that gave birth to the first women's rights convention, was only three miles from Seneca Falls, in Waterloo, N.Y. Mary Ann M'Clintock, whose home was the site for the drafting of the Declaration of Sentiments read by Stanton at the Seneca Falls convention, was in Waterloo, too. 
 Only 12 miles west of Seneca Falls, in Geneva, N.Y., Elizabeth Blackwell received the first medical degree conferred on a woman, in 1849. That same year, in Seneca Falls, Amelia Bloomer started The Lily, her women's rights publication. Eight years later, just 25 miles east of Geneva, Harriet Tubman settled in Auburn, N.Y., after helping hundreds of slaves reach freedom on the Underground Railroad.
The geography is striking: so many women seeking reform rose to prominence in such a short time span in such a small space in western New York! Not long ago, my husband and I and our two children, ages 9 and 5, spent a long, glorious weekend exploring the area.
Since there were a lot of musty 19th-century houses to be seen, we interspersed the antiques and display cases with parks, beaches, vineyards and some of the most elaborate hotels of the Finger Lakes. As a result, the children were kept from mutiny -- in fact, our 9-year-old daughter enjoyed much of the Women's Rights National Historical Park -- while the adults found the weekend a revelation. Trips are so often geared to one huge (male) historical figure, like Jefferson at Monticello. But we found it a more intimate experience to pick out a series of less monumental homes that serve as a record of women connected by time, place and passion.
We started out late on a Friday night from our home in Westchester County, drove two hours to Albany, then collapsed at a motel. This gave us a good start on Saturday for the Anthony house in Rochester, four hours away.
We arrived in time for an afternoon tour of the well-tended, three-story red-brick house with wisteria growing alongside the front porch. Anthony lived here for the last 40 years of her life, her most politically active period, when she traveled extensively for suffrage. Inside is a proper Victorian home, now a dark and sleepy museum, but with touching mementos: Anthony's satchel and alligator purse, walls of pictures of suffrage leaders, the simple bed in which Anthony died.
Our well-informed and talkative guide, Betty Allinger, related one of the most famous stories associated with Anthony and the house: how in 1872 Anthony tested the laws and voted, only to be arrested at home two weeks later by a United States deputy marshal, then taken away in a streetcar. When the conductor asked Anthony for her fare, Anthony retorted, "I'm traveling at the expense of the Government."
The next morning, Sunday, we went to tour the home of Stanton, which I had seen on a previous trip, only to learn that one guide was off and the other out sick. As a result the house would be closed until Thursday. (I recommend calling ahead to all the houses when planning a trip; despite what guidebooks say about hours, many are open at odd times.) Grumpily wondering if this would ever happen at Monticello, I was still able to tour the visitors' center of the Women's Rights National Historical Park as well as the restored Wesleyan Chapel, where the first women's rights convention was held. The park, part of the National Park Service, is scattered across urban parcels in Seneca Falls and Waterloo, and includes the Stanton house on the edge of town.
When I returned home, I called Jack E. Shay, the park service ranger who had led my extensive tour of the Stanton house on the earlier trip and who is also the co-author of "Arcane America," which he called a "thinking person's travelogue" about 101 of the best places you've never heard of. Mr. Shay can tell you all about Stanton's wallpaper (mostly a white-and-green floral, one of the brighter patterns of the day) and her piano (a Gilbert from Boston).
Stanton's house is a light and relatively airy white clapboard farmhouse, with elements of modified Greek Revival style, decorated with Stanton's original mahogany fold-open desk. "She had good taste," Mr. Shay said. "She was used to living in rather expensive digs." The house is missing two wings, but it still has a feeling associated with its most famous owner: clean, strong, confident lines, no nonsense, no gewgaws.
Stanton, who supplied the speeches that Anthony delivered ("I forged the thunderbolts and Susan fired them"), had moved from Boston, where she had been part of a progressive, liberal circle that included William Lloyd Garrison, Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The switch to Seneca Falls seems to have been made for her husband's political career in the Legislature in Albany and also because her father, an influential judge and former congressman, owned the house and gave it to the couple. Although Stanton despised the drudgery of Seneca Falls, she also admitted in a letter to Anthony that "it may be well for me to understand all the trials of woman's lot, that I may more eloquently proclaim them when the time comes."
On Sunday we also took a look at the big, four-columned, red-brick Jane Hunt house on East Main Street in Waterloo, from the outside only. The house is privately owned, but there was a for-sale sign out front. The real estate agent, Greg Peet, will tell you that the asking price is $139,900 for three bedrooms, three baths and history. The park service said it was interested in buying the house, and Mr. Peet said the owners were concerned about its preservation, but he also said they wanted to sell to the highest bidder. Not far away is the M'Clintock house, a red-brick Federal-style building owned by the park service and under extensive restoration. We peeked briefly inside; it is a shell at the moment.
In Geneva we looked for the site of the Geneva Medical College, long burned down, which Elizabeth Blackwell attended. On Main Street we found all that's left, a plaque, and also Joan Braun, who came out of her house when she saw us looking confused. Mrs. Braun, the immediate past president of the Geneva Chamber of Commerce, showed us where the college had been, then invited us in to see her house and its view of Seneca Lake. I asked if people came by often on the trail of Dr. Blackwell. "All the time," she said. "I love it."
Then she pointed us to an Elizabeth Blackwell statue a short walk away on the campus of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, a tribute to a woman who was rejected by at least 15 medical schools before her admission to Geneva. On the statue is part of an 1847 letter that Blackwell sent from Geneva: "I cannot but congratulate myself on having found at last the right place for my beginning."
Our last stop was the Harriet Tubman home, where the Rev. Paul G. Carter and his wife, Christine, showed the children an evocative cartoon of Tubman's life, then gave us a tour of the simple two-story white-frame house with a big front porch. Most of the furnishings are not original, but Tubman's bed and Bible are, and the tour was somber and moving.
We spent one night at Belhurst Castle in Geneva, an expensive old ivy-covered Romanesque pile that looks out dramatically over Seneca Lake, and another at Geneva-on-the-Lake, a small resort just up the road that has less personality and higher prices than Belhurst Castle. We had a basic tour and wine-tasting at the Wagner Winery in Lodi, a good lunch at the vineyard's Ginny Lee Cafe and a good dinner at Pasta Only's Cobblestone Restaurant in Geneva. One of the highlights for the children was a hike up through the amazing gorge at Watkins Glen State Park at the southern end of Seneca Lake in Watkins Glen.
Why did so many female reformers spring up out of western New York in the mid-19th century? There's no simple answer, but it was a time of ferment, of great pressure for social change -- abolitionism, temperance, religious revivalism, prison and education reform -- and of great economic development. The opening of the Erie Canal not only transformed New York City, but also made the towns between Lake Erie and Manhattan -- including Seneca Falls, Rochester, Waterloo and Geneva -- important centers of commerce and thought.
All of that is available in books. But what is available only by traveling is the sense of history by proximity, of seeing how geography led to connections and then ideas. In house after house, the connections came up: Tubman knew Anthony through the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who knew everyone, including Stanton, who knew Hunt and M'Clintock and Bloomer, who introduced Stanton to Anthony. And it was Stanton who in 1861 recorded in her diary that she had "fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with the help of Harriet Tubman."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Weekend on Friday about visits to women's history landmarks in western New York misidentified the suffragist who wrote an 1861 diary passage saying she had "fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with the help of Harriet Tubman." The author was Susan B. Anthony, not Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
A listing with the article misstated the subtitle and price for the book "Susan B. Anthony Slept Here." It is "A Guide to American Women's Landmarks," not "A Guide to American Women's Monuments," and it costs $20, not $7.99.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Lot of Attention for a Small El Al Plane Deal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Airbus Industrie released blueprints for a synagogue in the sky: a converted business-class lounge, complete with ark and Torah.
Boeing, not known as a patron of the arts here, helped haul in 64 tons of Alaskan ice for a Seattle sculptor's installation at Jerusalem's city gates. 
 Behind the scenes, European ambassadors and American Cabinet members were button-holing Israeli officials, promoting the purported advantages of the Airbus 340 over the Boeing 777, or vice versa, and hinting at diplomatic consequences should the sale go the wrong way.
Flying synagogues and melting arctic ice cubes are two of the more visible products of a yearlong public relations battle between the world's dominant aircraft manufacturers, which are vying to supply Israel's national airline with its next generation of midsize jets.
But when El Al's board meets Monday to award the contract, it is the invisible but palpable pressure from the United States and the European Union that may prove decisive.
"It is a campaign that clearly has a political aspect," said Alan Dupiech, an Airbus spokesman. "There is strong political pressure in Israel from the U.S., but for the first time there is nearly an equal response from Europe."
The competitors acknowledge that their aggressive campaigns here are disproportionate to the sale's size: El Al is deciding between three B-777's and two A330's and two A340's, an approximately $400 million order that would expand its long-range fleet by 900 to 1,000 seats. Airbus and Boeing fill contracts on that scale almost every month.
But for both companies, Israel and its airline are a powerful symbol.
Israel's dependence on American military and economic help has made it loath to place big aircraft orders anywhere except the United States. El Al is one of the few remaining all-Boeing international airlines, and Boeing wants to keep it that way. "We have had more high-level executive visits per potential airplane sold than in any sales campaign ever," one Boeing executive said.
Boeing has also had more high-level Washington help than usual for a three-jet contract. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers raised the issue with Israel's Finance Minister, and Commerce Secretary William M. Daley pressed Boeing's case here this month with Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
"Nobody likes to lose competition because it fuels the next deal," Mr. Daley said. "You get on a roll. Boeing was on that roll for a long time, with no competition, or very little from Airbus. Airbus is now a very real, serious competitor."
Boeing's fear, and Airbus's hope, is that an El Al contract would give Airbus bragging rights in a midsize market that is expected to double from 1,500 jets now to 3,000 in two decades. If Airbus can sell here, it reasons, it can sell anywhere, because of a perception that Israel would buy European jets only if they were clearly superior, technically and economically.
For Boeing, though, the American connection is more carrot than stick. In one pointed display of its resources, Boeing senior executives were holding a weekend meeting with Israeli military industry leaders to discuss new contracts with local subcontractors, which already total $150 million yearly -- much of it financed by United States military appropriations.
John Leahy, the executive vice president in charge of commercial sales for Airbus Industrie, lashed out on Tuesday at what he called unfair support for Boeing from the United States. But the Europeans have applied leverage of their own.
Last week, the French, German, British and European Union ambassadors to Israel trooped into the office of Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen to make their own pitch for Airbus. After expressing hope that the sale would be "independent of political considerations," the ambassadors promised that an Airbus order "would undoubtedly lead to more extensive Israeli-European cooperation in the sphere of aeronautics," according to a ministry account of the meeting.
That promise is tempting. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is controlled by the newly merged military giants Aerospatiale of France and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, in partnership with British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain.
Israel's competitive but small state-run aeronautics industry has been seeking European supply deals and technological partnerships.
"Three or four planes is not a huge thing, but collaboration with a $10-billion-plus program certainly is," one Airbus executive said.
After listening, Mr. Cohen told the four diplomats what almost nobody here believes: Israel's Government "is not involved in the independent El Al decision, which will be made exclusively on economic and technical grounds."
As a state-owned airline with a board of political appointees, it is difficult for El Al not to be perceived as a division of the Government. Officials here worry openly about the repercussions on Capitol Hill if El Al were to spend $400 million on European aircraft at a time when Israel is lobbying for a special $1.2 billion Congressional appropriation to cover the costs of withdrawal from the West Bank.
Airbus also worries about Washington. In 1997, after an advisory committee urged El Al to buy the midrange Airbus 320 instead of the Boeing 737, El Al's board rejected the recommendation and opted for Boeing planes instead. To seal the deal, Boeing cut its price by 6 percent, a discount Airbus said it never had a chance to match. "Two years ago we were defeated at the ultimate minute by a decision that was hard for us to understand," Mr. Dupiech said this week. "Even if we lose this one due to politics, we will know that we tried."
Trying to debunk the notion of an all-American company fighting a wholly European competitor, Airbus says it provides more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. "Israelis say they have to back United States industry, but 40 percent of the content of the A340 is American," Mr. Dupiech said. Besides, he said, "If American and United can buy Airbus, why can't El Al?"
In their final presentations to El Al this week, the main battleground was price. Though neither company would disclose its terms, company officials agreed privately that on a per-passenger basis, the four Airbus jets were cheaper than the three Boeing planes. Boeing has countered with a proposal to guarantee discounted prices now for future El Al purchases, and has argued that keeping the fleet homogeneous will bring additional savings in training and maintenance.
"We take every customer seriously," said Jim Frank, the Boeing salesman responsible for trying to secure the deal, "but when a customer is using only Boeing equipment, it takes on a higher level of importance."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Agreement on Banking Plan Leads to Widespread Gains

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks powered ahead yesterday after the Clinton Administration and top Republican lawmakers announced that they had reached an agreement to overhaul the nation's financial system, paving the way for mergers in the financial services industry that could create financial supermarkets.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 172.56 points, nearly 1.7 percent, to end at 10,470.25. For the week, the Dow was up 450.54 points, its best weekly gain since July. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,958 to 1,075, on active trading of 959.2 million shares on the Big Board.
"The stars of the show certainly are financial stocks, but nearly everything is up," said Trude Latimer, an independent stockbroker in Charlottesville, Va.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 14.55, or 0.52 percent, to 2,816.52. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 18.04, or 1.4 percent, to 1,301.65.
In the Treasury market, prices finished narrowly mixed. Treasury prices, which often move inversely to stock prices, were trading slightly higher before stocks opened but came under immediate pressure when stock prices opened sharply higher, traders said.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond faded from its opening high but managed to end with a slim 4/32 gain at 97 3/32, yielding 6.34 percent, in late New York trading, down from 6.35 percent on Thursday. The price and yield move in opposite directions.
Banking and insurance stocks surged after the White House and Congress agreed on a banking overhaul bill. The move is seen as speeding up mergers in the business by repealing Depression-era laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance industries from moving into one another's businesses.
Leading the Dow were American Express, up 3 3/4, to 148 5/8; J. P. Morgan,, up 8 7/16, to 125 5/8, and Citigroup, up 1 1/4, to 48 3/16.
Among insurance stocks, Travelers Property Casualty, which belongs to Citigroup, gained 4 15/16, to 33; Chubb rose 2 15/16, to 48 13/16, and Hartford Life added 3 9/16, to 41 3/16.
The optical networking company Sycamore Networks posted a large enough rise on its first day of trading to give it one of the best market debuts ever. The stock closed up a stunning 146 3/4 at 184 3/4.
Meanwhile, I.B.M. rose 2 15/16, to 93 15/16, retaking a small portion of the steep losses of the previous two days after it issued a profit warning for the next two quarters, citing consumer worries over Year 2000 problems.
"Over all, earnings have been coming out very strong, and it looks like we're going to see double-digit gains" for companies in the third quarter, said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in Chicago.
On Monday, six Dow components are scheduled to report earnings: AT&T, American Express, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Union Carbide, Chevron and Exxon.
In the Treasury market, the absence of economic data and of remarks from Federal Reserve officials, gave traders little support.
Looking at next week, the third-quarter employment cost index scheduled for Thursday is especially important. The Government will also release the advance estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product growth that day.
The employment cost index jumped 1.1 percent in the second quarter. In a poll by Reuters, economists offered a preliminary average estimate for a rise of none-tenth of a percent in the index for the third quarter.
Speaking of the Treasury market, Michael McGlone, vice president at IBJ Lanston Futures said: "The market got itself locked in a narrow range," but added, "We should break out of this range next week."

HEADLINE: Roscoe Egger Jr., 79, Dies; Former Head of the I.R.S.

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Roscoe L. Egger Jr., a commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in the Reagan Administration, died on Oct. 14 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was 79 and lived in Green Valley, Ariz.
He died after angioplasty to open arteries in his heart, said his wife, Betty. 
 Mr. Egger headed the I.R.S. from 1981 to 1986, a period of tumult at the service. Its computers were dated; its budget was under fire; the tax code was constantly being changed, and the number of returns being filed was increasing.
In 1985, Mr. Egger issued a rare apology to taxpayers after the service lost hundreds of thousands of returns, some of which were found in trash cans, and refunds were delayed because of computer problems.
In his last year in office, Mr. Egger secured money to upgrade the agency's computer system. He also helped develop a sweeping tax law that simplified the Federal tax code and closed some loopholes.
Roscoe Lynn Egger Jr. was born on Sept. 19, 1920, in Jackson, Mich. He graduated from Indiana University and served in the Army in World War II, receiving a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He then earned a law degree from George Washington University.
Mr. Egger went to work for the General Accounting Office and later was a private tax accountant. He also practiced law for several years before joining Price Waterhouse in 1956. He was head of the firm's office of Government services when he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be commissioner. Mr. Egger was the second certified public accountant to head the service.
He returned to Price Waterhouse as a consultant after retiring from the I.R.S. in 1990.
Besides his wife, Mr. Egger is survived by two daughters, Gabrielle Shaykin of Westport, Conn., and Antoinette Taylor of Chevy Chase, Md.; two stepdaughters, Cathe Schultz of Alexandria, Va., and Martha Coutts of Burlingame, Calif.; a stepson, Steven Spear of Centreville, Va.; two sisters, Gertrude Rigle of Jackson, and Beatrice Luce of Bowling Green, Ohio, and seven grandchildren.
A story Mr. Egger often used to tell, about what he thought was widespread noncompliance with the tax laws, became well known.
Once, Mr. Egger said, while he was awaiting confirmation as tax commissioner, he was in a taxi on his way to a make a speech, and the driver began talking about the sagging economy, his rising costs and byzantine taxi regulations.
When Mr. Egger asked how he coped, the cabby confided that the only way to make enough money was to cheat on his taxes.
Mr. Egger said nothing; the poor cab driver, the commissioner figured, would never have believed who his passenger was.

HEADLINE: Hard Hats and Cranes Abloom in City Center

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Fourteen years ago, Dean Jernigan, son of a carpenter and a department store clerk, sensed the stirrings of a trend. "I saw major consumption," he said, "a society that likes to collect things." Too many things for attics and storerooms.
So Mr. Jernigan built some you-rent-it garages on Summer Avenue, the street where an entrepreneur opened the nation's first Holiday Inn in 1952.. 
 Mr. Jernigan turned out to have been similarly prescient. Society's itch to consume and collect became an engine of the nation's most prosperous, most acquisitive decade in at least a century. More than 300,000 customers are now paying Mr. Jernigan's Storage USA from $60 to $200 a month to park the jetsam of their affluence in 34 million square feet of garages in 31 states at 500 sites, including 30 in Memphis.
His good fortune is contributing to a rebirth of Memphis's downtown. Ravaged since the 1970's by white flight to the eastern reaches of the city and the Shelby County suburbs beyond, the city center is now abloom with hard hats and cranes.
With several big projects under way among the boarded-over buildings and check-cashing shops, downtown Memphis is savoring the bounty of prosperity.
It is the kind of prosperity filtering through hundreds of communities these days. Previously whipsawed by three- or four-year spurts of growth that crashed in recessions, most cities are reaping unaccustomed benefits from the nearly nine years of uninterrupted economic growth.
The growth of many cities like Dallas, Nashville and Atlanta has been orchestrated by coteries of business and political leaders. But there is less such cohesion in Memphis. Instead, this city has sprung open to the fantasies of businessmen who with more freedom than those of many other cities can go off and build something big.
"Memphis is not an establishment-driven city," Henry M. Turley, a leading downtown developer, said. "It is an entrepreneurial city."
In Memphis, prosperity has broken out in all directions. Mr. Jernigan is building the city's first downtown baseball park, a $75-million, five-story, 14,000-seat home for the Redbirds, a minor league team of the St. Louis Cardinals. Mr. Jernigan, 53, and his wife and partner in philanthropy, Kristi, 36, bought the team and brought it to Memphis. They are renovating the abandoned William R. Moore Building, adjacent to the ball park, for a new home for Storage USA, including an apartment for themselves.
Directly east, out Poplar Avenue beyond midtown, toward the suburbs of Germantown and Collierville, cheek-by-jowl neo-Colonial mansions and upscale malls are replacing older, midscale, mostly closer-in malls built in the 1970's and 1980's.
Contemporary art galleries, new for Memphis, have opened. At the four-year-old Ledbetter Lusk Gallery on Poplar Avenue, David Lusk, an owner, points to a large surreal painting by Colin McLain, formerly of Memphis, now of New York and Provincetown, Mass. It depicts faceless men in black and white striped prison suits. The suits have vests and white collars. They might be swindlers and frauds, or they might be the workaholic slaves of prosperity.
"A Colin McLain could not have sold here 10 years ago, even for $1,000," Mr. Lusk said. "That one is $4,500. Our average price now is probably $5,000, $6,000."
A little south of the upscale mall housing the gallery is the big Mall of Memphis, once a citywide center of shopping, now catering mostly to black Memphians. At least six shops sell jewelry, mostly watches priced below $1,000 and gold bracelets and chains for men and women.
Farther south is a wholly different kind of commerce. Running mile upon mile along Shelby Drive, past the airport and runways of Federal Express and the new sorting plant of United Parcel Service, are the low-lying blocks of mostly gray, largely windowless buildings with the gaping square holes of loading docks, a mark of the city's emergence as the leading jet-age cargo hub.
"We're in the general cargo warehousing business," said W. Neely Mallory, who has moved onto Shelby Drive, far beyond the cotton warehouses downtown that built the family fortune. "We're in everything from rolls of paper to bubble gum to Nintendo games."
 The speed with which all those goods come and go sharpens Memphis's edge in today's economy, Mr. Mallory said. At midcontinent intersections of road, river and air traffic, Memphis has positioned itself to exploit modern industry's demand for just-in-time delivery of goods at the instant that factories, stores and consumers need them and not a day before.
It is downtown, however, where prosperity is blinding. Employment in construction, most of it downtown and at the airport, has jumped nearly 60 percent in seven years. Besides the new stadium, developers are rebuilding Beale Street, the railroad station and the convention center. New office buildings, movie theaters, condominiums and stores are opening in century-old shells.
W. J. Michael Cody, 63, former United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, works for a 91-year-old law firm downtown, housed in an exotic Romanesque three-story building that was once the home of the now-defunct Tennessee Club.
"We're getting ready to spend $4 million for a new four-story building to tie into this one," Mr. Cody said. "The prosperity has been translated into our confidence to spend that kind of money and make a commitment to downtown Memphis. We wouldn't have done it in a less prosperous time."
Downtown development has been spurred, too, by the Shelby County Mayor, Jim Rout, and by the Memphis Mayor, Willie Herenton, who recently won re-election to a third four-year term. They have provided generous tax breaks and regulatory relief to give developers incentives to build.
One agent of the downtown's rebirth is Joseph R. Hyde 3d, 56, who founded Autozone, a nationwide chain of 2,700 car-repair shops that he started in 1979.
In 1993, Mr. Hyde, known by the nickname Pitt, put his corporate headquarters on the site of an abandoned cotton warehouse, the first company to build downtown in 20 years.
"I wouldn't have done it if Pitt Hyde hadn't done it," Mr. Jernigan said of his own decision to move into the Moore Building. Mr. Hyde is paying $3.75 million for 25-year rights to name the ball field Autozone Park, and he is now leading the fund-raising to expand the National Civil Rights Museum, site of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a top tourist attraction.
An earlier agent of downtown revival was Jack Belz, 71. Twenty-four years ago, Mr. Belz paid $675,000 for the opulent old Peabody Hotel, which was then shuttered, and said he had poured $45 million into restoring it.
More recently, in partnership with Mr. Turley, Mr. Belz has expanded into developing close-in and stylish, high- and middle-income houses on the South Bluffs of the Mississippi riverfront and on Mud Island, a sandbar in the Mississippi separated from downtown by the narrow Wolf River.
Mr. Turley has built his home in South Bluffs, one with a goldfish pond in the vestibule, buttons he flicks like light switches to fill the house with the blues and jazz, and soaring glass walls overlooking his black-bottom pool, the wide Mississippi and the forest beyond.
With his tie loose and seat belt unfastened, he takes the wheel of his silver BMW convertible sports car and rolls out his cobblestone driveway for a tour of the more than $200 million in projects he has developed in and around downtown.
He passes Cordelia's, the grocery store he built and named for his mother, and the two riverfront warehouses where he is building loft apartments. He passes his and Mr. Belz's 132-acre Harbor Town development on Mud Island and crosses the Wolf River back to the mainland and the north side of town. He comes to the bleak, partly boarded-over Hurt Village and Lauderdale Courts, two public housing projects filled with crime and poverty.
Mr. Belz and Mr. Turley have agreed to forgo their customary profit to manage the rehabilitation of the 1,000 living units there for mixed-income, public and private housing.
Flush with his new prosperity, Mr. Turley said: "You got a big old wad of money in your pocket. The rich economy gives you economic resources, and it gives you psychic resources." Whether for good or for evil, he said, "it enables you to do more of what you want to do."
In Memphis, the building is a spontaneous eruption. Local government has helped fuel it with financial incentives. But Memphis, unlike Dallas or Atlanta or Pittsburgh, lacks a boss or a large and coherent coterie of business leaders to join the government in steering development.
A century ago, a blue-blood class of cotton, lumber and warehousing merchants ruled Memphis. Through the most of the first half of this century, the Tammany-like boss Edward H. Crump was in charge, but he leaned on the merchant clans to get things done.
These days, however, such an absence of coherent leadership can be a problem. Herman C. Ewing, president and chief executive of the Memphis Urban League, said: "We have difficulty getting consensus on items that warrant answers, like tax policy and development. We live in a city where the merit of an idea takes second place to who endorses it."

HEADLINE: First Amendment Decisions;
The Klan Loses

 BODY:
Yesterday's decision by a federal appellate panel upholding New York City's right to forbid masked Ku Klux Klan members to stage a rally today in lower Manhattan was a legal victory for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani but a low moment for the First Amendment and a city that prizes freedom of expression. Few would quarrel with Mr. Giuliani's depiction of the Klan as a "disgusting, horrible organization that represents the very worst of American history." But when the city is allowed to selectively target the free-speech rights of a deservedly unpopular group like the Klan, it diminishes the rights of everyone.
The decision by the three-judge appeals panel overturned Thursday's ruling by two district judges that rebuffed the city's attempt to block the "white pride" rally. The city had cited a rarely invoked provision of the state penal code that makes it unlawful to be masked or disguised in a public place except in connection with a masquerade party and with the permission of city officials. The Police Department refused to permit the rally if Klan members insisted on wearing their traditional masks, saying it would make it hard to identify people in the event of violence. 
 No testimony suggested that Klan members were likely to engage in violence. But the lower court recognized that the Klan's fearsome masks -- themselves a form of symbolic hate speech -- afford members protection against threats of physical and economic retaliation for their views.
In its reversal, the appeals panel said the city was not trying to bar the rally because of the Klan's views but merely enforcing an existing state law. That interpretation conveniently ignored the city's selective invocation of the anti-masking provision. It also raced past a line of Supreme Court cases protecting the anonymous speech of pariah groups, and other federal court rulings tossing out similar anti-mask provisions on First Amendment grounds.

HEADLINE: A NEW FINANCIAL ERA: THE IMPACT;
Financial Services Industry Faces a New World

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
During the careers of every living executive in the finance industry, bankers have made loans, brokers have sold stocks, insurers have underwritten policies to protect against disasters, and, with exceptions that sometimes made headlines, they rarely trespassed on one another's turf.
This gentlemanly division of labor was intended to make sure that a catastrophic failure in one part of the finance industry did not invade every other part -- or, more precisely, that a stock market crash would not undermine the entire financial system as it did in 1929. It worked, and it has more or less endured: Even today, after a decade that has witnessed extensive consolidation and diversification in finance, it is not inaccurate to think of Chase Manhattan as a lender, Merrill Lynch as a broker, and Prudential as an insurer, though they all do other things as well. 
 But with Congress about to consign the rules that underlie that tripartite division of financial services to history, industry executives and analysts say it is only a matter of time before changes already under way mean that the largest financial companies will offer many ways of saving, investing, borrowing and protecting money under one roof. The Europeans call this a universal bank, and many say they believe that American companies are moving headlong in that direction.
Shares in bank, insurance and securities companies soared yesterday on merger speculation. The biggest winners were life insurance companies, which some saw as prime targets of banks hoping to offer insurance to their customers. Investors see banks and Wall Street firms as effectively in play as well, though industry executives said that change might come slower than was suggested by yesterday's market reaction.
Consumers stand to gain from the convenience of finding every financial product they need in one place, often for less money than they are accustomed to paying. But consumer groups have already begun to raise red flags about privacy in a world in which the same company insures a customer for both sickness and early death, or tracks how much debt a client is incurring through mortgages, credit cars and margin loans. The financial provider as big brother might theoretically discriminate against providing life insurance for people with shaky medical histories, or inundate those who owe lots of money with high-cost loans.
The concept of one-stop shopping, of course, is not a new one. American Express, the credit card company, already lets clients trade stocks. Merrill Lynch already provides home mortgages and business loans. And Citigroup, an agglomeration of a bank, a securities firm and an insurance company, is the antithesis of what lawmakers sought to achieve in the 1930's, when legislation to divide the industry into heavily regulated fiefs was first enacted.
But while counterexamples abound, the practical difficulties of cross-selling and merging across industry lines have kept American financial companies from selling the broad range of products their European counterparts do. In particular, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act will make it far easier for banks, insurers and brokerage firms to introduce new lines of business without going through legal loopholes like setting up subsidiaries in Bermuda to underwrite insurance polices or buying savings and loan companies to sell bank-like products through the back door.
"Over time, as firms fully understand the implications of this change, it will stimulate consolidation," said David H. Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch. "For us and the other major securities firms, it clearly opens a range of strategic alternatives."
Few expect the financial landscape to change overnight. Consumers tend to remain loyal to their local bank or family stockbroker longer than economic models predict. Moreover, some banks may not want to sell health insurance anymore than the Gap wants to sell television sets.
But the catch phrase in banking is "deepening share of wallet." When a bank is already paying rent for a branch office and a brokerage firm is paying the salary of a broker, they welcome the chance to pump more goods through existing channels.
"We will start to see the emergence of the universal bank -- all financial services under one corporation," said Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant. He said the new legislation provided fertile soil for combinations involving bankers and insurers. "I think it's highly likely that you would see a wave of mergers there."
American International Group, Metropolitan Life and Prudential, three of America's largest insurance companies, might be among the biggest targets for banks, Mr. Ely and other analysts said. Or, they might look for banks to acquire themselves. What seems certain is that the splendid isolation that insurance companies have enjoyed even more than banks and securities companies is nearing an end.
One model for the future is AXA Financial, known until recently as the Equitable Companies. The company includes Equitable, one of the largest life insurers and sellers of annuities, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an investment banking firm. Edward D. Miller, AXA's chief executive, said his company long ago began looking for synergies between different kinds of financial services.
Though insurers have been barred from banking, many have begun encroaching on that industry by purchasing savings and loans that they hope to convert to commercial banks, said Allen R. Freedman, chairman and chief executive of Fortis Inc., a midsize life and health insurer. Fortis is the American unit of the Fortis Group, the big Dutch and Belgian financial services company. "This legislation confirms the market reality," he said. "A lot of little bits and pieces are being filled in."
One big piece is Citigroup, a company that has symbolized the imminent decline of Glass-Steagall even before the demise was assured. Citigroup was a result of a $72 billion merger that brought Travelers insurance and the Salomon Smith Barney investment bank together with Citibank last year. The merger passed muster with regulators, though only with the proviso that the company would make adjustments -- most likely including the spin-off of its insurance underwriting business -- if Glass-Steagall was not repealed within two years.
As it is, Citigroup provides a glimpse of the kind of cross-selling financial companies say is possible when the old walls are torn down. For example, brokers working for Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney have sold $420 million in Citibank mortgages to their clients in recent months, the company says. It has also begun pilot programs in 29 states in which property and casualty insurance are sold to Citibank credit card customers.
"By liberating our financial companies from an antiquated regulatory structure, this legislation will unleash the creativity of our industry and insure our global competitiveness," Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, Citigroup's co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement yesterday. "As a result, all Americans -- investors, savers, insureds -- will be better served,"
The new legislation eliminates what some executives viewed as a playing field tilted in favor of traditional commercial banks. Under administrative changes in recent years, commercial banks like Chase Manhattan and Bank of America have been able to purchase securities firms. Just a few weeks ago, Chase bought San Francisco-based Hambrecht & Quist to give it a bigger investment banking presence. But until now, the securities firms have not had the reciprocal right to buy commercial banks, which have been protected because they hold Government-guaranteed deposits.
Some Wall Street firms covet trust and custody businesses, a commercial banking preserve. They see those businesses as fitting together well with their existing asset management and brokerage businesses because they house the wealth of affluent individuals.
"There are elements of the commercial banking business that are attractive to us," Mr. Komansky of Merrill Lynch said. "For example, we have our own trust business. This would enable us to accelerate growth if we choose to acquire a trust business. The global custody business is another niche that we could be interested in."
Northern Trust, U.S. Trust, State Street Bank and other commercial banks with large trust and custody services are among those that might be attractive to investment banks, several analysts said. Mr. Komansky did not specify companies that Merrill would consider acquiring.
For consumers, one benefit might be that when financial companies rush to sell one another's products, prices tend to fall, even collapse. Take stock trading. Some Internet brokerage firms now eagerly offer the service for one-fifteenth the price traditional vendors typically charged just two years ago. Today, some banks and brokerage firms offer free checking in accounts that pay money-market interest rates. A few years ago, many such bank accounts earned no interest at all and had a fee subtracted for every check cashed.
But consumer groups see a downside. Glass-Steagall, if only as a byproduct of the division of financial services, afforded individuals a measure of privacy because companies selling different kinds of financial services had no incentive to share data. Now, with cross-selling and mergers expected to produce more unified providers, the concern is that companies will mine data to blitz consumers with marketing. Or, if a bank discovers that a customer has a deadly disease, it might use that information to keep the person from taking out a 30-year mortgage.
Senator Phil Gramm, a prime proponent of the repeal of Glass-Steagall, and the American Banking Association contend that the financial overhaul offers consumers more privacy protections than current law. But consumer and privacy advocates called the provisions a sham.
Under the bill, financial institutions would be required in most circumstances to notify their customers if they sell personal information to third parties. Customers then would have the right to demand that their private data be deleted from those files. But customers would have no say in how private data are shared between the affiliated companies of the financial conglomerates that are expected to be created.
Frank Torres, legislative director for Consumers Union in Washington, said the bill actually weakened consumer privacy protections. "They legalized the fact that banks can share this information," he said.
Uncertainty about privacy shows how the end of the Glass-Steagall era throws the financial industry into uncharted waters.
"The theories of what might happen remain to be tested," said Mr. Ely, the banking industry consultant. "Either by the market, or in court."

HEADLINE: How Controversial Art Killed a Museum;
In a Case That Parallels 'Sensation,' Cultural Leaders Took On Miami

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 22

 BODY:
Several years ago, an art museum here challenged the sensibilities of the community. Much uproar ensued. The Mayor and city commissioners reacted by trying to cancel the museum's lease. The museum went to court, and won. The First Amendment prevailed.
Supporters of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its current battle with New York's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, might take comfort from the tale of the victory of the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture over the city of Miami in 1991. But a closer look at the Miami dispute, which foreshadowed the Brooklyn case in many ways, provides a different perspective. 
 Eight years later, the Miami museum is out of business.
"Everybody closed their doors to us," said Ramon Cernuda, a book publisher and art collector who served on the museum's board for 15 years.
"The museum languished like a wounded animal for many years. Eventually, they succeeded in crushing us," he said, referring to the museum's opponents.
Unlike the stated religious basis of the objections against the Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" exhibition, the controversy here revolved around politics. It began in 1988, when the Cuban museum, devoted to preserving the cultural heritage of a people divided by cold war politics, held a fund-raising auction that included the paintings of artists who lived in Cuba or had not criticized the Cuban Government.
The auction provoked a commotion among Cuban exiles here and divided the museum's board of directors between those who viewed the artists as representatives of the Communist leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro, and those who argued for tolerance and artistic freedom. The auction took place, but emotions were at such a high pitch that one protester bought one of the Cuban paintings for $500 and then proceeded to set it on fire on a Miami street.
The controversy raged for the next three years, leading to the resignation of more than a dozen museum trustees, two pipe bomb explosions (one at the museum, the other under the car of a museum official), numerous city investigations and three city audits of museum finances. Finally, Miami officials began eviction proceedings, claiming that the museum, housed in a former Little Havana firehouse since 1982, had violated its $1-a-year lease by selling artwork on its premises.
The museum sued. It alleged that the city's real motivation was its objections to the exhibiting and auctioning of Cuban works of art, and contended that the city was violating the museum's First Amendment rights. In a May 1991 decision, Judge James Lawrence King of United States District Court agreed and stopped the eviction, ruling that "the First Amendment must assure that government does not curtail valid expression because a majority, a plurality, or any segment of its constituency wishes to prohibit or penalize that expression."
Lorna Bade Goodman, a spokeswoman for the New York City Law Department, said New York officials were not worried.
"That case is only a lower-court case," she said. "That decision does not bind the courts up here."
But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who is representing the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its lawsuit against New York City, called the Miami case central to the New York dispute and said it was of immense "persuasive value at the district level and on any appeals."
"In both cases you have a city responding to art of which it disapproves by seeking to punish the museum that displayed it," he said. "The cases are very close."
Any legal parallels notwithstanding, the two museums were in vastly different positions and ran different risks when controversy befell them, several former officials of the Cuban museum said. With a $23 million annual budget and a world-class collection that ranges from ancient Egyptian art to American paintings spanning several centuries, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, they say, will surely survive its current turmoil. Although New York City has withdrawn financing from the museum and has threatened to cancel its lease, polls show solid support for the institution, which dates to the 19th century.
By contrast, the Cuban museum, which was founded in 1973 to showcase Cuban culture only, counted on an annual budget of about $200,000, drawn mostly from the state of Florida and Cuban-American companies. And its actions were deemed offensive by a powerful segment of the population -- the conservative exiles who have made Miami home for the 40 years since the Cuban revolution.
The case here prompted no international debate, no solidarity statements from other arts organizations, the former trustees said. The public rejection was so extensive, they said, that most funding sources dried up and the museum limped along, first with grants from the Ford Foundation, and later with donations from its directors, who eventually narrowed the museum's scope to exile artists only and changed its name to the Cuban Museum of the Americas.
"The museum never recovered from the controversy," said Jose Alonso, an art dealer who served on the museum's last board. "It had the stigma of being politically incorrect. We tried to fund-raise and I had people on the phone calling me a Communist."
Despite the hostilities, however, the Cuban museum managed to survive until this year, when news that Miami had placed the museum building on a list of properties it could sell to resolve a municipal financial crisis prompted museum directors to explore their options. In June, they decided to donate the museum's 500-piece collection of original artwork and historical memorabilia to the University of Miami's Lowe Art Museum.
(Miami officials, as it turned out, kept the property and have turned it into a community service center. Laura Billberry, Miami's asset management director, said city officials decided to hold onto it because the city had achieved financial stability before a sale was necessary.)
Former trustees insist that the museum was not the building but the collection, and said they were optimistic that it can now thrive under the aegis of a bigger cultural institution. "There's going to be a healthy Cuban Museum of the Americas," said Maria C. del Valle, a real estate and art lawyer here who served on the museum's last board, which is now an advisory group to the Lowe Art Museum. "The museum is something that is in an embryonic stage now with the Lowe's."
The fate of freedom of artistic expression in Miami, however, is less certain. Today, violence, protests and verbal attacks still greet some of the few Cuban artists who risk coming here. Michael Spring, executive director of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, said most Miami art institutions did not sponsor the work of artists who are still in Cuba out of both sensitivity and fear to offend. "The psychological and real wounds of Cuban exiles here in Miami are still so fresh that artistic decision-making takes that into account," he said. But he added, "If you're trying to build an audience for the arts, you're certainly not going to program against the grain as a practical matter."
Local laws also make it difficult for a cultural institution to stray. A county law prohibits the county and any county-funded institution from doing business with anyone who does business with Cuba. That includes recipients of cultural grants. The local law is more stringent than Federal law, which exempts informational material like books, records and paintings from restrictions imposed by the American economic embargo of Cuba. But there has been improvement, said Mr. Cernuda, the former Cuban museum trustee. Los Van Van, Cuba's most popular dance band, has been able to perform here despite large protests, he said, and private galleries sell and exhibit Cuban paintings.
Earlier this year, the works of Manuel Mendive, the Cuban artist whose painting was burned in 1988 by a protester, were sold at a Coral Gables gallery without incident, Mr. Cernuda noted. "We started this work of presenting artistic expressions without censorship," Mr. Cernuda said. "Back then it was considered crazy. Today, there's a segment wide enough so that these expressions can't be censored. That was won in the battle of 1989 to 1991.
"We lost because the institution couldn't survive, but we contributed to creating a climate of artistic freedom."

HEADLINE: A NEW FINANCIAL ERA: THE OVERVIEW;
ACCORD REACHED ON LIFTING OF DEPRESSION-ERA BARRIERS AMONG FINANCIAL INDUSTRIES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and top Republican lawmakers reached an agreement early today to overhaul the financial system, repealing Depression-era laws that have restricted the banking, securities and insurance industries from expanding into one another's businesses.
The deal was announced about 2 A.M. after a compromise was reached over the measure's effect on lending rules for the disadvantaged, the source of months of partisan bickering between the White House and Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the banking committee. 
 It concludes decades of attempts to rewrite banking laws to catch up with a marketplace that has already experienced broad consolidations and the rise of financial conglomerates offering bank and brokerage accounts as well as insurance.
While these conglomerates have found ways around the old rules, those rules had made it expensive and at times impossible to expand into new lines of financial services.
For instance, the nation's largest financial services company, Citigroup, would have been forced to sell some of its insurance operations as part of the $72 billion merger last year between Citibank and Travelers Group without either the legislation or a waiver from regulators.
With such situations in mind, the banking, insurance and securities industries spent more than $300 million in 1997 and 1998 alone on a combination of donations to political candidates, soft money contributions to political parties and lobbying.
The legislation will more easily enable financial companies to offer corporate clients a full range of services, from traditional loans to investment banking services, like public stock offerings. And for consumers, it paves the way for financial supermarkets, which will be able to offer one-stop shopping for an array of services, all under one roof. The measure is also expected to clear a path for a new and bigger wave of corporate deal-making as more companies consolidate. Page C1.
White House officials withheld final approval of the agreement until aides could see the measure's language. But the officials indicated tonight that, with broad support from Democrats in Congress, the measure was all but certain to be signed by President Clinton. As such, it will be one of the most significant pieces of legislation to be written by the White House and the 106th Congress, which began its term considering whether to remove Mr. Clinton and has had a bitter relationship ever since.
"When this potentially historic agreement is finalized," Mr. Clinton said in a statement, "it will strengthen the economy and help consumers, communities and businesses across America."
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in an interview, "At the end of the 20th century, we will at last be replacing an archaic set of restrictions with a legislative foundation for a 21st-century financial system." The measure, he added, "would provide significant benefits to the national economy."
Senator Gramm said the measure "is the most important banking legislation in 60 years."
Mr. Gramm's counterpart in the House, Representative James A. Leach of Iowa, said that he expected a final bill to be brought to the House and Senate floors later this month.
While the measure is likely to enjoy broad bipartisan support, it has also been criticized. Some lawmakers and privacy groups say the legislation does not adequately protect consumers and will allow financial companies to share and sell private information about customer accounts. Other critics worry about the further consolidation of the financial services industry.
The legislation repeals the Glass-Steagall Act, or, as it is formally known, the Banking Act of 1933, which broke up the powerful House of Morgan and divided Wall Street between investment banks and commercial banks. It also makes significant changes to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which had restricted what banks could do in the insurance business.
The Glass-Steagall Act was enacted after the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing banking crisis and Great Depression. On the day it was signed, along with the National Industrial Recovery Act and other measures, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the package "the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American Congress."
The idea behind Glass-Steagall, named for the two lawmakers who wrote it, was that confidence in America's financial house could best be restored if bankers and brokers stayed in separate rooms. Such a separation, it was thought, achieved two purposes.
First, it would reduce the potential conflicts of interest between investment banking and commercial banking that were thought to have contributed to the speculative frenzy in the stock markets. Under the 1933 Banking Act, commercial banks could receive no more than 10 percent of their income from the securities markets, a limit so restrictive that most simply abandoned business on Wall Street.
Second, it would provide a safe harbor for the money of ordinary Americans by enabling them to put their money in accounts that were protected by deposit insurance and insulated from more speculative investments like stocks. (The 1933 act also established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which now insures bank deposits up to $100,000.)
Over time, Federal judges and regulators chipped away at the Glass-Steagall Act and other restrictions on cross-ownership of banks, insurance companies and securities firms, enabling, for instance, Citibank to merge with Travelers last year to form Citigroup, the world's largest financial services company. But large hurdles remained that have discouraged the expansion by banks into new businesses.
The breakthrough in today's legislation came in a backroom meeting at the Capitol soon after midnight, when a group of moderate Senate Democrats -- led by Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Charles E. Schumer of New York -- forced a compromise between Mr. Gramm and the White House over the legislation's effect on the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 anti-discrimination law intended to encourage lending to minorities and others historically denied access to credit.
Mr. Dodd, whose state is home to the nation's largest insurance companies, and Mr. Schumer, with strong ties to Wall Street, have long sought legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. Both men said in interviews today that they moved to strike a compromise after it became apparent that the legislation might be killed, as it was last year by Mr. Gramm, over the debate about the Community Reinvestment Act.
Mr. Gramm had maintained that he did not want anything in the bill that would expand the application of the Community Reinvestment Act because it was, he said, unnecessarily burdensome to banks. He had sought a provision that would exempt thousands of smaller banks from the law. He also wanted a provision that would expose what he has described as the "extortion" committed by community groups against banks by requiring the groups to disclose any special financial deals the groups extract from the banks.
But the White House found that provision unacceptable and had its own ideas about community lending. It wanted the legislation to prevent any bank with an unsatisfactory record of making loans to the disadvantaged from expanding into new areas, like insurance or securities.
The White House had insisted that the President would veto any legislation that would scale back minority-lending requirements. Four days of intense negotiations between Mr. Summers, Gene Sperling, the President's top economic policy adviser, and Mr. Gramm, while moving the two sides closer, failed to resolve the differences.
Such was the state of play Thursday evening when Mr. Gramm decided to force the issue by having the House-Senate conference committee vote on his proposed compromise, which the White House had already rejected for failing to block banks with bad lending records from expanding to new businesses.
When Mr. Gramm's measure was defeated by one vote, it quickly became clear that there would be no law unless Mr. Gramm could get some Democrats to break from the White House.
But Administration officials had spent all day making sure that the Democrats remained solidly against the measure until their concerns about the Community Reinvestment Act could be worked out.
After receiving calls from executives of some of the nation's leading financial companies, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Schumer began trying to work out a compromise. An agreement was quickly reached on the issue of banks and expanded powers -- no institution would be allowed to move into any new lines of business without a satisfactory lending record.
The lawmakers bogged down on Mr. Gramm's insistence that all community organizations disclose to the regulators what benefits they get from banks. Some Democrats expressed the fear that Mr. Gramm's proposal would require the Boy Scouts to file reports with the regulators.
Ultimately, the following provisions were drawn up and both the White House and Mr. Gramm said they could accept them:
*Banks will not be able to move into new lines of business unless they have satisfactory lending records.
*Community groups will have to make disclosures to regulators about certain kinds of financial deals with banks that they have pressed to make loans under the Community Reinvestment Act.
*Wholesale financial institutions, a new kind of business that takes large, uninsured bank deposits, cannot be affiliated with commercial banks.
*Small banks with satisfactory or excellent track records of lending to the underserved would be reviewed less frequently under the Community Reinvestment Act. As a practical matter smaller banks are reviewed about every three years. The deal struck today allows all rural banks and banks with less than $250 million in assets to undergo examination once every five years if their last exam resulted in an "outstanding" grade and every four years if they last scored "satisfactory."
For more than 20 years, Congress has tried unsuccessfully to rewrite the nation's financial services laws and repeal Glass-Steagall, particularly as many other industrial nations had no similar restrictions on their banks. But until recently, the three main industries affected by the legislation -- banks, securities companies and insurers -- had competing interests and were able to lobby any legislation to a standstill.
That all changed in recent years as the lines between the industries began to blur and it became more broadly acknowledged that a deregulation of financial services could be beneficial to insurers, bankers and securities firms alike. Once the three industries rallied around the legislation, they became a formidable political force, raising millions of dollars for lawmakers and pressing both Republican leaders in Congress and the White House for new legislation.

 The agreement, reached after a compromise over lending rules for the disadvantaged, concludes decades of attempts to rewrite the nation's banking laws and catch up with a marketplace that has already seen broad consolidations. Page A1.
 
"It's probably the most heavily lobbied, most expensive issue to come before Congress in a generation," said Ed Yingling, the American Bankers Association's chief lobbyist. C4.
 
Vodafone May Bid for Mannesmann
Vodafone Airtouch, the world's leading mobile phone operator, is said to be considering a hostile bid for Mannesmann of Germany, its partner turned rival with its purchase of Orange, another British wireless company. Vodafone insisted in public that its relationship with Mannesmann was unchanged, but British press reports said Vodafone's chief executive, Christopher Gent, was furious at the German company. C2.
 
Wall Street Journal Editor to Stay
The Wall Street Journal's managing editor, Paul E. Steiger, turned down an offer to head all financial news operations at CNN, ending more than a week of uncertainty. Also, company and labor union negotiators resolved a fight over retirement benefits, ending more than seven months of sometimes-tense talks. C3.
 
Waste Management Expects Charge
Waste Management, the nation's largest trash hauler, said that it expected to take a third-quarter charge and have lower 1999 earnings because an audit found irregularities with its accounting. It did not estimate the size. C15.

KEYCORP TO SELL CREDIT CARD HOLDINGS TO HELP PROFITS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Keycorp said yesterday that it had decided to sell its $1.3 billion credit card portfolio, which shrank 10 percent in the last 12 months, by early next year to help profits. Keycorp said in May that it might sell some units to improve its earnings, which lag behind those of some other regional banks. Fee income from the portfolio, the 23d largest in the United States, dropped to $16 million in the third quarter, from $21 million in the second quarter, and its loans outstanding have fallen from about $1.45 billion in the last year. It may fetch about $220 million, based on the average paid for other credit card portfolios this year.

HEADLINE: In Adirondacks, Fight Over Parcel Reflects a Larger Battle

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: FINE, N.Y., Oct. 20

 BODY:
John A. Gibbs, a New York State forester, walked along a ribbon of dirt road through one of the hundreds of public woodlands in the Adirondack Park, a Vermont-size patchwork of state preserves and private land.
On one side lay the 2,000-acre Alice Brook tract, one of many areas in the park officially designated as "wilderness," where people can pass only on foot or in a canoe; on the other was land labeled "wild forest," where trails can be traversed by snowmobiles or mountain bikes. 
 The trees and tangled brush on both sides of the road were the same. The patches of still-green ferns sprouting through golden mats of newly fallen leaves were the same. But the difference could not be more stark, a variety of private environmental groups, sporting groups and local officials say.
In the latest fray in a decades-long battle for the soul of the Adirondacks, the culture of the hiking boot and that of the motor are locked in debate over a state plan to change the status of the Alice Brook tract from wilderness to wild forest so it can provide an east-west corridor for snowmobiles.
Altogether, the Adirondack Park Agency this fall is considering what kinds of restrictions should apply to about 45,000 acres of forest preserve land, including parcels like Alice Brook that have long been state property and newly acquired land, such as the 14,700-acre William C. Whitney tract, which was bought two years ago for $17 million from a company owned by Marylou Whitney, the heiress and Manhattan socialite.
Even taken together, the tracts are minuscule compared with the total of more than one million acres of wilderness and one million additional acres of wild forest within the sprawling park, which runs from about 50 miles north of Albany to the Canadian border and contains a mix of publicly and privately owned tracts. But the pending decision has sparked intense interest, with advocates on both sides packing a series of public hearings that ended on Oct. 15.
In almost every decision it will make, the park agency, whose board is appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, stands to make someone very unhappy when it rules in December or January.
The final decision rests with the Governor, who under state law can reject the board's land-classification plan. That decision will be difficult, political and environmental experts said. In the past, Mr. Pataki has received high marks from land-preservation groups, but he also relies on strong support in largely Republican upstate towns, where snowmobiles and outboard motors are often preferred to boots and paddles.
Last week, Mr. Pataki's aides said he would give no hint of his position until the agency board presented its findings.
The Alice Brook tract -- although the smallest piece of the planning puzzle and a mere pepper fleck on the Adirondack map -- is ground zero in the fight. It lies on the northern flank of an ecological treasure called the Five Ponds Wilderness. But it also contains an old snowmobile trail that, if restored, could link existing snowmobiling areas that are now cut off from each other.
As he clambered over a pile of trees knocked down in a wind storm, Mr. Gibbs laid out the debate: "There's a lot at stake, whether it be economics to the folks living here who need to make a decent wage, or preservation to those folks who may live in Long Island or Syracuse but who feel good that this is here, and will be here forever. Somehow," he said, "there's got to be some kind of a balance."
To many small Adirondack towns, where the economy largely shuts down in winter, a boom in snowmobiling could mean jobs and money. "Hamilton County has 18 percent unemployment in winter," said Thomas T. Bissell, the Town Supervisor of Long Lake, which includes the Whitney tract and another parcel being considered for changes.
But to environmental groups, any diminution in wilderness in the 107-year-old park -- even the loss of a tiny fragment like the Alice Brook tract -- would set an unacceptable precedent and violate an amendment of the State Constitution that made the forest preserves of the Adirondacks "forever wild."
"There's so little true wilderness in the Northeast that we think every acre is valuable," said John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a private group that opposes and reduction in protections on forest preserves.
Since 1972, Adirondack park officials have been slowly working their way across the park, studying and then classifying each patch of public land as suitable for some level of use -- or, if left as wilderness, for hardly any use at all except to wildlife.
Land that had old logging roads, mines, or intermingled private holdings, was given the wild forest classification, allowing more access. The delicate politics in the region always demanded rough parity between amounts of wilderness and wild forest.
In the latest batch of proposed land classifications, the park agency's planners attempted to keep a rough 50-50 split. But in this case, the details do matter, people on both sides of the debate say.
Some of the newly configured zones would reclassify land that is currently wild forest, and snowmobiling groups want none of the land now accessible to them to become off limits. David Perkins, the president of the New York State Snowmobile Association, asked the group's members recently to write letters to the park agency opposing the new wilderness designations that were being pushed by what he called "environmental extremists."
Neil F. Woodworth, a lawyer for the Adirondack Mountain Club, a private lobbying group, said that the State Constitution and a series of court decisions are clear on the need for state preserves in the Adirondacks to remain free of excessive human intrusion. He cited a 1930 decision of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, which described the Adirondack forest preserve this way:
"We must preserve it in its wild nature, its trees, its rocks, its streams. Its uses for health and pleasure must not be inconsistent with its preservation as forest lands in a wild state," the judges wrote. "It is essentially a quiet and healthful retreat from the turmoil and artificiality of a busy urban life."
Snowmobiles and jet skis and other powered craft are not what the judges were describing, Mr. Woodworth said. Even so, he said, at least for the Alice Brook tract there is a solution that could satisfy both sides.
Under state law, even with the stricter wilderness classification for the land, a snowmobile trail could run around its edge, as long as it was built within 500 feet of the outer boundary of the parcel.
For the Whitney tract, the debate centers not just on terrestrial vehicles, but also on motor boats. The parcel is prime canoeing territory, containing Little Tupper Lake and Rock Pond, which are linked by a winding channel. And it sits to the east of Lake Lila, which is also on state park land. The park agency is considering whether the Whitney tract and the land around Lake Lila should be wilderness or something less -- including intermediate classifications like "primitive" and "canoe," which allow some motorized access but not as much as the wild forest designation.
Mr. Bissell and other local officials, along with snowmobile clubs, would like to see the area opened to more than just hikers and canoeists. For snowmobilers, a road on the Whitney tract could provide a link from Long Lake to an old railroad line that runs north and south and is something of a snowmobile equivalent to the New York State Thruway.
A half-dozen private environmental groups weighed in at the hearings, insisting that the Whitney land be wilderness and nothing less. Roads should be allowed to fade away as the forest grows, they say. Little Tupper and Lake Lila are among only a few water bodies left in the Adirondacks where the sound of motors is almost unknown, representatives of these groups said.
Mrs. Whitney concurs. Through her husband, John Hendrickson, who is the president of Whitney Industries, she has been threatening to refuse to sell the state another 36,000 acres of prime Adirondack land if Mr. Pataki approves any additional boat or snowmobile access.
"If they don't do right by the classification, that's certainly not going to bode well for future sales to the state of New York," Mr. Hendrickson said. "And there are 22 more lakes that Marylou owns."
Next year, once the park agency and Mr. Pataki decide what to do, then it will be up to John Gibbs and others at the State Department of Environmental Conservation to draw up detailed management plans.
Mr. Gibbs and other state foresters working in the area generally favored the view that the Adirondack landscape is vast enough to satisfy hikers seeking solitude and people who prefer to be pulled along by a high-revving engine.
As Mr. Gibbs made his way along the road through the Alice Brook tract, he pointed out that by far the greatest disturbance to the forest there came not from snowmobiles or other human influences, but instead from a violent wind storm that swept the region in the summer of 1995, pummeling millions of trees. New saplings were rising from between uprooted stumps.
"Fifty years down the road this is going to be beautiful softwood forest," he said.

HEADLINE: A NEW FINANCIAL ERA: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Big Gains By Gramm In Diluting Lending Act

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
Community-lending advocates and banking industry officials found one thing to agree on yesterday about the rewrite of the Community Reinvestment Act: It is not going to improve lending in poor neighborhoods.
After long negotiations on legislation to overhaul the nation's financial services laws, Senate Republicans and the Clinton Administration resolved their differences early yesterday over whether to strengthen or weaken the law involving lending to minorities and others commonly denied credit. 
 The law's chief critic, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, appeared to get much of what he wanted. Mr. Gramm not only secured reductions in how often small banks would have to face compliance examinations, but he also won a provision requiring his ideological adversaries, the community advocacy groups, to disclose how much they receive from reinvestment agreements with banks.
Mr. Gramm has said the groups use these agreements to "extort" money from banks by dropping objections to mergers or expansions in exchange for payments. Community groups say that the agreements are an important part of insuring better access to credit in poor areas and that fewer banks will agree to them if the details have to be disclosed.
By comparison, a provision trumpeted by the Clinton Administration failed to impress many low-income-lending advocates. The Administration, which had threatened to veto any measure that weakened the community lending law, inserted language barring institutions from expanding or buying an insurer, brokerage firm or bank unless all their affiliated lending institutions have satisfactory ratings on fair lending. Mr. Clinton said the new provisions will "promote continued investment in America's communities."
But critics pointed out that the deal includes no penalties for banks that fail to maintain satisfactory grades. Moreover, they said, the forces that have lobbied hardest for the bill are among the biggest lending institutions in the country, and they almost never receive unsatisfactory community-lending ratings.
"In their desire to please the financial industry, the Administration has agreed to substantially reduce the impact of C.R.A.," said Chris Saffert, a legislative representative for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. "Phil Gramm completely walked over the Administration. And for them to be saying this is a good bill is a poor reflection on their priorities."
The deal struck yesterday also allows banks with less than $250 million in assets to undergo a community-lending compliance examination once every five years if their last exam resulted in an "outstanding" grade, and every four years if they last scored "satisfactory." Under current law, examinations are required every 18 months.
Community groups expressed concern, saying that this change would allow many institutions to finesse the examination process by sloughing off community-reinvestment loans in most years, as long as they take them seriously in the period leading up to an examination.
John Henneberger, director of the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service, said a study of 89 Texas banks that failed exams from 1990 to 1995 found that 87 had less than $250 million in assets. But he said the study also showed that most of those quickly improved their lending practices after their bad ratings, demonstrating that vigilant oversight of small banks is effective.
"Communities that rely exclusively on small banks to provide mortgage credit are having the same hard time as inner-city folks," Mr. Henneberger said. "The numbers are very close."
Steve Scurlock, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas, said the changes would not hurt small-town lending. The study's findings are not surprising, he said, given that more than 90 percent of Texas banks have less than $250 million in assets.
"The overwhelming majority of community banks do a very credible job of serving their community," he said, "which has a direct relationship to the well-being of banks over the long term."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the Community Re investment Act, which encourages banks to lend in low- and middle-income neighborhoods, misstated the frequency of inspections to check compliance by banks and savings and loans with less than $250 million in assets. For most, the examinations generally occur every two to three years, not every 18 months.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN;
Doing What the Islands Do Best

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS; FRANCES FRANK MARCUS reports frequently on the Caribbean.

 BODY:
AT the Hyatt Regency Dorado Beach Resort on the north coast of Puerto Rico, the general manager, Michael Walsh, has been working on a nature brochure describing the tropical flora on the property and writing a book about its history. The resort had its beginnings in the 1950's when Laurance Rockefeller created it as a low-key haven-cum-natural-wonders. "I think people are looking for a cultural experience," Mr. Walsh said.
This year, complementing the hotel's two popular golf courses, there's a new clubhouse built in the style of Su Casa, the gracious manor house that came with the coconut plantation Rockefeller purchased for his beach retreat. 
 A bit to the east on the spectacular northwest coast of St. John, another, quieter Rockefeller creation, Caneel Bay resort, is steeped in a sort of burnished rusticity -- a place to observe nature effortlessly. It, too, is making efforts to stay true to the past yet in step with the times.
Among the recent duties of Brian Young, its new managing director, was taking a hike. Why? To become familiar with a three-mile trail in the United States Virgin Islands National Park, which surrounds the resort, mainly to see some mysterious rock carvings, because, he explained, "Our guests keep asking about the petroglyphs."
On Anguilla, at Cap Juluca, the enticements include bush tea along with the Champagne. Guests may wander Marie Antoinette-like in the hotel's new herb garden, gathering bits of lemon grass and sweet marjoram, for instance, for their own special blend of herbal tea for brewing by a hotel housekeeper.
In a reach to run ahead of the crowd, resorts -- and entire islands -- throughout the Caribbean have been sprucing up and expanding their specialties while offering attractions -- cultural, natural and historical -- meant to instruct, enlighten, entertain and invigorate. On Bonaire, for example, the domain of divers and flamingos, snorkelers can pedal up to coral reefs on mountain bicycles. At the new Cuisinart Resort and Spa scheduled to open next month on Anguilla, boccie, cooking demonstrations and croquet will be among the diversions.
Following is a survey of islands and their specialties. Unless otherwise specified, hotel prices refer to two people sharing a double room.
 
Anguilla
Even the beaches are glossy on small, coralline Anguilla. The most popular of more than 30 is Shoal Bay, gleaming white sand stroked by reef-calmed waters. Offshore, a limestone ridge attracts small tropical fish and novice snorkelers.
The most seductive of the luxury resorts is Cap Juluca with white Moorish domes, parapets and arches opening to romantic views of the sea. The hotel has 58 rooms and junior suites, 7 larger suites, 6 villas with private pools, and 2 restaurants along a luminous beach. The gardens and a half-mile nature trail offer glimpses of turtledoves, tree lizards, snowy egrets and the red and green bell-shaped flowers of the love bush. The garden is planted with culinary and medicinal herbs, salad greens and edible flowers. There are benches and shade. Rates at Cap Juluca, (888) 858-5822 or (264) 497-6666, fax (494) 497-6617, start at $665, plus 18 per cent tax and service. The price includes Continental breakfast, sorbet served on the beach, afternoon tea and twice-daily maid service.
On Rendezvous Bay, the sleek new beachfront Cuisinart Resort and Spa, (800) 932-3222 or (264) 498-2000, fax (264) 498-2010, is scheduled to open in November with 93 rooms, suites and penthouses in white villas inspired by the architecture on the Greek island of Mykonos. It will also have its own hydroponics farm.
The cheapest, "superior" rooms, with marble bathrooms and private patios, are $490, plus 18 percent tax and service. Rates include Continental breakfast. Among the activities are water sports, tennis and billiards. A 6,000-square-foot spa will have a fitness center (included in the room rate), treatment rooms and an art gallery on the top floor where guests can relax, meditate and perhaps buy a painting. The first hotel venture of the food processor company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., the resort will have a demonstration kitchen with complimentary cooking classes twice a week, as well as an open kitchen in the dining room where guests can watch chefs work.
 
Antigua
Once a hangout for Horatio Nelson and the British Navy, Antigua is still a haven for sailors, who like the trade winds and splendid English Harbour. Yachts race here year-round but especially during the annual Sailing Week, April 30 to May 6 in 2000, with a gathering of boats from around the world, preceded by a yacht regatta, April 20 to 25. There is a Web site, www.sailingweek.com, with links to more information.
Nicholson Yacht Charters, (800) 662-6066, started operating on the island 50 years ago when Nelson's Dockyard in English Harbour was quiet and cobwebby. Today the dockyard's old Georgian buildings have been restored, and Nicholson has around 50 yachts for charter based in English Harbour and another 350 or so around the Caribbean: classic wooden boats, modern fiberglass vessels, high performance boats and mul tihulls. The company specializes in crewed yachts accommodating from 2 to 14 pas sengers.
The price for a week's sail on the 52-foot custom Alden schooner Metani with stops to visit other islands is $4,750 for two people, including meals but not drinks.
Built on a private peninsula with two beaches, Curtain Bluff Resort, (268) 462-8400, fax (268) 462-8409, has 63 luxurious beachfront rooms, including 6 two-bedroom suites, all with terraces. The resort fleet includes Sunfish, windsurfers, sea kayaks, a dive boat and a 30-foot fishing boat. There are four lighted tennis courts, a pool with three 75-foot lap lanes, squash court, putting green, croquet and exercise room. Daily rates start at $725, including meals and drinks but not the 18.5 percent tax and service charge.
A day of sailing on a 47-foot Wellington ketch costs $95 a person for up to six people. The course is 10 miles along the west coast, with a stop for lunch and a swim at a secluded beach.
 
Bahamas
In the Bahamas, flashy hotels claim center stage, but there are also eco-lodges, blue-hole diving, snorkeling and beautiful beaches. There are 700 islands, some 2,400 cays, and every kind of water sport. In September, the Bahamas felt the wrath of Hurricane Floyd, but the more developed islands and their resorts escaped the brunt and suffered damage mostly to the landscape.
The storm battered the less-traveled Out Islands, especially Abaco, Eleuthera and Cat Island; the hotels that were affected are expected to reopen by Feb. 1.
Grand Bahama is home to the Underwater Explorers Society, (800) 992-3483, offering scuba lessons and a variety of expeditions, with boats leaving from the docks at Port Lucaya. The price is $169 for a reef dive and a dive with dolphins, $82 for a shark dive, $60 for a wreck dive, $49 for a night dive and $145 for an all-day dive. To get on the popular dolphin and reef dives, you must book at least two additional dive trips.
On the largest island, Andros, near a 143-mile-long barrier reef, Floyd brushed the Small Hope Bay Lodge, damaging the landscape and dock but sparing the 20 coral stone and pine beach cottages, which are cooled by ceiling fans and decorated with batiks created on the island. The lodge, (800) 223-6961, fax (242) 368-2015, is a base for diving, snorkeling, fishing and a fresh creek safari in search of dolphins. The double room rate with meals for non-divers is $350, $470 for divers, including three dives a day. The safari costs $45 a person.
 
Barbados
It's been called Little England: Great houses built by British sugar barons still stand, gardens bloom all around the island and afternoon tea is a ritual at some resorts.
Standing behind an avenue of mahogany trees, St. Nicholas Abbey, (246) 422-8725, was built in the mid-1600's, near the spectacular east coast, and is still part of a 420-acre sugar plantation. Dutch gables and a Chinese Chippendale staircase are among the Jacobean mansion's embellishments. Open weekdays 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. Entry fee: $5, free for children under 12.
The scenic, 50-acre Flower Forest is part botanical garden, part nature trail. Allamandas and waxy heliconias as well as monkeys swinging through trees are among the sights. The Forest, on Highway 2, (246) 433-8152, is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Entry fee is $7.
 
Bonaire
Bonaire sits quietly atop an underwater mountain, fringed by coral reefs in a limpid sea. Because the reefs are so healthy and easy to reach, this is one of the world's best places to dive and snorkel. There is diving day and night from the shore, where sites are labeled on the coast by stones marked with yellow paint. The Bonaire Marine Park manages the coral rigorously.
Sand Dollar Dive and Photo Shop, (599) 7 5433, fax (599) 7 5252, sells six days' unlimited use of tank and air for $90, plus 10 percent service charge and 5 percent tax, along with boat dives, kayak tours and other adventures. The shop sits next door to the Sand Dollar Condominium Resort, 79 Kaya Gobernador N. Debrot, on the sea about a mile from the capital, Kralendijk.
Snorkelers, with less gear, can get around on 21-speed mountain bikes, rented from Cycle Bonaire, 11D Kaya L.D. Gerharts in the Stephany Shopping Center, (599) 7 7558. A day's rental costs $15, plus 5 percent tax.
 
Cayman Islands
Scuba divers dote on Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. And why not? The sea is crystalline. The coral is healthy and vast. Some divers avoid Grand Cayman's crowds by heading to secluded lodges on Little Cayman, 10 miles long and a mile wide, where the underwater visibility averages 100 to 150 feet and the human population around 100. The attractions include snorkeling over the drop-off at the island's spectacular Bloody Bay Wall, shore diving, bonefishing and bird watching.
The white sand beach measures 800 feet long at the Southern Cross Club, (800) 899-2582 for reservations, (345) 948-1099, fax (345) 948-1098, a renovated 1950's fishing camp with 11 air-conditioned beachfront cottages and a lodge. Lying 200 yards off the beach, 11-acre Owen Island beckons swimmers and picnickers.
The cost for a week in one of the beachfront cottages is $3,638 for two divers, including meals, use of kayaks and bicycles, airport transfers, tax and service, and five days of diving. Nondivers pay $240 less, per person, for a comparable package.
 
Curacao
Just north of Venezuela, the fetching pastel facades of 17th- and 18th-century Dutch houses gleam in the tropical sun. Curacao's harbor and the island's colonial Dutch architecture in the capital Willemstad are on Unesco's World Heritage List. A major oil refinery and deepwater port make this a business destination as well as a tourist spot.
For a glimpse of historic Willemstad there's a 75-minute trolley tour. The trip begins at the 17th-century Fort Amsterdam and stops to allow visits to Mikve Israel Emmanuel Synagogue, inaugurated in 1732, reputedly the Western Hemisphere's oldest synagogue in continuous use. In high season there are tours Sunday through Friday at 2 P.M. (The trolley runs on Saturday but the synagogue is not accessible.) On days cruise ships are in port the trolley runs continuously from 8:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Call for reservations: Atlantis Adventures Curacao, (599) 9-462-8833. High-season tickets are $20; children under 12, $10.
Habitat Curacao, (800) 327-6709 or (599) 9-8648800, fax (599) 9-8648464, allied with Bonaire's well-known dive resort, Captain Don's Habitat, lies near shore diving spots on the southwest coast, edged with small beaches and coves. The 56 junior suites have views of the sea or garden, kitchenettes and air-conditioning in a landscape of cactus and oleander.There is first-rate snorkeling 20 feet from shore. Seven-night dive packages start at $1,124 a person, double occupancy, including buffet breakfast, tax, service and airport transfers.
 
Dominica
Seen from above, the island is mostly a tangle of wild mountains. Tucked among the greenery are scenic waterfalls, a splendid virgin rain forest and rare parrots. A muddy, taxing hiking trail leads to the large Boiling Lake, often swathed in vapor. Offshore, there are whales to watch and scuba diving.
The charming seven-room eco-inn Papillote Wilderness Retreat, (767) 448-2287, fax (767) 448-2285, sits in a botanical garden on a rain-forested slope at the top of Roseau Valley, five miles from the capital, Roseau. Ginger blossoms, orchids, begonias and ferns adorn the landscape traversed by two streams, one hot, one cold. Three hot pools for therapeutic baths are fed by volcanic mineral water. The simply furnished rooms are decorated with fresh flowers and quilts made on the island. Rates begin at $90, plus 5 percent tax.
 
Dominican Republic
Hotels the size of small towns line the palmy white-sand beaches at Punta Cana, a tourist zone along the country's fast-developing east coast. The resorts are bustling, low-rise destinations for chartered planeloads of Germans, Italians, French and South Americans, though North American visitors are increasing. Hurricane Georges swept through Punta Cana last year but left relatively minor damage. At last count, there were 15,000 hotel rooms in the area, growing to 20,000 by the end of next year.
The quirkiest lure can be found at the Melia Bavaro, (800) 336-3542 or (809) 221-2311, fax (809) 686-5427, where the sounds of Mozart, Vivaldi and Puccini waft from a rowboat floating in a lagoon. A string quartet from Belgrade gives evening concerts outside Melia Bavaro's Chopin restaurant, which sits among mangroves.
Dotted in the lush landscape are 7 restaurants and 686 air-conditioned suites in bungalows connected by walkways. The all-inclusive nightly rate is $330. The Manhattan-based Inter-Island Tours, (800) 245-3434 or (212) 686-4868, offers all-inclusive seven-night packages for $1,436 a person; that price covers air fare from New York, with comparable prices from other cities.
Shaded by coconut palms, the 400-room Punta Cana Beach Resort, (800) 972-2139 or (809) 221-2262, fax (809) 687-8745, lies near the large, up-to-date Punta Cana International Airport built by the hotel's investors.

Double rates start at $536, including meals, drinks, horseback riding, tennis and non-motorized water sports.
 
Grenada
Anthony Trollope, who visited in 1859, wrote glowingly of Grenada. He thought its mangoes "the finest I ever ate." And in the hillside capital St. George's, a blend of 18th-century architecture and red tile roofs above the harbor, the novelist found hints of "a goodly English town." The mangoes are still sweetly delicious, sun-ripened on trees growing 12 degrees north of the equator.
The place to buy them is the frenetic food market in St. George's Market Square, where vendors sell island produce, including nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon, from about 7 A.M. to around 5 P.M. Monday through Saturday. For the biggest selection, go on Saturday. Unless you're a shrewd bargainer, the mangoes will cost about the same as you'd pay at home.
Grenada's southern coastline shelters an assortment of inviting beaches. The most popular, Grand Anse, in the southwest, runs alongside St. George's and is lined with resorts. The Blue Horizons Cottage Hotel, (473) 444-4316, fax (473) 444-2815, lies on a slope with access to a 1,600-foot stretch of Grande Anse in front of its more upscale sibling, the Spice Island Beach Resort, built across the road.
At Blue Horizons there are 32 comfortable cottage suites with kitchenettes, air-conditioning, ceiling fans and balconies or terraces, a 40-foot-long swimming pool, and one of Grenada's better restaurants, La Belle Creole. Rates start at $170, plus 18 percent tax and service.
 
Jamaica
As a background to its all-inclusive resorts promising endless diversions, the landscape of this beautiful island is endlessly varied, with gorgeous beaches and waterfalls, the majestic Blue Mountains and hundreds of caves.
Claiming 20 green acres along 800 feet of Negril's renowned Seven Mile Beach, Swept Away, (800) 545-7937 or (876) 957-4061, fax (876) 957-4040, is an all-inclusive geared to fitness-minded adults.

In East Jamaica, Port Antonio is a convenient base for touring the Blue Mountains, waterfalls and scenic rivers. The twin harbors of the old banana port are backed by mountains; there are comfortable hotels.
Valley Hikes, 12 West Street, downtown Port Antonio, (876) 993-3881, a nonprofit group promoting eco-cultural tourism, offers a variety of expeditions with trained guides, including hikes to waterfalls and caves, river rafting and bird watching.

Valley Hikes' adventures can be booked through Unique Destinations, (401) 934-3398.
 
Martinique
Called the Island of Flowers, it is better known for French Creole food, an impressive tropical rain forest and the active volcano Mount Pelee. In spirit and actuality, the island is part of France.
Le Jardin de Balata, (596) 64 48 73, on the Route de Balata, is verdant with a palm grove, an orchid arbor and vivid anthuriums, the island's signature blossom. As lagniappe, there are many hummingbirds. The garden is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $6.36, $2.38 for children under 12.
Considered one of the island's best restaurants, La Canne a Sucre, telephone and fax (596) 63 33 95, is decorated with French lace curtains, painted wooden walls and latticework to resemble a small colonial house.

There is a $13.50 prix fixe lunch; an a la carte meal with wine is around $33. Dinner daily, lunch Monday to Friday.
 
Puerto Rico
The island is prime habitat for golfers, gamblers and aficionados of Spanish colonial architecture. The narrow streets of Old San Juan date to the 16th century. Among the island's 18 golf courses, four of the best are at the 298-room Hyatt Regency Dorado Beach Resort and Casino, (800) 223-1234 or (787) 796-1234, fax (787) 796-6560 and its neighbor, the 509-room Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Resort and Casino, (800) 223-1234 or (787) 796-1234, fax (787) 796-4647, a 45-minute drive west of San Juan on the north coast.
The classic greens were designed by Robert Trent Jones, and renovations are in the works. Dorado's West Course and Cerromar's North Course are finished and open. The challenging East Course at Dorado, built around a small forest of mangrove-like pterocarpus trees, will reopen for the P.G.A.'s Chrysler Senior Match Challenge Nov. 11 to 14; Cerromar's South Course is scheduled to reopen Dec. 15.
Greens fees at the four courses range from $100 to $140 for hotel guests, $120 to $175 for nonguests. Fees include golf carts.
On Puerto Rico's southeast coast at Humacao, 45 minutes from San Juan, two golf courses, one of them new, lie just beyond the sea at the sprawling Palmas del Mar Resort and Villas, (800) 468-3331, fax (787) 852-6320, graced by thousands of palm trees.

A marble staircase sets the tone in the grandest of the island's 17 casinos, along with stone columns and wrought-iron chandeliers.
Visitors can stroll through the lush garden at Casa Blanca, 1 Calle San Sebastian, said to be the oldest of 815 Spanish colonial buildings in Old San Juan's National Historic Zone. Built in 1521, it was the home of the family of Juan Ponce de Leon, the Spanish explorer who helped settle Puerto Rico, though he did not live there. Now a museum, it is closed for renovations; the garden is open weekdays from 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Entry is free.
 
Saba
Don't look for beaches -- there's just one, and it vanishes in winter, but visitors don't mind. They're busy admiring the sights in the transparent offshore waters. Just five green square miles jutting from the sea, Saba is an extinct volcano encompassing four villages, rugged walking paths and Mount Scenery, at around 2,800 feet.
The Saba Marine Park, which circles the island, requires divers to explore the reefs from boats at some 30 mooring buoys. Undersea mountains rise to 90 feet below the surface, encrusted with corals, sponges and other invertebrates, magnets for fish from the open ocean.
Saba Deep Dive Center, (599) 4 63347, fax (599) 4 63397, based at Fort Bay on the harbor, books groups of typically six to eight people. It offers packages with rooms at various small casual hotels, including the Cottage Club, 10 white cottages with red roofs, kitchens and scenic views near the village of Windwardside.

St. Croix
In the sea beyond the lovely old Danish colonial waterfront in the capital, Christiansted, now being restored by the United States National Park Service, are coral gardens, tropical fish and large sea turtles. A mile long and a half-mile wide with beckoning beaches, Buck Island Reef National Monument, six miles off Christiansted, has a barrier reef comprised mostly of elkhorn coral, a peaceful lagoon and a 120-yard-long snorkeling trail with underwater signs explaining the ecology.

St. Eustatius
Quiet since the late 18th century, when its busy port was sacked by the British Navy, the Dutch island known as Statia never regained prosperity. The excitement today lies in the sea among the dive sites protected in the Marine Park; one is an underwater Grand Canyon. The reefs attract lobster, red snapper, moray eels, turtles, nurse sharks and large schooling fish like African pompano and bonefish. Divers can explore the coralized relics of ships that sank more than 200 years ago.
Dive Statia, (599) 38.2435, fax (599) 38.2539, the island's oldest scuba shop, offers seven-night packages that include accommodations, breakfast, airport transfers, taxes and service charges, plus 10 two-tank dives. The package with a room at the recently reopened Old Gin House is $798 a diver, double occupancy. The hotel was built with bricks that served as ballast on the sailing ships stopping here. The bar was an old cotton gin. The 14 cliffside rooms, facing the pool, have been redecorated, and four additional seaside units are expected to open this winter.
 
St. John
You can reach camping heaven by ferry. The ride takes 15 to 20 minutes from the east end of St. Thomas to the dock on small St. John. A boat is the only way to go. The ferry is $3.
Most of St. John is part of the United States Virgin Islands National Park, traversed by hiking trails.

St. Maarten
Casinos, cruise ships and duty-free shopping set a brisk pace on the island shared by Dutch St. Maarten and French St.-Martin.
The small independent stores that line Front Street in the busy Dutch capital, Phil ipsburg, selling gold jewelry, watches, cameras, cigars and countless other items, offer bargains to buyers willing to comparison shop and haggle. The better deals include rum, perfume and electronics.
There's a lively night scene seven miles from Philipsburg near the airport at the 600-room Maho Beach Hotel and Casino. The Casino Royale, (599) 552 590, which sits in a complex of restaurants, cafes and shops, has 16,000 square feet of gambling now, and is scheduled to grow by 15,000 square feet by winter. The gambling goes on from 1 P.M. to 4 A.M. daily.
 
St. Martin
The Caribbean's best creme brulee? Don't rule out St. Martin, where the cuisine, like the sensibility, is French, a place for people who regard a day at the beach as preparation for dinner.
You can find creme brulee and other delicacies on the west coast in the town of Grand Case at the popular Rainbow Cafe, (590) 87 55 80. Rainbow sits along the beach at 176 Boulevard de Grand Case, at the end of a row of good restaurants.

Non-shoppers might head for Coral World, (888) 695-2073, an aquarium at Coki Beach on the island's northeast shore. The 4.5-acre park has a predator tank, pools of baby sharks, stingrays and turtles and a touch pool, where conch sidle about among sea cucumbers, sea stars and West Indian sea eggs. The Underwater Observatory Tower, 100 feet offshore in a natural reef, allows a look at the open ocean from its lower level.

The trip, from 9 A.M. to noon, or 1 to 4 P.M., includes 45 minutes to an hour at the beach. The tour can be booked at hotels for $49 a person.
 
St. Vincent
Sailboats are the way to roam the Grenadines, the islands and cays lying in a string south of lush, mountainous St. Vincent, brushed by clear seas and efficient trade winds.
For a taste of sailing, Young Island Resort, (800) 223-1108 or (784) 458-4826, fax (784) 457-4567, built on its own 35-acre island 600 feet across the sea from St. Vincent, offers a seven-night package that lets guests spend two or three nights on a crewed 44-foot or 50-foot yacht.

Tortola
Yachts ply the clear blue waters, stopping to allow passengers to swim off secluded beaches, snorkel over a reef or disembark at a lively bar. With countless coves and bays in the British Virgin Islands, sailors are rarely far from anchorages.
On the island of Tortola, the largest in the group, Road Town is among the convenient places to charter a yacht, crewed or bareboat. The Moorings, (800) 368-9991, began operations there 30 years ago and now offers 770 yachts for charter around the world.

Trinidad and Tobago
The common thread is color: flash and dash among the islands' many-splendored species of birds, flowers, butterflies and the fetes that overtake the capital, Port-of-Spain, during the Caribbean's liveliest pre-Lenten season. The fun begins in January with calypso performances and rolls to a crest on Carnival, celebrated the two days before Ash Wednesday -- March 8 next year -- in a frenzy of street parties, parades and bands.
For nature lovers, Trinidad's ground zero is the Asa Wright Nature Center and Lodge, a Victorian plantation house 1,200 feet up in the Northern Range, with hiking trails. The veranda of the main lodge is a lookout for hummingbirds and toucans. The Nature Center, (868) 667-4655, fax (868) 667-4540, off the Blanchisseuse Road, seven miles north of Arima, is open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Entry costs $6.

Virgin Gorda
It's easy to love this island, home of a few secluded resorts, casual but drenched in civility, with hypnotic vistas.
Reachable only by sea, Biras Creek Resort, (800) 608-9661 or (284) 494-3555, fax (284) 494-3557, sits on 140 acres on a remote isthmus above three bays in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean and the North Sound. There are hiking paths with scenic views, a bird sanctuary, a saltwater lake and attractive oceanfront suites with verandas and bicycles. The setting for dinner is romantic, on a hill overlooking the water.
The resort has 23 suites in cottages along the Atlantic shore and 9 suites in the gardens. Rates start at $650 and include meals and airport transfers as well as the use of Sunfish and other small boats, snorkeling gear and trips, two floodlighted tennis courts and snooker.

 BODY:
Before you decide whether to seek the Presidency of these United States on the Reform Party ticket -- and they say they are interested if you are -- there are some things you should know. The party's leftists are recruiting an anti-abortion, anti-immigration creationist, Pat Buchanan, as their champion. The party's centrists -- the heirs of prairie populism, with its dirty fingernails and rage at Eastern elites -- are eyeing a New York developer, Donald Trump, who made his fortune castling the rich and beating poorer people at games of chance. The party's most popular leader, Jesse Ventura, has contempt for one of its founding goals -- and some of the potential candidates are not precisely sure what those are, anyway.
You should probably also know that it is not the best oiled of political machines. This year's national convention ended when the party's lease expired on a small ballroom at the Hyatt in Dearborn, Mich., and the battle-weary delegates -- drained by fights over whether to drop the word "paperless" from the platform or to change "government reform" to "political reform" -- got the boot. 
 You should definitely know that all this, to many Reform Party members, is good news -- evidence of ferment and outsider vigor.
But why dwell on those positives? Consider these: the party has a prize of $12.6 million in taxpayers' money to bestow on whoever wins its nomination. It has a terrier's grip on some issues, like campaign-finance reform, whose time always seems to be coming and -- who knows? -- might even arrive next year. And it has some bright, idealistic, hard-working members who want to awaken indifferent or cynical Americans to their power and possibilities as citizens.
You should know, in short, that the Reform Party on the national level is at a fork, with a chance to forge into the mainstream of American politics and invigorate next year's Presidential contest or -- more likely at the moment, sad to say -- drift off to what a certain jug-eared Texan has in another context called "loo-loo land."
Which fate lies in what direction is anyone's guess, and there is no shortage of hands lunging for the tiller. "The party's not that sophisticated -- yet," confided Hoppy Heidelberg, a member of the Oklahoma delegation to the convention, which was held in July. Heidelberg, who was thrown off the grand jury investigating the Oklahoma City bombing for pursuing his own suspects ("Middle Easterners on contract to the C.I.A."), glimpsed signs of an emerging sophistication. "In time," he predicted, "you will see planks in our platform to get rid of the U.N. and the Federal Reserve."
To realize his vision, Heidelberg will have to contend with the likes of Dan Plyler, an earnest, goateed young man from Morehead, Ky., who is bent on legalizing hemp for industrial purposes and marijuana for medical ones. "I view this party as a hunk of clay that's been thrown in front of us," Plyler said at the back of the convention hall.
I heard much the same thought about the party's malleability expressed just a few weeks ago as I patted Gipper the cat and listened in on the kitchen extension while Pat Buchanan, from his living room, conducted yet another of his spirited talk-radio interviews, this one with a station in St. Louis. The hosts adored Buchanan, but feared for him if he began associating with the likes of Gov. Jesse Ventura, who in an interview with Playboy called organized religion "a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people."
"The views and values and beliefs of Pat Buchanan would, if taken into the Reform Party, become the views and values of the Reform Party nominee, and very probably of the Reform Party itself," Buchanan reassured them. He would be, he continued in his urgent, husky tones, "the most pro-life, traditionalist, conservative, America First nominee in the entire race!"
Other potential Reform candidates likewise sound more interested in capitalizing on the party than building it up. "You know, I hate to say I'm the king of New York," Donald J. Trump told me, as he explained why he would run only if convinced he would win the Presidency, "but I am. And I'm not looking to sort of say, 'Let's go out, work my expletive off for a year, and in the end, I'll get more votes than any third-party candidate in history, and isn't that wonderful.' And what do you have? You have nothing. You have a little asterisk alongside of your name. You got more votes than anybody else thus far. But what good does it do you?"
That evening, when I pressed the point beneath the gamboling sprites on his living-room ceiling, Trump conceded: "It would do them a lot of good. It wouldn't do me a lot of good."
Within the party, Reformers speak of a split between "Dallas," meaning Ross Perot's people, and "Minnesota," meaning the group led by Ventura. That is geographic shorthand for a struggle over philosophy and power. For behind the vivid personalities and the dark if antic intrigue, real ideas are at work here, starkly different visions of individual rights, government responsibilities and foreign policy. The Democrats and Republicans have for years been divided over some of the same issues, including trade and abortion, and as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton proved, a strong candidate can unify and redirect even an established party. But the Reformers are particularly bereft of adult supervision now that Perot, the founder, has at least temporarily left the sandbox. Further, among Reformers, the policy disputes are personal and are more likely to fragment the party because it has almost no history or grass-roots infrastructure to hold it together.
The eventual nominee will have to reconcile the clashing personalities and ideas or else build a new Reform Party around one set of them. That intramural feat accomplished, the candidate would have the chance to do some good. The end of the cold war and the humming economy have lowered the perceived stakes of the Presidency. Bill Clinton has proven its potential entertainment value. And now that the MTV generation has come of age, the popular culture can serve as a political base much the way Texas or Tennessee does. Mostly because of the Reform Party, there is an inspiring sense suddenly that any boy can be President (and you probably are better off being a boy in this testosterone-charged outfit).
People keep talking as if all that's a bad thing. "It's almost the late empire," Buchanan said darkly. "I think we are an unserious people in an unserious time." But somber sound-bite politics is not a roaring success, considering that only 49 percent of the voting-age population bothered to cast a ballot in the last Presidential election and only 36 percent did in 1998. For all their grim-faced speechifying, the Democrats and Republicans are as antsy to avoid matters of substance as the Reformers are slapdash in taking them on. The Reform candidate could capitalize on the upside of the party's zaniness -- its insurgent sensibility and its reach beyond the nightly news to media outlets like "Access Hollywood" -- to stimulate people for whom voting is as irrelevant and unsexy as they find most major-party candidates. That candidate could force the Democrats and Republicans to become more rollicking and more serious at the same time, to broaden their appeal and to get specific about issues like securing Medicare. That candidate could even win. Theoretically.
After handicapping the potential field, Ventura, let out a deep sigh when asked if another candidate might be out there. His enormous hands dropped into his lap and his foghorn voice softened. "I don't know," he told me. "See, that's the tearing that I have inside myself. I know I should be the candidate." He paused. "But what do I do? I'm between a rock and a hard place." He did not want the job, he said, and he would not break his commitment to serve his full term as Governor.
There are some other possible candidates, at least in the dreams of party members. But Warren Beatty insists he wants to save the Democrats' soul, not mold the Reformers', though he has equivocated just enough to keep some members hoping. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former Republican Senator and Independent Governor of Connecticut, says he might run, but only as the candidate of a Reform Party splinter group. (Oh, yes, there is one.) "Circus," spat Weicker, who has been wooed as a candidate by Ventura, when asked what image the Reform Party is projecting. Then for 11 seconds he sat silently, shifting slightly in his chair, before bursting forth with: "Nuts! I mean, it just is -- circus, nuts."
Jack Gargan, a gentlemanly, fittingly big-eared Reformer who was elected party chairman with Ventura's backing at Dearborn, has encountered so much infighting that he is already referring to himself as the "embattled chairman-elect." When I caught up with him earlier this month at a convention in Washington of that splinter group, the American Reform Party, he predicted that none of the names bandied so far would ultimately grace the Reform Party ticket.
"I couldn't even begin," he began, when asked to describe the prince who will come. Then his droopy, hangdog expression lifted itself into a grin. "All of a sudden, somebody will be there, and we'll say, 'Geez, why didn't we think of him or her?' You know, it's going to seem -- Wow!' -- a revelation."
Could it be you? Don't let Jack Gargan down. At least consider your competition.
Ruddy, jowly and wry, Patrick Joseph Buchanan strode into the green room at CNN one afternoon in late September and held out his hand to Skip Smith, the makeup man for his former shout show, "Crossfire." "Skipper," he declared, "I'm in trouble again." Smith knew all about it. That day, Senator John McCain had attacked Buchanan over his new book, "A Republic, Not an Empire," in which he argues that Hitler was provoked by the Allies into attacking the West. The first Presidential candidate in half a century to campaign on his vision for conducting World War II, Buchanan, who is 60, was preparing to spend his afternoon fighting the last war in an appearance on the CNN show "Talk Back Live," followed by other radio and television chats. It was going to be a hard day.
Buchanan, who travels with his own television earpiece, understands the news media as well as any candidate. Rather than merely shaking hands, he has always campaigned more by snatching "free media" -- showing up at dawn at local television stations, for example, to offer himself to content-starved morning shows. That is part of his attraction for the Reform Party, where publicity has substituted for the traditional work of grass-roots organizing. Reformers like to call their outfit a "cyberparty," since it lacks a bricks-and-mortar national headquarters. But it is even more of a cable party. Just as the Reform Party was trying to squeeze in between the Democrats and Republicans, cable news was coming of age as a competitor to the networks. The needs of cable and the party were reciprocal, and they have complemented each other ever since Perot chose the CNN show "Larry King Live" to announce his first Presidential candidacy. This year, a compliant news media stands ready to embrace anyone who might enliven the Presidential race, as Buchanan certainly would.
"Just the possibility of him running has so dominated public discussion that the Reform Party has become equal in people's minds to the Republican Party and Democratic Party," crowed Pat Choate, the author and 1996 Reform Party Vice Presidential candidate. That Buchanan has come under fire has made him only more popular with some Reformers, who argue that Perot, too, was cruelly caricatured as soon as he became a threat.
Choate is part of an influential group of Reformers who contend that theirs should be a "nonideological" political party, with Buchanan in the lead. Their theory is part good-government idealism, part desperation move. First part: the political process is so corrupt that there is no point in debating issues like abortion until the system is fixed through campaign-finance reform, same-day voter registration and increased use of referendums and initiatives. Second part: Reformers can agree on nothing except the need for campaign-finance reform, same-day voter registration and increased use of referendums and initiatives. If the nonideological faction carries its ideas into practice, the result would be a strange meta-campaign -- a sort of campaign about campaigning, to build a party devoted to encouraging more parties, with the idea of fostering ideas.
But that will probably not happen. Ideology has a way of asserting itself, particularly when the putative nonideologue is Pat Buchanan. Before a picture of the United States Capitol, he sat alone in a booth and fielded questions from the "Talk Back Live" audience in Atlanta. Characteristically direct, he answered when asked if he would appoint "moral degenerates" as ambassadors. (No, because such people wouldn't support his candidacy.) When one woman told him she could imagine "nothing in the world worse" than a "young girl" forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, he replied evenly: "I respectfully disagree. I think there is something worse, and that's a dead baby."
Buchanan emerged from his booth looking pleased. The questions had been mostly softballs. "That's 700,000 homes, maybe a million," he said of the television audience. "As Nixon would say, that's a rally." His next stop was a CNN conference room. There, leaning over a telephone and karate-chopping the air, he conducted back-to-back drive-time radio interviews in Boston and Baltimore, insisting that he believed Hitler was an "evil monster" and urging people to read his book.
In an interview, Buchanan smiled when I asked whether he would run a "nonideological" campaign if he ultimately chose to abandon the Republicans for the Reformers. He said that the theory might be mere semantics. But he suggested that he would not have to emphasize social issues, because his positions were known and because Federal social policy was minimal, "with the exception of right to life and overturning the Supreme Court."
Such whopping exceptions notwithstanding, this attempt at nonideology has paved the way for one of the strangest political alliances in recent memory, between Buchanan and two increasingly powerful members of the Reform Party, Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani, who have come to dominate the New York branch of the party. By their supporters, Newman, a psychotherapist with shoulder-length silver hair, and Fulani, a two-time Presidential candidate of the former New Alliance Party, are considered visionaries. By their critics, they are considered cultists and anti-Semites, charges that they call smears.
There is no gainsaying their strength within the Reform Party, and rather than ally predictably with one camp, they have shifted their support from Dallas to Minnesota and back again. Unlike most Reformers, their followers vote reliably in a bloc, and Fulani was almost elected vice chairman of the party at the Dearborn convention. Her support was crucial to Gargan's victory as chairman. Talking with the two of them in their lower Manhattan office, it was hard to escape a sense that the embryonic alliance with Buchanan was one of convenience, for they have little thought that he might actually win the Presidency. In fact, they don't want him to.
"We're hoping he gets 10 to 15 percent of the vote," Fulani said. That result, Newman said, "keeps the dollars coming in, and it keeps us as America's major minor party." If the Reform nominee gets 5 percent of the vote in 2000, the party will be entitled to Federal money for the next Presidential election; if the nominee cracks 25 percent, it will achieve the grail of "major party status" and get as much money as the Democrats and Republicans. And if Buchanan actually won by selling the country on his brand of conservatism? "Then," Newman said, "we're all in trouble."
With his radio interviews done, Buchanan had called his office and begun dictating a response to McCain when CNN's "Inside Politics" bloomed on the television screen in the corner of the conference room. The sound was turned down, but Buchanan kept his widening eyes on the screen, and as the images of himself gave way to ones of goose-stepping soldiers, he began a stunned running commentary. "Oh, my goodness, they got Hitler's guys here, and Stalin," he said in a hushed voice. "My goodness, they've got this huge thing on all the camps and stuff." After a long silence, he angrily declared that it was "a hatchet job" on his book. "This is a CNN special, it's quite clear."
He dashed downstairs to "Crossfire," commandeered an office and began mounting a counterattack on his old network from within his old network. "We're getting hammered, but I think we can do it if we hang in there," he comforted his wife, Shelley, over the telephone. He dictated and repeatedly revised statements to his aides, who evidently lacked his grasp of World War II landings. ("Anzio," he rasped into the phone. "A-N-Z-I-O.") Buchanan angrily rejected an offer by a penitent CNN to respond on the air right away, opting instead to take his business to its rival MSNBC, where he would end his day in a shouting match with the historian Stephen E. Ambrose.
Before he left, his good humor restored as always by a fight, he stuck his head into the office of a conservative journalist and "Crossfire" guest, Tucker Carlson. "Lenora Fulani says hello," he said.
'I built that one, and two or three more over there," Donald Trump was saying, Manhattan at his feet as he pointed north and west from the first floor of his apartment, the 66th floor of Trump Tower. He nodded across the street. "And, of course, I bought the General Motors Building. That's pretty great, to own the General Motors Building."
He guided me across the dining room to a model of a tower as he mulled the sacrifices he would have to make to be President. "For Lowell Weicker and Pat Buchanan, there is no decision," he said dismissively. "It's an easy one. I'm the biggest developer in the city, by far, so for me it's a big step. Compare this to Washington." The flick of his hand encompassed the apartment -- with its bulletproof blinds, its blue onyx bathroom, its inches-thick gilt double-doors -- as he gave me an appraising look. "You understand."
Indeed, it is hard to understand why Trump, 53, would run for President, though it is easy enough to understand why he would toy with the idea. There is little downside to considering it; he has a book coming out this winter, and reporters are pounding on his door. Trump said he would get in the race if he believed he would do a better job than the other candidates, and if he believed he would win. But at times it sounded as if the appeal of the race was similar to the challenge that he said led him to dream up this apartment: "I really did this to see if it could be done."
Trump is emerging as the candidate of the Minnesota wing of the party, led by Ventura. Ventura has been casting about for someone who can beat Buchanan, whose social views he regards as out of step with the Reform Party. "He seems to represent the far-reaching right, which is not what the Reform Party is about, at least in my view of it," Ventura said. When I asked if he would leave the Reformers if Buchanan became the nominee, he said, "I'd have a hard time supporting him, unless Mr. Buchanan can sit down with me and in some manner change my perspective of what he stands for."
Ventura has known Trump since his days as Jesse the Body, when he wrestled in a Trump casino. The two have spoken several times about a possible race. While Trump, like Buchanan a registered Republican, told me that Ventura "loved the idea of Trump doing it," Ventura insisted that he was merely "intrigued." But he repeatedly cited what he considered Trump's virtues as a candidate. "He's a job maker, he's an entrepreneur," he said. By contrast, he said of Buchanan, "this guy has never really had a real job, has he?"
Ventura said that he had read advance excerpts of Trump's book and found that their philosophies were similar. Yet Trump's philosophy is hard to pin down. While Reformers regard the campaign-finance system as the evil beneath all evils, the rot corrupting all, Trump told me, "I love campaign-finance laws, because to be honest with you, I'm restricted to giving $1,000 per candidate." There was no question, he said, that donations bought political favor, but "a lot of times, favor is a positive thing." He suggested that the limits might be too low, since they were set two decades ago and have not been adjusted for inflation: "When I have a United States senator who gets on a plane and flies to New York in order to have a meeting with me, in order to get a thousand-dollar contribution, I say to myself, Isn't that a sad thing?" He says that complete disclosure of donations is more important than limits on them.
Trump seems more comfortable with an interventionist government than Ventura, who has a deep libertarian streak. Trump does not drink or smoke because of the urging and example of an older brother, Fred, who died an alcoholic. He hailed lawsuits against the tobacco companies. "And I can't believe, with all the lawyers, with all the scoundrel lawyers that we have in this country, that nobody's attacked the companies that produce all of the alcoholic beverages, because I think that they cause far more damage," he continued. "As part of an agenda, I'd actually do that. Of course, now I just lost a lot of political contributions" -- he grinned and shrugged -- but the nice part about me is, I don't need 'em."
That is a paradoxical element of his draw for the Reform Party, which, in essence, is a self-styled populist movement founded by a billionaire. Though it is out to change the campaign-finance system, the Reform Party is a creature of it. It would not exist if candidates could not spend unlimited amounts of their own money to get themselves elected. The belief of Reformers is not that all money corrupts, but that other people's money does. In fact, the more money someone has, the less corruptible and the more appealing he is. Conversely, it is a bad thing for a candidate to be poor. When I suggested to Ventura that some potential candidates might be more interested in the party's Federal money than its cause, he said: "There's one thing at least about Trump, is he don't need it, per se. I mean, he's not going to be the opportunist who's the poor man standing out there, can't finance anything for himself."
Combined with Trump's great wealth, his aversion to handshaking, which he considers barbaric, would seem at first glance to pose a problem for a populist candidate. As we drove between events one evening in his limousine, he pulled open a cabinet beneath the seat and offered me a Super Sani-Cloth germicidal disposable wipe. "What's really tough," he explained, as we separately wiped away and an antiseptic fragrance filled the car, "is when you're at dinner eating a roll and some guy comes out of the bathroom and says, 'It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Trump,' and sticks his hand out."
Yet the truth is that Trump can backslap with the best of them. His appeal is undeniable, if not easy to explain. Trump, not an ostentatiously introspective man, declined to analyze it. "Whatever it is," he said, "it is." Trump boosts ratings when he appears on television, and when he appears in public, people flock to him. They laugh with him, not at him, though the strange thing is that Trump himself is not laughing. He emerged from his limousine at a benefit in East Harlem and waded into a delighted crowd. As they surged toward him, people joked about seeking an ambassadorship or pleaded for a picture. Over his shoulder, he asked me, "Think this happens to Pat Buchanan?"
And what an extraordinary crowd it was -- at least according to Trump. One man was the "biggest man on Wall Street" and the next the "greatest producer in the history of Broadway." Each glowed as Trump turned the spotlight of his attention on them. "Regis," he declared, "has the No. 1 morning show and the No. 1 evening show."
Seated at Trump's round table, Regis Philbin leaned over and asked if I would write that he was considering joining his friend on the ticket. "I'm thinking of throwing my hat in the ring," he declared in his brassy voice. "I could pull him through. I could make him President! Hell, who needs him? I could be President!"
And why not? It does suddenly seem as if Regis Philbin could reach the Oval Office, or at least credibly run for it.
"There are signs that our political culture is changing in a very dramatic way, and I think again about Jesse Ventura," said Frank Sorauf, an expert on American political parties who is a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Minnesota. "Really, what Jesse Ventura represents is the pop culturization of our politics. Jesse Ventura is a series of icons from the pop culture: wrestling, the in-your-face attitude, the radio talk show, the outrageous behavior -- this is all out of 'The Simpsons,' out of World Federation Wrestling. It's all out of the media. An increasing number of young people view society, including our politics, through the eyes of popular culture."
What is untested on the national level is whether pop-culture politicians understand something about voters or just about the news media. It was an odd thing, recently, to watch George Stephanopoulos, notebook in hand, interviewing Dustin Hoffman about politics in the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton. It was an odd thing to find myself joining a pack of reporters in questioning Jack Nicholson about a prospective candidate's prospects.
"Mad-dog Beatty loves to win," Nicholson wheezed, with that grin from "The Shining." He argued that the proliferation of cable channels and the Internet enhanced his friend's chances, because "you can communicate more easily." Behind his purple shades, he was hunting through the gloom for his girlfriend, Lara Flynn Boyle.
Everyone who had come to hear Warren Beatty address the Southern California Americans for Democratic Action was in on the joke, except that no one was quite sure that it actually was a joke. The audience was winking at his coyness and applauding his bravery at the same time, while journalists -- 150 of them, from as far away as Japan -- were mocking the scene's importance and transmitting it around the globe. And Beatty, acutely conscious of the balance between ironic detachment and yearning for credulousness in his public and the press, played his role to the hilt. He acknowledged that it was spillover from the worship of celebrity that gave him his platform while taking full advantage of that platform to mock his party's candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley, the former Senator.
The sight of paparazzi pressing against rope lines as entertainment television covered a political event was quite appealing. It was reminiscent of a list of calls from the media that Trump handed me for one day, Sept. 14. The list contained 36 messages in all, and among the usual suspects, like "Crossfire," Minnesota Public Radio and The New York Times, were less politically oriented organizations, like "Access Hollywood," "Inside Edition" and "Roseanne." If a candidate wants to excite people who normally do not vote, reaching past "Meet the Press" is probably not a bad way to start.
Yet the exercise at the Beverly Hilton felt fundamentally fraudulent. After delivering a passionate, detailed critique of globalism, the economic recovery and the campaign-finance system, Beatty capped his speech with an appeal to a "drum majorette" who found herself famous enough to influence policy. Despite the "moneyed, honeyed voices of ridicule and reaction," he urged her to speak up: "Let them call you coy."
This was a clever piece of pre-emptive rhetoric, which managed to morph Beatty's coyness from an act of self-indulgence into one of courage. But, in fact, it does not take much courage to be coy and manipulate the press -- certainly nothing compared with the courage it takes to stand for office and risk the rejection of a nation. In that department, Al Gore and Bill Bradley thus far have Beatty beat, hands down.
It was impossible not to wonder why, if Beatty truly cared so deeply about child poverty and income inequality, the facts that he loved "making movies" and was married to "the most breathtaking woman on the planet" would prevent him, as he suggested, from running for office to right such wrongs. Another question -- why the press would nevertheless take him so seriously -- is more easily answered. It is the same reason we pay so much attention to potential Reform Party candidates before they have committed to campaigning. "The news media as an interest group have an interest in confecting a horse race," said Nelson W. Polsby, a professor of political science at U.C. Berkeley.
There is nothing coy about Jesse Ventura. Given the amalgam of paradoxes that is the Reform Party, it is fitting that its most authentic leader would be a former pro wrestler who named his memoir for a line he uttered as a movie actor ("I ain't got time to bleed"). In his book, Ventura, who is 48, calls himself "basically an entertainer" and says of his victory last year, "The bottom line is that my opponents were boring." Yet he does not seem to be putting on a show -- at least not only putting on a show. He seems, in fact, to be honest to a fault.
Ventura makes no effort to hide his love for "The Young and the Restless." He threatens to closet recalcitrant lawmakers with his famously flatulent bulldog, Franklin. Asked about his musical taste recently, he described himself as "more Led Zeppelinish." For all his overbearing self-assurance, he likes to poke fun at himself slyly. He said of Donald Trump, "He's -- excuse the pun, and I hate to use it in this interview -- he's somewhat of a playboy." He had to add, "I hate to use that word right now," before his entourage caught on and started laughing. His small blue eyes vanished in a welter of wrinkles as he grinned.
Earlier this month at Harvard, where he was invited to meet with professors at the Kennedy School, the Governor picked up a couple of school ties because of a scene from "Trading Places" in which Dan Aykroyd snootily mocked Eddie Murphy for wearing one. With gusto, Ventura, who barely attended college and was clearly moved to find himself taken seriously at the university, kept imitating Aykroyd's line, "Like he went to Hahhvahd."
After he appeared on live television before a Harvard audience, Ventura hung around to chat with students. Such political appearances generally have a uniform choreography. A velvet rope separates the politician from the crowd, and he stays in motion so that he can ignore embarrassing questions or wackos as he reaches for the next hand. But Ventura just stood in place, rocking as though he could not quite contain his power. With a felt-tip pen borrowed from a student, he signed baseballs, tickets and copies of the Playboy magazine in which he had just precipitated his greatest public-relations crisis. He answered every question, without hesitation.
Q: If you were in a mosh pit, would you surf?
A: I'm probably the only candidate in any election who had mosh pits at his election party.
Q: What can be done about high-school violence?
A: Parenting.
Q: What about apathy among young voters?
A: There's an old saying that I always say: If you don't vote, don't bitch.
Q: Is it hard for candidates to resist special interests?
A: If they don't have name recognition, they have to buy it, and if they have to buy it, that's selling your soul to rock-and-roll.
Q: What do you think of national health care?
A: I don't like it. I think competition is good. Monopolies are good for a while, and then they become their own worst enemies.
With a condescending grin, one student asked Ventura what he made of school vouchers. The grin faded as Ventura responded with a lengthy warning against the dangers of privatizing public education.
Unlike the nonideologues, Ventura proudly calls himself a centrist, as do the other members of what is known as the "Minnesota clique" to its Reform opponents. Asked what "centrist" means, he says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal, but those labels only roughly approximate where he stands. They do not explain why he insists that gun control is the ability to "put two rounds into the same hole from 25 meters" yet also opposes the death penalty.
Ventura seems to incorporate with unusual consistency what was always most appealing about the Reform Party's message: an insistence on authenticity and accountability. It is his emphasis on accountability that explains his divergence from a core Reform Party stance, protectionism, that has always seemed philosophically at odds with the party's calls for no-excuses responsibility. "We shouldn't shy away from our strength to compete -- we should actually focus in on it, exploit it," Ventura told me. When I asked him if he would like to see that part of the party's platform changed, he shot me a puzzled look. "Would I like to see the language change?" he repeated. "I'd like to see the philosophy change."
At Harvard, Ventura carried a photocopy of the Playboy interview in his suit pocket and pulled it out repeatedly, along with his wire-rimmed glasses, to argue that he had been quoted out of context. He did not back away from his support for legalizing drugs and prostitution. He dutifully repeated for every interviewer cynically seeking a sexy revelation -- and television interviews with the Governor often seem like bearbaiting -- that he had visited prostitutes before he was married. That tidbit, like most of the recent supposed surprises, was contained in his book. He insisted that he believed being "weak minded," as he described followers of organized religion, "is not necessarily a detriment." That sounded disingenuous until he said that he would apply the same adjective to his wife, who attends church.
Ventura also shares the typical Reformers' deep suspicion of government generally and of representative democracy in particular. Just as American business has become fixated on "disintermediation," or cutting out layers of middlemen, Reformers want to eliminate as many layers as possible between voters and policy decisions. This explains the Reformers' obsession with referendums and initiatives and Ventura's drive to combine the two houses of the Minnesota Legislature into one.
For most Reformers, these suspicions of government shade off into dark conspiracy theories, which they also concoct about other party members. Ventura is no exception. He suspects that John F. Kennedy wanted to end the Vietnam War and so was killed by the military-industrial complex. He also suspects that Buchanan is being sent as a "sacrificial lamb" into the Reform Party by the Republicans and the Democrats to destroy it. "Print that one," he urged me. "I've seen it. They will band together. The two parties will band together to stop a third party." Perhaps so, but they may not have to in this case. The Reformers are doing quite a job of carving themselves up on their own.
From shining pate to dimpled chin, Ventura dragged one hand down his face when asked how he would describe where the Reform Party stands today. When he drew his hand away, he was laughing. "Probably in chaos," he said, before growing serious. "We're troubled right now -- there's trouble in the ranks." He laid the blame squarely on Dallas, on Ross Perot and Russell J. Verney, a close Perot ally who is to step down as party chairman at year's end. Ventura accused them of "simply not allowing the party to naturally grow beyond them -- you know, the Reform Party's always been kind of boxed in and been called Ross Perot's party, and I'm starting to believe he believed the publicity."
Despite Ventura's pleas, Perot did not help him when he ran for Governor. "I think there's a jealousy factor," Ventura said, "that I'm successfully elected, and the focus of the Reform Party in the eyes of the media and the world all of a sudden shifted from Ross Perot to Jesse Ventura."
For its part, the Dallas faction is in a rage with Ventura. Verney requested that he leave the party because of his comments in Playboy. "I think he's brought disgrace to the members of the Reform Party," Verney told me. "He's lost his moral authority as a leader within the Reform Party." Verney insisted that any animus flowed one way, from Minnesota. Perot, he said, "is not battling with anyone over anything."
Regardless of who is at fault, the upshot is that the Reform Party is entering a critical election torn by what is essentially a civil war.
To understand the roots of this dispute, with its dueling suspicions of Machiavellian maneuvering, it is helpful to think of the people around Ventura not as the Minnesota faction but as the Lamm faction. Ventura and his top strategists supported Richard D. Lamm, the former Democratic Governor of Colorado, in his run for the Reform Party nomination in 1996. In their view, Lamm was sandbagged by Perot, who after indicating -- they thought -- that he would not run, stepped into the race once Lamm announced his candidacy. Perot won the nomination, using what the Lamm people regard as dirty tricks. Perot wound up with 8 percent of the vote, compared with the 19 percent he won in 1992, when, in one of the great political miscalculations, the Bush campaign permitted him to appear in the debates.
Naturally, the Dallas camp has its own conspiratorial take on the struggle of '96. From its perspective, Lamm was a spoiler dispatched to the Reform Party by the Democrats. "Dick Lamm was one of the 938 close personal friends who slept in the Lincoln Bedroom," Verney said. "The sheets were barely cold when he decided to come over and run for the nomination. And all he did here was complain."
Thomas J. D'Amore Jr., who was a senior Lamm adviser and is close to Weicker, sees a familiar pattern developing. According to this theory, Perot is keeping all options open while delighting in the chaos. "It's different players and a little more smoke this time, but it's still Perot's game," he said. "Perot will offer himself again at some late date as a savior in all this. There's an echo here."
Dean M. Barkley, one of Ventura's top strategists and another Lamm supporter, expressed the same thought this way: "I think Buchanan is the Dick Lamm of 2000."
The candidates will have to clarify their intentions by early spring because of the Reform Party's marathon nominating process. The party is now on the ballot in 20 states and expects to gain access in one more. According to its nominating rules, would-be candidates must get themselves on the ballot in the other states or demonstrate by July that they are making a "good faith" effort to do so. To do that requires either a large number of die-hard volunteers or a large amount of money to gather tens of thousands of signatures around the country. The Minnesotans grumble that the nominating rules were stacked to favor a Perot candidacy because he has the money to hire signature-gatherers; seen in this light, Ventura's interest in Trump takes on new coloration. Trump's advisers say they think that the nomination would cost their man $20 million -- $10 million to get on the ballot and another $10 million to win the vote. They say he has already put three signature-collecting firms on retainer. Rather than money, Buchanan has his pitchfork brigade to rely on, but having seen what Steve Forbes was able to do in 1996, he is clearly worried about the depth of Trump's pockets.
The Dallas camp argues that this nominating system is a sure means of weeding out dilettantes. Verney says that a candidate could start as late as March 14 and still gather the necessary signatures, but he predicts that would cost $6 million. With more time that cost would drop slightly, he says, and with enough volunteers it would plummet.
Once the candidates are approved, the choice of a nominee is as freewheeling as the preceding process is pinched. Ballots are mailed out to every Reform Party member, every person who simply signed one of the petitions and literally any other registered voter who wants one. The Reformers view this as a chance to beef up their membership roles, but it also provides an opening to a candidate to essentially stuff the ballot box.
Perot's intentions are a source of worry to the potential Reform Party candidates, but they would not discuss their concerns on the record for fear of alienating the party's founder. Pat Choate, who is widely respected within the party, said that Perot has expressed no interest in offering himself again. He is approaching 70, Choate said, and his family does not want him to run. Further, Choate said, "he's been so demonized, it's hard for him to rise above 30 percent." But, he said, if there were a "national emergency," like a war or a plunge in the Dow to 2000, "he would be available."
Because Choate is close to Perot, his efforts to recruit Buchanan have been widely seen as Perot backed. But Perot has kept a careful distance from Buchanan, not even speaking to him by telephone. That distance could permit Perot to enter the race later on the pretext of saving his party from the religious right. Or it could be just what Verney says it is, high-minded detachment. "At the moment his position is still that he is going to remain silent, and that silence cannot be interpreted as implied support of somebody," he said. "It is simply silence." He added, "The decision will be made by the members of the Reform Party, and at this point Ross wants that decision made free of any influence from him."
Verney did not rule out a bid for the nomination by Perot: "He has not said one way or another whether he will be a candidate in 2000."
For all the grumbling in the ranks that his time was past, that he needed to move over for Jesse Ventura, Perot was received with wild ovations when he addressed the national convention in July. He twanged away for 38 minutes, offering his characteristic blend of plain talk, common-sense criticisms, vague prescriptions, paranoia and weird metaphors. ("Why doesn't somebody put that in the paper and just pull that skunk up by the tail and let everybody see it?" he said of the poor condition of the military.)
Tellingly, almost the first thing out of his mouth was an announcement that he was being broadcast on C-Span and CNN. He often stared into the cameras, where his party lives, as he addressed the rather paltry crowd of 400 delegates. By the four-minute mark came the first chants of "We want Ross!" Perot never even mentioned Jesse Ventura, and without naming him, he bashed Dick Lamm for having slept in the Lincoln Bedroom. "I've been told that the team that worked for this person is back again," he warned. "Now, so there you are, O.K.?"
He concluded with a formulation familiar from his previous campaigns, insisting that he would leave it strictly to the members to decide what he should do. "The thing I want you to understand," he said, "is that as long as I am helpful to the organization, I am certainly happy to help and participate in any constructive way."
As moved as some delegates were by the founder's appearance, the convention's most poignant moment came later that evening when a group of actual, declared Presidential candidates gathered in a loose, shy semicircle. These were the candidates you have never heard of, and probably never will: Reform Party members with a particular grievance or cause or a touch of Napoleonic fervor. They spoke out in the hall to a gaggle of smirking reporters and a handful of delegates. None were rich or famous, and so the convention had voted earlier in the day not to permit them to address it.
And so it turns out that you probably should not seek the Reform Party nomination, after all. The sad truth is that even for the Reformers, any boy can't be President. The party will not be interested in you unless you meet certain criteria, which the news media insist on as well. (Note the failure to name the minor candidates above.) You have to be famous like Buchanan or rich like Trump or -- like Trump -- both.
Some people who would make effective Reform Party candidates are already running, in other parties. To the extent that they make their own races more provocative -- by presenting themselves as authentic insurgents fed up with the system -- they will diminish the value and attraction of the Reformers. Bill Bradley is one of them. A more potent choice would be Senator John McCain, the maverick Arizona Republican who has made a crusade of tightening the campaign-finance system. Ventura tried to recruit him, but McCain wasn't interested. "His natural move should be with the Reform Party," Ventura said.
Perhaps it should be. But right now it surely is not. The unseriousness of the Reformers -- exactly what gets them so much attention -- has reached the point that it is eclipsing the seriousness of their stated purpose, to root out political corruption and instill fiscal discipline. Too many Reformers seem content with the circus and the nuts. They have turned out to be easily distracted from their mission by celebrity sweepstakes, picayune platform details and backbiting. Despite its worthy goals, the party has always functioned more like a cult of personality, and now it has altogether too much of it for anybody's good.

Condos Make a Sharp Comeback in Fairfield County

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
CONDOMINIUMS are making a spectacular comeback in Fairfield County, selling briskly to first-time buyers, empty-nesters, single professionals and investors.
The main reason for the turnaround, say brokers, is inflated house prices coupled with very low inventories, resulting in a tight, expensive rental market. This, they say, makes it more sensible and often cheaper to buy. 
 Moreover, they explain, tax deductions for mortgage interest, depreciation, and property taxes can bring monthly costs of a condominium unit below a rental of similar size and quality, and the owner has something that will appreciate in value -- these days almost overnight.
Forgotten is the decade ending in 1996 when condominiums were often worth less than their outstanding mortgages. Investors who are new to the market -- and even those who suffered a double whammy when the recession followed on the heels of the 1986 Federal law restricting tax deductions for investor-owned condominiums -- are coming back.
"They bought like they were playing Monopoly," recalled Elayne Jassey, a broker at Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford, for whom the years of difficulties for condominium owners are still a vivid memory. "Prices kept going up and they thought it would never end." But end it did, and a glut of units sat unsold for years, even at drastically reduced prices.
Now, two-bedroom condominium prices in Stamford have rebounded from an average of $75,500 in 1994 to $172,500 this year, according to statistics from William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford. The statistics also show that 656 units have been sold this year through mid-October, when 192 were on the market. In 1998, 566 were sold for the entire year.
The customer looking for a unit to live in faces a seller's market -- "especially for hot developments," said Ms. Jassey.
"As each unit comes up and creates a new high, the next person who lists in that development goes up another few thousand," she explained. "Buyers who aren't willing to bid above the offering price often lose out." Owners who have waited for values to be restored are seizing the opportunity to sell. If their tenants won't buy, someone else will, and the tenant must move, she added.
A popular 365-unit Stamford complex called Chesterfield is monitored closely by brokers who have clients on waiting lists. A one-bedroom unit sells for around $215,000 and two-bedroom units cost about $255,000. Rent for a two-bedroom, 1,200-square-foot unit with a cathedral ceiling and fireplace is around $2,100 a month.
While most condominiums are being purchased by owner-occupants these days, they are also attracting "a different kind of investor," said Ms. Jassey, those who see "a positive cash flow rather than tax benefits."
Moreover, the tax law is better understood today and less fearsome than first anticipated, said Gene Qualman, the founding principal in the Darien accounting firm of Able & Company.
He explained the way the Tax Reform Law of 1986 works for condominium investors as follows:
If the owner's adjusted gross income is under $100,000 and the condominium is rented out, the owner may take a deduction from his income tax for losses up to $25,000. The amount is calculated by subtracting from the rent allowable deductions -- such as the annual depreciation on the unit, insurance, monthly fees, property taxes, maintenance and repairs. A loss occurs when expenses exceed the rental income.
If the owner's income is above $100,000 but below $150,000 and a loss is sustained after deductible expenses have been subtracted from the rent, the loss may be deducted in the current year, pro-rated on a complex Internal Revenue Service formula.
When the owner's annual income exceeds $150,000, no loss may be currently deducted. Instead, it is carried forward until the unit is sold, or the loss may be deducted in future years when the unit becomes profitable again.
Lower interest rates and higher rents, said Mr. Qualman, the accountant, have made condominiums an attractive investment.
Karin Wagner, a North Stamford resident, owns three Chesterfield units. She bought one last month; the other two she purchased in 1984 after selling a house she owned as rental property.
"The house required a lot of maintenance," said Ms. Wagner. "Condos just need painting and carpet cleaning." She said she had been dismayed by a 20 percent loss in her stock portfolio over the last couple of years.
"I don't feel comfortable with stocks anymore, and bonds stay at the same value and income," she explained. "Here, capital continues to go up. Real estate prices could drop by $50,000, but they come back again. It's a problem only if you are a short-term investor."
ONE of the more unusual condominium developments under construction in Stamford is called Victorian Manor. "We created seven units out of an 1890 sea captain's house," said Donald R. Corbo, project manager for Viking Construction, a local builder, "and we are attaching to it an additional 20 units of similar character." Three units in the main house, each one different from the rest, have been sold for $235,000 to $255,000.
The three-story addition in the back will have simplexes on the ground floor and duplexes above, reached by elevator.
In Greenwich, there is a waiting list for condominiums at Waterford, a 24-unit complex overlooking Cos Cob harbor. When it opened in 1989 it created a sensation by breaching the million-dollar condominium mark for the first time in Connecticut history, selling units for $1.5 million to $2 million.
Brad Hvolbeck, owner of Brad Hvolbeck Prudential Real Estate in Greenwich, recently sold a Waterford condominium for $1.7 million. "When they scale down here, it's from a multimillion-dollar house to a million-dollar condo," he said. "Seventy-five percent of the residents at Waterford are Greenwich people who sold big homes but want to keep a place in town."
James Fieber, principal of the Fieber Group in New Canaan, is awaiting site plan approval for 16 luxury condominiums he plans to build in New Canaan in four to six three-story buildings. By siting his complex within walking distance of the shopping and entertainment district, Mr. Fieber noted, "we are aiming at seniors -- empty-nesters. Our goal is to make a lateral move quality-wise from a large house, but with the convenience of maintenance-free town-house living."
An elevator, maid's room, library, terrace, garage and recreation room, top floor master suite and two additional bedrooms are included in each unit. Prices will open at $800,000 to $900,000. "Customizing could bring the total to $1 million," said Mr. Fieber.
Among projects now in construction is the Carriage House in Norwalk, begun more than a year ago by Building & Land Technology of Wilton. The first 36-unit building of the 66-unit complex is sold out. A second building containing the remainder of the two-bedroom apartments with 1,600 to 1,800 square feet of space will be completed next month. Prices in the new section will rise to $220,000 from the $180,000 charged for the first units.
Each building is designed with a single entry, a security gate in the garage, and storage cubicles. Common charges covering hallways, elevators, exterior maintenance and landscaping are $131 a month.
"We are getting three prototypes," said Mr. Kuehner, "move-down buyers, divorcees -- predominantly female -- and first-time home buyers." So far, he said, "there are no children in the complex."
Also under construction is a 140-unit development of attached town houses in Danbury called Lexington Mews. It is being built on 32 acres along Old Brookfield Road, just off I-84, five minutes from the Danbury Fair Mall.
Site work has barely begun, but the developer, Baker Residential of Pleasantville, N.Y., has sold 27 units from plans. Priced from $174,000 to $215,000, the first units are scheduled for completion in March.
Six floor plans are available for two- and three-bedroom units of 1,800 to 2,200 square feet, with decks, finished walkout basements, separate dining rooms, and fully equipped kitchens. A residents' swimming pool, poolhouse and tennis court are to be built by the developer.
"We are planning a second similar town-house development in the Greater Danbury area," said Norman Greenberg, vice-president of Baker Residential. "There is a demand for attractive, affordable multifamily housing with room for an office that can serve as a guest room, or a part-time room for college-age children."
On the shores of the Connecticut River just north of Long Island Sound, hearings are being held for a condominium proposal in the venerable town of Essex. Elm Development Services of East Longmeadow, Mass., wants to construct several buildings containing a total of 62 units on a 40-acre-tract.
The project was voted down by the town's Planning Commission, which acts in an advisory capacity, and it is vigorously opposed by a group of some 200 residents called Friends of the Falls River Association.
Paul Lehman, spokesman for the group, lives at the end of the road where the development is planned. He noted that local concerns include the developer's proposal for a septic system with large leaching fields that could pollute the Falls River, and traffic on a two-lane road that already serves 92 homes.
"There is a demand for condos," said Mr. Lehman. "But any development is looked at very carefully here, with a certain amount of prejudice based on the town wanting to preserve its look and feel. This is where a lot of Fairfield County people come to retire."

Builders' Showrooms Cater to the Appetite for Extras

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FIVE months ago Alan Burtick and his wife, Josephine Cavanaugh, bought a 2,600-square-foot house in a 411-unit single-family home subdivision being developed in Mansfield Township, in Burlington County.
The couple paid $190,000 for the house, and an additional $26,000 in upgrades and options to turn it into what they describe as their dream home. They put in the hardwood floors and ceramic tile she wished for and the cathedral ceiling in the master bedroom and extra windows in the family room that he wanted. 
 To select their options the couple -- she is 39, he is 41 -- worked with a consultant at the central design showroom in Edison, a 40-minute drive from Mansfield, that the developer, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, recently opened to show buyers ways to customize their homes. The $2 million center, among the largest in the nation, is in a low-rise building in the huge Raritan Center business park. The 17,000-square-foot center displays 21 kitchen and six bathroom arrangements, 10 fireplaces and more than 800 flooring samples.
In addition to Hovnanian, at least two other developers in the state -- U.S. Home and Westminster Communities, as well as the Matzel & Mumford Organization, a Hovnanian subsidiary -- have gotten into the business of selling options from central design centers. Such centers satisfy buyers' appetites for extras that can add from 10 to 20 percent to the price of a house.
Gopal Ahulwalia, director of research at the National Association of Homebuilders in Washington, said design centers were inevitable, given the robust housing market of recent years. But, he said, only builders who operate in large markets and whose sales volume can support such showrooms will open them. "It's all about marketing to today's buyers, especially baby boomers and empty-nesters who have more money and are willing to spend it," Mr. Ahulwalia said. "The more choices developers offer them, the more buyers want and the more they will spend."
Generally, he said, salespeople at design centers work "mostly on salary, but also salary plus commission." Hovnanian and Westminster pay salary plus commission. U.S. Home refused to say how it compensates its salespeople.
Because of the wide choices at the Hovnanian design center, Mr. Burtick and Ms. Cavanaugh said they had spent $6,000 more on options than they had planned. "You see it, so you have to have it," said Ms. Cavanaugh, an administrative assistant at the Insignia/ESG commercial real estate brokerage concern in Manhattan. "It's a very wise move on the part of the developer."
Mr. Burtick, who is a sales representative for a commercial printing company in Secaucus added: "Buying a house is a big investment, so it should be what you want."
But will central design centers shut down if the market sours? Many probably will, Mr. Ahulwalia said. He added, however, that the housing market nationally, as well as in New Jersey, should remain positive for at least the next two years.
NOT all large builders in the state are sold on the concept of central design centers. Some choose instead to use the traditional approach of selling options from a room within a model home at each development. One is Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., which is developing seven projects in New Jersey, together totaling 770 units and priced from $188,000 to $583,000. The units include town houses, detached single-family homes and active adult residences for buyers 55 and over.
"Buyers are busy and it's easier and more convenient for them to pick out their options and get mortgage help right where they are buying their homes instead of driving to a design center," said Trina Lowry, marketing manager at Toll, which has its own mortgage affiliate, Westminster Mortgage. She said Toll also offered homebuyers a book of more than 300 options, adding that at large developments it dedicates an entire model home to the selection of options and upgrades.
Lon Tabatchnick, a principal of Bertram Associates of Union, said selling upgrades at a central showroom could make the process seem impersonal and buyers feel they are shopping at a Kmart.
"People don't buy a house the same way they buy a shirt," he said. His firm is developing 10 projects with a total of 600 attached and detached single-family homes, priced in the high $200,000's to more than $1 million. Upgrades for each are sold from an on-site sales office.
Ms. Cavanaugh said she and her husband did not mind the three trips to Hovnanian's design center for the three two-hour sessions they had with their consultant, which, she noted, made their experience far from impersonal. "It felt almost like the house was being custom designed," she said.
The Hovnanian center now serves 10 developments, together totaling about 1,000 units, ranging from town houses to single-family homes and active adult residences and priced from $150,000 to more than $600,000. On average, the company builds about 2,000 homes a year in New Jersey.
By separating the sales process from that of selecting upgrades, the design center "provides today's buyers, who are more educated and expect more," better service because they are helped "by people whose passion is design," said Ara Hovnanian, president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises. Buying in volume provides the company "with economies of scale and consumers with more choices," added Gabriel Pasquale, vice president of marketing at Hovnanian.
Hovnanian, U.S. Home and Westminster all said that they pass along to buyers savings in volume purchases of extras. A spokesman for Matzel & Mumford said volume purchases enabled them to have "competitive pricing."
The company also offers mortgage assistance at the center though its affiliate, K. Hovnanian Mortgage.
The design center is part of the company's growth strategy, which Mr. Hovnanian said "is to be the dominant player in the areas where we operate rather than be everywhere in the country." Plans call for opening design galleries in other areas, including the Washington, D.C., area and North Carolina, he said.
The company also plans to grow by acquiring other builders. In New Jersey it recently acquired Matzel & Mumford, which was among the state's first builders to offer buyers a central location to select upgrades. The company, which builds about 300 attached and detached single-family homes a year, opened a 4,000-square-foot center in 1992 at its Hazlet headquarters.
"We set out to improve our operations and efficiency," said Roger Mumford, a company principal. "Making the process more convenient makes it more profitable."
While Mr. Mumford said there was a natural tendency to offer an overwhelming number of options, his firm has limited its selection to avoid problems with availability and delivery. The idea is not just to offer buyers different products but to offer them the opportunity "to meet with a design expert to plan out their lifestyle and equip their new home," he said.
Providing convenience to buyers is also why U.S. Home, a national builder headquartered in Houston, opened its design center in New Jersey nearly two years ago within 3,000 square feet of space at its Freehold office. "Customers didn't want to keep coming back," said LuAnn Dunkinson, the center's director, noting that they can select upgrades or customize their homes, including moving walls, "in one day with the help of a professional design consultant." And that gives the company a competitive edge, she said.
The center serves buyers at the five projects the company is building in the state, together totaling 2,400 single-family and active adult homes and priced from $150,000 to $400,000. Mortgage options are also available at the center, one of 18 U.S. Home centers throughout the country.
Westminster Communities, a division of the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, is the latest to make a central design center available to its homebuyers. Its $1.2 million center opened a month ago with 7,000 square feet of space at its corporate headquarters.
"Buyers today demand a higher level of service and want to be involved in the selection process," said Nicholas Minoia, president of Westminster Homes. A design center "is the best way" to give them both, he said.
Centralizing the buying process is also a benefit to a growing company, like Westminster, Mr. Minoia said. He said his company, which builds about 400 residences a year, expects to increase its production level to 750 to 1,000 homes in the next two years.
Mr. Burtick and Ms. Cavanaugh, for their part, said they considered the options they added an investment that would help raise the value of their home over time. They expect to move into the house in February, Ms. Cavanaugh said, and "with all the money we invested, we don't intend to leave until we retire and move to Florida."

HEADLINE: A Group Pushes to Preserve the Merritt

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
THE Merritt Parkway, which runs from Greenwich to Stratford, is a state highway and is listed on maps as Interstate 15. That makes it seem no different from I-84 or I-95 -- roads that simply take you from here to there and leave you at your exit, relieved to get off.
But for decades, the Merritt has been more than a highway. Some people drive on it just to experience the road, especially in the fall. And that is what its designers had in mind. 
 In the late 1930's and into the 1940's, it was not unusual for a family to take a Sunday drive on the parkway, following the ribbonlike road as it passed by woodlands, hills and panoramic vistas. Now, fans of the highway hope to improve the Merritt's landscaping with public support. They want to create a conservancy for the preservation and enhancement of the Merritt, a rare move for a roadway.
"The Merritt has long been viewed as a special type of road, a special driving experience," said Peter Szabo, a former deputy commissioner for policy and planning in the Connecticut Department of Transportation and the author of a new study that recommends the creation of a Merritt Parkway conservancy. "When you talk to people who remember the parkway from the 40's and 50's, they talk like it was this incredible dream to drive on."
Having survived earlier pressures to widen its lanes to accommodate the estimated 60,000 vehicles that travel its 38 miles every day, the Merritt faces a new challenge: how to keep it beautiful and still meet current transportation needs. There are state and Federal funds for capital improvements, but experts said the Transportation Department could not handle the esthetics, like landscaping, because it lacks funds, manpower and expertise.
Last spring, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation hired Mr. Szabo to research the feasibility of creating a conservancy for the Merritt Parkway by, among other things, looking at similar nonprofit entities protecting and promoting Central Park in New York City and a string of parks in Boston called the Emerald Necklace. A conservancy serves as an advocacy, resource and fund-raising body and, one was created in 1991 for the Bronx River Parkway in New York.
Emil Frankel, who was the Transportation Commissioner under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker, said the timing was right for a public-private partnership.
"Public funds can be used to restore the parkway, and private efforts -- funds, in-kind contributions and energies -- can be used to maintain these projects after they've been completed," he said. "We can have safety and beauty. They are not in conflict."
Public good will toward the Merritt, healthy economic conditions and maintenance work already under way make it an opportune time to create a conservancy, Mr. Szabo said. Its primary mission would be to attract funds and services to enhance the Merritt's appearance.
The conservancy would promote the state's Adopt-a-Ramp program on the Merritt, in which sponsoring groups and companies pay for landscaping work at entrance and exit ramps. The conservancy could also create similar programs for bridges, landscaped sections and service areas.
Mr. Szabo also recommended that a board of directors be established, made up largely of people and corporations from Fairfield County, the state's Transportation Commissioner or designee, and the executive director of the Connecticut Trust. He suggested that a conservancy educate the public about the Merritt's history by creating interactive materials (like a map of the highway's special features) that would be available at service areas, a traveling exhibit that could be loaned to libraries or museums, college course curriculums, and van tours of key sites.
Mr. Szabo estimated start-up costs of $15,000 and a first-year budget of at least $112,000, which would include $67,000 for part-time staff members and expenses and $45,000 for ramp maintenance services.
The study results were presented to the Connecticut Trust in late September and the proposal is expected to be voted upon by its board of trustees Nov. 17, said Helen Higgins, the trust's executive director. If the conservancy is approved, the trust must begin developing a constituency from the towns bordering the road, she said.
Although she would not predict the board's response, Ms. Higgins said, "There certainly is enthusiasm and long institutional support for the Merritt Parkway."
Deanne Winokur of Greenwich, a philanthropist and member of the Connecticut Trust's advisory committee working with Mr. Szabo, said she hoped that private supporters -- including individuals, garden clubs and environmental groups -- would extend their skills and resources beyond town borders to back the conservancy effort.
"It will be the people who saw what happened with Central Park and other conservation groups -- and who think past their own lifetimes and generations in the future -- who will think of the longevity of that road and its historical beauty the way they would a historical building," Ms. Winokur said.
Besides Mr. Szabo, a key player in the conservancy effort is Mr. Frankel, who served as Transportation Commissioner from 1991 to 1995 and is now on the Connecticut Trust's board. It was during Mr. Frankel's tenure, in 1991, that the Merritt Parkway was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its landscape design, Art Deco and Art Moderne bridges, and preservation and enhancement of woodlands.
There are only 80 to 90 scenic roads on the register, and few are limited-access highways, said Dan Marriott, director of the Rural Heritage Program at the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Mr. Marriott called the Merritt "one of the cutting-edge roads," along with the Arroyo Seco Parkway between Los Angeles and Pasadena in California, and hailed the conservancy effort.
"Protecting historical roads is an emerging movement," Mr. Marriott said. "They showcase the history of transportation in this country. Roads like the Merritt Parkway were some of the really early efforts to provide a very sensitive balance between the automobile and the landscape. Unfortunately, that's something we've really lost in recent years. Any sense of esthetics becomes incidental."
Construction of the Merritt Parkway began in Greenwich in 1934 and the first section, from Greenwich to Norwalk, was opened on June 29, 1938. It reached its terminus at the Housatonic River (Sikorsky) Bridge on Labor Day in 1940. The highway, which cost an estimated $21 million, was named after Congressman Schuyler Merritt of Stamford, who pushed for construction of a road that followed the topography of the land.
The bridges, each of a different design, were created under the supervision of the architect George Dunkelberger. The landscape architects, led by Thayer Chase and Earl Wood, used hardy native plants that would require little maintenance and provide fall color and spring flowers. Unfortunately, Mr. Frankel said, the landscape design, which included laurel and dogwood trees, cannot be followed completely today because plantings must be able to tolerate the salt applied to the road in winter and also repel deer, which will otherwise eat them.
Today, the Merritt Parkway is in good physical shape, state officials and preservationists agreed, but they said the Transportation Department should remain focused on transportation, safety and maintenance, not historic restoration. Since the Merritt's inclusion on the National Register, however, the department has paid the parkway much attention. It has created a landscape master plan and a bridge conservation plan and has received Federal transportation funds to address safety and maintenance needs.
Projects in Greenwich and Stratford are near completion. Among the improvements are new curbing, landscaping, road resurfacing and steel-backed and crash-tested guide rails with wooden facades.
Seven other improvement projects are planned in the next few years, said Brad Smith, manager of state design for the Transportation Department.
Couldn't the department maintain the parkway's charms without a conservancy? Mr. Szabo said the department's maintenance budget has fallen since the 1950's and the equivalent of 15 state employees work on the Merritt full time. Their chores, explained Mr. Smith, include mowing grass, repairing guide rails and bridges, unclogging catch basins and picking up litter and dead animals.
"We welcome the help," he said of a private partnership. "A lot of states do this. It works well. When things start to look better, it's funny, people tend to treat it better."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In /Rowayton, Conn.;
A Neighborly Enclave on the Sound

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST 

 BODY:
EDGING its way down the Five Mile River to Long Island Sound, the community of Rowayton shows telltale signs of creeping exclusivity. Some young families moving in are enlarging older ranches and even tearing them down to build bigger homes.
This has set longtime residents to grumbling about oversized mansions and obstructed water views. 
 But some things about this coastal enclave of Norwalk never change, and that's a comfort to the people who chose it for its traditional village appeal. The chain-link fence surrounding the old schoolyard off Rowayton Avenue still serves as the community bulletin board. The locals still hang out at Rowayton Hardware in the village center. And every December, the outdoor Christmas pageant, complete with live donkeys, still brings people out in the cold to sing carols together by flashlight.
"This is a real community," said Barbara Garfield, a designer who raised her four children in Darien before moving to Rowayton four years ago. "I go for a walk every morning and people come out and say hello to me. Two little old ladies who'd seen me walking by their house every day even came out and invited me in for tea."
The layout of what is officially known as the Sixth Taxing District of Norwalk encourages such familiarity. Houses are closely spaced along narrow streets -- "As I'm washing dishes, I'm looking into a neighbor's living room," joked Andrew P. D'Alessio, a district commissioner.
Rowayton's mere 1.28 square miles, as well as a shortage of parking spaces in the village center, encourage residents to do their errands on foot. Mingling naturally follows, said Victoria Hirsch, 32, who regularly hoofs it behind her 2-year-old son's stroller.
"When we moved here in the summer of '98, I thought I was going to horn in on my cousin and her friends here," said Ms. Hirsch, who is renovating a ranch with her husband, Gary, 36, a lawyer in Manhattan. "Now I know more people in Rowayton than she does because she works during the day and I'm out and about."
Founded by farmers and fishermen in the 1600's, Rowayton has gone through several metamorphoses. In the mid-1800's, it was a major oystering center, shipping tens of thousands of bushels annually. In his history of the village, "Rowayton on the Half Shell," Frank E. Raymond, a native of the community, notes that the eastern side of what is now Rowayton Avenue was then known as "Oysterman's Row" because the large Victorian homes on the street were all owned by oystermen.
By the turn of the century, when oystering had begun to decline, Rowayton had become a tourist destination. Steamboats and trolleys delivered crowds of visitors to Roton Point Park on the Sound. In addition to its beaches, the park featured a merry-go-round, dancing pavilion, roller coaster and other amusements.
Now a suburb with several office buildings along Rowayton Avenue, Rowayton has used its taxing authority to maintain a degree of independence from Norwalk. In addition to Norwalk taxes, residents pay a Sixth District tax to maintain their own street lights, parks, beach, public library and community center. But the illusion of separation is briefly shattered every morning when a the lengthy caravan of United Parcel Service trucks comes rumbling through town from a nearby Norwalk industrial park.
Still-smaller fiefdoms have grown up within Rowayton in the form of the private beach communities of Bell Island, Pine Point and Rowayton Beach. Mr. D'Alessio, who lives in Bell Island, notes that current tastes for larger homes are rapidly transforming these communities. Bell Island, for instance, once consisted primarily of small, one-story houses. "Now, they spend $500,000 to $1 million for the property," Mr. D'Alessio said. "Then they bring in a Dumpster and put the house in it."
Houses with views of Long Island Sound typically start at about $500,000, says Fran LeMoult, a sales associate for Prudential Wheeler Real Estate in Darien. Waterfront properties seldom go for less than $2 million, she said.
HOUSING styles vary widely, from modest Cape Cods and cottages, to charming English cottages neatly penned in by hedges, to grand Victorians. New four-bedroom colonials currently on the market are priced from $795,000 to $895,000.
Rowayton's only condominiums are at Thomas Place, a luxury development along Wilson Cove on the Sound. Four three-bedroom apartments are in one building and one without water views is under contract for $899,000, said Ms. LeMoult. In addition, there are 21 detached colonials, one of which, a four-bedroom house, sold earlier this year for $1.125 million.
With a dry-cleaner, a post office and a hardware store, the village's commercial center on Rowayton Avenue provides some of the necessities, as well as a few luxuries. Rowayton Market caters to gourmet tastes. And the relatively new River Cat Grill features tapa-sized portions for sampling with a wide selection of wines by the glass.
Other eating establishments include Rowayton Pizza, Wendell's 101, a deli and ice cream shop; Rowayton Seafood and Bistro Du Soleil, which its Chilean owners say has "a global cuisine."
Elsewhere along the avenue's riverfront, boatyards rent moorings and slips. The district operates its own community dock on the river. On Wilson Cove, the private Rowayton Yacht Club at Hickory Bluff provides moorings and launch service.
Roton Point Club, on the former grounds of the amusement park, offers members a private beach, pool and tennis courts. Adjacent to the club, Bayley Beach is open to all Rowayton residents. Named for Neville Bayley, the amusement park's last owner, the beach is enhanced by a picnic area, playground and tennis courts, making it a favorite spot for families.
The influx of young families to Rowayton over the last few years has gradually swelled enrollment at Rowayton School. The student body at the K-5 school has grown from about 270 in 1990 to about 400, said Leslie Pattengill, the principal. However, class sizes are still holding steady at around 20 students, she said.
The school emphasizes the arts throughout its curriculum. "It's a very artsy community and it's the philosophy here that to be a really well-rounded person you want to have exposure to the fine arts of all kinds," Ms. Pattengill said. Internet resources are also incorporated into classroom learning.
Roton Middle School, with an enrollment of 435, serves grades 6 through 8. The school's science curriculum makes considerable use of an onsite planetarium. And students get a jump-start on the high school's focus on foreign languages, offering courses in French, Spanish and Japanese.
The 1,200-student Brien McMahon High School, which serves Rowayton and South Norwalk, draws others from outside the district to its Center for Japanese Studies. According to Joseph Rodriguez, the school principal, the center uses an interdisciplinary approach as well as an exchange program to immerse about 75 students a year in Japanese culture. The school offers a total of seven languages.
ANOTHER of the high school's strengths is its music department, which Mr. Rodriguez calls "absolutely powerful." The school marching band was the lead band in the ticker-tape parade following the New York Yankees' World Series victory last year. And the school's chamber singers performed last year at both Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.
Mr. Rodriguez said that the school's student body is "wonderfully diverse in many senses of the word: racially, linguistically, and economically."
Average S.A.T. scores for the 1998-99 school year were 482 for verbal and 470 for math; state averages were 510 for verbal and 509 for math. Last June 84 percent of 235 graduating seniors went on to higher education.
Outside of the schools, community life tends to revolve around the public library and community center, which are housed in the same building. While the library offers a variety of children's activities, the community center plays host to everything from a farmer's market to the monthly meetings of the district commissioners. And every year on a Saturday in mid-June, area residents begin lining up outside the center as early as 4:30 A.M. for the 375 parking stickers for the Rowayton train station. (About 40 people are currently on the waiting list.)
Perhaps the village's greatest treasure is Pinkney Park, high on the bank overlooking Five Mile River. The park has become all the more prized as commercial development has blocked the river from view.
The midsummer River Ramble, featuring canoe races, live music and kids games, capitalizes on the park's location. And during the last two weeks in June, thousands of area residents descend on the park for Shakespeare on the Sound, a free professional outdoor festival.
More than 100 volunteers help with the evening performances, which have grown so popular that the group is considering extending its season, said Betsy Sprague, the current president. The year 2000 production is "A Winter's Tale."
"People bring their chairs, their blankets, their picnics and their bottles of wine," said Ms. Sprague. "It's a very family-friendly thing."

WARTIME PROSPERITY: Connecticut shoreline towns were frequently raided by the British during the Revolutionary War, and Rowayton was no exception. The British and their Loyalist allies were aided in their nighttime attacks on Rowayton by Capt. Esaias Bouton, whose home sat at the head of Wilson Cove. According to Frank Raymond's "Rowayton on the Half Shell," Bouton signaled to British whaleboats that the coast was clear by lighting a fire in his fireplace. In return, Mr. Raymond wrote, Bouton was said to have been given a cut of the booty from the raiders. Ironically, says the author, Bouton's grandson Nathaniel gave the principal address at the 75th anniversary of the Revolution in 1851.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. Mandana Nakhai;
Professor Sees Changes in Native Iran

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
HERE in the United States, Dr. Mandana Nakhai is a professor at Concordia College in Bronxville. But because she is an Iranian citizen, each time she returns to visit her home country, as she did this summer, she can only come back into the United States after obtaining written permission from her husband.
The inequities of Iranian law toward women is something about which Dr. Nakhai feels passionately. At the same time, she said she is hopeful that things will continue to open up in Iran, a process that she says has begun in the last two years since President Mohammad Khatami took office. 
 Dr. Nakhai, 49, left Iran at 18 to pursue her education at the University of Tennessee. There she met her Iranian-born husband, then a nuclear engineering student. Today the couple live in Stamford. She has her doctorate in English and has been at Concordia for 12 years, where she teaches English literature and is director of the Writing Across the Curriculum Program. This summer she spent a month in Iran, where she was supposed to have lectured at the University of Teheran, but was unable to do so because of student riots, which centered largely on the issues of freedom.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Dr. Nakhai:
Q. When you were growing up, at the time the Shah was still in power, did you feel you had freedom as a woman?
A. Under the Shah, in a superficial way, I would say we had some freedom, because, of course, we had the freedom to go outside unveiled. Women did not have to cover themselves from head to toe as they have to today. But still we lived in a very patriarchal society. In the area of education, women were really not encouraged to continue their education. They were not encouraged to emerge in the social or political arena.
I had more freedom in certain areas, but the very same laws that oppressed women today still existed then. So, yes, we had some freedoms during the Shah, but not freedom in a sense that women experience in the West. Patriarchal attitudes were still prevailing in our society even before the Iranian Revolution.
Q. What events caused you to come to America for your education?
A. Even as a child I was very independent, very stubborn and I was very good at arguing with my parents about this and that. So I suppose they gave up on me. I always had a passion for studying languages, and they really didn't see that as a threat. In other words, I wasn't going to study political science; I wasn't going to study engineering. So they agreed to send me abroad.
I chose English because I fell in love with English literature. To me language is memory, identity, culture. Once you master a language, then suddenly you gain access to another consciousness, another way of thinking. So my parents encouraged me. But they had serious concerns about me leaving home and especially going to America with the ugly stereotypes of permissive women. I had been very sheltered. And they were really reluctant to let me go to graduate school and continue my education, but they were consoled because at that point I was married and they didn't have to worry about their daughter becoming an old maid.
Q. Have you been going back to Iran regularly?
A. Not as regularly as I wished to, but I think in the last three or four years I have felt more comfortable going back to Iran. In fact, one summer I taught at the University of Teheran, and it was a wonderful experience.
Q. How hard is it for you to go from the American society, which is generally free for women to navigate, to Iran?
A. It was very difficult, of course. Here in the United States we take this freedom for granted -- the freedom to say what we want, to be direct and honest. Even though whenever I think of home I think of warmth and an embracing place, yet at the same time I did not feel completely secure. And there were, in fact, things there that made me angry. The situation of women, especially. The revolution of 1979 supposedly realized every citizen's dream -- and I say every citizen's dream -- of democracy. And now two decades after the revolution, sexually discriminating laws still prevail in Iran.
Our new president, Khatami, has said frequently and firmly that he stressed the word of God, the rule of law. The challenge for Iranian women now is to reconcile the Islamic code as understood and interpreted by Muslim theologians with their quest for identity and self-respect. There are really gross incongruities between this ideal of equality and the rights of women in Iran.
Q. What are some examples?
A. Women still, as you know, cannot be seen in public without covering themselves from head to toe. If a woman chooses to go outside wearing the hijab (or veiling), that's fine to me. It should be her choice. When the father of our former Shah came to Iran, he forced women to take off their hijab, and I think that was wrong also. Another thing: a woman can't travel outside the country without her husband's consent. Here I am an educated woman, but every time I want to go somewhere I have to get my husband's consent on paper because I'm not an American citizen.
Also, a man today is allowed to have up to four wives and several concubines at the same time. When I spoke to some people among the clergy they explained to me that nowadays they have added a little article to this law that it should be with the consent of the wife. But you see, it's very, very easy to get around this. A man can threaten his wife that he will take away the children from her and make her consent to the second marriage. And women are at a disadvantage in divorce cases. Men can divorce their wives at their whim, without even notifying her. And in custody battles men always have the edge.
Q. When you were in Iran this summer, did you find things changing for the better?
A. Yes. I interviewed some university professors, lawyers, educated women. I was really impressed by all the reforms. I was told that of the thousands of students who took the university entrance exam last year, for example, women constituted 52 percent of those admitted, and that's wonderful. The entrance exams are extremely difficult. That in itself shows that women are now motivated, that they have hope. Another thing that I found out is that one out of three Iranian physicians is female. I was also impressed by the female filmmakers. I saw a movie, "Two Women," directed by Tahmineh Milani. I was amazed they gave her permission to release the film.
Q. What will be the driving force toward reform?
A. A combination of factors. Education, of course. This is, after all, the Islamic Republic, and how can one forget the Prophet Mohammed's command that you have a responsibility to educate your daughters? I think, also, economic needs. It's impossible right now with the rate of inflation in Iran for a one-income family to live comfortably. Dual career marriages are becoming very common.
Q. How are you treated when you visit Iran? Do Iranians envy you for living in America or resent it?
A. There was ambivalence. There was always a sense of admiration, "You did the right thing." At one point I had asked my friends, What is it you most envy about my life in America? They always said the fact that you're free to choose, that no one tells you how to dress, speak or behave yourself.
They are so afraid of becoming schizophrenic. And that term was used so very often that it scared me, because they live double lives. At home, behind the closed doors, they live a certain way, where men and women socialize and are free to laugh together. But you can't do that outside the home.
In terms of resentment and bitterness, yes, I felt that at times. A friend of mine who is a university professor said it was very easy for us to leave the country, but "we stayed and it has been tremendously difficult but the important thing is we stayed and we resisted this oppression and now things are getting better." But she also said, about women, "In addition to academics we also practice acrobatics." She was trying to tell me the risks women have boldly taken to advance their causes.
Q. Is there any possibility that you would return to Iran to live?
A. I don't think I would go back. I think it's too late for me. But this could be a pivotal moment for Iranian women. I just hope that they won't sabotage themselves by alienating themselves and going about this movement in a negative way. I'm so afraid that if they use extremist methods, there will be a backlash and they will go down. So far they seem on the right path. But it means it will take time and it will take patience.

HEADLINE: Airport Expects Great Things From Airline;
Growth Tends to Follow Southwest

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IN 1997, the first year after Southwest Airlines brought its widely touted low-cost fares to T. F. Green Airport outside Providence, R.I., Green became the nation's fastest-growing airport, with an 88 percent increase in traffic. In 1998, Southwest began service to Manchester Airport in New Hampshire, and it became the top-growing airport in the nation last year.
Now Connecticut officials are hoping for a similar phenomenon at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, where Southwest begins operating on Saturday. 
 Bradley, which has until now had the sixth-highest average air fares in the country, according to industry surveys, should begin dropping quickly down the list as Southwest's arrival spurs competition, say officials of the state Department of Transportation, which runs the airport. The department projects that Bradley traffic will increase from 5.6 million passengers last year to at least 6 million this year, and that will likely double in the next five to seven years, although no one expects that Southwest will generate all those additional trips.
"If history is any indication, based on Southwest's startup at other airports, the other airports revisit their own pricing structure, and as the fares come down that leads to more travel," said Stephen E. Korta, Bradley's administrator. "The overall effect is almost always an increase across the board for all carriers."
Robert F. Juliano, head of aviation and ports for the State Department of Transportation, said even before Southwest has actually begun operating out of Bradley, there are signs that the other airlines are responding. Delta Express, the low-fare subsidiary of Delta, has announced that it is adding daily flights to Orlando and West Palm Beach from Bradley.
Mr. Juliano said Bradley has been trying to convince Southwest to stop in Connecticut for six years, but the last he heard there were 140 airports requesting Southwest's service, so he wasn't sure how long it would take. The arrival of the airline will add momentum to the state's planned $156 million expansion at Bradley, expected to begin late this year, which will include a new terminal and additional airport ramp area. In addition, he said the airport is seeing increased interest from private developers for projects such as a parking garage.
"By the time we conclude development in this next phase it could be close to $300 million in public and private investment, and that's only the beginning. The next step would be international service," Mr. Juliano said.
Andre J. Libert, director of marketing for the Department of Transportation, said he expects Southwest to have a much greater impact on the Connecticut economy than the 44 jobs at the two gates where it will begin service. Having a low-cost air carrier at Bradley will be one more feature that can attract business to the state, he said.
Southwest, which operates more than 2,400 flights a day, is probably best known for its low prices. The introductory fares for service out of Bradley included one-way $99 tickets to more than 30 cities, and regular-price advance purchase tickets such as $39 to Baltimore-Washington International, $126 to Kansas City, and $188 to San Diego.
But Southwest is known for more than its prices. According to the Federal Department of Transportation, it consistently has one of the best on-time arrival records and the fewest number of customer complaints.
Christine A. Turneabe-Connelly, a spokeswoman for Southwest in Dallas, would not disclose advance sales, "but the bookings have been very good," she said.
She said Southwest looks at several things when considering whether to add an airport to its network. It must be convenient for customers to get there, it must not have exorbitant landing fees, and away from the "hub and spoke" systems of other airlines, where overcrowding can lead to flight delays.
"We look at a lot of factors, and every one of them has to be a 'yes,' or we don't go there," Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said. "We get asked all the time when we're coming into Colorado, but it's so expensive to fly into Denver we wouldn't be able to keep our prices low. Basically, we look for a market that is overpriced and underserved, and that was certainly the case in Hartford."
Clearly, Southwest has had a major impact on a number of other airports in the region. At McArthur-Long Island Airport in Islip, traffic has more than doubled since Southwest began service in March, said Trish Pasciutti, the spokeswoman for the airport. Not once in the March-to-August period last year did the number of passengers go much above 90,000, and for two months the counts were below 70,000. In the first month after Southwest came in, the traffic hit almost 130,000, and it climbed to more than 200,000 per month in July and August.
The experience has been very similar at T. F. Green, said Patti A. Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation.
"Our traffic was at 2.4 million passengers a year at the end of 1996," Ms. Goldstein said. "The following year, with a new terminal and Southwest here, that went to 4.1 million, then 4.6 million the next year, and this year looks like it will top 5 million. After six months, Southwest said they needed more gates."
Ms. Goldstein said she does not expect that having Southwest offering service out of Bradley will slow down the growth.
"People asked us the same questions when Southwest went into Manchester, whether it was going to affect us," Ms. Goldstein said. "It didn't. We're both drawing from Boston. They draw from Logan north, and we draw from Logan south."
Southwest started with 12 flights a day out of Green and now is up to 23. Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said the same thing could happen at Bradley, where it will start with 12 daily nonstop departures to Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Nashville and Orlando, as well as 29 connecting flights, and Saturday service to Las Vegas starting Nov. 6.
Ms. Turneabe-Connelly said Southwest's growth has been even more pronounced at other airports. Its first service on the East Coast started in Baltimore in 1993 with eight daily flights and is now up to 87, growing soon to 93 with six a day between Baltimore and Hartford.
"Baltimore is not a typical city for us -- our growth up there has been off the charts," she said. "Not all of our cities grow that much, that fast. But we've seen growth in most of our markets, and we will always look to extend flights to wherever our customers want them."
Mr. Libert predicted that at lease some of the growth Bradley will see will come from people who are new to flying.
"Everywhere Southwest goes, you see people come out of the woodwork who have just never flown before," Mr. Libert said. "There are a lot of people who have never been on an airplane." But he said Bradley will be marketing in new areas as well. For the first time, it has a billboard in Norwalk, and it will be advertising in Danbury, Westchester County, N.Y., and other areas south and west of its usual area.
"We've drawn a few travelers from Albany before now, but we would expect to draw from as far east as Albany in a much bigger way," said Mr. Libert. "And we expect to start picking up more people from Norwalk, even Stamford and White Plains. To the east, we expect to see more people from New London, Willimantic and Worcester."
Mr. Libert said in the past Fairfield County has accounted for perhaps 2 or 3 percent of traffic at Bradley; today, it is up to 10 percent, and he expects that to grow.
"I have seen people drive to Providence from New York City, before Southwest started flying out of Islip," Mr. Libert said. "For the college kids, it'll be absolutely super. I don't think you can take a bus to Baltimore for the price that Southwest is charging."
Sheila M. Burbank, a supervisor at Chartrek Travel in Norwalk, agreed that Southwest will significantly increase traffic from her corner of the state. Currently, she said, some of her customers drive much further to get better fares.
"This is very important to business travelers," she said. "We have people right now who are driving to Providence for the fares, depending on where they're going. If you're traveling from New York or Hartford to Chicago, it's very expensive, and it makes the drive worthwhile. But if Southwest is going to be offering the same fares at Bradley, it would only make sense that they'll go there."
 With a 9,500-foot runway at Bradley, Southwest has been talking to the airport about more long-haul flights, Mr. Libert said. Bradley has the capability to service nonstop west-coast flights.
"Traditionally, Bradley has been a north-south airport. I guess most of the East Coast airports are," Mr. Libert said. "But once you get this east-west movement going, it will be dynamite."

HEADLINE: Officials Call for Defeat of Pipeline

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IT is called the Millennium Pipeline, and the company that wants to build it says the 442-mile underground pipeline will insure that the Northeast has an adequate supply of natural gas for decades. But critics question the wisdom of ending the line in a crowded section of Mount Vernon and, more broadly, whether it is really needed at all.
"This is going into a very crowded and tiny concentrated corridor that already holds three aqueducts, major roads, three railroad tracks and one of the most concentrated census tracks of folks in the Northeast," said Katherine S. Carsky, a county legislator from Yonkers. "Mount Vernon is not the only place in the world this could go." 
 And with Consolidated Edison, Westchester's distributor of natural gas, saying the line is not needed, Louis A. Mosiello of Yonkers, another county legislator, said, "I want to feel comfortable that there is a need for this for the people of Westchester County, and not just a need for the pockets of the Millennium builders."
Those two officials, along with Clinton I. Young and Vito J. Pinto, county legislators who represent Mount Vernon and Bronxville, respectively, are the authors of a nonbinding resolution calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to turn down the application of Columbia Gas Transmission, based in Fairfax, Va., to build the $650 million Millennium Pipeline. The resolution is before the Board's Environment Committee, which is not likely to vote on it soon, said its chairman, Legislator Michael D. Kaplowitz of Somers. "I remain concerned about the environment, but we haven't heard enough, in my opinion, to say the project should be killed," he said.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to act on the application within the next two to six weeks. If the project wins approval from the commission by December, there would still be the final environmental impact statement required by the state before it could go forward, Bentley K. Archer, manager of government affairs for Columbia Gas, said.
Columbia's entry into the region's gas market is the result of deregulation of the industry in the 1980's.
Companies like Columbia can transmit energy from far away and hook into local distribution systems. The transmission systems have been likened to superhighways with the distribution systems as the local roads.
Con Edison is a distributor of gas, not a transmitter. Neither Con Ed nor Columbia supply the gas itself, but instead their lines are leased by the natural gas companies, which then supply it to customers.
The Millennium Pipeline would be 24 inches in diameter, laid in 5-foot-deep trenches with 3 feet of cover. For the most part, the project would use existing rights of way and utility corridors, thereby minimizing impact on the area, Mr. Archer said. "The Millennium Pipeline does offer the residents of Westchester County important benefits such as reasonably priced energy, the ability to improve the reliability of existing utility service, new economic development potential and cleaner air," he said, in a recent letter to members of the Board of Legislators.
As proposed in 1997, the pipeline would start at the Canadian border in Lake Erie, go through northern New York State and wind its way down from Rockland County and cross under the Hudson River.
Here is a description of the Westchester route:
The line would go into Westchester near the Montrose Veterans Affairs Hospital in Cortlandt. It would go along a road next to the hospital, then under the Metro-North line in Croton-on-Hudson and Route 9. It would then enter the Con Ed power line easement and turn south. While on the power line easement, the pipeline would be installed under Furnace Brook Lake, under Teatown Lake and under the Croton River. It would stay in the power line easement until about Millwood in the town of New Castle. It would cross Route 100 and then Chappaqua Road, and then Route 100 a second time. South of Millwood, the pipeline would leave the Con Ed easement for a short distance and follow an abandoned railroad adjacent to the power line easement.
The line would pick up the Con Ed easement once again at the Hawthorne police barracks just to the north of Elmsford. It would cross under I-287, continuing on the power line through Greenburgh and Ardsley. Just south of Ardsley, the pipeline would leave the Con Ed easement and track the edge of the Sprain Brook Parkway and then the Bronx River Parkway. Just before crossing into Mount Vernon, the line would move slightly east from the Bronx River Parkway to be installed along an abandoned trailway, which will be improved. Then the line would continue into southeast Mount Vernon (somewhere around Seventh Avenue and Seventh Street) where it would connect with Con Ed's existing distribution system. From there (the so-called terminus) -- a small building that would have to be built -- gas could be delivered to customers.
"Obviously on a project of this magnitude in every region there is potential for concern, and each area has concerns that are unique to that region," Mr. Archer said. "And the way we've approached it -- we've been out there for some time -- is to get to know each of those areas and their unique concerns and try to develop solutions and strategies to address those needs."
In response to concerns of the members of the Board of Legislators, Columbia recently agreed to pay all expenses of an independent engineering consultant, which the county would hire to oversee the project. In response to concern from the Teatown Reservation, Columbia is considering paying to dredge Teatown Lake.
In writing the resolution calling for the regulatory commission to reject Columbia's application, Mrs. Carsky and the other legislators argued that there should be a better terminus than Mount Vernon. Mr. Archer said his company was willing to consider other sites, but Con Ed had not offered alternatives.
James P. O'Toole, director of public affairs for Con Edison, said there is no better site.
"We really don't have a good spot for this pipe to end," he said. "Of all the spots we have, Mount Vernon is the best of the worst." He added, "It would cause us to incur a cost that we do not want to incur." The cost would ultimately be borne by gas customers, he said.
Mr. O'Toole also challenged Columbia Gas's claim that the region has an inadequate transmission system to meet future needs. He said that existing pipelines, owned by other gas companies, could handle 50 percent more natural gas. Columbia, however, asserts that the need is great and that it already has customers lined up to receive all of the projected gas, including the International Business Machines research center in Yorktown.
Mr. Archer said the I.B.M. center has no natural gas pipes connecting to Con Ed's distribution system and that the nearest potential connection is not economically feasible because it is too far away. The proposed line by Columbia, by contrast, he said, comes very close to the I.B.M. center.
Part of the regulatory commission's task in evaluating Columbia's application is to assess need. This is something that the County Planning Department lacks the expertise to do, said Joyce M. Lannert, the Commissioner, who told the Environment Committee that the county would defer to the Federal agency on the matter. The administration of County Executive Andrew J. Spano has not taken a position on the pipeline proposal, she said.
Nor has Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, a coalition of many of the county's environmental groups, its executive director, Gudrun LeLash, said.
Many of the elected officials in the affected areas of Westchester have expressed concern but seem to be willing to let the Federal assessment process move along. Richard Halevy, director of public affairs and community relations for Yonkers, said of the project, "We'd rather not see it happen," but the pending plan is better than an earlier version that would have been more disruptive to his city. Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon could not be reached for comment, but Mr. Young, the county legislator who represents Mount Vernon, said, "It will, without question, be a real interruption to that community."
Mayor Nancy D. Hand of Bronxville also voiced concern to the Environment Committee. Supervisor Linda G. Cooper of Yorktown, said that she has so far been impressed with the Federal review process and with the efforts of Columbia Gas to deal directly with the town's concerns. "Our concern is what happens when the nice people who come through and tell us all about it leave and the construction crews come through."
Columbia hoped to begin construction in April, Mr. Archer said. The pipeline is built, he said, "in a rolling assembly line," meaning a crew prepares one area, moves on and then the construction crews come into the first area, followed by crews that make sure the area is restored. "In any given area, you may be disturbing things for three to four weeks, then you're gone," he said.
Once completed, the line will transport 714 million cubic feet of natural gas a day, enough by one estimate to heat approximately 500,000 houses.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A $21-Billion Mortgage Initiative;
Fannie Mae Eases Loans

 BODY:
Mortgage programs aimed at making home ownership more accessible for recently arrived immigrants, low-income families and people with poor credit histories in New York City, Nassau, Suffolk and Rockland Counties were announced last week by Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purchaser of mortgages from banks and other home-mortgage originators.
In one of the programs, aimed particularly at immigrants, Fannie Mae plans to purchase $50 million in loans that have been granted on properties that include co-ops and two-family homes. When their credit worthiness is being assessed, applicants seeking the mortgages under this program will be allowed greater flexibility in counting part-time or multiple-job income, and greater use of income from relatives who live with the home buyers. 
 A new program for people with poor credit histories, to be made available by the end of the year, will offer mortgage rates as much as 2 percentage points lower than typically charged such borrowers.
Fannie Mae, which purchases mortgages and packages the loans in pools for sale to investors, announced that $21 billion in mortgage financing would be made available through these, as well as existing community revitalization and development programs in the New York area over the next five years.

HEADLINE: Adding New Floors Atop Old Buildings

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
FIST-THICK bolts have been punched through 53-foot-long, 18,000-pound girders, forging a platform for four new floors atop the masonry walls of an 1860's building on Warren Street in TriBeCa -- an ornate structure that once warehoused munitions for the Remington Arms Company and, later, row upon row of champagne bottles for the G.H. Mumm Company.
By spring, the developer hopes to have sold the four full-floor condominiums being fashioned in the old building, the 6,000-square-foot apartment with a deck on the newly created sixth floor and, perhaps, the new triplex that will top it all off -- for prices ranging from $1.4 million to $4.3 million. 
 At 40 Prince Street in Little Italy, three new floors are being added to create a total of 20 apartments in a 1950's building that already has offices, art studios and residences. At 90th Street and Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side, scaffolding skirts a six-story 1920's building in preparation for the addition of five floors and a penthouse -- virtually doubling the building's size.
The Manhattan residential market, where demand has long outstripped available acreage, has long inspired developers to reach for novel architectural forms -- from the so-called sliver building, rising high from a narrow lot, to the lollipop building (kind of a sliver building topped by T-shaped wings over adjacent brownstones and town houses). These days, it is increasingly spurring construction of piggyback buildings: more floors -- in one case 11 -- added onto an existing structure. At least a dozen piggyback buildings are currently in some state of construction.
"It's definitely a trend," said Richard C. Visconti, acting commissioner of the New York City Department of Buildings. "The strong economy is driving a tremendous amount of residential development."
And as certain areas of the city have been rezoned from commercial to residential use, Mr. Visconti said, developers find it feasible -- particularly in lower Manhattan where many older buildings retain unused development rights -- "to buy buildings and add two, three or whatever the lot will yield in the way of additional floor area."
The phenomenon has generated considerable controversy, particularly from neighbors of buildings experiencing unanticipated growth spurts and, in some cases, people already living in the buildings.
There are immediate concerns, like the din of construction, fear of falling debris and fire safety; and longer-term issues, like access to light and air, the structural integrity of the old building, the historic character of the community and, in grittier districts, the frustration that "there goes the neighborhood" (upscale).
Not to mention sudden loss of that precious commodity: view.
The Department of Buildings cannot quantify the trend in what it refers to as "vertical enlargements" because they are lumped together with applications for all sorts of building alterations. "We have no statistics that say so many permits have been given for vertical enlargements." Mr. Visconti said. "But across the board we're up 31 percent in our alteration applications" -- from 46,214 in 1995 to 60,631 this year. "What is new," Mr. Visconti said, "is that everyone is seeing more and more of it."
Charles Dunne sees it every day -- and not just at the old munitions and champagne warehouse that his company is piggybacking.
Mr. Dunne is a partner in the 60 Warren Street Company. "I live downtown and I see it," he said. "Many buildings are doing one or two floors; I know of five to 10. But I'd say another four or five are adding four or five floors."
"One reason you're seeing this is because the price of raw space has gone up dramatically," Mr. Dunne said. "So to make a project economically viable it's not always possible just to keep and renovate the existing structure. That leaves you two choices, either knock the building down and start from scratch or do what we did.
"We didn't just go out with the idea of adding to a building," Mr. Dunne said. "We found a building we thought was beautiful and tried make it economically viable while preserving it."
Some people are not applauding, their reservations ranging from esthetics to fear of collapse.
Andrew Dolkart, an architectural historian and author of "The Texture of TriBeCa" (TriBeCa Community Association, 1989), pointed out that 60 Warren Street is representative of the first generation of imposing buildings that, starting in the 1850's, transformed what is now called TriBeCa from a neighborhood of Federal-style row houses with sloping roofs and dormer windows into a commercial and manufacturing district.
"It's five stories," Mr. Dolkart said. "That's typical because these buildings predate the elevator. It's an Italianate-style building with segmental arches on the windows of three floors and round arches on top -- a nice variation in the rhythms."
Such buildings were carefully proportioned for their height, Mr. Dolkart said, "so when you add stories you destroy the proportions."
"I hate this stuff," he said. "The Warren Street building is a really significant structure and doesn't deserve to be the base for a taller building. I'd rather see it torn down."
Roger Byrom, a graphics designer, lives across the street from 60 Warren and worries that the building, with its old wooden joists and beams and load-bearing walls, could come tumbling down -- especially if a fire starts in the dry-cleaning plant on the ground floor.
"I've asked structural engineers, 'Am I crazy here?' and they all say no," Mr. Byrom said.
"With that structure on the roof," Mr. Byrom asserted, the building will press the limits of its load-bearing capacity. "Can you imagine," he said, "if any of the integrity of the 100-year-old brickwork is in question, that the building will just buckle and fall over?"
NOT a chance, said Joseph Vance, the architect. "It was built to handle a lot of weight, stacked-up ammunition," Mr. Vance said. "So it was extremely well built."
One wall, on West Broadway, for example, Mr. Vance said, "is two feet thick at the bottom and tapers to 17 inches at the top." And engineers have calculated, he said, that the east wall -- a so-called "party wall" shared with the neighboring building -- "can not only support what we are doing, but a four-story addition on their building as well."
The neighbors were not convinced.
The co-op board at 56 Warren Street filed suit, primarily because of concerns that wood beams inside the old warehouse could catch fire and, with them, the building collapse. In June, City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed wrote to the Buildings Department, echoing those concerns.
"This problem is not unique to this project," the letter said. "Several other buildings in lower Manhattan have been renovated without attention to this critical safety issue. Even a minor fire in one of these buildings could cause a major catastrophe!"
Last month, the Buildings Department responded, saying, in part, that the builder "will be installing noncombustible bracing at required intervals."
Explaining his architectural design, Mr. Vance said: "We are creating a platform on top of the building, spanning from the west wall to the east wall, with three-foot-deep steel beams that transfer the weight of the entire four-story addition to the exterior masonry walls."
To deal with the issues raised by Councilwoman Freed and the neighbors' lawsuit, Mr. Vance said, it was decided to add fireproof steel bracing within the existing fourth floor.
"What they were concerned about is lateral stability," he said. "If you are standing up and someone stands on your shoulders you're wobbly -- laterally unstable. But if you're sitting on the ground and someone stands on your shoulders, you wouldn't wobble as much."
"The fourth floor," Mr. Vance said, "is where the walls are thinnest. And we have, through quantifiable calculation, determined that with the fourth-floor steel beams, every joist in the building could be removed and it would still be stable." On that basis, and with other issues addressed, the lawsuit filed by the board of the neighboring building was settled.
Asked if she was satisfied, Councilwoman Freed said yes and no.
"What the Buildings Department originally approved lacked these additional safeguards," she said. "If the department is saying it is now safe, what was it before?"
While questions of load-bearing capacity are quantifiable, those of esthetics are, as usual, in the eye of the beholder.
The addition was designed to be "modern, distinct from the building below," Mr. Vance said. "We didn't want a Disneyland version of the old building."
For Ms. Freed, "it's an ugly addition, but ugly isn't against the law."
THREE miles north, a sleek, seemingly seamless building dominates Seventh Avenue between 23d and 24th Streets -- the 18-story, sandstone-hued Chelsea. Two years ago, it was a squat, rather featureless seven-story presence. Then, like 60 Warren Street, it sprouted.
But the Chelsea was no relic. When the seven-story base was built in 1987, the developer, the Lazar family, installed a foundation and skeletal beams to eventually bear their higher aspirations -- 11 more floors, an atrium and landscaped decks to blend smoothly with the existing facade.
Still, there were growing pains, particularly because people were already living in the building.
Work on the addition began in February 1997, but came to a halt when tenants went on rent strike to demand compensation for the inconvenience caused by construction -- a dispute eventually settled in Housing Court with the landlord, Ethan H. Lazar, granting one month's free rent to existing tenants.
Compensation, however, could not ameliorate inconvenience.
"For the first few weeks the noise was almost intolerable," said Guy Winch, a psychologist who lives on the sixth floor. "As it went up, it got less."
Dr. Winch, who had recently moved into the building, said that "on one hand I was getting reassurance from management that they were doing it by the book and, on the other, people were going around like Chicken Little."
"My experience was," he said, "it was comparatively not dirty. And if anything went wrong, they were on top of it. I had a couple of leaks and they were fixed within 10 minutes. I called and they came right up. But I'm not saying that was everyone's experience."
Certainly not Salvatore Randazzo's.
Mr. Randazzo, a computer consultant and head of the tenants' association, lives and works on what had been the top floor of the Chelsea. "I have a tape recording of Mr. Lazar," Mr. Randazzo said. "His exact quote was: 'The noise will be a whisper in the distance.' Not so."
"It went on for months," Mr. Randazzo said: "Relentless pounding, jackhammering. Grunge covering everything; you couldn't open the windows. Water damage because of leaks. Total disruption to anyone's life style, especially for people at home during the day." Mr. Lazar declined to comment.
Asked if it was worth the legal battles, the uproar, Mr. Randazzo said: "Well, of course, it's nice now, it's done. But we put in countless hours to fight for a fair rent abatement and, really, to create a safe environment for people living under a construction zone. If landlords, the Buildings Department, the Mayor's office implement initiatives that take into account residents' safety and quality of life, then, yes, it was worth it."
What the contentiousness swirling around piggybacking is all about -- unused development rights -- is commonly referred to as air rights. And Sybil Pollet, a land-use lawyer, believes prospective renters and buyers should be aware that the little building next door offers no guarantee of permanent sunlight, air circulation or that spectacular view.
"Every district in the city has a designated floor-area ratio, or F.A.R., determined by planners' studies relating to building heights in the district and what they think is appropriate going forward," Ms. Pollet explained. The ratios are written into the city's Zoning Resolution, adopted in 1961.
"What you can build is based on this F.A.R., multiplied by the area of the lot," Ms. Pollet said. "That determines the maximum floor area for the entire building."
For example, if the F.A.R. for a particular district is 4, and the lot size is 100 by 100, or 10,000 square feet, then the building is allowed a total of 40,000 square feet of floor space -- subject, of course, to regulations about setbacks, side yards and distance from the street.
When a building has not used all of its allowable floor area, the air rights can be transferred, typically to contiguous properties. Or, the unused floor area can be used by a developer to piggyback onto the existing low-rise building.
"If you want to protect your view and you are concerned about the next building acquiring air rights from an adjacent property," Ms. Pollet said, "you need to do some research in the Office of the City Register" -- or insist that your lawyer exercise due diligence in examining the records.
"You look at the tax map for contiguous properties that are potential sources of air rights," Ms. Pollet continued, typically low buildings or vacant lots. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that a building down the block or across the street may have unused development rights that could eventually cast their shadow.
That specter so haunted residents of a co-op on Riverside Drive at 86th Street that the police were called in on the day two years ago when construction started for a 10-story addition atop a five-story town house on the adjacent lot. The lot is 25 feet wide.
It was, perhaps, the most dramatic moment in a long legal struggle that, with a twist, ended only last January.
The turn-of-the-last-century town house, called the House of Free Russia, had served as a haven for Russian emigres since the 1917 Revolution. But it was left out of the Upper West Side Historic District that the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission created in 1990 -- rendering it ripe for development.
"Old buildings should not be used as footstools for the exploitation efforts of developers," said Arlene Simon, president of Landmark West, a nonprofit preservation group.
Residents of the Normandy, the 18-story co-op adjacent to the House of Free Russia, agreed -- and filed suit to prohibit construction.
"We were not only saving the views," said Elisha Birnbaum, president of the Normandy board. "Our building has two wings with a big courtyard inside and if they had built this thing, it would have been a dark courtyard. It would have blocked light and air to more than 100 apartments."
JEFFREY DIAMOND, a partner in the law firm hired by the Normandy, Marcus, Rosenberg and Diamond, said, "We found a restrictive covenant in the deed from the turn of the century, which gave us the grounds to fight the building."
The covenant, dated March 12, 1900, read, in part: "No tenement flat or apartment house shall be erected on the premises." And so, on April 24, 1997, Justice Louise Gruner Gans of State Supreme Court in Manhattan issued a preliminary injunction barring construction.
But when it came to a permanent injunction, Justice Gans changed her position, citing the fact that the Normandy -- built in 1939 -- had itself violated the covenant.
In her decision, she wrote: "The Normandy, itself 18 stories high, seeks to avoid the suffocating effect which the presence of a 13- to 15-story structure only 10 feet away from its northeastern flank is likely to create. Yet construction of the Normandy created the same effect to the detriment of 349 West 86th Street."
"Despite the obvious undesirability of the proposed building to the Normandy," the justice continued, "it is inequitable to prevent defendants from developing 349 West 86th Street simply because construction of the Normandy violated the restrictive covenant first. Plaintiff has not come into a court of equity with the clean hands necessary to entitle it to enforce the restrictive covenant."
In January, after arduous negotiations, said Mr. Birnbaum, the Normandy bought the air rights above the town house for $1.35 million.

Referendum Is Set on Where Lottery Money Goes

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, voters approved a constitutional amendment by a 5-to-1 margin to permit New Jersey to begin a lottery. The amendment specified that the money raised -- now some $700 million a year -- must go to "state institutions."
After all that time, and all that money, some lawmakers recently got upset because according to state treasurers, "state institutions" has included penal institutions. 
 As a result, a referendum will appear on the ballot Nov. 2 as question No. 3 to fine-tune the the New Jersey Constitution to stipulate that lottery proceeds cannot go to benefit or support prison inmates.
The actual fiscal impact of this referendum will be minimal. The issue came to a head while former Treasurer James DiEleuterio was in office, and he openly told lawmakers that the referendum really had no point.
Some revenues are specifically earmarked by law or by the Constitution. Gasoline tax revenue, for instance, can only go to support the debts of the Transportation Trust Fund. Unemployment insurance taxes are supposed to go into the reserves used to pay out unemployment benefits.
But generally, most state revenue goes into a general coffer and is spent for general purposes. Such is the case with lottery funds. The loosely defined dedication to "state institutions and state aid for education" is a category that comprises at least half of the $19.5 billion state budget. Lottery dollars can be spent anywhere within those broad confines.
Mr. DiEleuterio said it was a matter of bookkeeping to align lottery revenue next to prison spending. The referendum, if approved, would require a change in this bookkeeping, and would not disrupt prison or education financing.
Lawmakers including Senator John Matheussen, Republican from Gloucester, and Senator Raymond Zane, a Democrat from Gloucester, claimed the use of lottery funds for prisons had been kept a secret. They said voters in 1969 intended for the money to benefit school children and the aging, not criminals.
Mr. DiEleuterio disagreed with the secrecy charge, noting that the annual budgets have always been plainly public documents incorporated into legislation.
But the treasurer amd governor have no say on proposals to amend the state Constitution. Such questions are placed on the ballot by the Legislature, and the Senate and Assembly passed this item unanimously.
Senator Robert Littell, a Republican from Sussex, was a member of the state Assembly in 1969 when he wrote the lottery law. He said it was plain the financing would go to all kinds of institutions. "The truth of the matter is that it was very clear when we passed it," he said during Senate debate in July.
Still, the Senator backed the idea of having a referendum
"I think it is good idea to give the public a say on this," he said.
 
The Question Before the Voters
Following is the text of Public Question No. 3 and the interpretive statement that will appear on the ballot Nov. 2:
Ballot Question: Shall the amendment to Article IV, Section VII, paragraph 2 of the Constitution agreed to by the Legislature, providing that state lottery net proceeds shall not be used to pay for the confinement, housing, supervision or treatment of, or education programs for, adult criminal offenders or juveniles adjudged delinquent or for the construction, staffing, support, maintenance or operation of an adult or juvenile correctional facility or institution, be approved?
Interpretive Statement: This constitutional amendment would provide that state lottery funds would not be used in any way to support prisons or prison programs. It specifically provides that lottery funds would not be used to pay for the confinement, housing, supervision or treatment of, or education programs for, adult criminal offenders or juveniles adjudged delinquent or for the construction, staffing, support, maintenance or operation of an adult or juvenile correctional facility or institution. Lottery funds could continue to be used to support other state institutions, such as state hospitals and state veterans homes, and for state aid for education.

September Unemployment Rate Stays Below 5 Percent

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate was under 5 percent in September, for the 23d month in a row, and the number of people employed continued to climb, the state Department of Labor said last week.
The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent for August, but still above the national average of 4.2 percent for August and September. 
 "We are at virtually full employment," said Brian Burns, a spokesman for the Department of Labor.
The number of people working rose by 6,600 in September to 3.8 million, a number that has gone up in each of the last eight months. The unemployment rate was at its lowest in February, at 4.1 percent and hit 4.9 percent in June, its highest this year. KAREN DeMASTERS

When Late IsToo Late

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS baby boomers, we have had amazing fortune. A strong economy has given many of us comfortable careers and the stock market has made us more comfortable still. Many in our group are successful, wealthy and not nearly done yet.
But that sense of endless possibility is causing us to make a familiar mistake. Although we are prescient enough to prepare for our children's education and our retirement, we have the same inability as past generations to contemplate our own deaths while we're young. That means many of us are not preparing wills or doing the other things that smooth the way for our heirs. 
 "Boomers are probably the best generation as far as investing," said Stuart Kessler of Goldstein Golub Kessler, an accounting firm in Manhattan, "but in other areas of planning, like wills, they are one of the least-equipped generations."
Mr. Kessler said boomers were also falling short in other areas. They lack disability insurance, a durable power of attorney if they become incapacitated, or even a simple letter of instruction -- telling survivors where, for example, to find the key to the safe-deposit box.
I've bought disability insurance, but I lack the others -- including a will. I keep putting it off because it's not a priority. Besides, if I die without a will, won't my wife end up with everything anyway?
Not true, Mr. Kessler said. In my state, Connecticut, assets held solely in my name would be divided automatically among her and the children. Generally, states divide the assets by giving the surviving spouse a portion of the assets, often $50,000, then splitting the remainder 50-50. New York and New Jersey do it that way; in Connecticut, the spouse gets the first $100,000. When there are children of a previous marriage involved, the formula is often adjusted.
David M. English, a law professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia, said that only 14 states, mostly in the Midwest and West, give the surviving spouse 100 percent of the assets.
A 50-50 split may sound benevolent, but my wife may need all the money to keep the household running. Although the court would appoint my wife to be the children's guardian, it may name someone else, like a lawyer or a bank, to watch over their money until they are 18. These guardians charge a fee for that service, which includes making sure that money is handled appropriately.
Depending on the circumstances, Mr. Kessler said, some courts would make the surviving parent pay for school, or the hiring of a nanny while the parent worked, out of the parent's, not the child's, share. Mr. Kessler recommends a will that leaves assets to the parent and money in trust for the children, with the parent as the trustee.
Albert L. Sica, 37, of Staten Island, doesn't have a will, but is seeing a lawyer about getting one. He always put it off, but now that his children are 10 and 13, he recognizes the need to provide for them.
"I knew we needed to get a will, but it's not like we have $20 million in the bank," Mr. Sica said. "It was not in the forefront of our minds, but, God forbid, if my wife and I were to die, what about the kids?"
Mr. Kessler said that having to make decisions about the children sometimes kept people from making a will. One reason "is that they can't agree on the guardians for the children" if the parents die together.
Charles Sabatino, assistant director of the American Bar Association's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, didn't get a will until he and his wife were leaving for a trip overseas many years ago, without their two children. The night before they left, he said, they were in a lawyer's office signing documents. The biggest point of discussion was who would take care of the children. They decided on his sister-in-law.
"People often don't start thinking about estate planning until they have little kids and are about to travel," he said. "Kids are a great motivator."
The biggest motivator may be our own parents. "Boomers think they'll live forever," said Scott R. Severans of Severans & Bennett, an Indianapolis law firm specializing in the elderly. "But we will see a surge of boomers getting wills when they encounter their parents' failure to plan and the mess it creates or the relief, at a moment of crisis, that their parents have a plan."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS : for JUAN SOMAVIA;
Making Markets Work for All

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
FOR decades, the International Labor Organization has been derided as an ineffectual, anticapitalistic talking shop, when it has been noticed at all. But its new director-general, Juan Somavia, is intent on changing all that.
With 2,300 employees and a $480 million budget, the Geneva-based organization, an agency of the United Nations, has broad responsibilities, among them leading the worldwide fight against abuse of child labor, promoting job creation in poor countries and defending workers' rights to form unions. Mr. Somavia arrived in March believing that the organization need not be anti-business to achieve its objectives. 
 With his thick beard, Mr. Somavia, a 58-year-old Chilean diplomat, looks like an Amish farmer, but he talks like a pragmatic politician and social theorist. He served as Chile's representative to the United Nations and was chief organizer of the 1995 World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen before taking his new post.
Mr. Somavia took time from attending the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Los Angeles to discuss his plans. Here are excerpts from the conversation. STEVEN GREENHOUSE
 
Q. Why should Americans pay attention to the International Labor Organization?
A. The I.L.O.'s Philadelphia Declaration from 1944 stated that poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere. You can't be indifferent to what's happening in the rest of the world. The global economy is not distributing its benefits sufficiently to people -- to workers in America or to workers around the world. If I had to synthesize what the I.L.O. is trying to do, it is, "How do we make markets work for everyone?"
What does the I.L.O. do when it finds that markets are not working? We have to promote entrepreneurship. Unless you generate more work in the world, we'll continue to have a series of problems. And to insure decent work, there's no substitute for organize, organize, organize.
Q. The I.L.O. has long had a reputation as a lethargic bureaucracy. How will you reinvigorate it?
A. I want to basically do two things: focus and modernize. And I plan to concentrate on four areas. First is protecting the rights of people at work. The second is employment and job creation, access to work. That's what people in the street want.
The third focus is social protection like Social Security, pensions, safe work. A central reality of the global economy is that a majority of people don't have basic social protections of any kind. The fourth focus is dialogue. The I.L.O. is one of the only places where you have employers, workers and government engaging in dialogue, talking things out to find common solutions.
The global economy is bringing I.L.O. issues to center stage, and consequently I arrive at a moment that we have a very good mandate. But we have to be much more pointed in how we go about it.
Q. Sometimes your goals to create jobs and eliminate poverty seem to overlap with those at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. How do you avoid conflict?
A. I was very glad to see the I.M.F. and World Bank put the elimination of poverty on their agenda. Our job is to be a social pillar, to make sure they're taking care of the social dimension. Many of the things that were done to make structural adjustment work meant that an enormous number of companies went broke. Somebody has to have an eye on what happens to people.
We in the international community have to agree on the issues on which we should all be pushing in the same direction. I suggest the reduction of poverty, creating employment (it's the first step out of poverty) and having more inclusive societies.
Q. How do you respond to critics who say your organization's agenda is anti-business?
A. Our historical mandate is to look at life at work. Our mandate is to promote workers' rights, but that's not the only thing we're about. We're also about tripartism between employers, workers and government. We're about dialogue, about creating jobs and entrepreneurialism.
Q. Why is the new child labor convention so important?
A. There is a growing consciousness that we should not have child labor. Child labor is a complex issue. It's strongly linked to development and whether parents have a job or whether children can go to school.
The new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor was approved in June, and now it has to be ratified by different countries. It was the first time you had global unanimity on child labor issues.
There are a lot of tensions on child labor, and some countries have not ratified existing child labor conventions, but finally we have been able to put together complete unanimity on the worst forms of child labor that should be banned -- prostitution, pornography, hazardous mining, serving as soldiers. The most important thing is to ban all of the morally abhorrent situations that no family would like its children to live through.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Fiat Multipla and Ford Ka;
Making the Scene, Avant-Garde Europeans Hit New York's Streets

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
AZ SNIDER was making his way through the afternoon crush of pedestrians in Rockefeller Center when the sight of a green, four-wheeled, six-passenger frog stopped him cold.
"Man, that is one ugly car," Mr. Snider, of Manhattan, volunteered even before he could be asked his opinion of the Fiat Multipla parked near the "Today" show studio. Just short of dumbfounded, he seemed unable to take his eyes off the oddly shaped mini-minivan, which has sold briskly in Europe in the year since it went on sale. After sitting at the wheel, though, and poking around in the spacious cabin, Mr. Snyder assessed the car more charitably, conceding that the unusual design incorporated a number of tricks that made the Multipla practical and pleasant. He even mellowed a bit toward the styling. 
 "It's ugly," he affirmed again before disappearing into the rush hour. "But I'm not into style. Look at me -- I wear bow ties."
Mr. Snider was among many New Yorkers brought up short by the Multipla and by another tiny car, the Ford Ka, that stood out in Manhattan like snowplows in Miami. Motorists pointed in traffic and crowds gathered wherever the two cars were parked, proving that although many Manhattanites are blase about automobiles, they respond enthusiastically to daring designs and the lure of the new and different.
Consider the success of the Museum of Modern Art's recent exhibition entitled "Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century," which closed last month. The Multipla and the Ka were among the nine futuristic auto designs in the exhibit, which was organized by Christopher Mount, assistant curator of the museum's department of architecture and design, with Phil Patton as curatorial consultant.
While new to Americans, the two cars are on their way to becoming common sights on the streets of Europe. But neither is destined to be sold here in the land of the garantuan sport utility, where faint demand for small, fuel-efficient, odd-looking vehicles cannot justify the costs of meeting American crash and emissions standards. Furthermore, Fiat has not had an auto-sales network in North America since 1983.
There is another hurdle: Neither car offers an automatic transmission. That is no problem overseas, where small-car drivers disdain automatics for sapping the power and reducing the economy of tiny engines. But relatively few Americans are able or willing to shift for themselves.
Nor is efficiency high on most American car shoppers' lists of essential characteristics. Still, a number of recent designs, including two inexpensive cars that have just gone on sale in the United States, the Ford Focus and Toyota Echo, demonstrate that economy can happily co-exist with spacious cabins, distinctive styling, responsive handling and people-friendly features.
The Ka and Multipla go a couple of steps further, with designs that may be too extreme for American tastes. While successful as hands-off displays in the Modern's sculpture garden, does their function match their form when they roll onto crowded streets? Can they be appreciated for the way they drive and ride, as well as for their innovative use of space?
Fiat and Ford, which had brought extra cars to New York in conjunction with the Modern's exhibit, made them available recently for test drives. Both the Multipla and the Ka proved even more impressive in traffic than as static sculptures of sheet metal. Indeed, each car offers answers to some questions posed by internal-combustion cars in the concrete jungle of New York.
 
Multipla: Space Before Style
Beyond the Fiat Multipla's frog-eyed face -- due to the rounded front and high-beam headlamps up near the windshield, like amphibian eyes -- the car is most striking for its bolt-upright side windows. "It is a vertical car," said Paolo Vannini, vice president for corporate communications at Fiat USA.
Though the high design looks ungainly, its beauty lies within, where six tall passengers sit high and comfortably. Huge windows make the cabin exceptionally airy. The driver's view is superb, if not as high as that from the biggest sport utilities (though one cannot see even a bit of the downward-sloping hood from behind the wheel).
The name of the car, which sells in Italy for the rough equivalent of $16,000 to $20,000, denotes its multiplicity of uses -- as sedan, station wagon, van or what the Europeans call a multi-purpose vehicle, akin to an American sport utility -- as well as its four potential power sources. The car's impressive interior volume defies its overall length of 157 inches -- half a foot shorter than a Volkswagen Golf. The space trick was accomplished by topping a low basic body module (the working part of the car, which is no larger than necessary) with a high greenhouse of glass for the passengers. A low waistline separates the two pieces and forms a line atop the fenders. The side windows are as tall as the body beneath them, and because they do not curve inward, they do not intrude on passenger space.
Another benefit of this design is safety. In a crash, the lower module absorbs the impact, in theory, instead of the cabin.
Getting in or out is easy, thanks to high, wide doors and seats that are comfortably but not excessively high. There are three identical seats up front and three in the back; they are all equally roomy. They can also can be detached and removed by lifting latches -- flush with the floor and designed with Italian flair. The middle seat up front, in fact, can be replaced with a console that includes an insulated box that can be heated or chilled. A small refrigerator can slip into the spot occupied by the middle rear seat.
The cabin floor is flat, and there is a surprising amount of cargo space behind the second row of seats. There are storage compartments everywhere, including neat bins that fold out of the roof above the sun visors. Controls are clustered in the center of the dashboard, including the manual shifter, which protrudes from a pod to the driver's right and frees the floor for legs. With the speedometer in the middle, the space ahead is available for the screen of an optional navigation system. This screen can also be plugged in on the passenger side and operated by remote, giving children in the rear something to occupy their time.
The interior is flamboyantly Italian, down to the modern fabric that covers the top of the dash, to the asymetrical sun visors -- one small, one huge -- and a tiny lid on the floor that lifts to reveal the ID number.
Its odd look is only part of what makes the Fiat different. It was brought to the Modern in part because of the choices of power sources it offers: gasoline only, diesel only, a dual Bi-Power system that can be switched from gasoline to natural gas and, yet to come, a gasoline-electric hybrid.
The car I drove in New York was the Bi-Power version, but its natural gas tanks were empty at the time. On gasoline, the four-cylinder engine (1.6 liters, 16 valves, 103 horsepower on gasoline) moved briskly through midtown traffic with three occupants on board. The car's small size, solid chassis and light, precise steering made it easy to maneuver around stopped cabs and slow trucks. With independent suspensions at front and rear, the car rode smoothly over streets ravaged by pre-millennium construction. The outside mirrors, which include a separate, convex portion for a wider view, retract electrically in tight quarters.
But it is inside where the Fiat makes the biggest impression. The roomy cabin; comfortable, flexible seats; excellent outward view, and well-though-out amenities lead one quickly to the thought that this would make an ideal taxicab in New York.
Indeed, Fiat is selling a taxi version in Europe. Big-boned New Yorkers would find a Multipla cab comforting, too, but they are unlikely to get a chance to hail one.
 
Ka: Commuting Module With Flair
While the Multipla seems a dandy alternative to yellow, metered Ford Crown Victorias, the Ford Ka has more room than a crowded car on the D train, handles a lot better than the M104 bus and offers some of the fun of in-line skates in a safer, weather-resistant package. It is a commuting device with style and a smile.
The Ka, in short, is a tiny city car -- too small to rate three letters, perhaps. Its layout is conventional (it uses the front-drive platform and 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine of the Ford Fiesta sold overseas), but the design is bright. The styling is New Edge, with rounded planes broken by creases, wrapped around a passenger cabin that is higher and more spacious than the exterior would lead one to believe.
To hold down costs in Europe, where cars are generally more expensive, Ford used cheap materials; the headliner is molded foam, and a thin feltlike material masquerades as carpeting. But there are plenty of clever touches, including an oval bin that pivots to reveal slots for cassette tapes on one side or a small, hinged storage box on the other. There are depressions in the floor, front and rear, that hold coins or other small items. A postmodern analog clock punctuates the minimalist dash.
In town, 60 horsepower never felt so good. The short-throw shifter is light and precise, and the Ka is geared to zoom when the light turns green. Quick steering lets the Ka dart around backed-up buses and trucks like a minnow in a school of tuna, and tiny curbside gaps become feasible parking spots. On a drive with Kathleen Hamilton, who works in Ford's New York office, we encountered a semi-truck backed up to a loading dock, blocking nearly the entire width of West 28th Street. After pausing for a second to judge the scant remaining space, we roared ahead and squeezed through the gap with fractions of an inch to spare.
And when we encountered a backup near the Lincoln Tunnel entrance from Ninth Avenue, we discovered that a fleet of Ka's could do much to relieve gridlock. Caught in the intersection as the light turned red, I shifted to first, gunned the engine and jammed in between a bus and a truck.
It is impossible to block the box in a car as a short as a Ka.

HEADLINE: Fishing Gear Makers Are Now a Prize Catch

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY 

 BODY:
LIKE toy and hardware makers before them, small manufacturers of fishing gear are being acquired by aggressive competitors looking to build economies of scale.
The sports-fishing equipment industry has long been the province of labor-of-love specialty companies -- supplying, say, just rubber bait for catching walleye in the Great Lakes region. Although several chief executives still answer their phones with a "Howdy do!," economic reality applies even to fishing tackle. 
 "You can't survive in this business working out of your garage anymore," said William H. Wilson, chief executive of Pradco Inc., a privately held company in Fort Smith, Ark., which owns 11 popular brands of fishing lures, including Smithwick and Quik-Hit, many of them acquired in the last five years.
Steve C. Greer, chief financial officer of the United States division of the Rapala Normark Corporation of Finland, another maker of fishing lures, said "product distribution is driven by the major marts and big-box sports chains who don't want to talk to you unless you can supply a range of products in large volume." Analysts say mass-market retailers and a handful of equally demanding cataloguers sell 75 percent of fishing tackle.
Sales in the industry -- encompassing lures, rods, reels, line and other accessories -- were estimated at $1.9 billion in the United States in 1998, and close to $3 billion worldwide. "It's a lot of little stuff that makes up a very big market," said Tom B. Doyle, vice president of information and research at the National Sporting Goods Association in Mount Prospect, Ill.
Rapala, with $106.6 million in sales -- nearly half in the United States -- went public late last year on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and used part of the proceeds to buy a competitor, Storm Manufacturing Inc. of Norman, Okla., for $13.2 million in January. After 59 years as a closely held family business specializing in hand-carved balsa wood lures, Rapala has "moved into acquisition mode," Mr. Greer said, to increase market share and capture "that all important peg space at Wal-Mart."
Similarly, Pure Fishing, a privately held company in Spirit Lake, Iowa, has bought out several tackle manufacturers, including the rod maker Fenwick in 1988 and, since 1995, the reel maker Abu Garcia, the Red Wolf line of fishing accessories and Coleman Family Fishing. Pure Fishing is known for its Berkley brand of bait and fishing line that was started in 1937 by the father of the current chief executive, Tom Bedell.
Also growing by acquisition are two other industry leaders, the Zebco Corporation of Tulsa, Okla., and Johnson Worldwide Associates of Sturtevant, Wis., which produces other outdoor equipment as well and is majority-owned by Samuel Johnson, the chairman of S. C. Johnson & Son, the household products company, and his family. Mid-level players like the Mason Tackle Company of Otisville, Mich., and the Castaway Rod Company of Conroe, Tex., have been buying competitors, too. Typical is Mason's recent purchase of the Hildebrant Corporation, a Logansport, Ind., company that is more than 100 years old.
It is better to buy existing brands than to create new ones, because "customers in this market tend to be extremely loyal to the old names," said Jeff Pontius, president of Zebco, a division of the Brunswick Corporation in Lake Forest, Ill.
"There's been so much consolidation, it's hard to keep track who belongs to who anymore," said Deborah Johnson, managing editor of Fishing Tackle Retailer, a trade magazine published in Montgomery, Ala.
Membership in the industry's trade organization, the American Sportsfishing Association based in Alexandria, Va., has declined to 450 members from 600 members in 1995. "But the number of products out there has remained pretty much the same," indicating that the decline results almost entirely from acquisitions, said Mike Hayden, president and chief executive of the association.
But consolidation is only one step in modernizing the tackle industry. Fishing is a seasonal sport, and the required gear varies by region and fish species.
"It's a very complex category to manage once you enter the broader market," said Mr. Bedell of Pure Fishing, which invested $4.5 million three years ago in a computerized inventory system and warehouse. "Before we were just like most everybody else in this business, writing out all the orders by hand."
PURE FISHING and others are also pouring money into research and development -- building huge aquariums, for example, to test how fish respond to new products.
By increasing product lines and updating technology, tackle companies are not only in a better position to serve the likes of Wal-Mart. The efforts also help them enter the almost untapped export market.
"Our read is that the U.S. market is essentially flat, and we need to look elsewhere to increase profits," particularly in recreational fishing hot spots in Asia, Australia and South America, said Mr. Pontius of Zebco, which has expanded its international operations 33 percent in the last five years.
Similarly, Pure Fishing has set up divisions in 11 countries since 1995.
Mr. Wilson, at Pradco, said the fishing tackle industry is "kind of behind" some others in globalization and consolidation. "It's probably because we spend so much time fishing," he said.

HEADLINE: An Oil Outsider Revives a Cartel

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
THE price of crude oil has doubled since early last year. Higher prices for gasoline, heating oil and other products are hitting every consumer's pocketbook.
Is OPEC flexing its muscles again? Not exactly. There's a new oil cartel in town, and after a shaky start two years ago, its members have achieved -- for now, at least -- the unity necessary to hold to their production quotas. And that means higher prices. 
 In a sense, this cartel is simply the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plus two -- Mexico and Norway. But the world's oil-producing and exporting nations are wielding power this time around mainly because of a shove not from the Middle East but rather from Mexico -- and especially from its persistent energy minister, Luis K. Tellez, a novice in the world of oil.
When Mr. Tellez began his mission, he was worried about the devastating impact that falling oil prices were having on the economy in Mexico, which in 1997 relied on oil for 38 percent of its revenues. But his leadership has been felt the world over. "Without Tellez, this coalition would not have been possible," said Dr. Gary Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a consulting firm based in Manhattan.
The coalition has shown such cohesion that some analysts predict that crude oil could rise to an extraordinary level -- $30 a barrel -- by the end of the year, a price not seen since January 1991, during the Persian Gulf war. Already, the price of crude oil has more than doubled, to $23.45 a barrel from $11 early this year.
Not that the coalition is home free. Prices hit $24 a barrel last month, but slipped back when traders thought they saw hints of cracks in the cartel's solidarity. After all, if one country breaks ranks, the cartel's tenuous grip on the world market could crumble.
For the moment, though, there seems little easing in the cartel's united front or in rising oil prices.
For one thing, the bullish global economy strengthens the group's grip. World oil inventories have been declining, but in the past year demand has been rising sharply. Most Western economies are in high gear, and as Asian economies have recovered from their turmoil last year, their need for oil has grown, too. World demand, now about 76 million barrels a day, could outrun supply by about three million barrels a day as early as this quarter, said Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear Stearns.
"If the oil exporters stay with their cuts, inventories of oil will run down hard and push the price up to close to $30," Mr. Leuffer said, echoing a view shared by many oil experts. "Everyone is on the edge of their seat about when the discipline will break or when the first increase will be made in the production quotas."
EVERYTHING was different in the early months of 1998, when the coalition was forged. With oil prices at $15 to $16 a barrel, oil producers were hurting. Mexico was in particularly dire straits, forced to make a series of painful cuts in government spending that hit its people where it hurt most: in health, education and other basic services.
Mr. Tellez, an economist who had no previous experience in the oil industry, decided to try to steer the world's oil-producing nations in a new direction. When he became energy minister in 1997, the soft-spoken Mr. Tellez knew neither his colleagues nor much about the arcane world of oil politics.
But he jumped headlong into the oil patch, and within a year he was able to persuade a few key oil ministers and officials from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to form a new coalition of oil-producing nations.
"It certainly demonstrates a new configuration," said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting group based in Cambridge, Mass. "Mexico's role has become central, whereas before it was more peripheral."
Unknown in the industry just two years ago, Mr. Tellez has become a force. "Tellez is now a significant player in the world of oil," Mr. Yergin said. How long he remains one depends upon Mexico itself, for he made no promises about Mexico's participation in the group beyond the end of next year.
In some ways, Mr. Tellez seems an unlikely world-shaker. A short, slight 41-year-old with receding dark hair, he was trained as an economist specializing in international finance, and his experience in government had been largely with a contentious project that gave tenant farmers title to the land they farmed.
In a recent interview in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan, where he spoke at a meeting of oil industry experts, Mr. Tellez reminisced about his plunge into the murky waters of oil diplomacy.
After getting his doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986, Mr. Tellez, who runs and plays tennis to remain trim, taught economics at his alma mater in Mexico for a time.
In 1987, he joined the Finance Ministry, and two years later helped to put together a plan, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, that reduced Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, he moved to the Agriculture Ministry, and in 1994 was made chief of staff to President Ernesto Zedillo, whom he had known since his early days as an economist.
Then it was on to the Energy Ministry, where the last months of 1997 were particularly bleak, he recalled, with oil prices falling to $17 a barrel in December.
At one point, "we sold a shipment of oil for $7 a barrel," he said. "Such a price has not been seen since the Great Depression." As revenues plunged, Mexico had to cut its budget twice.
Oil producers seemed unable to change the disastrous policies that led to the price spiral. But Mr. Tellez managed to break through this wall of paralysis, mainly with what he called "gentlemen's agreements" among Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico.
In February 1998, he began his effort to break the logjam by consulting with President Zedillo, who gave him his full support. He then contacted Erwin Arrieta, oil minister of Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC. Mr. Arrieta agreed on the need for action, and the two men met in Miami, discussing, among other things, the possibility of Mexico forging a coalition with Norway, another major non-OPEC producer.
It was an unusual initiative, one that could be politically touchy back in Mexico, which as a big oil exporter -- particularly to the United States -- had long kept its distance from OPEC. Any sign of change would raise concerns that Mexico was giving up its carefully guarded independence.
Still, with the support of Mr. Arrieta, and using various oil experts as intermediaries, he tried to find out whether Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, would be willing to talk to him. Word came back that he would.
The Saudis, who as the world's largest exporters play a leading role in OPEC, had helped set off the latest crisis in oil prices by pushing through a higher production ceiling for OPEC late in 1997. Mr. Naimi's support would thus be crucial in any attempt to halt the slide.
WHEN Mr. Tellez called him at his office in Riyadh in February 1998, he found that they had similar concerns. Their countries' budgets were being torn to shreds by falling oil revenue, and no one seemed to be taking any action to limit production.
"It was simple," Mr. Tellez said. "It was important to do something."
Mr. Naimi invited him and Mr. Arrieta for secret talks -- the first time a Mexican oil minister had been granted such a meeting.
On the way, Mr. Tellez made a stop in Norway, also a big oil exporter, to see what position that country would take. The Norwegian energy minister, Anne Enger Lahnstein, and other Norwegian officials listened to him, he said, but did not commit themselves. Only later did Norway, which also had a tradition of not cooperating with OPEC, go along with production cuts.
With only one assistant in tow, Mr. Tellez flew to Riyadh, where he and Mr. Arrieta, who arrived with a full staff on a private jet, sat down with Mr. Naimi in a luxurious official guest house in March 1998.
With oil prices still languishing around $14 a barrel, the three wasted little time, taking only one day to agree to cut the coalition's production by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels a day.
Mr. Naimi had the formidable, and delicate, task of getting other major OPEC producers to agree. Through an intense day of telephone calls, he lined up the often fractious group to support a cut of 1.6 million barrels a day.
Because their talks had been secret -- and because Mexico had never before cooperated with OPEC at such a level -- the announcement of the deal on March 22 came as a surprise to experts and analysts.
Despite skepticism that the new group would be able to stick together, oil prices began to recover quickly, from $14.65 a barrel in March to $17 a month later.
The recovery, though, was short-lived. With most Asian economies going into a severe downturn and demand falling from big oil importers like Japan and South Korea, the glut of oil started to build again.
Especially remarkable in the story of this ad hoc group has been its members' willingness to abide by the cuts through thick and thin -- even when prices kept falling last year because of the decline of the Asian economies. Skeptics were even more stunned when the group agreed on an additional series of production cuts this year -- totaling about 5.3 million barrels a day -- after its initial cuts last year.
According to Mr. Yergin, the author of "The Prize," a history of the oil industry (Simon & Schuster, 1991), it was the "specter of $5-a-barrel oil" -- a price so low that it would devastate the economies of many oil-exporting nations -- that inspired the group's cohesion.
"The source of the discipline is dire necessity and trauma that these countries went through because of the collapse in prices," he added.
And Dr. Ross, of PIRA, said: "What these countries found is that they have a common interest. The low oil prices were extremely painful to them since it cut their revenue."
Another reason, he said, has been the willingness of political leaders of the three nations that lead the coalition -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico -- to back up their top oil officials.
"Everyone thought OPEC was declining and losing members," he added, particularly after 1997, when the organization seemed to lack the will to break the disastrous pattern of pumping more oil, even as prices were plunging.
BUT now, again, a single coalition accounts for more than half of world oil production, a share that OPEC itself had not held since the 1970's. And this cartel could be around for a while. Many longtime observers of OPEC and the oil industry say that the new coalition will remain potent and that it could well be a stabilizing influence on world oil prices over the long term.
One vital component of this stability is Mr. Tellez's effort: by bringing Mexico and Norway together with OPEC, he has eliminated a big reason that past productions cuts have often been ineffective.
In the old days, Mexico and Norway often acted as a thorn in the side of OPEC. When the cartel tried to cut production, they pumped all the oil they could. Sure enough, OPEC members would follow suit to protect their markets, and OPEC's resolve to keep prices stable would crumble.
This coalition also has a different look. Even after two years, the group remains informal. While OPEC has a large staff and an elaborate headquarters in Vienna, the new group has no name or offices. It subsists largely on the growing trust among the sharply different personalities of the coalition's energy officials.
They communicate mainly by telephone, E-mail and periodic meetings.
"We're getting to know each other," Mr. Tellez said. "Building up trust is very important." And he saw no reason to change this informal approach.
Trust will be vital if the cartel is to last. Mr. Tellez said that current prices were not too high and that he saw no reason for the group to increase production. He said that there were no plans to discuss such a step at a meeting to be held on Nov. 17 in Riyadh with Saudi and Venezuelan officials.
Oil traders clearly thought differently. When word of the meeting leaked out, crude oil, which had been trading in the $24 range, slid to $22.
Mr. Leuffer said the market's reaction might have strengthened the group's resolve not to raise production, since it proved what could happen if it showed the least sign that it might do so.
The United States, of course, looks on from a different angle, because it imports 56 percent of its oil, making its economy vulnerable if prices soar. For now, though, higher energy prices have not had a large-enough effect to fuel inflation, said Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which puts together the Consumer Price Index.
Average prices for regular gasoline have risen from 95 cents a gallon last winter to about $1.29, and heating oil this winter will cost about $1.04 a gallon, up from 80 cents last winter.
"Nothing bad has happened yet, but it is something you have to keep your eye on," said William Dudley, the chief United States economist for Goldman, Sachs, adding that the core inflation rate was running at 2 percent so far the year.
Still, if the price of crude oil keeps rising, the impact on the American economy will be substantial, Mr. Jackman said, because oil is used in so many consumer products.
The full impact is yet to be felt in Mexico, either. Higher crude oil prices have helped the Government begin to recover from a huge drop in revenues in 1998, when spending cuts caused widespread hardship. Mexico's oil revenues totaled $9.7 billion in 1997, plunged to $6.4 billion in 1998 and are estimated to recover to $8.5 billion this year. But Mr. Tellez -- who can claim a great deal of credit for that recovery -- is not being hailed as a hero. That is because the money is going mainly to shore up the battered peso, not to restore services.
NONE of this has been easy for Mr. Tellez, who for most of his career was rarely in the limelight. When oil prices were still falling in 1998, even after Mexico and others had made cuts, he bore the brunt of increasing criticism in the press and among some oil experts in Mexico that his initiative had only added to the misery. Mexico had cut its production but now, with plunging prices, it was getting even less revenue, the argument went.
Mr. Tellez recalled that at one point even his mentor, President Zedillo, had second thoughts.
"Every time you get together with your friends the price goes down," he recalled the President telling him once in jest. "So be careful."

Graphs: "Gaining More Control"
A new oil coalition, including the members of OPEC as well as outsiders like Mexico and Norway, is producing more than half the world's oil. That is about the same share as OPEC produced at its former heights. The graph shows OPEC,s share of world oil production since 1975. *Includes Norway. (Source: PIRA Energy Group)(pg. 1)
 
"On Crude Oil's Coattails"
As the price of crude oil has increased, gasoline prices have followed and heating oil has started to creep higher as winter approaches. The graphs show crude oil price (West Texas intermediate), gasoline retail price (Regular gas, national average), and heating oil retail price (Residential, national average) since 1990.

Chart: "HOW MEXICO'S PLIGHT FORGED OPEC PLUS TWO "
Luis K. Tellez, left, Mexico's oil minister, took action in early 1998 to bolster world oil prices -- with the support of Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's president. These factors led Mr. Tellez to approach OPEC members, as well as Norway, another outsider, to build a new coalition:
*OPEC, on its own, was unable to maintain production discipline.
*A resulting oil surplus caused oil prices to fall drastically.
*Without buoyant oil revenues, Mexico made cuts in Government spending.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
In an Inflation Measure, A Way to Pan for Gold

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week.
E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHAT makes gold soar will eventually make stocks swoon.
That simple truth explains much about the recent downward path of the stock market. The gold market came to life well in advance of the Dow's most recent correction, which started in late August. 
 The price of gold is up 20 percent since it began its rise on July 20, despite weakness last week. Moreover, gold mutual funds gained an average of 19.2 percent during the third quarter, according to Lipper Inc., the research firm, after a 2 percent increase in the second quarter, the first time in four years that gold funds have produced back-to-back quarterly gains.
Many investors may not make the connection between the rise of gold and the selloff in stocks because they see gold's rally as artificial. That is not entirely unreasonable, because the sharpest part of the rally was seemingly prompted by an external event that did not have much to do with gold's economic fundamentals -- the announcement on Sept. 26 by European central banks that they would limit their sales of bullion. The rally has been propelled further by another nonfundamental factor: Short covering from traders who had been aggressively shorting gold .
Still, after studying gold forecasting models tracked by The Hulbert Financial Digest, I have concluded that the fundamental cause for gold's rally was not the central banks' announcement, but increasing inflationary pressures, against which gold is a traditional hedge. In fact, one of the most successful models bases its buy and sell signals on inflationary trends, and it had turned bullish on gold in mid-September, well before the steepest part of the rise.
This forecasting model was devised by the Institute for Econometric Research of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a newsletter publisher. The model is simple, based not on the absolute inflation level but on whether or not inflation is accelerating. Specifically, it compares the Consumer Price Index's most recent 12-month percentage change with the corresponding reading three months earlier. If the most recent reading is higher, then the model is bullish, and investing in gold funds and shares is recommended.
For example, the Labor Department announced in mid-September that the Consumer Price Index was at 167.1, or 2.3 percent higher than it was a year earlier. In June, three months before that announcement, the index was at 166.2, or 2.1 percent higher than in June 1998. The model thus indicated that inflation was accelerating, and it issued a buy signal for gold. (That trend was supported by the consumer price report last Tuesday, which showed inflation over the previous 12 months at 2.6 percent; in July, that figure was 2.0 percent.)
BECAUSE conditions were already ripe for a bullish move in gold, I believe that if the central banks hadn't provided the straw that broke the gold market's bearish back, sending gold prices up 14 percent in a week, something else would have. Those who analyzed the inflation data might well have seen what was coming -- 11 days ahead of the central banks' move.
Though the institute's record is not perfect, it is impressive. Over the last 15 years, by my calculations, an investor who switched a portfolio in and out of the gold market on the model's signals would have gained 2.6 percent, annualized. That doesn't seem striking until it is compared with the 0.2 percent loss, annualized, that he would have suffered by buying and holding bullion.
Picking specific gold-mining stocks is trickier. Many companies sell their gold production in the futures market. The hedging protects against declines in gold's price. But it means that they won't be benefiting immediately from higher gold prices. That is why one of the favorite mining companies among gold newsletters is Franco-Nevada Mining of Toronto, whose policy is to not hedge its production.
Among newsletters I track, the most-recommended no-load gold fund is American Century Global Gold. The stocks it holds are geographically diversified, use different hedging strategies and represent both high- and low-cost producers.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
Helping the Little Guy Fight the Big Guy

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
FOR two decades, Michael Sheldrake was the coffee king of Second Street here. With virtually no competition within 20 miles, his Polly's Gourmet Coffee dominated the market in the affluent Belmont Shores section of the city.
But Mr. Sheldrake's idyll, like those of many other small-business owners, was disrupted by the coming of the "category killer" chains. In his case, he found himself up against arguably the most formidable mass retailer of this decade, Starbucks. Polly's sales fell 10 to 15 percent when a Starbucks store appeared a few blocks away in Long Beach in 1994. And in 1998, another Starbucks opened just 78 yards from Polly's. 
 "We were getting despondent," Mr. Sheldrake said. "We were just trying to hang on. We had a chain problem and didn't know what to do."
Perhaps no phenomenon has more profoundly transformed American Main Streets in the 1990's than the "chain problem." From tony Annapolis, Md., to the Melrose district of Hollywood to bohemian Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass., retail streetscapes have been steadily homogenized as heavily marketed national chains have outgunned and displaced locally owned rivals, whose resources and organization generally pale in comparison with the likes of Starbucks.
But the way Polly's responded to the chain problem demonstrates that resistance is not futile. In a turn of events that suggests some hope for small-scale retailers, Polly's fought back, and has managed to grow and thrive even with two Starbucks in its neighborhood. Sales rose 40 percent in 1998 and are on a pace for a 30 percent rise this year.
With help from a retail consultant, Bob Phibbs, who specializes in helping independent businesses cope with chain-store competitors, Polly's decided to take aim at Starbucks in two ways: beating the chain at its own game by operating even more efficiently, and exploiting the inherent vulnerability of many chains: "The problem with a chain is that it's like a mall: it's all mechanical, and there's no relationship with the customers," said Mr. Phibbs, 41, whose other clients have included independent hotels and pet stores. "I think people are getting sick of the megastores. People are disaffected."
In the case of Polly's, Mr. Phibbs advised the company to stress the fact that the store roasts its own coffee on site, which is impractical for a sprawling chain like Starbucks, and to emphasize the wider variety of coffees Polly's offers. Starbucks, considered trendy by many of its customers, was derided in Polly's local advertising as a mere purveyor of "ordinary" coffee.
But Polly's resurgence was built on more than positioning. Mr. Phibbs urged the store's management to adopt the chains' best organizational and management ideas, like putting an end to a plethora of special arrangements between employees and longtime customers for free or cut-rate services and tightening cash management procedures. Employees attended mandatory classes to improve their sales skills.
"The advantages of the chains are their procedures and administration," Mr. Phibbs said. "If an independent doesn't learn how to be just as efficient, they're going to be dead, fast."
Many retail experts say the chains' organizational advantages and economies of scale will eventually overwhelm most independent businesses, even if a few, like Polly's, swim against the tide for a time. Yves Sistron, a principal at Global Retail Partners, a venture capital company based in Los Angeles that invests in aspiring chains, observed that mass retailers are continually invading once secure small-business preserves, even in areas like cosmetics, educational toys, watches, fruit juices and Chinese food.
To Mr. Sistron, who has invested in successful chains like Jamba Juice and P. F. Chang's China Bistros, it is only a matter of time before well-financed and managed chains gobble up just about everything on Main Street. "Who gets beat up?" he said. "The smaller independent stores, the mom-and-pops. I'm not saying it's not dreary. But it's true." In the future, he said, if shoppers want to find anything like a traditional Main Street, "it's going to be Main Street, Disneyland."
Certainly, the continuing success of Starbucks lends credence to Mr. Sistron's view. The company's sales at stores open at least a year were 8 percent higher in September than they were in September 1998, and it has bought out one smaller competitor after another; it now has 2,500 stores, up from just 11 a decade ago. Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, has spoken of growing to 20,000 outlets, rivaling McDonald's 25,000 stores for sheer ubiquity.
 YET it is Starbucks's concentration on growth, Mr. Phibbs said, that gives companies like Polly's their opportunity. The bigger Starbucks gets, he said, and the further afield it goes, the more trouble it will have maintaining consistent high quality in its products and in customer service.
The chain's expansion into other kinds of drinks, including sweetened iced coffees, and Mr. Schultz's Internet ambitions to turn the Starbucks Web site into a dominant "premier life style portal" have not yet excited much enthusiasm on Wall Street, where analysts are concerned about a perceived lack of focus. Translated into Main Street terms, Mr. Phibbs said, Starbucks risks squandering its cachet as an upscale coffee house. "Starbucks is not a coffee business any more," Mr. Phibbs said. "It's a drinks business -- a McDonald's of the 1990's."
Starbucks doesn't see itself as Goliath to the independents' David. It says it doesn't look at competition on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. "We couldn't be happier that this guy is doing great business," Arthur Rubinfeld, Starbucks' senior vice president for store development, said of Mr. Sheldrake and Polly's, because it enlarges the market for everyone: "More people are on the street looking for a coffee experience, and the higher end coffee ends up doing better." But he took issue with the claim that in-store roasting give Polly's a quality advantage over Starbucks. "It's not relevant in this day and age. We source and roast the best quality beans," he said.
Still, for entrepreneurs like Mr. Sheldrake, any weakness that might appear in the strategic focus of a powerful chain represents a chance to survive and thrive. But given the chains' marketing muscle, Mr. Sheldrake said, he knows that independents like Polly's can never afford to backslide or become lazy.
"A small business can stand up to a chain," Mr. Sheldrake said. "But you can only do it if you have procedures as good as theirs -- and better coffee, too."

The QuietHelp Of Family Members

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
LINDA K. WILLIAMS ticked off her expenses: rent for the small, neatly furnished apartment that she shares with her teen-age son, electricity, phone, groceries, medicine, life insurance, occasional evenings out, new clothing, the bus commute to work, the boy's allowance and lunch money. The expenses total nearly $19,000, but her take-home pay as a secretary is only $15,700. How does she make ends meet? Gradually, Ms. Williams explained how her sisters help, and also a boyfriend.
The boyfriend -- Ms. Williams is 43 and divorced -- shops with her occasionally for food and clothes and bought her the delicate gold chain that she wore during a recent interview at her apartment here. But the four sisters are Ms. Williams's real safety net. Each earns more than she does, and they often appear at her home with food or detergent or some other household item they have bought for her while shopping for themselves. 
 "If I let my finances get to me, I would be way down there, and I am way up here," Ms. Williams said. "If I lose my job, my backup plan is my sisters. They are going to help me, I know that."
So will government, of course, through unemployment insurance, Medicaid, food stamps and other support payments. But help from family and friends, particularly boyfriends in the case of single mothers, is turning out to be a huge part of the social safety net in an era when new jobs are constantly being created, most of them at $10 an hour or less. Millions of Americans like Ms. Williams find themselves struggling to make ends meet on family incomes below $20,000 a year. Roughly 20 percent of the nation's 104 million families fall into this category.
FAMILY help, in cash or in kind, is hardly new. It is routine practice in immigrant communities, and it became a means of survival during the Great Depression, when in-laws, elderly parents and close friends often shared an apartment or home, contributing what income they had to the household's upkeep. Until Social Security benefits began to increase annually just a generation ago, it was common for grown children to support their parents financially through old age. And among the wealthy, parents still often provide the down payment for a married son or daughter's first home in an upscale neighborhood.
But as the nation grew wealthier after World War II and the self-supporting nuclear family became the ideal, and often the norm, help from family declined somewhat, even among blue-collar workers and others at the lower end of the income scale -- only to rebound over the past decade. Sociologists have detected the widespread practice in recent research, and it was evident in interviews with low-wage workers in Middle American cities like Indianapolis, where incomes and living costs closely match the national average.
"We think of resources being shared within a nuclear family or a household," said Kathryn Edin, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist. "Our official statistics encourage that view. But resources are shared more broadly in a social network, which helps to explain why poor people are not flocking to homeless shelters or to charity in greater numbers.
"You might have a situation where your grandmother gives you money, and you might not pay her back in cash," she continued. "But you are expected to help her when she is sick, clean her house or shop for her. Reciprocity is important."
THE contributions of boyfriends or biological fathers, often not living in the household, are also undercounted, Ms. Edin has found. Her research, which has involved dozens of poor families in several cities over the last six years, found that such men often provide important if intermittent help in forms like cash gifts to a single mother, clothing for the children, or name-brand sneakers for a son. "If you add up the formal and informal, you find that twice as many families are receiving support as official statistics suggest," Ms. Edin said.
Parents and grandparents play big roles in the support network for many low-income households, partly because much of their working lives came before wage stagnation crippled the incomes of low-skill workers and before the minimum wage lost so much ground to inflation. Julie Pinner, 35, a receptionist and clerk, is plagued by break-ins and burglaries at the home she rents. She will soon move with her two children to a home in a better neighborhood that her father owns and that she will rent from him -- an improvement in circumstances that she says she could not have managed on her income of $15,500 a year without his help.
Her father worked for 34 years on a Chevrolet assembly line and has a union pension. "He picks me up in the morning and drives me to work," Ms. Pinner said. "If we don't have anything to eat, he'll help. Maybe once a month he pays for the shopping, and my aunt gives me a few dollars."
THE Clinton Administration views family support as a valuable supplement to government benefits like the earned income tax credit, rent subsidies, training and Medicaid. The Republicans emphasize community support for the poor, charity being one element and family help another. Missing from the policy mix of either party is strong endorsement of higher wages. That would be achieved in part through a greater increase in the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour than either Al Gore or Bill Bradley, the two contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination, have proposed so far.
Neither proposal would exert the sort of upward pressure on the wages of the poorest workers that the minimum exerted in its heyday back in the 1960's. And a higher wage, after all, is the solution favored by the working poor themselves.

The Slumber Is Over As La-Z-Boy Expands

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
FOR years, La-Z-Boy Inc. had a somewhat sleepy image: a midsized Midwestern company that was modestly well run and known for its signature product -- a comfortable reclining chair. But a string of acquisitions -- three announced this year -- have some investors thinking there may be a lot of spring in this 72-year-old business, which is based in Monroe, Mich.
On Sept. 28, La-Z-Boy announced its biggest deal: a plan to acquire Ladd Furniture, based in Greensboro, N.C., for $267.2 million, including debt of $101.5 million; the deal is expected to be completed early next year. In March, La-Z-Boy announced that it would buy Bauhaus USA, a furniture maker in Saltillo, Miss., for about $60 million; that purchase closed in June. And in April it announced that it would acquire Alexvale Furniture of Taylorsville, N.C., for undisclosed terms. That deal is expected to close this year. 
 After all the acquisitions are completed, La-Z-Boy will be the largest publicly traded home furniture company, with sales of more than $2 billion, just ahead of Furniture Brands International. La-Z-Boy hit the $1 billion sales mark only two and a half years ago.
The deals will broaden La-Z-Boy's product mix. Ladd has done well in two markets where La-Z-Boy has had no presence: children's furniture and furniture sold to hotels and other institutions. The Bauhaus line of upscale contemporary furniture gives La-Z-Boy a path into chains owned by Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores, two big retailers with which La-Z-Boy has had few dealings.
"La-Z-Boy has been very successful at making acquisitions and going after niche markets, and they've been able to do that without missing a beat in earnings growth," said Elliott L. Schlang, managing director of the LJR Great Lakes Review, a research firm in Cleveland.
But the company has not neglected its core business. In April, La-Z-Boy introduced the Oasis, a recliner that sells for about $999 and features in one armrest a cooler that can store a six-pack; its sales are going well, according to Gene M. Hardy, La-Z-Boy's secretary and treasurer.
La-Z-Boy shares closed at $17.9375 on Friday, down 27 percent from a 52-week high of $24.5625 on July 1 and just 11.7 times analysts' estimates for fiscal 2000 earnings. Mr. Schlang has a 52-week target of $33 on the stock.
Analysts attribute the lackluster stock price to concerns that higher interest rates will slow new-home sales, thus dampening furniture sales. Rivals have suffered too. Furniture Brands, which closed at $17.75 on Friday, is down 34.9 percent this year.
Analysts expect La-Z-Boy to post profits of 41 cents a share when it reports fiscal second-quarter results on Nov. 3. That would be up 17 percent from the quarter last year.
For its first quarter, ended July 24, La-Z-Boy posted profit of 25 cents a share, nearly double the figure a year earlier and ahead of analysts' expectations of 21 cents a share.
Shelly Hale, an analyst at Bank of America Securities, recommends La-Z-Boy stock and has a 52-week target of $29. One worry is whether La-Z-Boy has the expertise to manage the various brands. "I have some concern that they are a bit disparate," she said.
Lance James, a longtime La-Z-Boy investor who runs the Babson Enterprise II fund, sees the stock's low price-to-earnings ratio as a buying opportunity. After the Ladd announcement, he raised his La-Z-Boy stake to 3 percent of the fund's assets. And La-Z-Boy itself has been buying back shares. "Whether you're a long-term investor or a value investor," Mr. James said, "this is everything you're looking for."

A Retiree's Work: How to Break the Nest Egg

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
MANY Americans have taken to heart the advice to save for retirement, socking away some $2.61 trillion in defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s, according to the Spectrem Group, a business research and consulting company in San Francisco.
Now, as the first members of the generation responsible for their own retirement savings begin to leave work, comes the second part of the equation: withdrawing money from these plans. 
 Don't assume that this is the easy part. To avoid running out of money, retirees need to consider every aspect of their finances and life styles. "The issues in retirement planning are very complicated," said Avery E. Neumark, who is in charge of retirement planning for Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company, a New York accounting firm. Because few retirees can handle all the complications on their own, he recommends that they seek professional advice.
Joseph P. Healy, manager of retirement and advisory services for T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore mutual fund and investment advisory company, says that in addition to considering market volatility, interest rate shifts, inflation and tax laws, retirees must think about individual variables like their risk tolerance, life expectancies, living standards and whether they wish to leave money to children or anyone else.
Many people -- even some financial professionals -- look only at average rates of return. Say Mary Smith calculates that she will need $25,000 a year to supplement a pension and Social Security. She concludes that if she has $250,000 in her 401(k) plan, and it earns 10 percent, she will be fine.
Whoa. Her calculations have failed to account for possible wide swings in annual returns and for inflation. T. Rowe Price, having studied the performance of a wide range of portfolios from 1968 to 1998, concluded that a vicious bear market early in the period, like the one of 1973-74, could cause the rapid depletion of such a portfolio. That depletion would be further accelerated by the need to withdraw an average of 3 percent more each year to keep up with inflation.
The rich have long relied on investment advisers and fee-based financial planners to manage portfolios and devise withdrawal strategies. Nowadays, the middle class could also use professional help.
Some of Mr. Neumark's clients also receive retirement guidance from brokerage firms, among them Merrill Lynch.
T. Rowe Price aims at the middle class with a new service, costing $500, to analyze the options for people within two years of retirement, or who have retired recently.
Clients fill out detailed questionnaires, and the firm uses computers to consider hundreds of possible retirement income and withdrawal strategies, as well as possible market performance variations. From the results, it recommends three possible courses, tailored to individual goals and preferences. The cost includes an annual review for those who invest with Price.

'Threatening' Calls to Critic of Bars Lead to an Arrest for Harassment

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
Marcia Lemmon, a Community Board 3 member known for her opposition to bars in the neighborhood, said she thought at first it was a wrong number. Her phone would ring, and there would be an eerie silence when she picked up. But after a couple of times, she said, the calls became more than an annoyance.
"They started to get threatening," said Ms. Lemmon, a freelance corporate consultant who moved to the Lower East Side nine years ago. "The person would say, 'Lemmon, we are going to get you.' " 
 On Aug. 16, the police arrested Steven Gluck, charging him with harassment in the second degree, a misdemeanor, said Detective Walter Burns, a police spokesman. Mr. Gluck is to be arraigned tomorrow at Manhattan Criminal Court, according to the District Attorney's office.
Mr. Gluck's lawyer, Leonard Easter, said his client is a sales associate with Misrahi Realty on Rivington Street. Sion Misrahi, who owns the real estate company, did not return calls seeking comment.
In an interview last week, Mr. Gluck said it was all a "misunderstanding."
"I never made any threatening calls to her," he said. "I live a clean life." He would not discuss the charges.
Ms. Lemmon said that in June she started receiving hang-ups and then harassing calls from a 917 number she did not recognize. She had it traced, she said, and alerted the police.
Why might those calls have been made? "Because I have spoken out on what has happened to the neighborhood," Ms. Lemmon said. "I have spoken out on how the economy has become a monolithic nighttime-based economy of bars and clubs."
Gary Auslander, the owner of a lounge and restaurant called Baby Jupiter who has clashed with Ms. Lemmon, said, "She has an obsession against bars and restaurants."
Adam Silvera, a Democratic district leader on the Lower East Side, said Ms. Lemmon has drawn condemnation from some people in the neighborhood because she is "very powerful, very organized and efficient, and has a successful track record in fighting problem bars with the State Liquor Authority."

The High Road at a High Cost

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
AS Internet users stampeded to visit the Encyclopaedia Britannica's sleek new Web site last week, the venerable intellectual icon was nearly road kill on the information highway.
Britannica.com is busily adding computers to handle the more than 10 million people who tried to peruse its site. But the company also faces a much bigger question: Will its vaunted reputation for rigor be compromised by its decision to give free access to its vast stores of knowledge? 
 In the first half of this decade, annual sales of the familiarly bound volumes plummeted by roughly 80 percent as Britannica miscalculated, refusing to produce a cheap, computer-based version of the storied publication that most adults in America used in school and from which many cribbed at least one science report.
While Britannica was charging up to $2,000 for a 32-volume edition of books, Microsoft was often giving away CD-Rom versions of its Encarta encyclopedia to buyers of new computers. When Britannica produced a CD-Rom, it was $1,000 initially versus $50 retail for Encarta. And when Britannica first joined the World Wide Web, it did so with a subscription-only site, charging a fee for access in a medium where nearly all information sites are free.
Now, Britannica.com has joined the Internet mainstream with a free site that is supported by the sale of advertising and by links to an array of products for sale. But whether the new economics of the Internet age will allow the Encyclopaedia Britannica to support itself as a living document, constantly updated and renewed, is unclear.
"They certainly face an uphill battle," said Thomas S. Wurster, a vice president at the Boston Consulting Group and co-author, with Philip Evans, of "Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy" (Harvard Business School Press), which is expected to be published next year.
"Britannica was always thought of as a trusted adviser, known for its rigorous quality," Mr. Wurster said. "But on the Internet, others, like Yahoo, have a better identity with core users. Because Britannica will no longer be getting any revenues from their content, their success will very much depend on whether they can attract eyeballs to the site," and therefore be able to charge advertisers higher rates.
THE fact that the main competitors for Britannica.com are not other encyclopedias but on-line services like Yahoo and America Online is not lost on Britannica. By offering free content, it removes any advantage gained by serviceable but generally lesser products like Encarta, based on the old Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedia. And Britannica.com includes not only its entire encyclopedia but also articles from magazines like The Economist, Esquire and Sports Illustrated, news links, stock quotes, an Internet search service, links to Barnes & Noble's on-line bookstore and other commercial sites.
"Our intention is to be the premier knowledge destination site," said Kent Devereaux, senior vice president for product development and editorial at Britannica.com, based in Chicago. "We have found that the entire definition of the encyclopedia has to change. If that puts us into the same space as Yahoo and America Online, so be it."
Working to insure that its intellectual edge is not lost will be, in addition to the traditional team of Britannica researchers, a second group of content specialists. Their focus will be preparing weekly updates on current events -- a vast improvement over the biennial updates of the old print version -- plus taking advantage of the Internet's audio and video capabilities. While adding researchers, it has eliminated the door-to-door sales staff that accounted for most of the cost of the printed version.
The overwhelming response to Tuesday's unveiling of Britannica.com showed that the name Britannica retains its cachet in this country and around the world. If Britannica.com can continue to attract a passionate audience among the information generation, it will serve as a stellar example of how companies that are late adapting to new technologies can end up on top -- if they have a superior product. But such a brainy product must still compete in a medium based on entertainment and commerce as much as information.
And just think what might have been: Even if Britannica.com eventually completes an initial public offering of stock, it will probably never catch up to Yahoo's $46 billion market value. For succor, Britannica.com might consult its own Web site. The Encyclopaedia Britannica has no entry for "business failure." But type in those words on its search engine and a visitor will be offered the chance to buy a potentially helpful book -- titled "When Things Go Wrong: Organizational Failures & Breakdowns."

A Cyberspat Makes History

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
THIS month marks the 30th anniversary of the Arpanet, the Internet's predecessor. Then again, maybe it doesn't.
The University of California at Los Angeles was ground zero for the Arpanet. Then again, maybe it wasn't. 
 This anniversary of the Internet has been a particularly contentious one. Vice President Al Gore's misstatement to CNN last spring that he "took the initiative" in inventing the whole thing was roundly ridiculed by anyone with an inkling of the network's true origins. But in recent months, several more genuine contenders have stepped forward to stake a claim to this or that invaluable piece of the invention, giving rise to a number of public spats.
As barbs fly and longstanding friendships disintegrate, figuring out just who did what when is more difficult than ever.
I know about this problem at close range. In 1993, when I began researching a history of the Arpanet, the story seemed a relatively straightforward one. I scoffed when one of the Net's many fathers said to me one day: "Why are you even trying to write a history? No matter what you write, it won't be the real story."
While that may be true of history in general, anyone who tries to write the real story of the Internet right now will encounter a welter of contradictory material. Now graying, the scientists who took part in building the Net are busier than they ever were, not inventing new technologies but telling their side of the story to reporters, putting up time lines and history pages on their Web sites and shooting off E-mail messages. The goal, of course, is not to get rich but to secure a spot in history.
"What we're witnessing is a case of history getting revised in real time," said Peter J. Denning, a computer science professor at George Mason University who took part in the development of the Internet but has remained a largely silent observer. "We are watching the process of myth-making as it happens around us. Eventually certain people will emerge out of the myth and lots of what's been accomplished will be ascribed to them, even if they didn't do it personally."
The revision of history while the principal participants are still alive is not new. The author Stephen E. Ambrose said he grappled with the phenomenon recently when writing about the construction of the transcontinental railroad 130 years ago, an immense project in which dozens of luminaries like Senator Thomas Hart Benton and the industrialist Leland Stanford had a hand.
"You should see how those people fought each other," he said. "They would write letters to The Railroad Journal, or Horace Greeley's paper, saying, 'I'm the one who first suggested it's possible to build a railroad across the country.' "
To try to sort it out for himself, Mr. Ambrose relied on a well-established body of literature. His advantage was not having to fend off calls from Leland Stanford's p.r. agency. Nevertheless, he found no consensus. "I threw up my hands," Mr. Ambrose said. "Don't ask me who first thought of it. I could give you a lot of entries into the race."
Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University, says it's a common problem. "History is constantly being revised in informal ways, in popular culture and in private conversations," he said. "There are always many different versions."
What's new, Professor Brinkley said, isn't the revisionism as much as the presence of the Internet as a revisionist's tool, providing an easy way to spread one's own version of events. The latter-day equivalent of fighting it out in letters to the editor is to spam the world with your take, using the Internet as an amplifier. Whoever is fastest with the send button, whoever has the lengthier "cc" list, is most likely to rise above the din.
Scholars are wondering if the Internet will make the process of historical inquiry more difficult. "The word definitiveness comes to mind," said Neil M. Postman, a professor of communications at New York University. "Print is more definitive. Books preserve information. The Internet moves information. So with information on the move, appearing and disappearing, and without gatekeepers, it diminishes the credibility of claims."
Not only do electronic versions of events have a way of drifting more quickly and easily into the public's consciousness, but they underscore how quickly other information can disappear from the record.
In the case of the continuing paternity battle over the Internet, Professor Denning pointed to 1989, a more subdued time in the Net's evolution, when a symposium commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Arpanet took place at U.C.L.A. Back then, the Net was still relatively obscure and there was nothing much at stake. In attendance were the very men slugging it out today. A transcript of the event has them lavishing one another with praise and credit. But that transcript exists not on the Internet but on paper tucked away in the archive of the Charles Babbage Institute of Computer History in Minnesota.
Whatever remaining solidarity there might be among the Net's founding fathers is increasingly strained. There is one contingent that stands by early September, when the network got its first node, as the birth date of the Arpanet. Others continue to claim it was late October, when the first electronic bits passed from U.C.L.A. to a computer at the Stanford Research Institute, about 300 miles to the north. Some profess to have invented packet-switching, the data transmission technology that made it all possible. Still others claim to have had the idea for a network in the first place.
FOR his part, Professor Brinkley does not believe the Internet will hamper historians' ability to gather facts. "I don't think the Internet has reinvented history," he said. "It's just expanding and complicating it a bit. History is always contested, and over time frivolous claims get discounted, and more serious claims get more attention, and eventually there's a consensus around a particular answer. You won't have the open-ended disputes that are going on today."
Time may also slow the rush for recognition. Every so often, the Internet is not glorified but blamed -- for inflation, for the slump in dot-com stocks, for widening the gap between haves and have-nots.
"When the true dark side comes along, you won't see people scrambling to take credit for that part," Professor Denning said. "It will be, 'That's not the part I had anything to do with.' "
Maybe they'll say that was Al Gore's part.

An Old-Line Business Group Is Trying to Play Catch-Up

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
The 65-year-old Business Council, an exclusive club of 100 big-company chief executives like John F. Smith Jr. of General Motors and John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, has been showing its age.
Despite its reputation for legendary speakers and deal-making opportunities at its thrice-yearly meetings, some chiefs from the fastest-moving sectors of the economy, including Bill Gates and Michael D. Eisner, have declined to join. 
 But the Business Council is trying to catch up with the times, as the two-day meeting beginning on Wednesday evening will show. On the scene in Boca Raton, Fla. -- a switch from Colonial Williamsburg, the site since 1992 -- will be two new-economy members who have joined in the last year, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems and John Chambers of Cisco Systems. Michael Dell became a member in May but won't attend this week.
The program includes old standbys like Alan Greenspan and Bill Bradley, but with the Internet as the main focus, some speakers will be decidedly younger. Four teen-agers will expound to their elders on "Growing Up Digital" in a panel led by Don Tapscott, who wrote a book by that name and is chairman of the Alliance for Converging Technologies in Toronto. Mary Meeker, the Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, will moderate a discussion among four E-commerce chief executives whose names, even now, would never make the member list.
There is buzz, too, among some members that the membership committee may extend an invitation to Hewlett-Packard's Carleton S. Fiorina, who during the summer became the first woman to be named chief executive of a company in the Dow Jones industrials. If she joins, she would be right behind Crandall Close Bowles, the chief executive of Springs Industries, who became the group's first female member a year ago.
Oh yeah, and Bill Gates will be there, too -- not as a member, but as a Friday morning speaker. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

Playing Russian Roulette

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The most important story out of Russia last week was buried in the business pages: Russia's top stock-market watchdog quit after declaring that Boris Yeltsin's government was simply not interested in enforcing laws to protect shareholders in Russia.
Imagine if you picked up the paper and found that Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had quit, saying that the New York stock exchange and our commercial courts were so corrupt that you were better off going to Las Vegas, and putting your money on red or black, than investing in the market. 
 Well, that's what happened when Dmitri Vasiliev, who led Russia's Federal Securities Commission, quit. This story gets to the core of what is wrong with Russia today. Think of countries as computers. Today we all have the same basic model -- the Free Market PC. The real question is: Which countries will get the operating system and the software to go with their Free Market computer so that when they plug into the Electronic Herd of global investors they can get the most out of it and cushion the worst. Operating systems are the basic macroeconomic policies needed to succeed in today's global economy and software is the rule of law, the courts, regulatory agencies, a free press and democratic institutions.
Russia is like a computer that plugged into the Electronic Herd with no operating system -- not even the basic DOScapital 1.0 -- and no software inside. If there is one thing we have learned since the end of the cold war it is how much more difficult it is for developing countries to get the software and operating systems than we thought.
Where does Russia even start when the head of its S.E.C. is quitting? I asked Bill Lewis, who heads the McKinsey consulting firm's Global Institute and has just completed an extensive study of the Russian economy. "To start with," answered Mr. Lewis, speaking from Moscow, "you need a whole different group of people at the top in Russia. Many people have pointed to the fact that Russia has consistently held free elections as a sign that it is basically going in the right direction. But the real question is, Do Russians have people to vote for? Do they have politicians who understand what Russia needs today and are ready to implement it? The answer is no."
Look at Russia: Most of its economy has been privatized, prices have been decontrolled and competition exists -- all the free-market hardware is in place -- yet the economy is stalled. Why? The answer, the McKinsey team found, lies in microeconomics. The Russian system is so rigged and full of corrupt, arbitrary officials and rules that an unproductive steel mill, based on outdated blast-furnace technology, can pull strings so that the government gives it free energy, just to keep its people employed. Meanwhile, a modern Russian steel factory, which is both productive and could be profitable, can't make a profit, grow its market share and drive out unproductive firms because the market is saturated with subsidized steel.
In post-Communist Poland, the economy sagged and then surged as reforms kicked in because the best companies were allowed to win. In Russia, no such level playing field exists, so the most corrupt companies win. "In Russia today you don't do well by doing better," said Mr. Lewis. "You do well by seeking favors, tax preferences and subsidies. This reduces the government's income and increases the deficits."
It has been said of America that it is a system designed by geniuses so that it could be run by idiots. What Russians need most from America today is not aid, and it is not advice per se, notes Mr. Lewis. Rather, it is an understanding of what is the real source of American prosperity -- that it's in the quality of the U.S. system, its legal and market software that usually allows the most productive player to win. Secret: One of the most important competitive advantages a country can have is a lean, flexible, honest civil service. The Russians not only don't have it; they don't get it.
"What Russia needs most is their version of our Roosevelt," says Mr. Lewis. "They need a shrewd, honest, savvy pol who can attract the right technocrats around him and lead a democratic process to put in place the social policies and limited, but enforceable, regulations that are the necessary foundation for growth. Unfortunately, that Russian Roosevelt doesn't exist today, and it's not clear when he will emerge."

HEADLINE: Harlem Development's Foes Show an Addled Attitude

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Harlem on the Brink" (Sept. 26): Harlemites opposing the new projects there show a typically addled New York attitude toward development. Lloyd A. Williams says that the new investors will "take money out of the community." In fact, they're putting money in -- $700 million, according to your article -- and they're entitled to take out high profits in exchange for risky, pioneering investments in this long-depressed area. They'll bring jobs into an area of desperately high unemployment, and if their stores and housing developments do well, they'll invest even more money in Harlem.
A preservationist, Michael Henry Adams, complains that "they're demolishing Harlem." While Harlem's spectacular architectural and cultural legacy must be conserved, anyone with open eyes can see a vast number of vacant lots and deteriorated, far-from-landmark quality buildings that no one will miss. 
 Exciting new retail (as opposed to the current schlock on 125th Street and vacant storefronts on Lenox Avenue) will encourage some of the tourists on buses to stop and spend their money, which once again will mean more jobs.

Surprises from Jakarta to Wall Street

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS 

 BODY:
Funny how the election of a new president can send financial markets roiling, especially when it isn't the president everyone is expecting.
 Indonesia, whose population and economy make it too big to ignore but whose financial crisis and turbulent politics have long given investors palpitations, took a big and surprising step last week along a road that many think can lead to stable democracy and growth. Its parliament chose a moderate Muslim theologian, Abdurrahman Wahid, over Megawati Sukarnoputri, the fiery daughter of Sukarno, the former president, even though her political party won more seats than Mr. Wahid's in recent elections. The Jakarta stock market reacted mainly with enthusiasm, rising 6.39 percent for the week on 10 times the usual trading volume. 
 Back in North America, stocks were bounced around by less extraordinary headlines, mainly quarterly earnings reports that left bank stockholders delighted and technology stockholders scratching their heads in confusion. The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 both finished the week with gains of more than 4 percent; smaller stocks trailed a bit. Bond rates continued to rise last week on inflation worries; the dollar gained slightly. PATRICK J. LYONS

HEADLINE: A New World of Finance

 BODY:
Even without new laws enacted by Congress, the financial world has hurtled through many changes in recent years. Now with the agreement in Washington on Friday to overhaul the nation's banking laws, American businesses and consumers face even more transformation. Legislation agreed to by the White House and the Republican leadership will sweep away the Depression-era curbs that have kept banks, securities firms and insurance companies from moving into one another's arenas. The proposed deregulation is designed to help American companies expand abroad and become more efficient at home. But the breakthrough agreement was made possible by the lawmakers' willingness to try to protect consumers and poor communities from being trampled in the process.
For more than 20 years, Congress has attempted without success to overhaul the nation's banking laws, while American financial institutions found loopholes to get around some of the old regulations. Banks have already moved in a limited way into the securities business, which was barred by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Travelers Group-Citibank merger seemed a harbinger of greater change. But as such steps accelerated, consumers had reason to worry about access to credit, as well as technological threats to their privacy. 
 The needed legislative overhaul was delayed as the various wings of the financial industry waged expensive lobbying campaigns. Often it seemed as if lawmakers were engaged in a big tease designed to shake down the industry for campaign contributions, overlooking the needs of consumers. Partisan hatreds in Congress at times made an agreement unlikely. But in the House, Representative Jim Leach, chairman of the Banking Committee, managed to bring all sides together and craft a bill that was mostly acceptable to the White House. Another step forward came this month when the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve reached an accord to share oversight of banks entering into new financial activities.
The final impediment to a new bill was a series of disputes over the right to privacy of consumers and the rights of long-neglected poor communities not to be discriminated against. Both issues got resolved in a way that was, on balance, positive. But it remains to be seen how well the new regulations are to be enforced and what penalties will be available. The agreed-upon bill requires financial institutions to disclose their policies on collecting and using financial information, and gives customers the right to stop them from sharing information with other companies. States were left with the right to regulate insurance companies.
Most significant, a White House veto threat forced Senator Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to drop his attempt to eviscerate laws that have long required banks to lend in the same minority areas where they receive deposits. The White House, in turn, accepted compromise language on enforcing the law against redlining, pushed by Senators Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer, two Democrats with insurance and banking industries among their most powerful constituents. Finally, Speaker Dennis Hastert and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, also pressed Mr. Gramm to accept the deal.
A sweeping deregulation like this one comes along rarely. There are sure to be unintended and adverse consequences, just as there were after the telecommunications deregulation of 1996. The bill that was put together over the last several weeks, with a marathon negotiating session into the early hours of Friday, was testimony to reasonableness on all sides. It is virtually certain to be passed in the Senate and House and signed by President Clinton. But it will also be important for Congress to continue monitoring the trends in the financial industry. The principle of freer competition is the economic engine of this era. But the other imperative is to demand openness, financial prudence and safeguards so that the vast new concentrations of wealth and power do not create new abuses.

Schuerholz Thrives As Expectations Rise

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 23

 BODY:
At the age of 59, John Schuerholz is a dinosaur. His colleagues represent an endangered species.
Unlike Tyrannosaurus rex, Schuerholz is not extinct, but he has become a throwback to another age, a time when baseball general managers could reasonably expect to hold on to their jobs as long as they were not stealing money or their boss's wife. These days general managers are jettisoned as easily as managers. 
 Not Schuerholz. He recently celebrated his ninth anniversary as general manager of the Atlanta Braves, matching his previous tenure with the Kansas City Royals, a team he left voluntarily. For 18 years he has run major league organizations, signing players, trading them, building championship teams. None of his peers have done it as long or as well.
On the contrary, Schuerholz keeps watching his peers change. In the past few months, five general managers, one-sixth of the major league population, have been fired or resigned. Milwaukee and Colorado have named new general managers; Anaheim, Baltimore and Seattle still have vacancies.
"I think it's a natural development," Schuerholz said of the volatility of the job. "With all of the money owners have invested in these teams, there's a lot more at stake. They have expectations that whoever is running it, they expect that person to be very proficient and very effective and very productive."
Owners, he added, are not as willing to be patient as they once were when the money involved was a fraction of what it is now.
"It probably comes with what's happening in the industry," he said, "how much more we're paying, how much more franchises cost, how much more is invested in these enterprises. They expect us to be better at what we do."
Increased costs are not new, but the escalation of the increase in costs has had an impact on owners' thinking and nerves. As payrolls have risen dramatically, a select circle of teams has emerged as perennial challengers for the World Series, the Braves and the Yankees included.
"There's a handful of us," Schuerholz said of some teams, "who have been so good for so long and whose expectations are so high internally and externally, that the bar has been set higher for all of us in these organizations -- general manager, manager, coaches, players. Expectations go higher and higher and higher. More is expected of us. That is a fact. The bar is set higher."
The bar sometimes is set inordinately high, the dean of general managers said. "We should be congratulated on one hand for building a team and an organization that so much is expected of," he said, "but on the other hand, there should be a little understanding about what the pressures are that come with that."
Under Schuerholz's stewardship, the Braves have never seen the post-season take place without them. Ten general managers who have been in their positions longer than a month have never seen their team play in the post-season.
One general manager, Frank Wren, did not reach his first anniversary on the job in Baltimore yesterday. If the Yankees do not win the World Series, another, Brian Cashman, may not make it to his second anniversary in February.
But just as a fired manager seeks another chance and another and another, once a general manager has general managed, the job gets in his blood. How else explain the desire of Pat Gillick, 62, to get the Seattle Mariners' job that became vacant with the departure of Woody Woodward, who had been the longest-serving general manager with the same team.
Gillick retired once, leaving the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1994 season, then was lured back into active duty a year later when Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, offered him $750,000 a year for three years. The end of that term could not come soon enough for Gillick, but here he is back in the market.
"I like the people out there," he said of the Mariners. "They're all good people. I get along real well with them."
But Gillick has wavered in his desire to compete for the Mariners' position. "I had some interest," he said, "but after I thought about it for a while, I pulled out of it. Then I talked to them again. So the thing is up in the air."
Gillick acknowledged that he still has the "itch" to do the job, though he said, "It certainly has changed."
"In some way," he added, "as far as putting a team together to win, I think you can do it more easily than before because of free agency. Unfortunately, because of the economics of the game, they're moving people around faster."
 
The Executive Grapevine
A week ago, Bob Watson, former general manager of the Houston Astros and the Yankees, seemed to be headed for the Anaheim Angels' job, or so went the word along the baseball grapevine. Then during the week, Bill Stoneman, a Montreal Expos' executive, was viewed as being on the verge of being hired. Now the Angels may be back to considering Watson following Stoneman's meeting last Thursday with Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Company, which owns the team.
The selection of Stoneman, who has been the Expos' vice president for baseball operations for 15 years, would come as a surprise to executives, player agents and players who experienced his executive style when he briefly served as the Expos' general manager in the late 80's. His style was so abrasive that the Expos changed his duties so that he would not deal directly with players and with agents whose players the club wanted to sign.
One executive who knows Stoneman well said he has not changed since those days. The Angels' interest in Stoneman did not surprise the executive. He said Stoneman and Tony Tavares, the Angels' president, are "like two peas in a pod."
 
Checking Torre's Finances
When Joe Torre signed a two-year contract extension with the Yankees this year, his salary for 2000 and 2001 was believed to be $2 million each year.
However, information on managers' salaries distributed to the clubs lists Torre's pending salary as 50 percent more, $3 million a year.
The lower figure would have matched Jim Leyland's salary with Colorado before he resigned, though $500,000 of his $2 million was deferred, and the amount Felipe Alou basically receives from Montreal, though his salary is listed as $1.4 million.
The higher figure puts Torre far ahead of other managers.
The new salary certainly is insurance against Torre's being fired.
It's one thing for, say, the Detroit Tigers to pay Larry Parrish his $425,000 salary for next season; it's another for George Steinbrenner to pay Torre $3 million not to manage.
Putting Torre's new salary in perspective, the seven lowest-paid managers will earn a collective $2.65 million next season, and it will take the next salary on the scale to put the pay of eight managers beyond Torre's.
Put another way, Torre will earn more than Bobby Valentine ($1 million) and Tony La Russa ($1.8 million) combined.
The Yankees' manager worked for $1.3 million this year, fourth-highest on the managerial pay scale.
 
Give the Red Sox Credit
Too bad the Boston Red Sox could not live out their once-in-a-lifetime fantasy: beat the Yankees in the American League Championship Series, avenging 1978 and every other dirty deed the Yankees have perpetrated against them, then beat the Mets in the World Series, gaining revenge for Bill Buckner and the rest of the 1986 gang.
But the Red Sox, or more specifically their general manager, Dan Duquette, deserve recognition for a remarkable job this year. The loss of Mo Vaughn was supposed to render the Red Sox offensively impotent and doom them to a finish lower than dirt, but they had an immensely better year than Vaughn did as Duquette recast the team in a different image.
The Red Sox batted .002 below their 1998 average, hit 29 fewer home runs and scored 40 fewer runs. But they won two more games than they did last season. They did not make up for the missing offense by playing better defense. They committed 22 more errors and allowed 18 more unearned runs than a year ago. It was the pitching that carried the Red Sox to their unexpected success.
The pitching staff, led by the incomparable Pedro Martinez, had a lower earned run average this year, the lowest in the league; allowed fewer home runs and runs; walked fewer batters, and struck out more.
But once the pitchers got the Red Sox to the playoffs, their hitters erupted, scoring 44 runs in winning the last three games against Cleveland.
With Vaughn leading the offense a year ago, the Red Sox scored 11 runs in beating the Indians in the first game of the division series, then scored a total of 9 in three consecutive losses.
How did Vaughn do with Anaheim?
Not that he was to blame, but the Angels won 15 fewer games than they did last year and finished 22 games farther away from first place. Vaughn, hampered by an ankle ailment most of the season, batted .281, his lowest average in seven seasons, and hit 33 home runs, his lowest output in five seasons.
A healthy Vaughn could lead an Anaheim resurgence next season, but a healthy Ramon Martinez could join his brother in making the Boston pitching even stronger and position the Red Sox to finish ahead of the Yankees.
It would not be the same as beating the Yankees in the playoffs and taking their place in the World Series, but that scenario would play in Boston.

HEADLINE: WARY OF ABUSES, U.S. SHARPLY CUTS VISAS FOR RUSSIANS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The United States Embassy in Moscow has sharply curtailed the number of visas issued to Russians, particularly students and scholars, despite Washington's avowed desire to spread Western values in Russia.
About 40 percent of Russian students who sought to study in the United States using private funds were refused visas this year, about twice the rejection rate of previous years. Embassy officials suggested that students from impoverished Russia -- potentially part of the country's opinion-making elite -- will be tempted to try to settle permanently in the United States. 
 In some cases, the reason given for refusing a visa -- that the applicant appeared to have insufficient ties, like children, to Russia -- echoed the Soviet practice of allowing citizens to travel abroad only if their loved ones stayed behind to insure the relative's return.
The tightened visa policy followed the August 1998 economic collapse in Russia and is part of a broader and increasingly rancorous debate over the procedures for inviting foreign students to the United States. Applicants from South Korea and Thailand, which have also undergone economic crises, have reported increasing problems too in obtaining visas.
But the visa policy has special implications for Russia, where America wants to encourage democracy and influence public opinion. The Clinton Administration has defended its policy of engaging Russia, and recently announced a vigorous campaign against what it calls the "new isolationists" in Congress.
In Moscow, American Embassy officials deny that they have been overly strict. Laura Clerici, the consul general, asserted that consular officials needed to be particularly vigilant after the 1998 collapse.
"Many Russians think that bureaucracy is something to be gotten around," she said in an interview. "They give us all sorts of paper that is false."
But American educators and former diplomats say that the embassy has overreacted and that many worthy candidates have been cast aside.
They note that the embassy's statistics do not show Russians hurrying to flee abroad after the ruble collapsed. Overall, visa applications have not increased since August 1998 -- although the number of rejections has -- and student applications have actually declined.
"The visa policy is at cross-purposes with U.S. foreign policy," said Greg Guroff, the former director of an American Government office that encourages educational and cultural exchanges. "The American policy had been to expand contacts. Now the consular policy appears to be to turn down young people, particularly on private education exchanges."
The visa policy has been a shock to many young Russians. Despite a general surge in anti-American sentiment -- most evident in the street protests outside the American Embassy during the Kosovo conflict -- young educated Russians are still drawn to the United States.
For Russian students, there are American Government-financed exchange programs that can last for a few weeks, or for years. In 1998, 6,000 visas were granted to Russians under such programs. But Russians also attend American universities and colleges using "F" type visas, where the education is paid for by the student or other private sources or is supported by a scholarship.
In 1998, 83 percent of all "F" type visas were granted during the prime student application months of June through August. This year, the acceptance rate slipped to 62 percent.
Ruslan Shevdov, 27, had appeared to catch a lucky break when the small Moscow-based trading and agricultural company he joined after leaving the food service division of the Russian Army offered to send him to America at its expense to earn a degree in business administration and to perfect his English.
Accepted by Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., Mr. Shevdov had hoped to begin his studies this fall. But his request for an "F" visa was rejected three times.
"They said I didn't fit the student profile," Mr. Shevdov said. "Maybe they think I am too old. I tried to assure them that I plan to return. My parents live here. This is the country where I grew up. I can call my friend here at any time and he will come. How would I live there?"
Embassy officials said they would not discuss individual cases. The six-member team that handles nonimmigrant visas at the Moscow consulate makes hundreds of similar decisions, often on the basis of a 5- or 10-minute interview.
They try to divine if a student or scholar has an unbreakable tie to the homeland that will spur return. Interviews often amount to hurried discussions of an applicant's marriage status, family life and assets.
The burden of proof that a Russian has no plans to emigrate, even legally, falls on the applicants. They may find it hard to argue that what appear to an American to be meager rewards are sufficient for a decent living in Russia. Mr. Shevdov, for instance, earns about $900 a month, a a respectable sum for a Muscovite.
Scholars have also had problems. Taras Ivchenko, a 34-year-old assistant professor at Moscow University, is a specialist in Chinese linguistics who graduated from Beijing University and wrote his doctorate in Chinese. Encouraged by several American professors, he was to visit the United States to help translate a Ming dynasty manuscript.
But in a 10-minute interview in May, Mr. Ivchenko was unable to secure a tourist visa. He earns $150 a month and has no substantial property. His wife, father and sister live here -- but Mr. Ivchenko said the consular officer who interviewed him suggested that his chances for a visa would be better if he had children to leave behind.
"It reminded me of Soviet times," the soft-spoken Mr. Ivchenko said. "I would like to work on a project or two in the United States, but I am not interested in emigrating there. I belong here."
American academics report increasing problems in obtaining visas for Russian students or faculty members. Some have campaigned successfully to secure visas; others have lost.
The University of Maryland was recently left without a Russian instructor when the candidate it picked was denied a visa.
Maria Lekic, director of the university's graduate program in Russian language, said the faculty had gone through a careful selection process and had never had a Russian refuse to return home when a visa expired.
But the American Embassy concluded that the university salary for the Russian was too appealing compared to his modest pay at home.
"For years, the Soviets would not let people leave," she said. "Now when Russia is opening up, we are behaving like Soviets."
American Embassy officials insist that they need to be wary, and note that the black market price of forged visas has risen, giving credence to street talk of many Russians "jumping ship."
But they also concede that there has never been a comprehensive study on whether Russian students eventually return, or emigrate.
Almost half a million tuition-paying foreign students were enrolled in American institutions in the 1997-98 academic year. The tough American visa policies are driving Russian students to other countries, like Britain, which has loosened visa regulations to admit more foreign students.
Certainly, Britain won in the case of Maria Ushakova, 17, daughter of a leading Russian businessman who wants to become a psychoanalyst and take over her mother's practice. Her request for a visa to attend college in Pennsylvania was repeatedly rejected.
Hr family says she was told there was no point in studying in the United States since Russia had no tradition of pychoanalysis and a foreign-trained specialist would never find work at home. Her father then obtained a letter from a Russian clinic saying it would gladly hire his daughter once she finished her training.
Ms. Ushakova received a visa on her fourth try. By then, however, she had missed the start of the school year in the United States. Offended, her father said, by all the refusals and worried that she might not be able to renew an American visa to finish her education, she is now studying in London.

HEADLINE: Molding Loyal Pamperers for the Newly Rich

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
At butler boot camp, Lori Meyers, who wants to work for a very rich family in a Fifth Avenue apartment with a view of Central Park, was singled out from her classmates and scolded.
"You are a little too slick for this profession, Missy," said Mary Louise Starkey, founder of the Starkey International Institute for Household Management, a school in Denver that markets itself as the Harvard of high-end household help. "The lady of the house will get rid of you in 10 minutes." 
 A discerning household manager, which is the Starkey Institute's gender-neutral term for butler, would never, ever look more fetching than the lady of the house, especially if that lady is one of those young "trophy" wives, who tend toward insecurity and prickliness, Mrs. Starkey said.
Ms. Meyers, a fit and attractive woman of 35, nodded compliantly. She conceded that she might have to retool her appearance to land the $60,000-to-$120,000-a-year salaries that household managers command in Manhattan. Having left her career as a chiropractor, Ms. Meyers is paying about $7,200 for an eight-week course in the elegant care and feeding of the rich.
These are lucrative and stressful times in the annals of household help in the United States. Never before have there been so many wealthy Americans with so many big houses that need tending. Yet many of these new rich need as much schooling in the art of living large as the students in butler school, according to Mrs. Starkey and many others in the service trade.
The number of American households worth $10 million or more has quadrupled in the last decade, jumping to 275,000 from 65,000, said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University and an expert on wealth.
The increase in the number of people who can afford a butler has no precedent in the country's history, except perhaps in the boom years of the 1920's, Dr. Wolff said. He estimated that up to a fifth of those worth at least $10 million -- about 55,000 households -- are in the New York region.
There has likewise been an unparalleled swelling in the size of the American house. When the Census Bureau began measuring in 1984, only 7 percent of new houses were larger than 3,000 square feet (often considered the size threshold for household help). By the second quarter of this year, 17 percent of new houses were at least that big, and many were much, much bigger, according to the National Association of Home Builders.
Its surveys show that the largest and most expensive of these houses are concentrated in the Northeast.
These numbers scream for good help.
Mrs. Starkey's 10-year-old school, based in a Georgian mansion near the Colorado Capitol dome, now graduates about 60 certified household managers a year. She plans to expand next year with a second training mansion in the Washington, D.C., area.
Carol Scudere, who owns Professional Domestics in Columbus, Ohio, said, "I wish I had more students and more applicants because I could place them all." She is the director of training at the four-year-old school, which competes with Mrs. Starkey's.
In New York, Washington and Los Angeles, placement agencies that specialize in servants for the rich say that the demand for experienced household managers exceeds the supply.
Exactly how many household managers are working in the United States is not known. Until Mrs. Starkey's school opened in Denver, most either had been trained in the great homes of the very rich or had emigrated from England, where there are training schools and a long tradition of butlers learning their craft as underbutlers. After a long postwar slump for butlers in Europe (when the number of butlers in England shrank to the hundreds from more than 18,000), demand there appears to be rising. The International Guild of Professional Butlers plans to open a school in Amsterdam.
"People don't want to deal with vendors, they don't want to cook, they don't want to hear about bickering and jealousy among the staff," said Keith Greenhouse, president of the Pavillion Agency in Manhattan."They want the butler to deal with it."
There is, however, a persistent and sometimes destabilizing undertow in this flood of big money, big houses and big demand for grade-A help.
Many Americans new to wealth -- and three out of four households worth more than $10 million were minted in the past decade -- say they are uncertain about how to manage their servants, how to pay them and even how to talk to them. Their parents, in many cases, were not rich. They did not grow up with servants in the house. They sometimes are too chummy with the servants or too demanding, or both.
Upstairs among the multimillionaires and downstairs among their better-trained servants, there can be grumbling, miscommunication and resentment.
"We have learned not to include servants in family functions," said Mary Campbell, who grew up in a two-bedroom house and now lives in two large homes, in Boston and the Berkshires. Her husband is Lewis B. Campbell, chief executive of Textron Inc., which makes Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.
"We have been burned through the years," added Mrs. Campbell, who three months ago hired a household manager trained at the Starkey Institute. "People took advantage of our niceness. They took advantage of friendship. They lied about their hours. They told other people about our business."
An experienced Manhattan butler says that working for the newly rich is almost always annoying.
"Nouveau riches tell you the price of things," the butler said with a sniff. "I have worked for people who brag in front of their kids about how much their statuary art costs; then their kids brag to their friends. Americans also don't know how to draw the line about being too familiar."
The butler, who was born in England, complained that many wealthy Americans do not even know basic table manners.
"They don't know how to use silverware. People leave their knives and forks on table at all different angles instead of putting them together to show they are finished."
To iron out wrinkles in wealthy households, Mrs. Starkey preaches professional management and personal boundaries. Her students are taught to trim their nose hairs, wax their eyebrows, use a yardstick to space plates at the dinner table and always call their employers by their surnames and use the proper courtesy titles.
Mrs. Starkey also drills her clients. During home inspections, she advises prospective employers to tell their household managers many details about their personal lives, from how they like their coffee in the morning, to favorite television shows, to which child is related to which ex-spouse. Mrs. Starkey repeatedly alerts clients to the insidious dangers of familiarity.
"You have chosen the profession of service," Mrs. Starkey told Ms. Meyers and seven other aspiring household managers at the Starkey Institute. "You are about to be propelled into a world many of us never see, a world of plenty, of power and of indulgence. Remember, you are going to be paid as a professional."
The morning course in "boundaries" at the Starkey Institute raised these sticky questions: What if the lady of the house asks the household manager for help in adhering to a strict low-fat diet? And what if the household manager, while working in her employer's bedroom, finds an empty container of double-chocolate ice cream?
"Throw it in the trash and keep it to yourself," said Jenny Hookey, a former household manager for Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan and an instructor at the school. "You are not supposed to be your employer's conscience."
Mrs. Hookey rose from her chair in a basement classroom of the mansion-cum-school and wrote these initials on the blackboard: YBYJ.
"You bet your job if you cross a boundary," Mrs. Hookey said, explaining what is perhaps the most dismal fact of life in the service trade. Servants have almost no job security. If an employer does not like your look, your attitude or your work, you are out, no matter how well trained or highly paid you may be.
In a class on "personal style," taught by Mrs. Starkey, students were asked to describe the character of the wealthy people for whom they hope to work. The class volunteered these words: selfish, intelligent, aggressive, rushed, motivated, stuck-up, philanthropic and judgmental.
Why would you want to work for people like that? Mrs. Starkey asked her class.
The answer, gleaned from separate interviews with all eight students in the class, seems to be as follows:
Those who aspire to the butler trade are middle-aged people in post-marriage, post-child-bearing phases of their lives. Ms. Meyers was the exception, and she has been advised to compensate for her relative youth. A beautician who consults for the Starkey Institute told her: Trim the blond, highlighted hair. Lose the showy earrings. Lay off the dark red lip-liner.
Most of the students said they enjoyed taking care of expensive things. Many have worked for restaurants or in catering, luxury sales or property management. They are intrigued by the idea of working for a very rich family with many houses and jetting around the world.
One student, Chief Petty Officer Samuel Sutton, 39, has worked for several generals and admirals in Washington as a chef and a senior household manager, and he is hoping to go to work soon in the White House. He said he went to the Starkey Institute to polish his skills and prepare for 2003, when he will leave the Navy and look for a household manager job that will double his military pay of about $40,000.
A more typical student was Ingrid Lawrence, 56, who is divorced with no children. In "personal image awareness" class, Ms. Lawrence, a tall German-born woman with ramrod posture and an expensive but understated wardrobe, was judged to have a near perfect look for service: tasteful, elegant and simple.
"I am kind of fussy," said Ms. Lawrence, who recently quit her job at Neiman Marcus in San Diego, where she sold china, crystal and silver. "I love housework. I love to be surrounded by beautiful things. It will give me pleasure to take care of these beautiful things in a private house."
Ms. Lawrence explained that in her own house in San Diego, she used only fresh linen napkins, never paper. She kept her linens damp in plastic bags in her refrigerator, she said, so that she could iron them as needed, obtaining the crispest and most wrinkle-free napkins possible.
In ironing class at the Starkey Institute, when a teacher mentioned the linen-in-the-refrigerator trick, Ms. Lawrence smiled knowingly.
At the end of a grueling 12-hour day at the Starkey mansion, all the students gathered in the basement over dinner to watch "The Remains of the Day," the 1993 film in which Anthony Hopkins plays an emotionally remote English butler.
The butler, Stevens, resolutely refuses throughout the film to judge the character of his employer, Lord Darlington, even as he makes a national fool of himself by appeasing the Nazis in the days before World War II.
Near the end of the film, the butler is asked how he could endure working for such a despicable man.
"I was his butler," Stevens replies. "I was there to serve him, not to agree or disagree."
Although the students laughed during parts of the film, especially when servants ironed The Times of London, it struck most of them as profoundly sad.
The next day in class, however, Mrs. Starkey said that Stevens had had it exactly right.
"If you start judging your employers," she said, "your days are numbered."

The demand for household help is driven in part by the unprecedented number of Americans experiencing the sweet taste of success. Nearly twice as many reported annual incomes of $200,000 or more in 1997 as in 1990. The graph shows the number of Americans reporting incomes of $200,000 or more since 1990.

HEADLINE: Deal on Bank Bill Was Helped Along By Midnight Talks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
At a fund-raiser at Senator Edward M. Kennedy's home here shortly after 6 o'clock on Thursday evening, President Clinton asked one of his closest friends in the Senate, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, how the talks were going with Republicans over the most important financial legislation since the Great Depression.
Mr. Dodd was not optimistic about the bill, which had reached the point of do or die. After four days of bitter polemic between Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Administration officials, the two sides were stuck over highly symbolic and racially tinged community lending rules that threatened to rip the legislation apart. 
 The discussions had become so poisoned by Thursday night that Mr. Gramm threatened both the top White House economic adviser, Gene Sperling, and the head of the nation's largest financial services company, Citigroup, that he would pull the plug on the bill, something neither the Administration nor Wall Street wanted.
But Mr. Dodd returned to the Capitol and, with a handful of other Democrats from the Banking Committee, slowly managed to turn Mr. Gramm around in an emotional confrontation in a tiny back office crammed with three dozen lawmakers and aides and Administration officials. There, they agreed to split a critical difference -- giving Mr. Gramm a provision he wanted that would make community lending advocates more accountable, and giving the White House what it wanted by making sure banks provided credit in poor communities before entering new lines of business.
At 2 o'clock on Friday morning, a few scant hours after his pessimistic report to the President, Mr. Dodd and other exhausted Democratic lawmakers placed a telephone call to a weary Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to report that they had clinched a deal with Mr. Gramm to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. After eluding its advocates for decades, the agreement to deregulate Wall Street, favored by many of the nation's most powerful business interests, was struck.
The meeting in the middle of the night was the final chapter in a saga that began in 1934, when Senator Carter Glass himself tried to undo the law that put his name into the history books. The meeting capped a month of posturing, brinkmanship and dealmaking in Washington. And its outcome is expected to bring about one of the most important changes in decades in the laws governing the nation's financial system.
This account of the roller-coaster ride of the Financial Services Act of 1999 is based on interviews with leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers, senior officials at the White House, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, and industry executives and lobbyists.
Their horse-trading involved several deals. One, over a new regulatory system that may wind up governing the nation's banks for much of the next century, was reached two weeks ago between Mr. Summers and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, after months of debate about their visions of the marketplace. The agreement between Mr. Summers and Mr. Greenspan to share regulatory powers is a centerpiece of the legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act.
A legacy of the Great Depression, the act shattered the House of Morgan and divided Wall Street into investment banks and commercial banks on the theory that this would lower the risks of economic catastrophes like the stock market crash and banking crisis of the time. Later laws would make it difficult for banks to sell insurance.
For decades Wall Street sought to repeal the act, and for decades Congress was unable to deliver, largely because the three competing industries, at war over the shape of the legislation, lobbied the lawmakers into a stalemate.
That began to change in 1997 when three leading banking and securities lobbyists met at lunch and formed an alliance. A few months later, lobbyists from the insurance industry joined the group. Slowly the industry battle faded, and as the alliance approached Congress and the White House, a new momentum developed to repeal Glass-Steagall.
Still, obstacles remained. Foremost was a turf battle between the Treasury and the Fed. Both agencies supervise banks, but it was not clear which would have the lead over the financial conglomerates that would now be permitted.
The White House took the position that the Treasury needed to play an important role in bank regulation in order for the Executive Branch to implement economic policy. But Mr. Greenspan said that for financial conglomerates, the Treasury's formulation would enable securities firms and insurers to unfairly take advantage of the special Government subsidies intended only for federally insured banks.
Shortly after Mr. Summers took office early in July, he decided he would take a stab at the issue, and ordered Gary Gensler, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, to prepare options for a compromise.
Eager for new legislation, Congressional leaders urged Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Summers to come up with their own solution to the regulatory question or have one foisted on them. Two months into Mr. Summers' term, the two men sat for the first of many discussions on economic theory aimed at a compromise.
"These were two world-class economists who were trying to find a solution," said one top Administration official involved in the negotiations. "They were both willing to grind this down to the facts, to the point where they both allowed each other's agency to share data even if that data contradicted what they were saying about each other."
Mr. Greenspan has told associates that he believed the talks ultimately succeeded because the two men spoke the same economic language, looking at such issues as marginal costs, subsidies and equities. He concluded that such a deal could never have been cut by lawyers.
In the early morning hours of Oct. 14, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Summers brokered a complex arrangement. Their agencies would share authority under a regime in which new financial conglomerates would not be able to take broad advantage of the economic subsidies that are provided to federally insured banks.
That resolved a fundamental difference between the House and Senate versions of the legislation and propelled the measure into high gear. Still, by the beginning of last week, there were a few remaining barriers to a deal between Mr. Gramm and the White House.
When President Clinton returned on Monday night from New Jersey, he was informed that there had been no significant progress between Mr. Gramm and the Administration over the Community Reinvestment Act.
"It's going to be a long night of baseball and C.R.A.," he told aides.
Detested by Mr. Gramm, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was intended to eradicate discrimination in lending. Mr. Gramm vowed that his bill would never expand the application of the act, and insisted that the new measure should exempt thousands of smaller institutions from its provisions. At the urging of civil rights groups, the Administration insisted that the new law could do nothing to roll back the 1977 act.
In particular, the Administration insisted that any bank interested in expanding into new lines of business must have and maintain a satisfactory record of community lending. For his part, Mr. Gramm was also insisting that community groups be forced to disclose any agreements that they reached with banks to increase their lending to minorities and the disadvantaged.
By Monday night it became clear that House and Senate negotiators still faced a wide gulf over the Community Reinvestment Act. Mr. Gramm summoned Mr. Summers and Mr. Sperling. But two hours of talk accomplished nothing.
In later meetings with White House aides, the Senator made clear that he thought Mr. Clinton would never veto a financial services bill just as Hillary Rodham Clinton was preparing to run for the Senate in New York, whose biggest industry is Wall Street.
But Administration officials believed that Mr. Gramm's political calculation was flawed. While Wall Street is an important constituent of any New York senator, they figured, so are the minorities and disadvantaged New Yorkers who now benefit from the Community Reinvestment Act. (Both Democrats in Congress and Administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton had played no role in the legislative battle.)
The talks fared no better on Tuesday. They began with Mr. Sperling, Mr. Summers and Mr. Gramm. After Mr. Sperling left the discussions to conduct talks on the budget in another corner of the Capitol, he was summoned back by Mr. Summers, who sent a dire message. "Larry wants you back," Mr. Sperling was told. "It's all blowing up."
On Wednesday, Mr. Gramm put forward what he called his final proposal. At 10 that night, the Treasury Department rejected it, issuing another threat of a Presidential veto in a statementlargely drafted by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee.
Concerned that Mr. Gramm would try to corral some Senate Democrats, top White House officials met on Thursday morning with Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, and the nine Democrats on the Banking Committee.
The White House concerns were well grounded. That same day, Mr. Gramm held a teleconference with top business executives from around the nation, urging them to call three of the Senate Democrats most favorably disposed toward the legislation: Charles E. Schumer of New York, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tim Johnson of South Dakota.
Meanwhile, the financial services industry's top lobbyists trooped to Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon to implore the majority leaders in the House and Senate to postpone any final votes for fear that they would unravel the measure.
Unable to hold all his Republican colleagues in line, a frustrated Mr. Gramm was beginning to show signs that he would pull the legislation, just as he had last year.
Mr. Gramm reminded his colleagues of a favorite saying: "Don't take any hostages you're not willing to shoot."
After losing a pivotal vote early Thursday evening that sought to get the deal that had been rejected by the White House inserted in the legislation anyway, Mr. Gramm issued an ultimatum to the chief lobbyist for Citigroup, Roger Levy. He told the lobbyist that if Sanford I. Weill, the company's top executive, did not call Mr. Clinton promptly, the legislation would be killed. Mr. Weill had been in touch with senior Administration officials at least four times that day, but it is not known whether he placed any calls in response to Mr. Gramm's threat.
A few moments later, Mr. Gramm took a telephone away from a White House aide who had been talking to Mr. Sperling, and repeated his ultimatum that absent a quick offer from the Administration for a workable deal, he intended to kill the legislation in the next 45 minutes.
Mr. Sperling pleaded for more time, telling Mr. Gramm that Mr. Dodd and Mr. Schumer were working on a new compromise. Mr. Gramm apparently softened, for as he hung up the telephone, he turned to an aide and said: "Where's Chris? I've got to find Chris."
Finding Mr. Dodd, Mr. Gramm handed him the amendment that had just failed and asked that he begin reworking it. Mr. Schumer, meanwhile, had begun to enlist the support of other Democrats and Republicans for his own compromise.
The group closeted itself in the tiny office of the House Banking Committee's staff director with top officials from the Treasury and the Fed.
At several points, Mr. Gramm and Representative John J. LaFalce of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee, threatened to walk out. They were cajoled to stay by Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who headed the conference committee, and Mr. Dodd and Mr. Schumer.
Still, tempers had begun to fray.
When Mr. Schumer got animated, Mr. Gramm pointedly observed, "I'm an old man, but I still have my hearing." That prompted Mr. Dodd to observe: "He's from Brooklyn. That's how they talk there."
Finally, they whittled away their differences, ending with an agreement on the last remaining issue, a relatively minor provision that would require community groups to make some public disclosures about financial arrangements they had with the banks they had pressed to make more loans to the underserved.
The final agreement gave Mr. Gramm what he had ultimately sought -- a statement in the legislation that the community groups would have to be more accountable by requiring that they had to disclose their arrangements with banks. Earlier, Mr. Gramm had acquiesced to the Administration's request that no banks with bad community lending records be allowed to enter into the securities or insurance businesses. The two sides also agreed to split the difference on exempting small banks from the Community Reinvestment Act. Small banks with the best lending records would get fewer reviews for compliance with the act by Federal auditors.
Shortly after 2 in the morning, the business of many years was done.

HEADLINE: CLINTON ABANDONS IDEA OF INVESTING RETIREMENT FUNDS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton dropped one of the most contentious elements of his plan for bolstering Social Security's finances today, and called on Congress to break the partisan deadlock over how to prepare the retirement system for the aging of the baby boom generation.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said he would send Congress legislation next week based on a proposal he first floated earlier this year to shore up Social Security with projected Federal budget surpluses. But the new version will not include Mr. Clinton's longstanding call for the Government to invest some Social Security taxes in the stock market. 
 "The American people deserve more than confusion, double talk and delay on this issue," Mr. Clinton said. "So it's time to have a clear, straightforward bill on the table, and next week I plan to present one -- legislation that insures that all Social Security payroll tax will go to savings and debt reduction for Social Security."
Social Security is now taking in more than $100 billion a year above what it is paying to retirees, but as the baby boomers retire, payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits.
In a signal of his desire for bipartisan cooperation, White House officials said Mr. Clinton was withdrawing for now his plan to seek higher returns for the system by having the Government invest as much as 15 percent of Social Security's reserves in the stock market.
Republicans had rejected the idea of Government investing in equities, saying it would amount to Federal ownership of private industry. Most Republicans have rallied instead around alternatives under which individuals would be able to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street.
Although Republicans are sure to welcome Mr. Clinton's concession, they long ago dismissed the rest of the President's basic approach, which is built around reducing the national debt and then capturing some of the interest savings on the retirement system's behalf. Republicans have often said Mr. Clinton's underlying plan is nothing more than an accounting shell game that fails to address the fundamental mismatch between promised benefits and the revenues to pay them.
"If the President is serious about saving Social Security, he'll work with us to give personal accounts to American workers rather than relying on tired old accounting changes that simply fill the trust fund with more i.o.u.'s," said Trent Duffy, a spokesman for Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The White House said its plan would extend Social Security's solvency from 2034, when under current projections it would be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits, to 2050, beyond the life span of most of the 76 million Americans born in the 18 years after World War II.
"What we have tried to do is present what we feel is the most solid, bipartisan, hopefully uncontroversial proposal to lock away the Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, and use those interest savings to extend the solvency of Social Security," said Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic Council.
Mr. Clinton's announcement today was in part a last-ditch effort to make some progress this year on dealing with Social Security, which has more than lived up to its reputation as the most politically and ideologically charged of issues.
But it was clearly also an effort to put the White House back on the offensive after several weeks in which Republicans in Congress have used Social Security to attack Democratic spending proposals.
In news conferences, rallies on Capitol Hill and television commercials in the districts of 10 House Democrats, the Republicans have made a case that Democrats want to spend so much money that they are raiding Social Security's reserves to foot the bill.
Responding to the President's radio address, Republicans in Congress promised not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for other spending programs, and called for cuts in spending. Representative J. C. Watts, the chairman of the Republican Conference, said Republicans now planned to cut spending and keep the budget balanced while paying down $150 billion in debt in the coming year.
"The Social Security surplus must be off limits," said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who gave the Republicans' radio address today.
"We believe the Government should stay the course and live within its means," Mr. Domenici added. "By doing so, we can preserve the Social Security surplus, pay down our national debt, keep the budget balanced, while investing in priorities such as education and health care."
 Both parties routinely agreed for decades to spend excess Social Security payroll tax revenues on general Government operations. But this year the two parties have both pledged to balance the budget without using any of the Social Security money, and they have been trading bitter accusations about the inability of the other to show how to do it.
The fight has been less about Social Security -- the retirement system's long-term health is only indirectly connected to whether some of its excess revenues are spent on other programs in a given year -- than about exploiting an issue that both sides believe can play to their benefit in next year's elections.
Although members of both parties have come up with approaches to dealing with Social Security's underlying problems, none of the plans have enough support to have been given serious consideration.
Mr. Sperling said Mr. Clinton's plan was intended to be a start on the broader goal of insuring Social Security's viability for at least 75 years.
Mr. Clinton's plan is based on the idea that by using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, the Government's interest bill will decline substantially.
By the White House's estimate, the Government's interest expense will be $107 billion lower in 2011 than it would be if the Social Security surplus were not used, starting this year, to reduce the debt. Mr. Clinton's proposal would take the money saved because of the lower amount of debt, starting in 2011, and earmark it to shore up Social Security.
From 2011 through 2015, the total savings in interest dedicated to Social Security would be $544 billion, Mr. Sperling said, and savings would continue accruing beyond 2015 at around $189 billion a year.
The savings would at first go to further reductions in the national debt. After the debt was paid off -- around 2015 under the White House's current scenario -- the savings would continue to be transferred to Social Security in the form of a Government i.o.u. that would later be redeemed to pay benefits.
Republicans said the plan would still require that the Government eventually pay Social Security benefits using general revenues. In that way, they said, Mr. Clinton's plan would merely defer tough choices about raising taxes, cutting benefits or again increasing borrowing.

HEADLINE: Bradley Relies On Wall Street To Raise Funds

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
One of the biggest surprises of this campaign year has been former Senator Bill Bradley's ability to be competitive with the Vice President in the campaign cash sweepstakes. Mr. Bradley has raised nearly $20 million this year and has more cash in the bank than Vice President Al Gore.
But Mr. Bradley's fund-raising prowess should come as no surprise, despite his claim to be running as an insurgent candidate who espouses an overhaul of campaign finance. 
 He was a legendary fund-raiser in the Senate -- raising $9 million a full year before his last Senate campaign, in 1990, and outspending his opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, now New Jersey's Governor, 15 to 1. He was one of the top Congressional recipients of money from corporate political action committees before forswearing their donations this year. He was called "king of the bundlers" in 1990 by the Center for Responsive Politics for his ability to gather scores of $1,000 contributions from individuals employed by top investment banks, insurance companies, media concerns and law firms.
Today, Mr. Bradley's unexpected challenge to Mr. Gore is backed by numerous corporate titans, especially those from Wall Street. But it is not only as a candidate that Mr. Bradley has benefited from Wall Street's largess: when he left public office in 1996, he earned $300,000 as a consultant for J. P. Morgan and reaped more than a million dollars from paid speeches, many delivered to audiences of financiers, bankers and health executives.
Wall Street's generosity to Mr. Bradley is noteworthy for another reason. It does not appear to be rooted in favorable legislative treatment. While he was in the Senate, Mr. Bradley espoused proposals that the financial world opposed, including an increase in the capital gains tax.
In his Presidential quest this year, Mr. Bradley's list of top fund-raisers includes John L. Thornton, co-chief operating officer at Goldman, Sachs; Douglas A. Warner 3d, chairman of J. P. Morgan; Richard S. Fuld Jr., chief executive of Lehman Brothers; John L. Steffens, head of brokerage operations at Merrill Lynch; Joseph H. Flom, senior partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who is a powerhouse in the world of corporate takeover battles; Sanford I. Weill, co-chairman of Citigroup; Thomas G. Labrecque, recently retired president of Chase Manhattan, and Louis B. Susman, a managing director at Salomon Smith Barney.
Each has enlisted dozens of bankers and traders from their firms, as well as wealthy friends and relatives, as $1,000 contributors to Mr. Bradley's campaign. Major Wall Street investment houses are the top six sources of income for Mr. Bradley's campaign, accounting for nearly $600,000 this year.
"This has been the easiest fund-raising I have seen in my 30-year history of raising money in politics," said Mr. Susman, the unofficial national finance director for the Bradley campaign.
"We don't have a Wall Street strategy per se," he said, "but Bill has had a relationship with many of these people over many years and we involved them early on to see what they could do among their friends and associates."
In the case of these top executives, their donations to Mr. Bradley are not hedge contributions, in which a donor puts down money on several candidates. None of the top bankers -- with the exception of Mr. Susman, who also gave $1,000 to Senator John McCain "as a favor to a friend" -- has so far contributed to any other Presidential candidate, according to records of the Federal Election Commission.
Mr. Bradley's fund-raising network extends well beyond Wall Street. He has also used his contacts from 10 years as a player with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association to recruit top sports stars as fund-raising draws. He used a year as a visiting lecturer at Stanford in 1997-98 to nurture relationships with lawyers and venture capitalists in the technology corridor south of San Francisco; they have already raised more than $2 million for his campaign.
But it is the preponderance of New York banking and brokerage firms at the top of Mr. Bradley's donor list that sets him apart from the other leading candidates for the Presidency. Only two Wall Street firms are in Mr. Gore's and Mr. McCain's top 10 lists of contributors; only one makes Gov. George W. Bush's list of 10 biggest donors.
The only firm to make the top 10 list for all four candidates is Goldman, Sachs, whose partners and their families have contributed $22,455 to Mr. McCain, $60,250 to Mr. Gore, $77,250 to Mr. Bush -- and $210,000 to Mr. Bradley. Mr. Bradley's success is even more notable because Goldman's former chairman, Robert E. Rubin, was chairman of the National Economic Council and Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration. Mr. Rubin is so far sitting out the 2000 Presidential contest.
Mr. Bradley's familiarity with top bankers, brokers and bond traders grew from his 18 years of service on the Senate Finance Committee. He was one of the primary authors of the landmark 1986 tax bill and the architect of a plan to address the third world debt crisis in the mid-1980's.
But even Mr. Bradley's opponents cannot point to anything specific in his Senate career that would account for Wall Street's loyalty and generosity. He proposed an increase in the capital gains tax, advocated abolition of a variety of tax shelters and urged banks to take substantial losses on their loans to struggling economies -- all positions that at times put him at odds with financial executives.
So what accounts for Mr. Bradley's popularity on Wall Street?
Partly it is geography: Mr. Bradley attended Princeton University, represented New Jersey in the Senate and still lives in northern New Jersey. Partly it is familiarity with the people and the lingo of the Street -- J. P. Morgan hired him as a $300,000-a-year consultant within weeks of his leaving the Senate in 1997. Partly it is his position as the only Democratic alternative to Mr. Gore.
And he also helped give New York something no other area politician has ever delivered -- two N.B.A. championships.
"It isn't any of the policies that make him popular," said Mark Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association. "Part of it is he was a Knick, and a very successful one at that. A lot of the Street are sports fans."
Mr. Bradley used the two years between retiring from the Senate and establishing his Presidential committee late last year to lay the political and financial groundwork for his Presidential bid.
In addition to his work at J. P. Morgan, Mr. Bradley signed on as a consultant with the Gartner Group, a telecommunications research firm in Stamford, Conn. The company paid Mr. Bradley $131,000 in 1998, according to the personal financial disclosure statement he released this year.
He took part-time appointments at the University of Maryland, Notre Dame University and Stanford University, earning $170,000 last year for a handful of lectures at each school.
He gave more than 60 speeches -- at an average of $25,000 each -- to a variety of corporations, law firms and interest groups. Among them were Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a pharmaceutical company; Health Care Information and Management Systems Society; the National Home Equity Mortgage Association; the Association of Investment Management Sales Executives; Key Bank; Barclays Global Investors; the American Association of Health Plans, and First Union Capital Markets.
So last winter when he announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for President, he had not only a rich list of potential donors from his three successful Senate campaigns, but a new cache of contacts from his two years out of office.
Besides his proven ability to raise money and win elections, Mr. Bradley seems to have benefited from disaffection among some Democratic Party donors with Mr. Clinton and his chosen heir, Mr. Gore.
"A lot of the initial interest in Bradley is the result of Clinton-Gore fatigue," said Bonnie Reiss, a top New York fund-raiser for Mr. Bradley and a member of his advisory board, "a feeling that they need to wash their hands of the whole Administration."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Hardaway's Career Enters Third Act, With Kidd a Co-Star

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Anfernee Hardaway walked into Ancient Art, a tattoo parlor in Memphis, this summer with one simple request. He wanted something printed on his right arm that signaled his rebirth as an outstanding player after his last few frustrating years in Orlando. He wanted something to capture his arrival in Phoenix, where he will team with Jason Kidd to form, on paper, the most potent backcourt in the National Basketball Association.
"I was thinking one night," he said recently, "what can I do to put something on my arm that reminds me of all this mayhem that's gone on in my career?" 
 He came up with "Heaven Cent, Part II." The cent, he made clear, refers to his nickname Penny rather than the $87 million contract he signed with the Suns in the off season. Having the thick, black Roman letters tattoed, he said, was among the most physically painful experiences of his life.
It still hurt less than the last two seasons in Orlando, where Hardaway went from being a potential heir to Michael Jordan to being just another petulant young star trying to run an N.B.A. franchise by himself. He led a 1997 revolt against the Magic's former coach, Brian Hill, was accused of taking his sweet time getting healthy instead of helping the team during injuries last season, and had a falling out with Coach Chuck Daly that was a factor in Daly's retiring from the game for a second time.
"I got myself in a situation that I couldn't win in, and I continued to talk and it made it worse," Hardaway said. Like Grant Hill in Detroit for a while, he had trouble picking up Jordan's torch and carrying the league.
"I think there was a lot of pressure on me in Orlando and Grant in Detroit," he said. "The pressure of us being labeled superstars and not getting it done was there. I went to the finals, but we didn't win. It seemed like anything else was not good enough after that. I never said I was the next Michael Jordan or anything. I just wanted to win basketball games."
That's where Phoenix and Kidd, who has possibly surpassed Gary Payton as the top point guard in the game, came in. While Hardaway was making a decision on his future and Orlando was trying to find a way to sign and trade him, Kidd telephoned him several times before he signed.
Kidd's message: 'We want you here, we need you here and nobody has any beef about you coming. It's going to be a family atmosphere. You're going to win. It's going to be fun."
Hardaway said of Kidd: "He's awesome. He makes so many good plays happen, controls the game and never gives up in anything he does. It's super playing with him."
These marriages between All-Stars don't always last, as Hardaway learned in Orlando in 1996, when Shaquille O'Neal left for the Lakers. Who knows how much time will pass before Hardaway can't keep from saying all the wrong things again and antagonizing an entire community. For now, though, he has a new lease on his career and does not have to carry a franchise all by himself.
 
It May Be Now or Never
Shaquille O'Neal and Alonzo Mourning did not match up last week in the Great Western Forum Shootout featuring Miami, the Lakers, Phoenix and Golden State. But the game's two most dominant true centers did share a common thought: time is running out for their teams to make a run toward the finals.
"I think that for the most part, this is our year," said Mourning, whose Heat has been knocked out by the Knicks in the first round the past two years. "I really feel that. We've been together for four years, gone through some adverse situations. But we've grown and matured from that and we've still got the same nucleus of guys. And we've improved.
"Once we get settled and adjusted to these new rule changes and we start taking care of the basketball a little more, we're going to be a dangerous team."
O'Neal is not predicting a championship, but he feels the Lakers need to finally overcome their worst nemesis: themselves. "If we don't win it, it'll be a failure," he said. "It's a real tough conference. Everybody stacked the deck. For us, it's always been, if we play hard and do everything right, we're a hard team to beat. If we screw around and go through the same mess, it's going to be a long season."
Asked if the Lakers had been given enough time to mature as a team, he said: "Probably not. I'm probably to blame for that because I don't have patience, either. Like this house around the corner I really want to get. People want me to build my house. I don't want to build my house. I want the house around the corner. So I'm going to go ahead and get it. For resale value, it'll be a bad buy because it's a custom house. But I want it. And I want it now."
 
Romper Room Session
Judging by Antonio Davis's words last week, Charles Oakley has another player to help him babysit the Toronto locker room. After the Raptors lost their first two preseason games to Milwaukee and the Los Angeles Clippers, Davis, the former Indiana forward, demanded a players-only meeting.
Fingers were pointed in the direction of Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady, who only happen to be two of the most exciting young players in the league. Carter and McGrady were said to have been throwing down monstrous dunks and engaging fans and other players in banter while Toronto was losing badly.
Coach Butch Carter and Davis thought both players got caught up in entertaining the fans. "This game is a lot more than having two kids go out and excite the crowd," Davis said.
"My good players must learn there is a proper field goal attempts-to-points ratio," Butch Carter said. "It's something a kid doesn't know. It's up to me to teach him."
Davis and the veteran point guard Muggsy Bogues did all the talking during the meeting. The Raptors then won their next two preseason games.
Davis added, "When you lose to the Clippers, it's time to stand up and say something."
 
Metal Chairs and Memories
Pat Riley recently had his Miami contract extended and was given a part-ownership stake in American Airlines Arena, the soon-to-be new home of the Heat. So no one knows the need for a nouveau technodrome more than the president and coach.
"It's like anything else," he said. "The game has changed, the talent has changed and the marketing has created a different perception. And obviously, the economics require suites because people want more."
Even so, even Riley got nostalgic late last week when the final N.B.A. game was played at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, Calif. The Lakers, the Heat, the Warriors and the Suns closed the building for league business with preseason doubleheaders on consecutive nights. The dim arena, which has metal folding chairs and not much more in the way of accouterments, was where Riley led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980's. It will be replaced by the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles for this season.
In 1968, the Forum was the place where a 6-foot-5-inch defensive specialist out of Kentucky got one of his first assignments. "I think I opened the building as a San Diego Rocket," Riley said. "Jerry West got 44 on us -- and me. And I was here during the glory years."
The Forum is just the latest arena to be spurned by the league or demolished in recent years, following the Boston Garden, the Spectrum in Philadelphia, McNichols Arena in Denver, the Memorial Coliseum in Portland and venerable Chicago Stadium, razed for a parking lot across from the United Center.
"There were a lot of great events here," Riley said, standing in the corridor where his N.B.A. career began. "I'm talking about concerts, too. I can remember going to see Elton John, I can remember going to see the Eagles.
"I remember the heavyweight championship fight between Ken Norton and Muhammad Ali, all the games that I played in and also coached. It was a great part of me."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Governor Defeats 11 Foes to Win Second Term

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Though dogged by a series of campaign miscues and embarrassments, Gov. Mike Foster, a blunt-spoken Republican conservative, won re-election to a second term today, easily dispatching a field of 11 challengers.
With more than 85 percent of the state's 3,898 precincts reporting, Mr. Foster had just over 60 percent of the vote, compared with just over 30 percent for his nearest challenger, Representative William J. Jefferson of New Orleans, a Democrat. No other challenger had more than 5 percent of the vote. 
 "I'll be back in the office next week, doing the same thing I've been doing these past four years, efficiently running and managing this state," Mr. Foster told a crowd of supporters in Lafayette as the vote tallies rolled in and it became clear that Louisiana voters were readily going to give him another term.
What he has been doing is working to solve two of the most bothersome problems in Louisiana for the past decade or so -- its lagging economy and its low-quality schools. And if today's vote was a reliable indicator, Louisianans are pleased with the progress he has made.
Mr. Jefferson, who is black and had hoped to become the first of his race to win statewide office in Louisiana since Reconstruction, contended throughout the campaign that the progress the Governor claimed to be making did not exist on close inspection. He argued that poverty was still widespread all over the state and that schools were still turning out poorly educated graduates.
In a concession speech tonight, Mr. Jefferson said that he had done his best and had "kept the faith."
Now, he added, "we'll have to wait for another day."
Mr. Jefferson had predicted in the final days of the campaign that he and the 10 other challengers would, together, be able to keep Mr. Foster from winning a clear majority in today's voting. Had that happened, a runoff between the Governor and Mr. Jefferson would have been scheduled for Nov. 20.
The way Mr. Jefferson saw it, he would have a real shot at taking the Governor in a one-on-one contest. But, of course, there will be no runoff. And one reason is that the miscues and embarrassments that dogged the Governor throughout the campaign appeared to have had little effect on his popularity in the end.
Voters seemed not to be greatly moved by the disclosure that in 1995 Mr. Foster secretly bought a list of campaign contributors and supporters from David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader. Nor were voters put off in large numbers when the State Ethics Commission fined the Governor $20,000 for not reporting the purchase as a campaign expenditure. Nor did they abandoned him in droves when it was disclosed just a couple of weeks ago that he had tried to persuade a private detective who was investigating him, apparently for another candidate, to become a "double agent."
If anything, said political analysts, such campaign antics may have helped solidify the Governor's standing with Louisiana voters, who like a little more spice and flavor in their politics than most voters, much as they like a little more spice and flavor in their food.

RECLAIMING THE COMMONS
 Community Farms & Forests
 in a New England Town.
 By Brian Donahue.
 Illustrated. 329 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $27.50. 
 I grew up in what Brian Donahue calls "the belly of the beast" -- the suburbs. Our family lived in a three-bedroom made of pumpkin-colored brick and shaped like a Monopoly house. The neighborhood had once been farmland, but the only scrap of rural character remaining was a weedy lot where I caught butterflies and stuffed them into a jar with a cotton ball soaked in cleaning fluid. Given enough time, I might have driven a few lepidopteran species to extinction. But I didn't have the chance. A house was built on the open lot, destroying the neighborhood's last scrap of butterfly habitat.
Most environmentalists wouldn't get upset with that sort of thing. They're busy fighting to protect rain forests and preserve the Endangered Species Act. But Donahue thinks they're wrong. In "Reclaiming the Commons," he argues that "preserving some land that is truly wild . . . is of far less importance than learning to treat the greater part of the land well, to care for it." Wilderness is threatened, he says, primarily because the overall economy is not on a sound ecological footing. In the 1970's, he "began to suspect that truly protected wilderness will follow from a society that has at last worked out a healthy relation with its everyday landscape, with its productive forests and farmlands."
He decided to test that suspicion. For almost two decades, he worked on a community farm in Weston, Mass., outside Boston, to see whether it was possible, in the suburbs, to establish a productive relationship with the land. Profitability was a key. If the farm couldn't make money, it would have to survive on the kindness of friends, and that would not assure it would continue.
His idea was to create a new kind of commons, in which community-owned suburban land would be used productively, not protected as imitation wilderness. As he saw it, this could transform Weston: "After passing centuries as slowly evolving farming communities, New England towns like Weston were being turned more or less overnight into rootless bedroom communities in which children grew up bored and angry in spite of boundless affluence, and their parents wondered why. Could it be at least partly because neither generation any longer had meaningful ties to the land they inhabited or to any cultural tradition in that place?"
That may sound a bit utopian, but after nearly 20 years of hard work and blistered hands, he has demonstrated much of what he set out to prove. The farm in Weston, called Land's Sake, has followed sound ecological principles, made money, enhanced the beauty and rural character of the town and involved scores of students in farm projects. Donahue's book is more than a theoretical treatise. He shoveled manure, sheared sheep and boiled maple syrup; the book has the smell of moist earth.
Donahue grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh. As a boy, he sought solace in the wilderness. That proved to be a reasonably effective therapy for his suburban malaise until 1975, when he was camping and hiking in the Williams Mountains near Aspen, Colo. "I became acutely depressed," he writes. "I was exactly where I wanted to be, doing exactly what I most wanted to do. . . . Yet all at once I wanted desperately to be gone." After rejecting altitude sickness as an explanation, he concluded something was seriously amiss: He felt adrift amid the splendor of the mountains because he had no connection with the land. "I was lonely because I did not belong there."
A few months later, Donahue's adviser at Brandeis University, who lived in Weston, encouraged him to volunteer at the town's community farm. Weston is an unusual suburban town. More than one-fifth of the town is community owned, and Donahue saw plenty of opportunities to expand the work of the community farm. He and a few others formed a nonprofit organization and started another farm on private land that the town later bought. The aim of the project was to "provide ecologically sound care of the land in Weston, involve the community and particularly young people with the land and make the program pay its own way as far as possible." The farm couldn't compete with commercial agriculture in price, but it could in quality. Residents liked the quality of the food grown by Land's Sake and they were proud to buy food grown in their neighborhood. That, coupled with a profitable sideline in fresh flowers, allowed Land's Sake to prosper.
Donahue didn't stop there. He got into the sheep business. He persuaded the town to allow him to take a chain saw into the town forest to harvest firewood, often asking neighbors to walk the woods with him while he explained his idea that the forest should be used productively -- not simply left untouched. Much of his inspiration and practical knowledge came from extensive study of the history of New England's agriculture. The idea was to return to the time when Weston was the center of a cluster of market farms ringing Boston, to discover what the land was best suited for, and to recover some of the spirit of traditional New England towns. A considerable portion of "Reclaiming the Commons" is devoted to a history of New England agriculture, not from a detached, academic point of view but from the point of view of a working farmer.
Donahue doesn't have much to say to those of us who live in suburbs that have already been built up, where the closest thing to undeveloped land is a soccer field. Nor does he have much to say about how city dwellers might engage with any land that hasn't been sealed under asphalt or concrete. He focuses on the urban fringes, where new suburbs are creeping outward. As much as half of that land must be protected as commons, to support local economies, engage residents who move in and provide an alternative to industrial agriculture, Donahue argues.
His aim is to encourage a land ethic that will lead naturally to a desire to protect more remote areas as havens of endangered species and biological diversity. It's difficult to know whether his proposals for productive use of suburban land can engender that kind of land ethic. But his case that we should try to reconnect with the land is made more powerful because, in one town, he has shown it can work.

Of Cabbages and
 Kings County
 Agriculture and the Formation
 of Modern Brooklyn.
 By Marc Linder and Lawrence S. Zacharias.
 Illustrated. 478 pp. Iowa City:
 University of Iowa Press. $32.95. 
 The history of urban development in America is also the story of rural decline. The ever-outward spread of homes and businesses overwhelmed small towns and some of the nation's most productive farmland. Metropolitan Los Angeles, which now covers an area nearly as large as New Hampshire, grew out of citrus orchards and vegetable fields. The new suburbs of Chicago and Cleveland are sprouting on once fertile cornfields. But except by a handful of social critics like Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford, or land use advocates like Henry Richmond, the founder of 1,000 Friends of Oregon, the growth of the nation's cities and suburbs was celebrated as stirring evidence of a system that works. The American Dream, after all, defines the good life as a home, a big yard and space for a fleet of vehicles.
Of late, though, the unyielding advance of American civilization has taken on a different aura. Suburban development is increasingly viewed as a metastasizing smear across the countryside. The issue is so dynamic that an important component of Vice President Al Gore's campaign for the Presidency is finding new tools to stem the loss of of farmland to strip malls and subdivisions. In "Of Cabbages and Kings County" Marc Linder, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, and Lawrence S. Zacharias, a management professor at the University of Massachusetts, find considerable traction to explore these trenchant issues in, of all places, turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. As late as 1879, they report, Kings County was the nation's second county in terms of vegetable production, behind Queens. By 1919, almost nothing was left of a once thriving agricultural economy and the rural community it supported.
Brooklyn's swift transition from a pastoral landscape to a tightly packed 20th-century urban center with more than a million people came because of technological innovation (particularly refrigeration) and blind devotion to free-market principles that made land too expensive to farm. The question of what Brooklyn gained and lost from what the authors call "irrational deagriculturization" lies at the center of this thoughtful and well-written history. Linder and Zacharias conclude that human and community values suffered irreparable harm because Brooklyn's Dutch-influenced small-town culture was obliterated along with the agricultural landscape.
Can "the inevitability of agricultural dissolution in the face of urban expansion" be altered in the United States, they ask. Their answer is a guarded yes. First, Linder and Zacharias say, policy makers need to follow the lead of Suffolk County, N.Y., and states like Oregon and Maryland, which preserve the richest land for agriculture. Second, lawmakers need to be courageous in providing research and economic incentives that open new markets and keep farmers farming. Third, every level of government needs to reconsider the existing paradigm, which puts business development above any other value.
"What happened to farming was not the best of circumstances," Linder and Zacharias write of Brooklyn's experience. "The process was rigged in favor of congested land development and its quasi-universal effects. This form of urbanization foreclosed the possibility of creating an urban life style that proponents of urban farming today and even in the 1910's and 1920's recommended. New York and other cities thus forfeited numerous other possibilities for balanced population growth, more diverse and integrated self-sufficient urban economies, interurban public transportation and less costly environmental pollution controls."
Along with the thoughtful approach to the larger issues of land use, "Of Cabbages and Kings County" works wonderfully as a text brimming with new insights about Brooklyn's development in the 19th century. From the earliest days of the republic, Kings County was a bread, meat and milk basket for New York. As late as 1890, a visitor to what is now the corner of Church Avenue and Ocean Parkway could view a pastoral landscape of handsome farmhouses, open meadows and wagons filled with tall stacks of hay. The first big economic transition occurred in 1825, when the Erie Canal opened. The canal not only made it possible to ship grain inexpensively from the more productive Ohio Valley but also accelerated economic development and population growth in the city. Brooklyn's farmers took advantage of their close proximity and easy access to Manhattan's markets by cultivating high-value vegetables for sale to the growing middle and upper classes. By 1880, agriculture's zenith in the borough, more than 400 farms covered 12,359 acres and produced $1.2 million a year in farm products.
But such riches in the shadow of the metropolis were destined not to last. Industrialization drove up manufacturing wages, making it more difficult for farmers to hire workers, and by 1878 four steam railroads operated in Kings County, making it easy for settlers to reach the borough's interior. In 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge opened, and by 1890 new refrigeration techniques made it possible to ship vegetables out of the Deep South cheaper than Brooklyn could grow them.
Though New York was losing the capacity to feed itself, that thought was hardly a concern to the legion of business executives, developers and their friends in elected office who were racing to fill Brooklyn's idle fields with homes. By 1900, the future for the 72-square-mile borough as a center of manufacturers, small business and thousands of residences was plainly evident, and from 1900 until the Depression land values rose tenfold. Brooklyn's population reached nearly 1.2 million, and the acres under cultivation dropped to fewer than 6,500.
The authors cite Sweden and Germany as models for how public policy shaped real estate markets to preserve agriculture both within and near urban centers. In the 1970's, New York began to understand what it had lost and moved to reclaim at least a bit of its agricultural past, through farmers' markets and Green Thumb community gardens, especially in Brooklyn. There gardeners work about the same acreage as was under cultivation in 1929.

The Big Test
 The Secret History
 of the American Meritocracy.
 By Nicholas Lemann.
 406 pp. New York:
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27. 
 It takes 349 pages to get there, but eventually Nicholas Lemann makes his point unequivocally in "The Big Test." It is that a democratic society should provide -- as a national, Federal matter -- free, excellent and multifarious education to anyone on demand, from high school through college. The only important test of ability should be one designed to discern if a person has mastered a nationally agreed-upon curriculum on graduating from high school. There should be no testing of what Lemann regards as the phantasm of "innate abilities," no SAT's and the like, and thereby no possibility of a putatively meritocratic elite emerging out of American democratic life. "Decent schooling, the absolute prerequisite to a decent life in America today, should be thought of as something that Government guarantees to every citizen as a matter of right. It shouldn't be left to local authorities to screw up, any more than flight safety should."
Anyone reading "The Big Test" would be well advised to read the afterword before embarking upon the engaging but also deeply frustrating narrative it follows. What the afterword does is provide the essential context to Lemann's long, episodic history of the Educational Testing Service and its role in creating the structure of American education today. For unless you share Lemann's view that the testing of academic ability is unacceptably narrow and elitist, that sorting students according to their capacity to profit from college is impermissibly exclusionary and that the Federal Government is the right institution to run our educational system, you might be a little bemused by the tone of the book you have just read. You might find it mystifying that Lemann constantly denigrates a system that helped open up higher education to millions of previously excluded people, or that his account of the nave idealists who genuinely believed in the promise of a meritocracy is so pervaded by condescension and anxiety. The story he tells -- and often beautifully -- seems such an obviously progressive one that framing it as a case study in failure seems willfully perverse until you reach the conclusion. And then it merely seems unpersuasive.
Lemann is a staff writer for The New Yorker and former national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, and his literary skills pay off in this story. His access to the archives of the E.T.S. gives him an unrivaled insight into the thoughts and motives of many of the players, and he is also lucky enough to have been able to interview many of the characters involved. So the book is part social history and part Bob Woodward -- with the sources on the record. It begins in the old Ivy League of the prewar years and ends with the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative (better known as Proposition 209) to abolish government-sponsored affirmative action in 1996. It tells the unlikely story of the way in which scholastic aptitude testing came to dominate the process of educational selection in the United States, and how education itself came to play an increasingly important part in deciding who wins and loses in the American economy and class system. Throughout, Lemann is alert to the role of personality and serendipity, as good historians are. And he is sharp in his judgments of class and status, as good journalists are. He knows the difference, for example, between test prepping la Stanley Kaplan and test prepping la Princeton Review. The former buys into the notion of meritocracy; the latter mocks it.
And he does an excellent job of evoking characters in thumbnail sketches and a few memorable scenes. The story starts with one down-at-heels Henry Chauncey praying in a church. It was Chauncey, descendant of Puritans and classic product of the old Ivy League elite, whose fierce enthusiasm for the new science of intelligence testing played such a crucial part in the early days of the E.T.S. (He is a member of what Lemann nicely calls "the Episcopacy.") At the other end of the story, in both time and space, is Molly Munger, boomer, feminist lawyer in the era of Clinton, whose dedication to the meritocratic dream came unstuck in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. In between, there is, perhaps most memorably, Clark Kerr, peerlessly political pioneer of the University of California in the 1950's, epitome of that decade's optimism in planning, growth and social science. Lemann captures him artfully: "Kerr presided over his utopia from a Japanese-style house, plain but intricate, like him, that he and his wife had built in El Cerrito, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay. He often worked from home, going through stacks of memoranda and resolving whatever issues they raised by writing tiny, cryptic messages in the margins in green ink. He traveled regularly all over the world, a figure in an international community of modern scholar-administrators. In his spare time he would pick a period of artistic or literary history and master it." Kerr, of course, would later be swept away by a wave of 1960's student revolt.
If all Lemann were trying to do was to tell a fascinating and heretofore underreported story about the role of educational testing in forming modern American society, then this book would be a qualified success. Although there are times when the author's pretended omniscience can grate a little, the story belts along. The cast of characters is sometimes bewildering -- some are introduced for no apparent reason and then disappear -- but few are boring. To be sure, the prose sometimes overreaches. Lemann leans over backward to point out the lessons of various anecdotes just in case the reader might have missed them, remarking at one point, for example, that the Harvard president James Bryant Conant "never imagined that he and Henry Chauncey were actually creating a new kind of class system even more powerful than the old one." The book's subtitle, "The Secret History of the American Meritocracy," is typically melodramatic. It might be better called "The Obscure Records of an Underrated Institution." Lemann unearths no classified secrets from the archives of the Educational Testing Service, and, as he points out, the organization was often very receptive to outsiders and critics. Indeed, his sources seem to have been more than generous with their time and records -- even thrilled by the attention.
As well they might be. But the book's real flaw is not its loving inflation of somewhat recondite events but its propelling argument. What Lemann wants to show is that American education's thralldom to intelligence testing -- specifically in the form of Scholastic Aptitude Tests -- was neither inevitable nor desirable. He shows how the Educational Testing Service won critical Government contracts in part because it offered a quick and effective way of sorting out vast numbers of people during periods of great stress -- during World War II and the cold war. He then shows how it used these footholds to gain acceptance among some influential colleges by a measure of cunning, chance and politics. It had competitors and plenty of critics, internal and external. It dodged plenty of political and cultural bullets. But once it had established winners, they themselves had a vested interest in perpetuating the system and so, despite the odds and growing injustice, it prevailed. The result, in Lemann's view, is the accident of an oligarchic elite that "looks more and more like what it was intended to replace" and, in fact, for Lemann, is almost morally indistinguishable from its predecessor.
This is a nice irony to give shape and direction to the narrative -- but it is an obviously overdone one. America wasn't alone in embracing some form of testing in the middle of the century -- the British went far more overboard in the 1940's, as Lemann notes. And it seems more than a little strained to pretend that a system that sees thousands of children of Asian immigrants dominate California's universities in the 1990's is as iniquitous as an Ivy League peopled by wealthy, not-so-swift WASP's in the 1890's. It is easy to point out flaws in the aptitude testing system, and plenty of people have -- until one imagines a viable alternative. Lemann's vision of tests based on a national curriculum would seem to be even more susceptible to favoring the well-prepped children of the wealthy and well educated.
To be sure, the upper-middle-class game of getting one's children into the best colleges is in danger of creating an entrenched elite; elaborate prepping schemes somewhat undermine the promise of the tests, and good public high school education -- especially for the poor -- is an inarguable public good. But that doesn't mean that a reasonably reliable means of scholastic testing is inherently oligarchic and that it cannot sometimes help the less advantaged leapfrog their socioeconomic superiors in the struggle for social advancement.
One suspects that Lemann's deepest worries about the system stem from the problem of race, not class. The most original part of the book is its very perceptive analysis of the links between the rise of an educational meritocracy and the race debate in America. Lemann is surely right that without the dominance of testing, the shockingly poor performance of African-Americans in higher education would not have become such a pressing political issue, which is why the battle against affirmative action is a fitting climax to the book. As it is, low test scores among blacks have been fuel for both sides in the argument: for those who suspect that undeserving blacks are being admitted over whites to institutions of higher education and for those who suspect that the entire system is rigged against African-Americans in the first place. For Lemann, it is a virtual given that low black scores further prove that the system is unfair. But he oddly fails to account for how low black scores endure high up the socioeconomic ladder and how poor, and often newly immigrant, Asian-Americans seem to have made such a success of the system despite high economic and linguistic hurdles to achievement.
The Asian-American lacuna is particularly striking. Lemann's major Asian-American characters are left-liberal activists, including Bill Lann Lee, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, whose attachment to old-liberal identity politics helped insure he never won Senate confirmation. For some reason, we are denied the far more typical story of poor Asian immigrants for whom the aptitude test is an invaluable opportunity -- not an entrenched injustice. Why, one wonders, does a test devised to perpetuate an upper-middle-class oligarchy seem to suit these poor, bright newcomers so well? To this, Lemann doesn't seem to have an answer. Given the ambitions of this book, he surely needs to.

HEADLINE: We Are Family: Mom, Dad and Just Me

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, Mia Walker, a former television producer who is just about to have her second child, asked some friends to give her a "nonshower." Absolutely no presents, she insisted. Instead, as she tearfully told her girlfriends gathered in an East Side brownstone, she wanted them to assure her she wouldn't "disappear down a black hole" as a mother of two in Manhattan.
Although she was ecstatic to be having another baby, she said, she couldn't help but be a little worried about fitting her new double stroller into the elevator, or giving up the ease of jumping on the subway or visiting museums and restaurants with just a toddler, versus a toddler plus an infant. 
 Ms. Walker was experiencing a classic New York syndrome: two children puts you in a different universe. "I'm really happy about having another baby, but there is something looming about the onset of child No. 2 in New York," she said. "When you have one kid here you have the world at your fingertips."
In contrast to suburbia, where two or more children are the norm, Manhattan has become a veritable only-child paradise. Demographers, using figures supplied by the city, say that the single-child family is now the most-common family unit in Manhattan. More than 30 percent of all married women on the island in their early 40's -- that is, women who are largely past childbearing age and whose family size is most likely set -- have only a single child. Add to that the number of women under 40 with one child, and you have a raging plurality that the demographers, Andrew Beveridge and Susan Weber of Queens College, say could top 40 percent.
By contrast, the national figure for women ages 40 to 44 who have ever been married and have just one child is about 21 percent, according to Census Bureau data.
In the suburbs, only children are still often considered a curiosity, sometimes even a sad one. But in Manhattan, there is virtually no stigma attached to them. They are as much a part of the cultural fabric of the city as the unique circumstances that, in a word, breed them: small, expensive apartments, a huge proportion of women who delay marriage and childbearing to pursue careers, inadequate public schools and sky-high private school tuitions.
"There's nowhere else that the two-parent, one-child ratio is regarded so positively," said Len Covine, 46, an architect who lives in SoHo with his wife, Sophie, and their 5-year-old daughter, Lena.
"Walking on the streets here you can forget about the whole S.U.V. thing, the whole play-date thing, the whole soccer-mom thing," he said. "Instead, you can remember the museum thing, the Central Park thing, the matinee thing, the hop-into-a-taxi thing. Having a child here, one child, is completely different than the family experience anywhere else."
Another parent-of-one, Anita Farrington-Brathwaite, whose daughter, Monet, is 8, said: "I feel I have the best of both worlds. I have a career that's really meaningful to me, and I have a great deal of time to devote to my daughter. I really shudder at the thought of having to spread myself thinner."
Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, an undergraduate dean at New York University, grew up in Queens and was herself an only child. She said she never thought of having more than one. "I grew up knowing that I had a really good deal, that my parents, who really didn't have that much money, were able to give me security I wouldn't have had otherwise," she said.
Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, whose husband is also a college administrator, lives in a two-bedroom N.Y.U.-subsidized apartment and sends her daughter to the Little Red School House, a private school that has a large percentage of only children. "There is no way I could have done that if I had more than one child," she said.
Now that New York has been dubbed safe again and small-town schoolyard shootings are still fresh in the public's imagination, fewer couples seem to be moving out of town right after the birth of their first child. Then, a few years later, at the time most people decide to have a second child, these couples are loath to move. "New York," said Ms. Walker, who has returned to school to become a psychotherapist, "just gets in your blood."
But unlike Ms. Walker and her husband, who recently left a family business to start an Internet venture, many people simply decide not to have another child. Where members of an earlier generation might have felt guilty or conflicted about that decision, fearing they were depriving their child of sibling companionship, today a large body of research shows that only children do not suffer social or intellectual repercussions.
And a welcome aspect of having an only child in Manhattan is that such families do not stand apart, parents say. Amy Virshup, 40, a journalist who has a year-old son, Nicholas, lives with her husband, an architect, in an Upper West Side building that may stand as a microcosm of Manhattan: among the 24 apartments, there are seven couples with one child. Each of the children is old enough to suggest that the parents are unlikely to be planning more. "The only person who asks me when I'm going to have another kid is my cleaning woman," Ms. Virshup said. "She says I'm lazy."
With so many only children in town, the usual services and activities for infants and toddlers take on a special tinge. Play groups and luncheon clubs that specialize in first-time mothers -- a disproportionate number of the total mothers in the city -- have sprung up everywhere. "When I grew up as an only child, it was awful," recalled the novelist Dani Shapiro, 37, whose son, Jacob, is now 5 months old. "I was the only one in my entire private school class. But I know that if I don't decide to have another baby, Jacob will have lots of kids in his class who are only children. That really makes a huge difference to me."
While the percentage of only children in Manhattan is the highest in the United States, there has been a subtler boom in one-child families across the country. Only children are the nation's fastest-growing family demographic. Three-person families have grown from 10 million in 1972 to more than 15 million today, and between 1980 and 1990, the most recent census, there was a 76 percent increase among women nearing the end of childbearing with one child. That trend, plus the rising number of childless couples (nearly 18 percent), has lowered the United States birthrate to less than two per family. Demographers trace the decline to a rising divorce rate, higher costs to rear and educate children, a rise in the number of working women and a rising age of marriage.
Although choice is not always a factor in the decision to have an only child -- infertility is rising as women delay marriage and childbirth into their 30's -- more people than ever are consciously opting to have just one, experts say, especially in Manhattan. "Here there is a self-selection factor," said Dr. Kathleen Gerson, an N.Y.U. sociologist and the author of "Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career and Motherhood" (University of California, 1985). "They say, 'If staying in New York means having only one kid, I'll do it.' "
Only children may no longer be seen as deprived, but their parents still sometimes come in for criticism for being self-centered or for spoiling their offspring. "We seem to have a generation of Eloises in Manhattan," said Danielle Crittenden, a cultural critic and the author of "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman" (Simon & Schuster, 1999). "Our standards for what we think we need to give our children, in space and in things, is outrageous, absurd. Children are like consumptive items, like a Jaguar. It's very sad."
Dr. Gerson, who has a 16-year-old daughter who is an only child, said she is now interviewing 18- to 30-year-olds for her research, many of whom are themselves only children and "take having only one kid pretty much as a given."
Those decisions may well be influenced by the remarkable turnaround in the attitude of psychologists and child-rearing experts. Until the 1970's, the prevailing wisdom among experts, and society in general, was that having an only child was tantamount to cruelty. This view, shaped by turn-of-the century studies of the pioneering psychologist G. Stanley Hall, held that only children were spoiled and self-centered. "Being an only child," Dr. Hall wrote in 1892, "is a disease in itself." Dr. Hall's influence was profound: surveys throughout the years have shown that the primary reason people cite for having a second child is to make sure their first child isn't maladapted, Dr. Gerson said.
But in the last 20 years, there has been a 180-degree shift. Now, experts say there is virtually no difference between only children and first-born children in self-esteem, generosity, popularity and relations to parents. In fact, many studies show that only children score higher on I.Q. tests and are more popular with peers than children with several other siblings. The psychologist Toni Falbo published a review of 141 studies in 1984 and concluded, "Only children scored significantly better than other groups in achievement motivation and personal adjustment and were in all other respects indistinguishable from children with brothers and sisters."
Scanning volumes on child-rearing in Barnes & Noble, it is virtually impossible to find a condemnation of the choice to raise an only child. A new generation of name-brand experts in child-rearing has emerged, all of whom insist that Dr. Hall's studies had no basis in fact, including Ann Laybourn of the Centre for the Study of the Child and Society at Scotland's Glasgow University and Susan Newman, author of "Parenting an Only Child" (Doubleday, 1990). Last year, the journalist Bill McKibben wrote "Maybe One" (Simon & Schuster, 1998), an ecological defense of only childhood that used a battery of new studies as ammunition.
To cynics, and some parents of more than one child, it may be hard not to wonder if psychology is not merely reflecting changes in the societal landscape. With more women in the work force by choice or necessity, and higher rates of infertility, it may seem all too pat that new research shows that only children are not disadvantaged. "There is no doubt that we have a great ability to mold our ideas of what is good for our children based on what is good for us," Dr. Gerson said.
But that observation cuts both ways. The landscape of childhood has changed strikingly since Dr. Hall's time, and even since the 1960's. In the early part of the century, high child mortality rates and farms that needed extra hands likely influenced Dr. Hall's research showing that only children were a blight on society. Until the 1970's, when birth control burgeoned and women entered the work force significantly, having only one child was virtually never a conscious choice. The stigmatized only child was likely to be at home alone with his mother, a situation that might indeed have contributed to the perception that only children were overindulged.
"The whole obsession with the multi-child suburban family ideal flourished in the 1950's," Dr. Gerson said, "which was the height of the isolated nuclear family."
Now, many only children go to day care, since their mothers are more often employed than mothers with more children. "Children now learn socialization skills from other nonrelated children," Dr. Gerson said.
Mr. Covine, the architect, proudly flaunts a modern, boom-market attitude toward raising an only child. "Maybe a little selfishness isn't so bad," he said. "If it means my daughter goes to Harvard and over achieves, hey, I can live with that."
 
Where Wealth Begets Children
 
IN leafy suburban communities, there is nothing unusual about seeing a woman drive up in a sport utility vehicle with three children in the back. In much of Manhattan, however, such a sight is downright shocking, for a simple demographic reason: women who have more than two children are usually struggling economically. Demographic data analyzed by Queens College sociologists show that affluent parents almost always stick to one or two, if they have children at all.
But there is one neighborhood in which all bets are off: the Upper East Side. Although the actual percentage of women who have three or more children in Manhattan's toniest enclave is small -- only 6 percent (compared with 21 percent in Harlem) -- they are highly visible. That's likely because their resources are breathtaking. In Manhattan, three children can be a potent social signifier.
While the median income in almost every other neighborhood falls for families with three or more children, on the Upper East Side, it soars. In Chinatown, for example, the median household income is $36,000 for a family with one child, and $19,000 for a family with three or more children, according to the data compiled by Andrew Beveridge and Susan Weber of Queens College.
But on the Upper East Side, the median income for a one-child family is $120,000; for families with three or more children it nearly doubles, to $303,000 a year.
"Sometimes it really feels like there are virtually no regular people up here," said Erica Goldberg, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment on East 80th Street with her husband, Andrew, a management consultant, and three sons, all under 8. "And having a big family seems to be part of the package."
Ms. Goldberg, 36, said that 80 percent of her friends had at least three children. The last decade of extraordinary growth on Wall Street has contributed, she speculated, to a baby boom on Park Avenue and its environs. "I even know a woman who is having her fifth child. Personally, I find it really frightening, but she couldn't be happier or calmer."
Ms. Goldberg said her husband makes a very handsome living. Still, she doesn't count herself among the truly privileged, at least in East Side terms. True, they drive a Mercedes station wagon. They do not, however, have a second home.
In fact, while the youngest two children go to private school, they send their oldest son to P.S. 290, the well-regarded school in the neighborhood. "When I was trying to get the younger one into school, a friend who is incredibly well-to-do told me I should mention in the interview that my oldest child goes to public school," Ms. Goldberg said. "With a completely straight face she said the admissions people would like that because they were always looking for diversity." NANCY HASS

HEADLINE: We Are Family: Mom, Dad and Just Me

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, Mia Walker, a former television producer who is just about to have her second child, asked some friends to give her a "nonshower." Absolutely no presents, she insisted. Instead, as she tearfully told her girlfriends gathered in an East Side brownstone, she wanted them to assure her she wouldn't "disappear down a black hole" as a mother of two in Manhattan.
Although she was ecstatic to be having another baby, she said, she couldn't help but be a little worried about fitting her new double stroller into the elevator, or giving up the ease of jumping on the subway or visiting museums and restaurants with just a toddler, versus a toddler plus an infant. 
 Ms. Walker was experiencing a classic New York syndrome: two children puts you in a different universe. "I'm really happy about having another baby, but there is something looming about the onset of child No. 2 in New York," she said. "When you have one kid here you have the world at your fingertips."
In contrast to suburbia, where two or more children are the norm, Manhattan has become a veritable only-child paradise. Demographers, using figures supplied by the city, say that the single-child family is now the most-common family unit in Manhattan. More than 30 percent of all married women on the island in their early 40's -- that is, women who are largely past childbearing age and whose family size is most likely set -- have only a single child. Add to that the number of women under 40 with one child, and you have a raging plurality that the demographers, Andrew Beveridge and Susan Weber of Queens College, say could top 40 percent.
By contrast, the national figure for women ages 40 to 44 who have ever been married and have just one child is about 21 percent, according to Census Bureau data.
In the suburbs, only children are still often considered a curiosity, sometimes even a sad one. But in Manhattan, there is virtually no stigma attached to them. They are as much a part of the cultural fabric of the city as the unique circumstances that, in a word, breed them: small, expensive apartments, a huge proportion of women who delay marriage and childbearing to pursue careers, inadequate public schools and sky-high private school tuitions.
"There's nowhere else that the two-parent, one-child ratio is regarded so positively," said Len Covine, 46, an architect who lives in SoHo with his wife, Sophie, and their 5-year-old daughter, Lena.
"Walking on the streets here you can forget about the whole S.U.V. thing, the whole play-date thing, the whole soccer-mom thing," he said. "Instead, you can remember the museum thing, the Central Park thing, the matinee thing, the hop-into-a-taxi thing. Having a child here, one child, is completely different than the family experience anywhere else."
Another parent-of-one, Anita Farrington-Brathwaite, whose daughter, Monet, is 8, said: "I feel I have the best of both worlds. I have a career that's really meaningful to me, and I have a great deal of time to devote to my daughter. I really shudder at the thought of having to spread myself thinner."
Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, an undergraduate dean at New York University, grew up in Queens and was herself an only child. She said she never thought of having more than one. "I grew up knowing that I had a really good deal, that my parents, who really didn't have that much money, were able to give me security I wouldn't have had otherwise," she said.
Ms. Farrington-Brathwaite, whose husband is also a college administrator, lives in a two-bedroom N.Y.U.-subsidized apartment and sends her daughter to the Little Red School House, a private school that has a large percentage of only children. "There is no way I could have done that if I had more than one child," she said.
Now that New York has been dubbed safe again and small-town schoolyard shootings are still fresh in the public's imagination, fewer couples seem to be moving out of town right after the birth of their first child. Then, a few years later, at the time most people decide to have a second child, these couples are loath to move. "New York," said Ms. Walker, who has returned to school to become a psychotherapist, "just gets in your blood."
But unlike Ms. Walker and her husband, who recently left a family business to start an Internet venture, many people simply decide not to have another child. Where members of an earlier generation might have felt guilty or conflicted about that decision, fearing they were depriving their child of sibling companionship, today a large body of research shows that only children do not suffer social or intellectual repercussions.
And a welcome aspect of having an only child in Manhattan is that such families do not stand apart, parents say. Amy Virshup, 40, a journalist who has a year-old son, Nicholas, lives with her husband, an architect, in an Upper West Side building that may stand as a microcosm of Manhattan: among the 24 apartments, there are seven couples with one child. Each of the children is old enough to suggest that the parents are unlikely to be planning more. "The only person who asks me when I'm going to have another kid is my cleaning woman," Ms. Virshup said. "She says I'm lazy."
With so many only children in town, the usual services and activities for infants and toddlers take on a special tinge. Play groups and luncheon clubs that specialize in first-time mothers -- a disproportionate number of the total mothers in the city -- have sprung up everywhere. "When I grew up as an only child, it was awful," recalled the novelist Dani Shapiro, 37, whose son, Jacob, is now 5 months old. "I was the only one in my entire private school class. But I know that if I don't decide to have another baby, Jacob will have lots of kids in his class who are only children. That really makes a huge difference to me."
While the percentage of only children in Manhattan is the highest in the United States, there has been a subtler boom in one-child families across the country. Only children are the nation's fastest-growing family demographic. Three-person families have grown from 10 million in 1972 to more than 15 million today, and between 1980 and 1990, the most recent census, there was a 76 percent increase among women nearing the end of childbearing with one child. That trend, plus the rising number of childless couples (nearly 18 percent), has lowered the United States birthrate to less than two per family. Demographers trace the decline to a rising divorce rate, higher costs to rear and educate children, a rise in the number of working women and a rising age of marriage.
Although choice is not always a factor in the decision to have an only child -- infertility is rising as women delay marriage and childbirth into their 30's -- more people than ever are consciously opting to have just one, experts say, especially in Manhattan. "Here there is a self-selection factor," said Dr. Kathleen Gerson, an N.Y.U. sociologist and the author of "Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career and Motherhood" (University of California, 1985). "They say, 'If staying in New York means having only one kid, I'll do it.' "
Only children may no longer be seen as deprived, but their parents still sometimes come in for criticism for being self-centered or for spoiling their offspring. "We seem to have a generation of Eloises in Manhattan," said Danielle Crittenden, a cultural critic and the author of "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman" (Simon & Schuster, 1999). "Our standards for what we think we need to give our children, in space and in things, is outrageous, absurd. Children are like consumptive items, like a Jaguar. It's very sad."
Dr. Gerson, who has a 16-year-old daughter who is an only child, said she is now interviewing 18- to 30-year-olds for her research, many of whom are themselves only children and "take having only one kid pretty much as a given."
Those decisions may well be influenced by the remarkable turnaround in the attitude of psychologists and child-rearing experts. Until the 1970's, the prevailing wisdom among experts, and society in general, was that having an only child was tantamount to cruelty. This view, shaped by turn-of-the century studies of the pioneering psychologist G. Stanley Hall, held that only children were spoiled and self-centered. "Being an only child," Dr. Hall wrote in 1892, "is a disease in itself." Dr. Hall's influence was profound: surveys throughout the years have shown that the primary reason people cite for having a second child is to make sure their first child isn't maladapted, Dr. Gerson said.
But in the last 20 years, there has been a 180-degree shift. Now, experts say there is virtually no difference between only children and first-born children in self-esteem, generosity, popularity and relations to parents. In fact, many studies show that only children score higher on I.Q. tests and are more popular with peers than children with several other siblings. The psychologist Toni Falbo published a review of 141 studies in 1984 and concluded, "Only children scored significantly better than other groups in achievement motivation and personal adjustment and were in all other respects indistinguishable from children with brothers and sisters."
Scanning volumes on child-rearing in Barnes & Noble, it is virtually impossible to find a condemnation of the choice to raise an only child. A new generation of name-brand experts in child-rearing has emerged, all of whom insist that Dr. Hall's studies had no basis in fact, including Ann Laybourn of the Centre for the Study of the Child and Society at Scotland's Glasgow University and Susan Newman, author of "Parenting an Only Child" (Doubleday, 1990). Last year, the journalist Bill McKibben wrote "Maybe One" (Simon & Schuster, 1998), an ecological defense of only childhood that used a battery of new studies as ammunition.
To cynics, and some parents of more than one child, it may be hard not to wonder if psychology is not merely reflecting changes in the societal landscape. With more women in the work force by choice or necessity, and higher rates of infertility, it may seem all too pat that new research shows that only children are not disadvantaged. "There is no doubt that we have a great ability to mold our ideas of what is good for our children based on what is good for us," Dr. Gerson said.
But that observation cuts both ways. The landscape of childhood has changed strikingly since Dr. Hall's time, and even since the 1960's. In the early part of the century, high child mortality rates and farms that needed extra hands likely influenced Dr. Hall's research showing that only children were a blight on society. Until the 1970's, when birth control burgeoned and women entered the work force significantly, having only one child was virtually never a conscious choice. The stigmatized only child was likely to be at home alone with his mother, a situation that might indeed have contributed to the perception that only children were overindulged.
"The whole obsession with the multi-child suburban family ideal flourished in the 1950's," Dr. Gerson said, "which was the height of the isolated nuclear family."
Now, many only children go to day care, since their mothers are more often employed than mothers with more children. "Children now learn socialization skills from other nonrelated children," Dr. Gerson said.
Mr. Covine, the architect, proudly flaunts a modern, boom-market attitude toward raising an only child. "Maybe a little selfishness isn't so bad," he said. "If it means my daughter goes to Harvard and over achieves, hey, I can live with that."
 
Where Wealth Begets Children
 
IN leafy suburban communities, there is nothing unusual about seeing a woman drive up in a sport utility vehicle with three children in the back. In much of Manhattan, however, such a sight is downright shocking, for a simple demographic reason: women who have more than two children are usually struggling economically. Demographic data analyzed by Queens College sociologists show that affluent parents almost always stick to one or two, if they have children at all.
But there is one neighborhood in which all bets are off: the Upper East Side. Although the actual percentage of women who have three or more children in Manhattan's toniest enclave is small -- only 6 percent (compared with 21 percent in Harlem) -- they are highly visible. That's likely because their resources are breathtaking. In Manhattan, three children can be a potent social signifier.

THE CAPE
 And Other Stories From the Japanese Ghetto.
 By Kenji Nakagami.
 Translated by Eve Zimmerman.
 191 pp. Berkeley, Calif.:
 Stone Bridge Press. Paper, $12.95. 
 When Kenji Nakagami was awarded the Akutagawa Prize in Japan in 1976, it was a commonplace to observe that he was the first writer born after the war to achieve that recognition. It was a more astute critic who noted that Nakagami was likely to be the last such writer to come from a family whose members could scarcely read what he wrote. Nowadays most young people from his background, while often still disadvantaged concerning employment or higher education, are at least literate. Nakagami, who died in 1992 at 46, belonged to a generation of Japan's excluded minority burakumin, in which perhaps only one out of five completed high school. He was one of the lucky ones; among his elders 80 percent or more never got beyond elementary education.
Seventy years before Nakagami's success, a Japanese writer, Toson Shimazaki, inaugurated a new phase in literary realism with "The Broken Commandment," a moving portrayal of the spiritual sufferings and eventual social ostracism of a young burakumin teacher. There had been earlier attempts to tackle the fate of the burakumin in fiction, usually by liberal-minded reformers or Christian authors. After Toson's time, writers might occasionally use the buraku ghetto as the scene for bohemian slumming, or re-create it, particularly after the war, as the setting for political melodrama. There was also Sue Sumii's multivolume saga "The River With No Bridge." Although this story is often moving and does take risks (as in a bitterly comic scene concerning the Emperor and his privy), even burakumin activists on occasion found the heights of sentimentality explored by this left-leaning sympathizer hard to appreciate.
However ambivalent the achievements of the writers who dared to treat this hidden side of Japanese society, through the century establishment critics had almost nothing to say about literature and the ghetto. One short special section in a major literary review in 1956, an article in the 70's and one more in the 80's. The next selection of relevant articles in a major journal finally showed up in 1994. And they are mainly about Kenji Nakagami, the first writer from the ghetto to make it into the mainstream and from within it to attempt to tell other Japanese, however fictively or even fantastically, about life at the rough end of the economic miracle.
The story that won the Akutagawa Prize is "The Cape," finally available in Eve Zimmerman's confident translation. She has combined it with one earlier, related story, "House on Fire," and joined to both one of Nakagami's many erotic (some readers may opt for the term pornographic) tales, "Red Hair." All three were written between 1975 and 1978, at the beginning of the author's most productive decade. Zimmerman's selection is a excellent point of entry into two of the main lines along which his writing would evolve: the family saga of Akiyuki and stories saturated with sexual obsession.
While he exists in outline in "House on Fire," Akiyuki only first steps forward as a focal character in "The Cape," which is novella length. Akiyuki, 24 and a virgin, seems content to vegetate, laboring for his brother-in-law's small contracting outfit. "Construction work suits Akiyuki. All day long he digs and shovels up earth. . . . The sun is hot. The breeze feels pleasant on his sweaty skin. He doesn't think." As the story makes clear, whether he chooses to think about it or not, he is haunted by both an absence and an excess of family. "Here, in such close quarters, they laughed, celebrated, groaned, violating and heaping abuse on one another. Even the ones most hated had a place here. . . . It amazed him. He felt stifled. Oppressed."
His mother, the closest thing this family-despite-itself has to a centripetal force, had three children by a man now dead, became pregnant with Akiyuki by a man she later rejected, then moved in with another man and his son, leaving her first three children to fend for themselves. The most poignant of all the absences suggested by this chaotic genealogy is that of Akiyuki's older half-brother. Driven mad by loneliness, alcohol and drugs, he had turned against his mother and her new family. "Time and time again, his brother had come to the house with a kitchen knife. Sometimes he came with an ax." He hanged himself when Akiyuki was 12 and he himself was 24.
As troubling by his absence from any normal parental role as by his presence, lurking on the periphery of Akiyuki's world, is his biological father: Akiyuki's consciousness can't even accord him a proper name; he remains "that man." "His brother had had a beautiful face, a mix of the father, Uncle Gen, and the mother. But Akiyuki's face belonged to that man. The ugliest face in the world, the crudest face, a face full of evil." This skulking father, redolent of violence and transgression, is sketched out in vivid detail in "House on Fire," where a reader gains some hint of how a gambler and arsonist elbowed his way into what would become Akiyuki's life.
The story's style of narration is even more complex than that of "The Cape." Here too there are strong hints about the catastrophic direction in which Nakagami would propel that man and his son in later, longer texts, like the author's best novel-length work, "Karekinada" (an untranslatable place name, as jagged with consonantal music as the rugged coast of Nakagami's Wakayama Prefecture, glossed by the translator as "Withered Tree Straits"), and eventually "The Sublime Time at the Ends of the Earth," Nakagami's most eloquent failure of a novel.
"Red Hair," many similar short stories and perhaps most of all the longer work "Psalm" seem uncannily to prefigure fin-de-si<heart>cle narcissism about sexuality -- or at least the sort of sex fetishized by academic criticism. "Red Hair," with its relatively simple conjugation of one man with one woman, is a provocative warm-up for the gymnastics of Nakagami's later erotica.
In this strikingly designed paperback, Stone Bridge Press has allowed Zimmerman to back her translations with a preface, an eloquent afterword and a short biographical sketch. There is as well a helpful genealogical chart, an eloquent visualization of this rare author's circuitry of family romance as family despair.

 BODY:

THE PREDICTORS
By Thomas A. Bass
309 pages. Henry Holt. $25.
Readers of an entertaining earlier book by Thomas A. Bass, "The Eudaemonic Pie" (1985), will recall how from 1976 until 1981 a group of California physicists worked to break the banks at Las Vegas by predicting the outcome of the game of roulette. They designed miniature computers that fit inside their shoes, walked into a casino, punched into their computers the Newtonian numbers that govern roulette and started placing winning bets. 
 Well, that was just the beginning of their adventures in forecasting. In his lively new book, "The Predictors," Mr. Bass reports how the two leaders of Eudaemonic Enterprises, Doyne Farmer and Norman Packard, set about finding more complex things to predict than the eventual resting place of a metal ball bouncing around a rotating wheel.
As pioneers in the arcane science of chaos theory, Mr. Farmer and Mr. Packard saw possibilities of exploiting chaos as a predictive tool. What you could do, it had been discovered, was send a probe into a turbulent system, like two gases flowing next to each other, in which coherent patterns called fractals could tell you about the system in its entirety.
And what phenomenon would they model this time out? Not a dripping faucet, a measles epidemic or smoke rising from a cigarette in an ashtray, all of which are potential subjects of chaos theory. No, instead the physicists would study what was in a sense an extension of roulette, the behavior of financial markets, which Mr. Bass, with his vivid introductory description of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, makes seem the very paradigm of turbulence.
By discovering the order within disorder of the markets, nice money could be made, Mr. Bass asserts. "How much money?" he asks. Take an initial $100 million investment, "leverage it by a factor of 5, secure a 30 percent return, collect 25 percent of this as a fee for your services, and pocket a cool $37 million a year in profit." He adds: "This is a nice balance sheet for Year One. After that, real money."
In "The Predictors" Mr. Bass describes how the two chaos theoreticians tried to achieve these results, how they set up shop in Santa Fe, N.M., hired a scruffy band of Ph.D.'s to think and write software for them,how they sought out financial advisers and investors, eventually contracting with the powerful Swiss Bank Corporation (not gnomes of Zurich but behemoths of Basel) and how they went about decoding and modeling the commodities, currency and equities markets.
Mr. Bass has good narrative fun contrasting the loose-jointed working style of the Prediction Company, as it came to be called, with the Masters of the Universe who ended up financing the project. He lavishes some of the richest prose on the scenery surrounding the project's computer-crammed shop and on the local rituals in which the predictors partook, like Fiesta and the burning of Zozobra, also known as Old Man Gloom, a 40-foot puppet erected on a hill nearby.
More edifying, however, is Mr. Bass's use of his narrative to teach readers about chaos theory as it relates to economics, about the increasingly recondite instruments of investment in the age of derivatives and, perhaps most important, about the evolution of financial markets toward automation.
As the Prediction Company approaches success, creating software that models not only all markets but also all the world's stocks, at least the ones traded with some frequency, you wonder increasingly what the effect on those markets will be. Several of the company's employees wondered too, asking if "to make money this way is to be a parasite upon the financial system rather than to serve it," as one person put it. "Furthermore," he added, "it is pretty clear that the only way to make money consistently with such a technique is to keep it secret."
Mr. Packard's answer to these concerns was that "finding predictable structure and trading on it makes the markets more efficient." He continued: "Such trades reduce the overall volatility of the markets, and thus the risk to participants is reduced. The profits that go to the successful predictor are like a fee that the markets pay for the service of making them more efficient and less risky."
Mr. Farmer's response was even more to the point. "Making predictions is fundamental to financial markets," he said. "If people didn't think prices were going to change, they wouldn't trade. Price setting can be rational only insofar as the predictions that drive it are sensible. By making predictions and trading on them, we are indirectly helping society set its goals, even if we're also trying to make a profit."
Did the Prediction Company succeed? Although the answer is a matter of public record, it will not be repeated here, out of respect for Mr. Bass's energetic, serpentine narrative. Whatever the outcome, his story serves as a useful device for describing the increasing abstractness of contemporary finances, where markets derive from markets that in turn derive from derived markets. (Some passages of "The Predictors" read like Greek in their abstruseness, although Mr. Bass rarely uses terminology without coming back to it and defining it further along.)
But certainly you have doubts about the success of the venture, given the recent growing volume of voices arguing that markets are patternless and therefore unpredictable. At one point, the Prediction Company jokingly considered taking as its motto Lux Solis Ex Cucumero, meaning Sunlight From Cucumbers and referring to the academy in "Gulliver's Travels" where the academicians engaged in such an absurd project of extraction have to be protected from falling off cliffs or doing themselves other bodily harm.
Reading "The Predictors," you often feel that the computers Mr. Bass's heroes try to get light from might just as well be cucumbers hidden in their shoes. That they could eventually make money by reading the madness of crowds bidding up the price of tulip bulbs seems equally unlikely, until Mr. Bass gets through explaining in this instructive and amusing book.

 BODY:

Cable and Wireless Denies It's Ready for a Takeover
As the telecommunications industry goes through a whirlwind of merger-and-acquisition activity in the United States and Europe, there is constant speculation that Cable and Wireless of Britain is ripe for a takeover and ready to sell out.
The company's chief executive, Graham Wallace, dismisses that notion. He is trying to shift the company's focus away from its consumer businesses toward its business customers. That has meant selling some operations, including a deal announced yesterday to shed its holdings in Israel's state-controlled phone company for $630 million. Page C4. 

When the Product Is the Plan
The desire to cash out big is not a new motivating force in the technology industry. But what is striking about today's Internet economy is how many entrepreneurs are focused on selling business plans for their own sake rather than planning viable businesses. And the ability to pull cash out of companies quickly and with impunity may soon begin to crumple those Internet businesses that can no longer get money from investors or the public markets. Digital Commerce. C4.
 
Columbia Rejects Nisource Offer
Columbia Energy Group rejected a $6.1 billion takeover bid from the utility Nisource and said it would begin exploring other alternatives, including a merger with another company. The announcement came one week after Nisource sweetened its bid. C2.
 
Bigger Tent Sought for Road Show
The road show, the longtime practice of giving sophisticated investors a preview before an initial public offering, is being challenged by people who say all investors should be allowed to take part in conference calls about important information. In essence, the debate pits an Internet-age drive to give all investors equal access against many companies' desire to conduct private forums with the investors who still dominate the financial markets. C2.
 
Word-of-Mouth Opinions Go on Line
A handful of companies are hoping to take advantage of the age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations by creating independent Web sites that give common folks and bona fide experts a forum to voice their opinions and users a way to rate the pundits. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C16.
 
PC Shipments Up 23% in 3d Quarter
The personal computer industry is continuing to show significant global growth, with third-quarter shipments increasing by 23.2 percent compared with those in the quarter a year earlier, according to a report to be issued today by Dataquest, a market research company. C4.
 
MTV Show to Have Web Players
In the latest attempt to attain true convergence of television and the Internet, MTV plans to start a music-trivia game show in which viewers can play along by logging onto MTV's Web site. The program, "Web Riot," will have its debut late next month, but MTV plans to start promoting it today and to let potential players begin downloading the required software. Media executives -- particularly advertisers -- will be waiting for MTV to prove that the time for convergence has finally arrived. C21.
 
Crichton Makes Box-Office Deal
The author Michael Crichton has made an unusual deal with Paramount Pictures for his newest novel. Instead of collecting millions of dollars by selling the rights to the studio, he has opted to take a sizable percentage of the box-office receipts. Executives said they could not recall a similar deal with a novelist. C6.

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury Chief Meets Chinese Premier

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LANZHOU, China, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, discussed economic issues and China's campaign to enter the World Trade Organization in almost three hours of talks today that Mr. Summers said were "very useful."
The two discussed how China's entry into the trade organization could benefit both countries, Mr. Summers told reporters. He had flown to Lanzhou, an industrial city in northwest China that Mr. Zhu was visiting. 
 "Premier Zhu and I had a very useful, warm and candid discussion on a full range of issues affecting both our economies," the Treasury Secretary said.
China's effort to join the trade organization has been held up by American, European and Canadian demands that it first do more to lower trade barriers to foreign goods and investment. China has said that opening its markets too far too fast would hurt it economically. President Clinton rejected trade concessions offered by Mr. Zhu when he visited the United States in April.
Mr. Summers, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday, is the first Cabinet-level official from the United States to visit China since NATO warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in May, killing three Chinese citizens.

HEADLINE: Unnecessary Reform

BYLINE: By Gerald Posner; Gerald Posner is the author of "Citizen Perot."

 BODY:
Pat Buchanan is expected to bolt the Republican Party today to run for the Reform Party nomination, and Donald Trump said yesterday he too is joining the Reform Party in advance of a possible Presidential bid. But there is likely to be little celebration inside the Reform ranks, because while both men may generate a lot of national attention, they are unlikely to improve the party's diminishing prospects.
There are, of course, many reasons why the Reform Party has lost its bearings. Ross Perot's desire to control its every aspect has discouraged many serious candidates from running. Jesse Ventura, the wrestler turned governor, can talk himself into any amount of trouble. Social issues like abortion continue to divide the party. 
 But there is another important reason the Reform Party has become the butt of so many late-night jokemeisters: the strong economy.
Contrary to what many pundits have said, the Reform Party does have an agenda -- it supports fiscal conservatism and trade protectionism. That's not at all far afield from Mr. Buchanan's fiscal philosophy, nor does it seem to clash with what little we know of Mr. Trump's beliefs.
But if economic synergy has made a match of either Mr. Trump or Mr. Buchanan and the Reform Party, it may also keep the party from duplicating the success of Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election, when he won almost 20 percent of the vote.
Their economic policies just aren't relevant in today's economy.
During the heady days following the 1992 Presidential election, the Reform movement seemed poised to become the first viable independent party in several generations, one that might attract interesting political candidates who were misfits in the two major parties.
Mr. Buchanan also scored his biggest victories in 1992, winning a surprising 37 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary that made him a credible rival to George Bush. He won largely by capitalizing on discontent about the economy. (Likewise, Mr. Trump is now warning of a possible recession, hoping that such uncertainty might play to his strength as a savvy businessman.)
But calls for fiscal conservatism worked much better in 1992, when the economy was in poor shape. Today, the sky-high stock market, low unemployment and cheap interest rates have all taken the steam out of the party's issues.
With the Dow Jones at 10,000, it will take more than the North American Free Trade Agreement to get the average voter fired up. What would benefit the Reform Party -- short of a well-defined platform that addresses important issues like health care reform and Social Security -- is a recession, complete with spiraling inflation and rising unemployment. That might make voters wish for a pox on the houses of both the Republicans and Democrats and start looking in earnest for alternatives.
But the question is, would the Reform Party then turn to Donald Trump or Pat Buchanan? A recession might make the Reform Party seem more attractive to substantive candidates, like Lowell Weicker or Colin Powell, who have broader appeal and more credibility.
At the party's 1996 national convention, one of the delegates told me that it stood for "anyone but the other two guys." That's not enough anymore. Mr. Trump and Mr. Buchanan won't help the Reform Party unless they change their messages to suit the times and stop overplaying dire economic warnings. If they don't, it may cost both of them -- and the party itself -- whatever credibility they may have.

HEADLINE: Forbes Lavishly Champions Austerity

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Oct. 24

 BODY:
Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who is again running for President, brought his anti-tax crusade here this weekend, spending his own money lavishly in order to promote his view that the Government should have less and spend less.
Mr. Forbes, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, came to unveil what he and his staff had promoted as the Forbes New Economy Plan. But the plan was largely based on same views that he has long advocated: shrinking Government, shrinking taxes, shrinking the Federal deficit and increasing individual wealth. 
 He promised that if his conservative economic plan were enacted, the decade ahead would be "dazzling": wages would increase 62 percent, 24.5 million new jobs would be created, and the United States economy would double its current growth rate and expand by 75 percent.
"We want to cut taxes and return the money to the people who earned it," said Mr. Forbes, in his stump campaign speech. Wherever he said it, the line drew loud applause.
At a campaign stop at the Oakledge Country Club in Sunapee, N.H., Steve White agreed: "We're overtaxed. We're unfairly taxed. Taxes are confiscatory. In New Hampshire, we are very fiscally conservative, and we don't like our money to go to the Government."
Mr. Forbes's plan, amplified with additional economic statistics, consists of his basic message, which is that enacting a 17.3 percent flat Federal income tax, replacing Social Security with individual retirement accounts for younger workers and making the Government smaller will bring about a supply-side economic boom.
To get his anti-tax message out, Mr. Forbes is spending heavily here. Forbes television commercials flood the airwaves, direct mail brochures blanket doorsteps, phone banks work constantly and Mr. Forbes is crisscrossing the state in a two-bus caravan filled with sophisticated electronic equipment enabling him to instantaneously transmit campaign events to his Web site.
His campaign pays such close attention to detail that even the pumpkins at his Manchester campaign headquarters were carved with Forbes 2000 logos. Altogether he is spending money at the rate of $3 million a month, according to his campaign manager, William Dal Col.
In spending, Mr. Forbes is running almost neck-and-neck with the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush. Mr. Bush has spent $20 million since January, compared with $19 million by Mr. Forbes, who has a net worth of more than $400 million.
The big difference, however, is that while Mr. Bush's campaign cash comes from donations, the bulk of Mr. Forbes's spending is from his own pocket.
Moreover, Mr. Dal Col said the Forbes campaign anticipates big spending ahead. With 113 people on the Forbes payroll and campaign offices in states as far-flung as Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa and Louisiana, among others, Mr. Dal Col said the campaign has sufficient resources to engage Mr. Bush both on the ground with grass-roots organizations and in the air with television commercials.
Mr. Dal Col said the Forbes campaign will not hesitate to use the same kind of hard-hitting television advertisements against Mr. Bush that Mr. Forbes used against Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner in the 1996 primaries. Those advertisements were criticized by many Republicans for being overly harsh on Mr. Dole and for causing his support to drop in key electoral states.
But Mr. Dal Col maintains that spirited attacks are what campaigns are all about.
The Forbes campaign is broadcasting advertisements in New Hampshire and just finished broadcasting ads in Iowa. These advertisements promoted Mr. Forbes's views on taxes and Social Security.
Yet for all the money Mr. Forbes is spending, he also engaged in traditional meet-and-greet sessions, often laced with humor.
At the Belmont Restaurant in Manchester, Mr. Forbes turned to a table of four men and, on this rainy morning, promised: "If I'm elected, I'll do something about this weather." To 7-year-old Maxwell Lawrence of Manchester, Mr. Forbes added: "And if I'm elected, you won't have homework."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Again Asks Minimum Wage Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
With two economists and the head of New York's largest coalition of labor unions by her side, Hillary Rodham Clinton implicitly attacked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday for not supporting an increase in the Federal minimum wage and suggested that he had not done enough to help the poor in New York.
"Despite the wonderful news about the national economy in general, poverty has gone up here in New York City," she said, in a visit yesterday afternoon to the headquarters of Local 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Flushing, Queens. "Now there are those who have opposed an increase in the minimum wage, arguing that it will cost jobs, and there are some people who say that we need still more studies. Well, they are wrong." 
 In what has become a customary tactic in her exploratory campaign for a United States Senate seat, the First Lady did not mention the Mayor, her likely Republican opponent next year, by name. Instead, she left the direct attack on Mr. Giuliani to Brian McLaughlin, an Assemblyman from Queens who is also president of the New York City Central Labor Council.
Mrs. Clinton listened attentively as two economists for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit group in Albany supported in part by unions, challenged Mr. Giuliani's assertions that raising the base wage could result in jobs being lost and hinder welfare-to-work policies. Then, she quickly launched into her own veiled attack.
Mr. Giuliani, who has repeatedly said he would like to see more studies on the effect of raising the minimum wage, did so again yesterday. Mr. Giuliani also repeated his statement that he expects to come to support the wage increase eventually. "My stand on the minimum wage is that I have asked a study to be conducted to determine the impact it would have on poor people getting jobs," he said.
"If the impact is minimal," the Mayor said, "I'll support it. If the impact is substantial, then I'll try to find ways to ameliorate that, which is what I have done in the past. So I think what I am doing is actually much more caring and much more compassionate and that is not to just look at a poll and be in favor of something." Mr. Giuliani said he had asked the city's Human Resources Administration and the Economic Development Corporation to study the proposed increase in the minimum wage now being considered in Congress, to $6.15 from $5.15, over two years. "I anticipate that I'll eventually support it, but first I have to see what their study shows," he said.
At the union headquarters in Queens, Mrs. Clinton stood by Mr. McLaughlin, a Democrat, as he criticized the Mayor by name, just as she has stood by on other recent occasions as Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and other Democratic elected officials rebuked Mr. Giuliani for his position on the Brooklyn Museum or the Republican Federal tax cut proposal.
"I have often heard that we live in the greatest city on earth," Mr. McLaughlin said, an apparent reference to Mr. Giuliani's habit of calling New York the capital of the world.
"Greatness is measured in how well we treat the less fortunate among us," he said. "And with 25 percent of this city living in poverty, we must strive and can do better."
Mr. Giuliani derided Mrs. Clinton for having no experience as a government official. "This is really the difference between substantive politics and more in the nature of pandering politics," he said. "It's the difference between actually having responsibilities in government and then not having responsibilities in government."

HEADLINE: High-Tech Gets Low Priority in Berkeley

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 22

 BODY:
In the midst of California's latest gold rush, here is a city looking for lead.
As high-tech companies sprout on all sides, this city of 107,000 people is making a concerted effort to preserve its low-tech core. In the process, lost in a Zeitgeist all its own, Berkeley has managed to deter the one industry that most cities are scrambling to attract. 
 Earlier this year, executives at Ask Jeeves, an Internet start-up that has expanded so rapidly it outgrew its offices here, began looking for a new building. The company's preference was to stay in Berkeley but, unable to find a suitable spot, Ask Jeeves moved to Emeryville, a half mile south.
"We wondered if someone from the city would try to contact us," said Curtis Vredenburg, a company executive who led the search for a new site. "But no one did."
Other local high-tech companies do not even bother with Berkeley. When Pixar, the animation studio of "Toy Story" fame, began looking for new space three years ago in anticipation of a growth spurt, Berkeley did not make the short list, in part because of the lengthy permit process. Pixar plans to move next year to Emeryville from Point Richmond, just north of Berkeley, leapfrogging Berkeley in the process.
No one here is surprised. But even those who say that Berkeley has recently grown less hostile to business are exasperated.
"They're stuck in the 60's," Mayor Shirley Dean said of those who stand firm on the city's manufacturing-friendly policies.
As an example, the Mayor pointed to last year's Colgate controversy.
Indeed, if Hollywood were looking for a spot to film an urban bomb scene, it would find a ready-made set in the abandoned Colgate-Palmolive plant, whose 10 acres of buildings have steadily deteriorated since the company left nearly 20 years ago.
Last year, a developer proposed an office complex for the site that would have drawn multiple software, multimedia and biotech firms to the city. But when the city decided that 20 percent of the site must be used for manufacturing, the proposal died.
"It was breathtaking in its stupidity," said Patrick Kennedy, a developer. "Here's the whole Bay Area booming, and what we've done is snub the whole world, basically."
Defenders of the policy say that unless the city preserves its manufacturing base, social and economic diversity will suffer. They argue, too, that the city simply does not have the space to serve as much more than an incubator to high-tech start-ups.
Nathan Landau, a senior planner with the city, credits the policy for a small increase in the number of manufacturing companies over the last decade. He said the issues surrounding manufacturing were widely misunderstood.
"These are parts of the economy that are often different from the university-based economy that a lot of us in Berkeley are used to, and I think it's not always necessarily visible," Mr. Landau said. "But that doesn't mean it's not happening."
The part of the city most mired in dispute, known as West Berkeley, is an eclectic assemblage of manufacturers, warehouses, parking lots and residences, with a smattering of upscale retailers, eateries and offices.
In 1985, when city planners and residents began working on what came to be known as the West Berkeley Plan, which calls for a small number of choice parcels to be set aside for manufacturing, leftists and left-leaning moderates alike were in favor of it. When the City Council approved the plan in 1993, people began to think it might be flawed. Now those same people are sure of it.
"West Berkeley is being held hostage to the sentiment on the part of some activists that the city has to return to the good old days of lunch-pail jobs and blue-collar industry," said Polly Armstrong, a City Council member. "They're a group of people who appear to be waiting for General Motors to come to Berkeley to launch a new Saturn plant."
The stagnation stems from a classic case of Berkeley's most earnest residents getting "lost in their own Berkeleyness," as a longtime Berkeley fixture named Wavy Gravy once described it when running for City Council on a platform of lightening things up. (He lost.)
The feather in the city's hard hat is the biotechnology center of the Bayer Corporation's pharmaceutical division. Bayer, the city's largest manufacturer, is now buying the Colgate site, partly to use for parking.
In stark contrast, Emeryville, a swatch of a place, is the most direct beneficiary of Berkeley's restrictive policies. Thanks to its lenient zoning and speedy permit process, Emeryville has an impressive roster of computer and biotech firms. Ask Jeeves's 300 or so employees, up from 50 a year ago, occupy 50,000 square feet in a building on the site of a defunct Westinghouse plant.
Alameda, another relatively obscure city south of Berkeley, is nurturing a high-tech boomlet of its own. And Mayor Jerry Brown of Oakland, hardly a capitalist tool, is promoting his city as this side of the Bay's newest "high-tech settlement."
And so high-flying Internet companies continue to leave Berkeley when they grow beyond a certain size.
Shortly before Cybergold, another high-tech company, moved from downtown Berkeley to Oakland in July, the chief executive, Nat Goldhaber, got a call from an official in Berkeley's economic development office asking why the company was leaving. Mr. Goldhaber said he needed a building big enough to accommodate substantial growth and wired for Internet access.
"The person from the city said, 'Oh. Have a nice time in Oakland,' " Mr. Goldhaber said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Clinton Whiz Kid Who's Still There and Still a Believer

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GENE SPERLING, director of the National Economic Council, assistant to the President for economic policy and legendary workaholic, was alternating between Diet Coke and coffee at 10 P.M. on Thursday.
He was trying to reflect on his life, but the final negotiations on legislation to overhaul the nation's financial services industry were playing out on Capitol Hill, and Mr. Sperling was in the thick of it. So periodically an assistant would come to the door to announce a phone call from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers or the like, requiring Mr. Sperling to retreat, take the call, return and then try to slip back into cosmic mode. 
 For example, why has he endured, when so many of the other Clinton whiz kids have not?
"When you ask what keeps somebody here, it really is that knowledge that you may never have the opportunity to have this kind of impact again in your life," Mr. Sperling said, somewhat wistfully. "And that you have a chance, at times, to do good things for people who may not have the power to be at the table."
He worried, a moment later, about sounding self-important; in reality, as he reminisced about the economic battles of the Clinton years, he sounded like one of the last true believers. Most of the Clinton believers who made the leap from the campaign are gone -- feeling burned out or betrayed or simply ready for something new. Mr. Sperling is enmeshed in his seventh season of budgetary combat.
His job, previously held by Robert E. Rubin and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, puts him in the center of the Administration's economic agenda; he brings a deeply political background. In addition to his role in last week's banking negotiations, Mr. Sperling is a prime strategist on the Administration's latest Social Security move, to try to shore up the program with projected Federal budget surpluses, and -- not coincidentally -- prevent the Republicans from seizing the political high ground.
Mr. Sperling was out berating the Republican opposition on CNN on Sunday, asserting that they had a "cynical strategy to say that Democrats are spending Social Security surplus when they are."
His sparring partner, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, shot back, "This is typical of this White House, and I'm very sorry that the White House staff is not advising in a different mode."
In President Clinton's first term, Mr. Sperling was deputy director of the National Economic Council, and in the trenches for the budget battles of 1993 and 1995. He was economic policy director for the Clinton campaign in 1992. One of the advantages of his longevity, he says, is his relationship with the President.
"You know where his policy vision and his heart is," Mr. Sperling said. "And he knows you know where his policy vision and his heart is."
Mr. Sperling is 40 now, much better dressed, and no longer carrying the air of a grad student the day after an all-nighter. He has his workaholic tendencies under better control, he suggests: "Definitely have eased up some, but it's still at times too much." In fact, W magazine recently declared the never-married Mr. Sperling "one of the hottest catches on the Washington social scene" and "an unusually likable policy wonk." (This caused no end of amusement at the White House, including a "Dating Game"-style introduction by one of his colleagues in the press briefing room: "He loves tennis, rapid G.D.P. growth and romantic midnight walks on West Executive Drive.")
Mr. Sperling recently betrayed a touch of midlife crisis, going bungee-jumping on a Presidential visit to New Zealand. "It was a personal, conquer-your-fears challenge by a person who's seriously afraid of heights," he said.
BUT Mr. Sperling is still the same passionately political policy wonk that he was in 1988, when he was happily spinning reporters about the virtues of the college loan program proposed by Michael S. Dukakis, then the Democratic nominee for President. When asked about his best moments in the White House, Mr. Sperling tended toward budgets, like the passage of the 1993 agreement, "the sense that after all the campaign battling over the budget, you'd been part of a team that had actually done something significant, in terms of deficit reduction, in terms of the earned income tax credit."
When asked his worst moment, he cited 1995, when the Republicans had just taken over Congress: "The fear that very important protections in Medicaid, the earned income tax credit and food stamps would be undermined on your watch."
One of four children of a lawyer and an educational consultant, Mr. Sperling grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich., went to the University of Minnesota, received his law degree from Yale and attended Wharton Business School. He was one of a generation of young Democrats who came of age during the Reagan years and yearned to bring their party back to power with policies that broadened its appeal, particularly an economic message that could embrace both strong private-sector growth and strong Federal spending on social policy.
As the interview was ending, Mr. Sperling returned to the question about his best moments in the White House. What it came down to, he said, was "that special sense of camaraderie that you feel with certain people, when you have a mission and a cause you believe in." There seemed to be a lot of ghosts in the room, from Robert E. Rubin to George Stephanopoulos. Earlier, Mr. Sperling acknowledged that he missed them.

HEADLINE: Standoff on Budget Yields An Unexpected Dividend

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
For all the political blood shed over President Clinton's spending proposals and efforts by Republicans to cut taxes, the standoff this year over budget policy has led the two parties into a third course, the slashing of the national debt, that could have enormous political and economic consequences.
Such a momentous decision, made almost by default as each side blocked the other's proposals for allocating projected Federal budget surpluses, has ramifications that are sure to eclipse the outcome of the current sparring over financing for education, across-the-board spending cuts and the like. 
 Despite the magnitude of the decision, it was made without an explicit vote or even a full debate in Congress and the country.
Although there were trillions of dollars in projected surpluses on the table in a town that has never had trouble parceling out money, the two sides essentially battled each other to a draw on what to do with that money. There was no big tax cut. There was no big surge in Government spending. There was no expansion of Medicare and no agreement on how to shore up Social Security.
Yet gridlock in this case meant that the surplus was left more or less intact. And because of the way the Government's finances work, running a surplus means that the excess revenues flowing into Washington will automatically go to paying down the debt the nation ran up during decades of deficit spending and doing so at a pace that would have been considered fantasy even a year ago.
Should the Government stick to the course on which it is setting out, it could eliminate the most important component of the debt, the $3.6 trillion in Treasury bonds owned by the public, in 10 or 15 years.
While the approach was never put to a vote or even fully debated in Congress, it yielded an outcome that most economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, consider very positive for the economy over the long run.
Reducing the publicly held debt would put pressure on interest rates to go down and free up capital for private enterprise to use in building factories or developing technologies.
It would reduce the Government's interest expense and increase the Government's capacity to borrow in the future if it needs cash for looming problems like the projected shortfall in Social Security's reserves.
"Buying down debt in large amounts is a truly momentous and entirely salutary decision," said Carol Cox Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. "It is the one thing we can do in the short term to put us in a much better position to deal with the problems we face in the long term."
Debt reduction was basically a fallback position for both parties, embraced in its own right only after President Clinton blocked the Republican effort to cut taxes and Republicans stymied calls by Democrats for higher Government spending.
"Neither party had debt reduction as its priority, but it ended up being the common denominator they could agree on through gridlock," said Van Doorn Ooms, research director for the Committee for Economic Development, a business-financed research group.
Politicians of all stripes quickly found that debt reduction, which they had long considered arcane and difficult to sell to voters as an accomplishment, had a political appeal far greater than they had anticipated.
President Clinton would return to the White House from speeches and tell aides that he had been unexpectedly interrupted by applause when he mentioned debt reduction. At town hall meetings, constituents would tell members of Congress that if a family were to receive a financial windfall, it should go to cleaning up credit card bills, not a new car or a vacation -- and that the Government should have the same attitude.
"It's a metaphor the American people instantly understand," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Still, the support for debt reduction in Washington remains somewhat tenuous, and neither party sees continued gridlock as a long-term strategy, particularly since Washington has only deferred long-term problems like the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
Some conservative Republicans maintain that tax cuts would help the economy more than debt reduction. Some liberal Democrats say higher spending on areas like education and health care would prove the best way to invest the surplus in the nation's future. Should divided government give way to a situation in which one party controlled both the White House and Congress, support for debt reduction might dissipate.
Moreover, changing economic circumstances could lead one or both parties to reassess their commitment to debt reduction as the first fiscal priority.
Should the economy turn down, both parties would probably support some form of tax cut as a stimulus to recovery, and there could also be backing for increased spending, especially on social welfare programs like unemployment insurance and job training.
"Debt reduction isn't everything," said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal policy group. "It happens to be a very good and responsible thing to do at this point in our nation's demographic and economic history, but in other economic times it might not be true."
But given that both Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress have pledged not to spend any of the portion of the surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll tax revenues -- a promise that could bring swift political retribution if broken by either side -- the fiscal debate in coming years seems likely to be biased toward debt reduction.
"The taboo against spending Social Security trust fund surpluses probably will be a continuing reality for some years to come," said Ms. Wait of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The national debt began surging in the early 1980's as Washington began running huge annual deficits, forcing the Treasury to borrow to make up the difference between tax revenues and spending. Debt held by the public went to a peak of $3.77 trillion, or 47.2 percent of the gross domestic product, in 1997, from $710 billion or 26.1 percent in 1980. Surpluses the last two years have allowed the Government to reduce the debt to $3.6 trillion, or about 40 percent of the gross domestic product.
National debt can also be defined to include money the Government owes to itself, primarily in the form of promises to pay future Social Security benefits. By that measure, the debt, now about $5.6 trillion, will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as the population ages and commitments to retirees mount.
More than anything else, it was the political power of Social Security that brought debt reduction to the top of the fiscal agenda.
Mr. Clinton started the process when he called in his 1998 State of the Union address for the surplus to be left untouched until the two parties had agreed on a plan to strengthen Social Security's financial condition before the retirement of the vast baby-boom generation.
His strategy, which proved successful, was to block Republicans on their signature issue by framing the fiscal choice before the country as being between saving Social Security and having a big tax cut. At the time, White House aides said, debt reduction was considered a nice byproduct of the strategy, but not the main goal.
But by early this year, with the size of the projected surpluses growing almost by the month, pressure was growing in both parties to do something with the fiscal windfall. So Mr. Clinton set out a new framework, saying that 63 percent of the total budget surplus over the next 15 years should be used directly or indirectly for Social Security, with the rest going to a variety of other programs, including the military and education.
Late last winter, Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, saw a way to trump the White House. He pointed out that Mr. Clinton's proposal would allow the Government to spend some of the portion of the surplus being generated by Social Security, a practice in which the Government had engaged for decades.
Mr. Domenici put forward a budget framework that allowed Republicans to claim that they would not spend any of the Social Security surplus, which amounts to roughly $2 trillion of the $3 trillion total surplus over the next decade. House Republicans like Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, were reluctant at first, fearing that the plan would limit their ability to press for an immediate tax cut. But they eventually went along with it.
Democrats, particularly in the House, were equally reluctant to sign on to a program of austerity at a time of fiscal plenty. But by early summer, Mr. Clinton had agreed that he too would leave the Social Security surplus untouched, and most Democrats in Congress, not wanting to cede the high ground as protectors of the New Deal social welfare legacy, went along.
The effect was a bipartisan consensus to allocate two-thirds of the total surplus to debt reduction, reached before either party had fully thought through the consequences.
Since then the two parties have been grappling with how to turn their pledge into policy, starting with a budget for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. It is still unclear that the two parties will be completely able to make good on their promise.
Republicans have resorted to all manner of budget gimmicks to pass spending bills that leave the Social Security surplus untouched this year, and are counting on spending cuts that Mr. Clinton has already said are unacceptable to him. Mr. Clinton has proposed a tax increase on cigarettes as an alternative to spending Social Security money, but has little support for the idea in Congress.

America Finds Democracy a Difficult Export

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Among the many effects of democracy's spread through much of the developing world in the last few decades is the birth of a new American industry, democracy promotion. Beginning in the early 1990's, Washington began a wide variety of programs worldwide to help third-world countries democratize, including training election observers, improving parliamentary libraries, cajoling political parties to form coalitions, teaching citizens' groups how to lobby and helping independent newspapers write business plans. Last year the American government spent $719 million on these efforts.
While democracy has given rise to democracy promotion, the reverse is less clear. There has been no systematic effort to find out what programs actually aid democracy. Journalists mainly focus on scandals or feel-good stories of democratic triumph. Groups that do democracy promotion, mainly the Agency for International Development, must wrest funding from a hostile Congress every year and are under pressure to report quick success. Evaluation is also complicated because many factors affect political development -- and few agree on how to measure democracy or even what it is. 
 Thomas Carothers's forthcoming book, "Aiding Democracy Abroad: The Learning Curve," seeks to draw some general conclusions about what works. Mr. Carothers, now vice president for global policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, has worked in democracy programs in various countries. His book is a clear-eyed examination of attempts to reform legislatures, courts and political parties, and new efforts to promote democracy from the bottom up by helping local governments and civil society. He focuses on how these programs have worked in Romania, Guatemala, Zambia and Nepal.
Mr. Carothers's conclusion is that democracy promotion cannot make the difference. No American democracy consultant can affect the underlying conditions of a country that really determine its democratic progress -- concentrations of power and wealth, political traditions, the expectations of citizens.
But the right programs over the long term, he says, can do much in countries where a government genuinely wants democracy but lacks expertise -- nations such as South Africa, Slovakia or Chile. In dictatorships, aid to the besieged opposition can keep hope alive. But in nations that enjoyed some democratic progress but fell into strongman rule -- such as Peru, Haiti, Cambodia, Kazakhstan or Zambia -- classic democracy promotion efforts to reform government institutions have been thwarted by leaders who have little interest in sharing power.
Few veterans of the business would dispute these fairly straightforward conclusions. The democracy promoters at A.I.D., and at the political-party-run National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, are learning from their early mistakes. Hubris was one of them. Being American was once deemed synonymous with possessing expertise in democracy, and many consultants were campaign aides or Congressional staff people who knew little about the countries they visited.
Democracy promoters are also changing their earlier tendency to dictate pre-cooked solutions that do not fit reality. And even when Americans came in with good ideas, the lack of local input often kept them from being embraced and sustained.
A more persistent problem is the tendency to emphasize form over substance. Democracy programs have largely helped foreign countries replicate certain practices -- congressional hearings, for example. Today, Mr. Carothers believes, activists are beginning to see that these forms of democracy are easily manipulated by autocratic leaders, and that governments reform only when they want to. In Guatemala, he writes, a 10-year American effort to train the police did not limit police abuses. What did work was the election of new leaders who pressed the security forces to reduce brutality.
Today, Mr. Carothers writes, democracy promoters try to be more attuned to the political realities of the countries they work in. This understanding has not yet meant the abandonment of unrealistic efforts to work with authoritarian governments. But where governments resist reform, American consultants now try to strengthen democratic forces by boosting grass-roots groups, local governments and women's organizations. Americans increasingly stay for months or years of intensive work rather than a few days. In many places American organizations use regional experts, sending Filipinos to Indonesia or Poles to Bulgaria -- people who are often better received and know more about local realities.
What critics of democracy promotion often overlook is that the industry's mistakes have exactly mirrored the problems that bedevil American foreign policy in general, including hubris and the tendency to confuse surface reforms with deep-seated change. Democracy activists, moreover, seem to have learned more rapidly from their mistakes. Some in the Pentagon still believe that foreign officers will become less abusive if they rub elbows with the American citizen-soldier, and many in the administration and Congress argue that Myanmar's or China's dictatorships will soften if exposed to American business practices.
Few democracy activists today, by contrast, are naive enough to think that a tour of America will instill democratic values. The industry has carried out its share of useless programs. But it is learning -- and faster than its Congressional critics, who still fail to realize that building democracy in many developing nations is both crucial to American interests and resistant to instant solutions.

HEADLINE: Polytechnic U. Plans a Makeover Using Gift, but Not Everyone Is Happy

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
When we last left the Cinderella tale of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, it was celebrating a bequest of $175 million from one of its former chemistry professors and his wife and grappling with the pleasant problem of how to spend it.
Polytechnic officials have developed a plan to use the gift not only to strengthen the university's technical programs, but also to serve students who are less technically oriented. The university will create a joint degree program with small liberal arts colleges, a bachelor of science degree in liberal studies and more education programs for executives. 
 But while the plan has drawn plaudits from many professors, students and others with knowledge of its details, which are to be formally released today, it has displeased Long Island's high-technology industries because it will mean shutting the university's undergraduate program in Farmingdale, which has about 375 students. The graduate program will remain there.
"Poly is a key economic resource for the region, and its closure is going to be a problem," said Ken Aupperle, president of Hauppauge Digital Inc., in Hauppauge, Suffolk County, and a member of the Farmingdale campus's advisory board.
Polytechnic officials said upgrading both campuses would be too expensive. "We can't afford to invest in two world-class facilities at once," said David C. Chang, Polytechnic's president.
The $175 million windfall is Polytechnic's share of a $340 million gift to five Brooklyn institutions from the estate of Donald Othmer, a Polytechnic professor who died in 1995, and his wife, Mildred, who died in April 1998. The couple, who lived in Brooklyn Heights, amassed enormous wealth by investing with Warren E. Buffett, a fellow Omaha native who is one of the world's richest men.
Polytechnic officials hope to turn their commuter university, which has 1,700 undergraduates and 1,600 graduate students, into a more nationally prominent institution by overhauling its curriculum and offering housing at its main site at the Metrotech Center in Downtown Brooklyn.
The plan calls for $100 million in construction and renovation, including a new five-story academic building and athletic center and a 400-bed dormitory at Metrotech. Polytechnic will also overhaul its main academic building, Rogers Hall.
The work will be financed partly by the $175 million gift and partly by $100 million being raised in the university's capital campaign. The university also plans to use $25 million to endow research through the creation of the Othmer Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies.
Dr. Chang said the university will also use the gift to extend its reach to students beyond its traditional base. "We want to educate students outside of traditional engineers and computer scientists," he said.
The university, he said, will form an alliance with small liberal arts colleges in the New York region to offer a new five-year joint degree program to their students. The students will take some computer programming and other technical courses in their junior and senior years and then spend a year at Polytechnic to earn master's degrees in computer science. The alliance will include Marymount College in Manhattan, St. Francis and St. Joseph's Colleges in Brooklyn, Manhattanville in Purchase, N.Y., and Marymount in Tarrytown, N.Y.
Dr. Chang said Polytechnic also hopes to play "a more pro-active role in economic development and creating jobs" through incubators for nurturing high-technology start-up companies and more active commercialization of its research.
But some critics have said that closing the undergraduate campus in Farmingdale, in Nassau County, is at odds with that goal. Mr. Aupperle of Hauppauge Digital said that the Farmingdale campus has been a steady supplier of rigorously trained computer professionals in a region that cannot find enough of them.
A graduate of the Farmingdale campus, he said he hires three or four engineers a year, one or two from the Long Island campus, and also hires several interns each summer. "I'm not pleased," he said.
Some faculty members on Long Island have expressed concern about their future. Although tenured faculty members will be guaranteed spots in Brooklyn if they want them, nontenured faculty and staff members may not be offered transfers. Those positions will depend on the needs at the Brooklyn and Farmingdale campuses, university officials said.
Polytechnic plans to expand the less-technical master's degree programs at its satellite campuses in Hawthorne, in Westchester County, and on Wall Street. Despite the phasing out of the undergraduate program on Long Island, Polytechnic officials say they hope to expand the graduate program there, and plan to set up a task force to determine the future of the 25-acre campus.
Dr. Chang contends that the university must focus its efforts and cannot afford to upgrade the Farmingdale campus the way it plans to improve its Metrotech campus. He said he hopes to increase the number of Long Island students the university serves by attracting more to the Brooklyn campus.
Polytechnic has told the undergraduate students at Farmingdale that it will keep the campus open until they graduate, but that they may also transfer to Brooklyn and would be given priority for the new dormitory. But some students said they were skeptical about how that would work out.
"They are really turning people's lives upside down," said Wayne Schmidt, a sophomore from Richmond Hills, Queens. He said the Brooklyn campus is far from the high-technology companies on Long Island, has no grassy place to play ball, and is not as safe.
"I could put a $50 bill on a cafeteria table in Farmingdale, and it would still be there 24 hours later," he said. "If I put a $50 bill on a bench in the commons in Brooklyn, there is a question about whether it would be there 10 minutes later."

The PC Industry Shows Strong Growth

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The personal computer industry is continuing to show significant global growth, with third-quarter shipments of machines increasing by 23.2 percent over the comparable quarter last year, according to a Dataquest report to be issued on Monday.
Dataquest, a market research company based in San Jose, Calif., cited strong growth in all regions of the world and lower prices as the foundation of the continued surge in computer shipments, which totaled 28.5 million in the quarter. 
 Compaq Computer remained the world's largest PC maker with a 12.8 percent market share, although that figure was down from 13.4 percent last year. Compaq shipped 3.65 million computers during the quarter, according to Dataquest.
In contrast Dell Computer, the No. 2 PC company, whose sales have grown along with the rise of Internet commerce, expanded its market share from 8.2 percent to 10.8 percent, shipping 3.07 million computers during the quarter.
Behind the two leaders were three other computer makers based in the United States: I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Gateway. Dataquest analysts said that companies like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M., which have typically sold to customers indirectly, had experienced slower growth than those like Dell specializing in direct sales over the Internet.
Despite Compaq's global leadership position, it dropped behind Dell in sales of machines within the United States. That was a milestone for Dell, according to Dataquest.
For the third quarter, Dell's domestic market share rose to 17.1 percent, up from 13.4 percent a year earlier -- a growth rate of 56.5 percent. Compaq's domestic shipments, meanwhile, rose only 24.9 percent, as its United States market share edged up to 15.3 percent, from 15 percent a year earlier.
Meanwhile, I.B.M.'s overall market share sank to 7.6 percent, from 8.4 percent in last year's third quarter. Last week, the company announced that it was exiting the retail market and in the future would sell its personal computers via the Internet.
Dataquest said that the quarter was unusual because of the rise of computer memory prices, a trend whose impact had been felt most directly by Dell, but also by many of the other computer makers, in terms of lower profits margins.
Dataquest said that Gateway's new partnership with America Online, announced last week, was an example of a shift to a "next-generation PC economic model," which would shift the emphasis in competition beyond high inventory turnover.

You've Got Mail, Indeed

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE "check" is in the mail. So too are the "important national survey," the "Priority Express Gram" and other "time-sensitive material" that is "personal and confidential" as well as "extremely urgent."
At a time when the phrase "You've got mail" evokes images of virtual correspondence, the old-fashioned, ink-and-paper counterpart -- replete with the plethora of puffery quoted above -- is alive and well as marketers keep waging war on consumers' mailboxes. 
 The barrage of letters, catalogues and brochures that typifies the advertising medium known as direct mail continues unabated, peddling everything from magazines and computers to apparel and political candidates. Alive and well? That's an understatement -- and something you rarely find in direct mail.
In fact, direct mail, still widely dismissed with the sobriquet "junk mail," is proliferating faster than it did before the Internet, climbing to 44 percent of all pieces of mail handled last year by the post office from 41 percent a decade ago and 32 percent in 1978.
"It's becoming an information-loaded world and there's a minimal amount of attention span," said Barbara Weckstein Kaplowitz, editor of The DeLay Letter in Potomac, Md., which covers the direct marketing industry. "But direct mail is still working for many marketers."
According to the Direct Marketing Association, the industry's trade organization, direct mail generated $421.2 million in sales last year, an increase of 8 percent from $390 million in 1997 -- and a gain of 62 percent from $260.2 million as recently as 1992. The average compound annual growth rate of direct mail, at 8.4 percent from 1992 through 1997, is projected to accelerate to 8.6 percent from 1997 through 2002.
"If direct mailers go back to people who asked two years ago to be removed from their lists and say, 'We have something new; would you like to hear about it?' those are the best responders," Ms. Kaplowitz said. "They realize they miss it."
Most consumers, weary of the battle of the bulging mailbox -- and disgusted with materials they deem misleading from companies trying to sell magazine subscriptions -- might say they'd miss getting direct mail the way they'd miss getting bills.
"Don't get me started," warned Bob Bulmash, president of Private Citizen Inc., in Naperville, Ill., an organization that fights what he considers the considerable excesses of direct mailers and telemarketers.
"Junk mail is not going to slow down," Mr. Bulmash asserted. "As long as a marketing channel is there, it will continue to be abused."
Those in the industry would take issue with that castigation. Direct mail was once "pretty intrusive," acknowledged Howard Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft Worldwide in Chicago, the world's largest direct marketing agency. "But now we're trying to understand what a consumer's needs are and create an invitational approach."
His agency, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, creates direct marketing campaigns for advertisers like American Express, Compaq Computer, G.M. and Sprint.
"More and more, direct mail seeks to communicate with consumers who have bought a product in the first place," Mr. Draft said, "to build loyalty to encourage future purchases." That approach, meant to keep the most profitable customers and minimize or even shed the less lucrative ones, is a departure from the industry's onetime ploy of blanketing consumers with mail.
"The notion of mass mailings, which used to be the rule, has become the exception," said Ian Baer, recently named president of the Chicago office of Rapp Collins Worldwide, the agency owned by Omnicom Group that handles direct marketing assignments for a client roster that includes the on-line retail operations of Barnes & Noble, Pfizer, the United States Navy and Western Union.
"Americans receive more unsolicited mail than any other people in the world," Mr. Baer said. "They're jaded. They lack the time and patience and inclination to go through mail they didn't ask for.
"So to get them to open a piece of mail, we have to take our efforts to a whole new level of relevancy," he added, "because with all the clutter, people will focus only on what they consider most relevant to them."
To make direct mail more relevant -- and thus more effective -- advertisers and agencies are intensifying their efforts to customize the pitches they send consumers. The aim: to deliver pleas as personalized and tailored as possible to appeal to the intended recipients and minimize the anger generated by receiving unwanted, unneeded communication.
That is, obviously, also the goal of Internet marketing, which many experts describe as an updated, high-technology version of direct mail.
"The common phrase we're hearing is that the Internet is 'direct marketing on steroids,' " said H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association, which is based in New York.
"The Internet allows targeting in a more efficient way," he added, "but ink on paper still provides a sensory experience and still does a good job."
"The secret is to build a relationship by providing people with relevant information," said Mr. Wientzen, who is in Toronto this week at the association's 82d annual conference, which 15,000 people are expected to attend. "The fact we're growing at more than twice the rate of retail sales says the consumer appreciates the efficiency and convenience of shopping at a distance."
The computer technology that makes the Internet possible is also helping direct marketers in their quest for the grail of relevancy by making it easier than ever to compile extensive information about consumers before any mail is sent.
" 'Data mining' is the term -- collecting, over time, information that allows you to figure out what people want and like and do," Mr. Wientzen said. "Our path in the information age is finding the ability to market to niches, which was never economically feasible before."
The data miners gather their information from the consumers themselves, poring over records of what was already bought and ordered: how recently, how frequently, how much was spent.
"Watch what happens when you can accurately match an E-mail address to a street address," said Ms. Kaplowitz, the newsletter editor. "They'll know not only how you act in the mail but how you act on line."
And direct mailers comb through data from outside sources like mailing lists, postal records, government agencies and other businesses.
"All we're doing is using information we have on our customers, with overlays of demographic or psychographic information, to enhance our knowledge of them and market back to them," said Mr. Draft of Draft Worldwide.
"The data bases are being used to target customers who really have a need for a product," he added. "What brings results today is the unique selling proposition you're making to make the consumer want this product."
Mr. Baer at Rapp Collins offered an example for a client, Western Union, which differentiates campaigns aimed at Spanish-speaking customers based on their countries of origin.
"Dominican-Americans are more established, often second-generation, sending money to relatives back home," Mr. Baer said, "while Colombian-Americans are more likely to be first-generation, sending money back to their families and then going back themselves."
But privacy advocates complain that data mining is more insidious, the marketing equivalent of strip mining.
"You have to fight back," Mr. Bulmash of Private Citizen said, offering these tactics: "Keep your name and phone number off all documents, as best you can. Don't fill out sweepstakes cards. Don't subscribe to magazines; buy them on the newsstand. Don't list your address in the phone book."
Consumers seeking to have their names removed from mailing lists can do so by sending their names, home addresses and signatures to: Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735-9008. (Yes, you must use the mail to reduce the mail; about 3.4 million people have registered to date.)
The association, sensitive to the rising tide of complaints, has strengthened its privacy policies, with stipulations called the Privacy Promise to American Consumers taking effect July 1.
"Like all industries, we do have shady operators who push the line too far," said Mr. Weintzen, adding: "We don't want to lose the trust of the American people. If people don't like what you do, they don't buy from you."
The new policies did not impress Mr. Bulmash, who dismissed them as toothless because they involve the industry regulating itself.
"My dog says, 'I'll be good,' but he's not going to hit himself with a stick if he's bad," Mr. Bulmash said. "You've got to teach him to be good."
Other protests come from the advertising research industry, which is furious about a venerable direct mail gimmick: cloaking a pitch as a survey, pretending that the purpose of a letter is to seek opinions rather than sell a product or raise funds.
"It's a sham, it's dishonest and it does the survey-research business a tremendous disservice," said Jim Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation in New York. "Refusals to participate in legitimate surveys have been rising slowly and this certainly is a part of it."
"What drives me crazy is sometimes these are organizations I'm a member of and believe in," he added, referring to the fundraisers that sell under the guise of research. The foundation even has a name for such trickery, "frugging"; there's also "sugging," for selling under the guise of research.
There's one consolation for consumers tired of make-believe surveys, envelopes festooned with star bursts and addressed with simulated handwriting and letters with underlined sentences and a "P.S." at the end that looks to be an afterthought but isn't. Those gimmicks are likely to begin fading away.
"Every time we put material out there, that's the client's brand in the home," said Mr. Draft of Draft Worldwide. "You will not see the kind of clients we work with allow us to negatively affect the work they're doing in their general brand advertising.
"Star bursts, underlining, the 'P.S.' -- those don't affect results that much," he added. "If you come up with the big idea, the big offer, that's what drives business."

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about the proliferation of direct mail, misstated the figures for sales generated by it. They totaled $421.2 billion in 1998, not $421.2 million -- as compared with $390 billion in 1997, not $390 million.

Chart: "An Exegesis of Excess"
Marketers are using increasingly sophisticated direct-mail techniques in hopes of luring a curious consumer to open the envelope. Here are a few sample approaches.
 
Laser printers equipped with special signature fonts can address envelopes to look hand written. Words may be deliberately crossed out or misspelled to accentuate the fake human touch. In this instance, the mailer is also simulating an express envelope; note the word "Urgent" not once by five times across the top.
 
Consumers are asked to opine on subjects of interest to organizations or political candidates. But such "surveys" are typically used for soliciting contributions or selling products.
 
Years ago, direct mail might simulate air mail when that was the fastest way mail could travel. Now, express mail and next-day delivery provide a new genre to imitate. Rarely are these make believe "express" envelopes ever sent express mail -- it's too expensive. (pg. C23)

Direct mail volume has soared over the last 20 years and now accounts for more than 4 out of every 10 pieces of mail.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Africa: Unfulfilled Promises and Skepticism

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 24

 BODY:
As Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited six African nations last week, her twin goals seemed to be to reassure Africans that the United States was still interested in the continent's affairs and to persuade Congress that Africa mattered.
Using the backdrops of Sierra Leone, where a peace agreement just halted a brutal eight-year civil war, and of Nigeria, which recently emerged from nearly 16 years of military rule, Dr. Albright pledged to assist them with significant increases in aid. Inserting the two West African countries into the ongoing budget fight in Washington, she castigated Congress for wanting to cut President Clinton's $14.6 billion foreign aid request by more than $2 billion. 
 After a trip to Kano in northern Nigeria -- where city officials closed off streets for her visit but were unable to clear the sides of the usual mounds of garbage and refuse-chomping goats -- Dr. Albright said:
"They find it pretty hard to understand that we're going around saying we have the world's greatest economy, and that we have a huge budget surplus, and they are there digging themselves out of garbage."
The message conveyed by the Secretary, who returned to Washington on Sunday, underscored the unfulfilled promises of Mr. Clinton's historic visit to Africa in March 1998.
During that trip, the longest ever to Africa by an American President and the first in two decades, Mr. Clinton talked of a "new African renaissance" and a relationship rooted in partnership, not cold war paternalism. "The United States is ready to help you," he said at the time, promising a new approach to Africa.
Despite the President's emphasis on trade, Congress has yet to pass the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which would grant certain African governments greater access to the American market. Although Mr. Clinton called for direct aid to Africa to reach the highs of the cold war, development assistance has continued to decline, to the current level of about $700 million, down from about $870 million seven years ago.
Although he spoke of democracy, critics of Washington's Africa policy say the United States has not done enough to help resolve the many conflicts that have erupted or expanded in Africa since the President's visit -- at the same time that Washington and the West quickly poured billions into Kosovo and East Timor.
And so during Dr. Albright's first visit to Africa since the President's trip, there was skepticism among many ordinary Africans, in sharp contrast with the exuberance heard during Mr. Clinton's tour.
At an AIDS awareness event attended by Dr. Albright here, a participant, Stephen Otiemo, 29, said he had followed Mr. Clinton's 12-day tour very closely on the radio. "We heard him make many promises," Mr. Otiemo said, "but we have not seen much so far. But perhaps we had been hoping for too much. We cannot be angry because we cannot force somebody to do what he does not want to do."
"But somehow we are also angry because we have suffered for the United States," he said, mentioning the August 1998 bombing of the American Embassy here, in which more than 200 Kenyans were killed along with 12 Americans.
Another spectator, Peter Lasu Ladu, 32, a Christian refugee from southern Sudan, asked why Washington was willing to intervene so decisively in Kosovo, but not in his native country's civil war, where almost 2 million people are believed to have been killed in the last 16 years.
"He made a lot of promises," Mr. Ladu said. "But to talk of something and to implement something is different."
Even as Dr. Albright promised $55 million to Sierra Leone and a threefold to fourfold rise in Nigeria's current $27 million aid -- both will require Congressional approval -- she argued that the fulfillment of Mr. Clinton's promises had been blocked by a Republican-controlled Congress.
In line with other senior Administration officials, she blamed isolationism for their resistance. Republicans counter that they are not isolationist, but out to protect America's best interests. They and other critics also say the Clinton White House has failed to bargain with Congress to secure foreign policy goals.
Critics of Washington's policy toward Africa say the Administration shares the blame for what they describe as inattention toward the continent.
"The Administration hasn't made a particularly aggressive case on Africa specifically," said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The Administration has raised Africa's profile and followed through on some issues, including increased training for African peacekeeping forces and pushing for debt relief, Mr. Booker said. But he added: "The real problem is that without a serious commitment of resources, the American Government can only talk. Talking is important, but U.S. credibility in Africa will be eroded if the Administration can't put money and human resources, too, where its mouth is."
Dr. Albright's tour -- which included Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya -- was clearly intended to regain the momentum on Africa. Asked to assess American relations with Africa since the President's trip, the Secretary said: "I believe that our Administration has spent more time, attention and money on Africa than any previous Administration. The fact that we haven't accomplished everything we want is unfortunate, but it isn't over."
The sober words were a long way from what Mr. Clinton told half a million ebullient Ghanaians only 19 months ago: "My dream for this trip is that together we might do the things so that 100 years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say this was the beginning of a new African renaissance."
The change in tone reflects how much Africa, and Washington's view of it, have changed in those 19 months. During Mr. Clinton's visit, the Administration's darlings were a so-called new generation of leaders, pragmatic and competent men who would lead Africa to its renaissance. But the four men most often regarded as this generation's standard-bearers have all become embroiled in war since the Presidential visit.
Yoweri K. Museveni, the President of Uganda, and Paul Kagame, the leader of Rwanda, backed a rebellion against the Government of Congo and President Laurent Kabila, their former protege. Ugandan and Rwanda troops even clashed briefly in the Congolese city of Kisangani recently. Also, Meles Zenawi, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, and Issaias Afwerki, the Eritrean leader, started a border war that has claimed tens of thousands of soldiers.
In 1998, Mr. Clinton's plane pointedly flew over Nigeria, the African giant and its most populous nation, to protest the repressive Government of Gen. Sani Abacha. Since then, however, General Abacha's unexpected death unleashed a sweeping political transformation that resulted in the inauguration of the first civilian Government in Nigeria in nearly 16 years.
During Dr. Albright's stop last week in Nigeria, she heaped praise on President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is due to visit Washington this week. There was no talk of a new generation of leaders; Mr. Obasanjo, after all, was Nigeria's military ruler in the late 1970's. But Dr. Albright described Nigeria as a potential "regional partner" for the United States in Africa.
"Nigeria's success in meeting the challenges of democracy will be a welcome inspiration across Africa," she said in her keynote speech of the trip and one of her most upbeat comments. "For our part, the United States will continue to be a strong supporter of democratic forces across the continent."

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's visit to Africa described criticism of American policy by some Africans who believe that while President Clinton has spoken of democracy in Africa, the United States has not done enough to help resolve the many conflicts that have erupted or expanded on the continent since he visited last year.
The article said critics contrasted Africa with Kosovo and East Timor, into which Washington and the West have since "poured billions." The article should have drawn a distinction between participation in peacekeeping forces and direct military intervention, on the one hand, and foreign aid on the other. Washington's foreign aid to Kosovo and East Timor has not amounted to billions.

HEADLINE: Canada's Link to the Queen Grows Livelier

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
In 1942, with Japanese troops occupying Hong Kong, a well-dressed Chinese family stood quietly on a dock waiting to board a ship for evacuation to Canada, a country then legally closed to Chinese immigration. A colonial inspector skeptically eyed the family, including 3-year-old Adrienne Poy, and then announced loudly that they did not look like Canadians to him.
"They were first turned away, because they were Chinese," Prime Minister Jean Chretien recounted in early October in a speech broadcast nationwide from Canada's gilded Senate chamber. Behind him, on a throne of scarlet velour and Canadian oak, sat Adrienne, now 60 and about to become Governor General, the personal representative of Queen Elizabeth II to Canada. 
 The fairy-tale rise of Adrienne Clarkson from wartime refugee to the nation's first immigrant Governor General has captivated Canada, created an uproar, and pumped fresh blood into monarchism in the country. This new attention to the monarchy comes as Australia, which Canada often uses as a benchmark, prepares to vote Nov. 6 in a referendum on whether to break with the British crown and become a republic.
Traditionally, Canada's Prime Minister has appointed a bland retired politician as Governor General. Although largely ceremonial, the post does carry the authority to dismiss the Prime Minister in time of crisis, a confrontation that has not occurred since 1926.
But with Madame Clarkson, as she likes to be addressed, Canadians suddenly have a media savvy woman with intellectual gravitas -- a skilled communicator familiar to virtually every household from Newfoundland to British Columbia. From 1963 until a few months ago, generations of Canadians grew up watching Adrienne Clarkson on public television -- book reviewer, investigative reporter, foreign correspondent and cultural program hostess.
She became such a television icon that one comedian lampooned her familiar introduction line, announcing imperiously, "I'm Adrienne Clarkson -- and you're not."
"Everyone knows Adrienne Clarkson; she's been on TV, for the CBC, for years," said David Giles, a cell phone repairman here. "She's something new and exciting and fresh. The others were old and stodgy."
The first Asian to become the Queen's representative here, she has also attracted some thinly veiled racist thunderbolts.
"This appointment degrades Her Majesty, the office of Governor General and Canada as a whole," Kenneth Lieblich, a leader of the Monarchist League of Canada, wrote to a newspaper from the Vancouver area, a region with a population that is 20 percent Chinese.
Of a woman who has written three novels, headed the nation's largest publishing company, served for five years as a diplomat in Paris, been host on an estimated 3,500 public television shows, and most recently headed the Canadian Museum of Civilization, he said, "Her qualifications are mediocre at best, and her loyalty to the crown is unknown and untested."
Others complained that she and her husband, John Ralston Saul, were leftists opposed to free trade with the United States and devoted to affirmative action for women.
"Ms. Clarkson emerged as a spokesperson for cultural and economic nationalism and the left in general," The National Post said in an editorial titled "A Governor General for half the country."
Two days later, this conservative newspaper went after her husband, a 52-year-old author and philosopher. "Like so many left-wing intellectuals, Mr. Ralston Saul appears to see the world from a book-lined cave without windows," an editorialist wrote. "The shadows that dance on his cranial wall are not Plato's imperfect representations of 'ideal' reality, but projections of capitalist ghosts and goblins."
Then reporters rummaged through the couple's personal life, discovering that after 15 years of living together they hastily married this summer after learning that she was in the running to become the Queen's representative. Digging further, they found that she feuded with her Toronto neighbors and was so estranged from her two adult daughters that she did not list them in her official biographies.
"She's been given a scandalous, rocky ride in the press," complained Margaret Atwood, the novelist and a friend. "She has had some press that I would consider basically sexist and racist."
But somewhere between the Sept. 8 appointment and the Oct. 7 installation, Canadians began to be fascinated by their Governor General designate.
"O.K., let's recap," a reader said in a letter to The Globe and Mail last week. "She has an ex-spouse who doesn't want to talk about her, daughters who are uninterested in her achievements and seem to prefer their stepmother. She fights with her neighbors and she gets married to keep up appearances with the Queen. It looks as if the Prime Minister has chosen a perfect royal representative!"
By the time the new Governor General walked into Parliament past the clicking heels of the Princess Patricia's Light Infantry last week, The National Post published a poll showed that 83 percent of adults surveyed called her appointment "good" or "very good."
In contrast, only one-quarter could identify her predecessor, Romeo LeBlanc, a former member of Parliament for the governing Liberal Party.
In the Senate chamber, as she alternated smoothly between British-accented English and Parisian-accented French, her words did not always match the velvet and ermine decor.
"We did not arrive as part of a regular immigration procedure," she said, looking fondly at her 92-year-old father, seated in a place of honor. Recalling how the family won a waiver to a Canadian law barring Chinese immigrants, she added, "There was no such thing for a Chinese family at that time in Canadian history."
Recalling her family's move to Canada's capital in 1942, she said, "The city of Ottawa, then, was small and white -- like most of Canada."
She was eager to learn French, she recalled, but was barred from enrolling at a local public French school because she was Protestant and the school was controlled by Catholics. Her journey to become a Canadian was eased by a series of Ontario public school teachers, she said, "who treated me only as bright -- not bright yellow."
The speech soon evolved into an eloquent ode to "the Canadian dream," peppered with citations from a dozen Canadian writers, ranging from Samuel de Champlain, the 17th-century French explorer, to Leonard Cohen, the contemporary songwriter.
"We must not see ourselves as a small country of 30 million people, floundering in a large land mass," she said, lecturing Canadians about their frequent lack of national pride and self-confidence. "We are among the healthiest, best-educated people in the world, with great natural riches."
The smoke from a 21-gun artillery salute was still in the air and the new Governor General's horse-drawn landau was clip-clopping from Parliament Hill to Rideau Hall when Canadian reporters started to rave about someone they usually ignore: the representative of the Queen.
At the 79-acre estate, the Governor General was greeted by aides addressing her as "Your Excellency." In an interview in a high-ceilinged drawing room of the 1838 viceregal palace, she serenely dismissed the press uproar of last month.
Wearing her new, nonpartisan, representative-of-the-Queen hat, the former television interviewer deftly ducked controversial subjects like Canada's detention this summer of about 600 immigrants who arrived without passports in boats from China.
But according to a friend, she was secretly pleased by one newspaper cartoon last month. In the cartoon, a Mountie sternly looked down at a huddled boatload of illegal Chinese immigrants, then warned a fellow Mountie to be careful because "one of them could be a future Governor General."
According to the complaint in a wrongful-death suit filed by Mrs. Lum against Carnival in Federal District Court in Miami, on the second night Mr. Lum complained that he was not feeling well. He vomited and spent the next day resting in the cabin. His wife, meanwhile, heard other passengers discussing people falling ill with diarrhea and vomiting.
At 1:30 A.M. on the third day, Mrs. Lum said in an interview, she woke when her husband collapsed outside the cabin's bathroom. She said she called the ship's infirmary but the nurse tried to discourage her from bringing him there because it was so late. Mrs. Lum said she insisted, and her husband was put on an intravenous solution to avoid dehydration.
After a time, the nurse took Mr. Lum's blood pressure and said he was improving and could return to his cabin. Tired but relieved, Mrs. Lum hurried to the cabin to get towels and a change of clothes, because her husband had soiled his pants.
"My daughter and niece were awake, and I told them he was fine and would be coming back," Mrs. Lum said. "I was gone about five minutes, and when I got back to the infirmary the doctor and nurse asked me to wait in the waiting room."
Sobbing briefly, Mrs. Lum said she waited for several minutes, wondering what was going on. Then the doctor and nurse returned.
"They came back and told me that he had taken a turn for the worse and he had died," she said. "I asked them how that was possible, and they said there was nothing they could do."
Mr. Lum was the only person to die among the 52 passengers and 16 crew members who came down with viral gastroenteritis on the cruise. His death was caused by extensive blood loss from a tear in his esophagus caused by vomiting, according to the family's complaint.
"Mr. Lum died of retching to death," said Erik Peterson, the family's lawyer.
Curtis J. Mase, a lawyer for Carnival, said in court papers that the company was not responsible, contending that the death was an act of God and that Mr. Lum had failed to seek timely or appropriate medical care.
"Russell Lum's own negligence contributed to his death and injuries," Mr. Mase said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 25 described the appointment of Adrienne Clarkson as Canada's governor general, the personal representative of Queen Elizabeth II. Ms. Clarkson, a Chinese-Canadian television personality, is the country's first immigrant governor general.
While citing widespread acclaim, the article also reported that the appointment had "attracted some thinly veiled racist thunderbolts." At that point, the article quoted from a letter deploring the appointment, written to two newspapers by Kenneth Lieblich, a former leader of the Monarchist League of Canada. But the letter does not mention race.
In a later letter, to The Times, Mr. Lieblich said his objection to Ms. Clarkson was based on her lack of political experience and had nothing to do with race. The juxtaposition of Mr. Lieblich's first letter with a reference to racism was not justified by any evidence.
An article on Sunday about the quality of medical care on cruise ships misstated the salary of a doctor for Carnival Cruise Lines. The doctor, Mauro Neri, was hired by Carnival in 1996 for $1,057 a week, not $1,057 a month.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Arming Unsung Heroes of Health Care

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D. 

 BODY:
Hospitals may not be called pest houses anymore, but they are still terrible places to be sick. They are all crawling with bacteria, with strangers who are sometimes kindly but sometimes not, with the potential for bad accidents; hospitals assault the senses from every direction, and then they send a bill.
No, from time immemorial it has always been far better, if possible, to be sick at home, surrounded by familiar comforts and tended by a devoted relative or friend. 
 But that part of the picture is changing fast. Those devoted attendants have much more complicated jobs than they once did. Medical science is saving more lives, at the price of creating more people with serious chronic medical problems who need continuing expert care. And the hospital is no longer the site of most of that care: increasingly portable technology (not to mention rising costs) means that the deep desire of every sick person to get out of the hospital right this minute can generally be accommodated.
But while the technology can easily travel home, no one has yet figured out a way to get the hospital staff home too.
So instead, a vast, silent volunteer army has grown up: millions of Americans who do unpaid service as health care providers, with many of the skills of the professionals but none of the salary, by caring for sick relatives and friends at home.
A study published in March in the policy journal Health Affairs estimated this work force at 25.8 million people as of 1997, each working an average of 18 hours a week. If they were all paid an hourly wage commensurate with their duties -- from the unskilled labor of changing bed linen to the highly technical work of adjusting machines and administering medications -- their economic value would come to $196 billion, about 18 percent of total national health care spending for 1997 and six times the $32 billion Americans formally spent on home care that year.
Legislators and policy makers pay attention to numbers like these, as witnessed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the tax credit proposal for home care givers now under consideration in Congress. But, as virtually anybody who has ever spent time caring for a sick person knows well, the professional custodians of the nation's health have yet to give these millions of new colleagues their due.
Doctors and nurses, therapists and social workers, well intentioned though they may be, still tend to think in the old authoritarian patterns. The patient is their patient; they are in charge; they know best. Just leave them alone to do their work. Please.
What little training the professionals get in the art of negotiating shared responsibilities is generally devoted to the tangled politics of getting along with one another. Doctors and nurses are still scrapping in the Hundred Years' War; few have the insight or energy left over to negotiate the same issues with third parties. In fact, in surveys that ask health professionals what makes their jobs most difficult, many immediately reply, "Families."
But consider this multiple-choice question (not to be found among the millions that line the path into the caring professions): A doctor sees a patient for 15 minutes once a month, a visiting nurse drops in once a week, a therapist spends an hour or so every few days, an aide comes in for the morning shift. A caretaking spouse, child or parent is there for the duration, learning what the pills look like and how they go down, how to change the bandages and what to do when the machinery at the bedside starts beeping at 3 A.M.
Whose patient is it?
It is small wonder that a grass-roots movement is slowly taking shape in the ranks of these family caregivers, asking for a little more acknowledgment from medical professionals, a little more education and a lot more respect.
One of their most eloquent voices has been that of Carol Levine, a health policy researcher with the United Hospital Fund in New York. Ms. Levine's work with children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic earned her a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant in 1993. Now she spends most workdays on a long-term project that aims to bring family caregivers out of the shadows into the forefront of health policy decisions.
At night, she joins the caregivers' ranks, tending to her husband, Howard, 71, who was injured in an automobile accident in 1990. Once a sharp, energetic public relations executive, Mr. Levine is bedbound and largely paralyzed, with serious brain damage.
Nine years of hands-on caregiving have given Ms. Levine an intimate familiarity with the rough patches of the terrain. Unreliable ambulette service, irresponsible insurers and a new wheelchair that is an inch too wide to fit into the dentist's office are bad, she said in an interview. But any prolonged interaction with doctors and hospitals is generally even worse.
Mr. Levine has required periodic hospitalizations over the years, and making the transfer between hospital and home is always a nightmare.
"In the hospital, they think they're the experts and you're just the family," she said. "But I am an expert. I'm an expert in him."
And then, when it is time to go home, all the responsibility is suddenly hers again. She is the effector arm of the doctors' plans, the key to their success or failure. Even so, she is regularly sent off with a minimum of explanation or training for any new conditions, medications or equipment.
Ms. Levine has to date supervised the disbursement of about $1.5 million in grant money to hospitals in the New York area for an assortment of projects to help home caregivers do their job. But no institution has yet taken her up on her most revolutionary proposal.
"All professionals in training should spend a day entirely on their own in a household like mine," she said. Not to make a house call, or a home visit, she emphasized, or to accomplish a series of discrete tasks, but to live the total experience -- the stretches of boredom and the moments of sheer terror, all played out in the complete isolation of the home.
"One day out of all those years of training," she said. "Is that too much to ask?"

HEADLINE: Experiment Seeks to Protect Ovaries From Cancer Treatment

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
In an experimental operation last Thursday that one doctor called "great work" but another called "preposterous," surgeons in Brooklyn removed a woman's ovaries, sliced them into thin strips and implanted them into her arm.
The patient, in her 30's, has cervical cancer, and the reason for the seemingly outlandish procedure was to protect her ovaries from the radiation treatment she will be getting. The radiation would very likely damage her ovaries and plunge her prematurely into menopause, bringing on the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis and other problems caused by the sudden loss of estrogen. (Menopause can be forestalled by estrogen-replacement therapy, but the woman, who allowed a reporter and photographer to watch the operation only on the condition of anonymity, refused the pills in favor of the experimental surgery.) 
 Now, when her pelvis is irradiated, she will simply have to raise her arm over her head to keep the ovarian tissue out of the way. No one knows whether ovarian tissue can live in a person's arm, but the surgeon who devised the procedure, Dr. Kutluk Oktay of New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, said he hoped the strips would survive and act like a normal ovary, producing enough estrogen to prevent menopause.
Although the patient in Brooklyn wanted the ovarian surgery to prevent menopause, Dr. Oktay said that if the method worked, the real goal was to use it to preserve fertility in young women hoping to have children after being treated for cancer. Eggs might be easily harvested from a patient's arm, he said, and used for in vitro fertilization, in which they would be fertilized in the laboratory and then implanted in the patient's uterus to start a pregnancy.
The research is part of a larger pattern of efforts to find ways to enable people to have families after being treated for cancer, particularly young people who have good odds of being cured of certain cancers like leukemia and bone tumors. The approach is in a highly experimental field that has yet to make parents of anyone. Nonetheless, many patients have pinned their hopes on the research.
For young people with cancer, particularly those who have not yet had children, it can be devastating to learn that the chemotherapy and radiation given to save their lives will also leave them sterile. Taking steps to try to have children later may be the utmost expression of faith and hope.
But only men have been able to plan for a future, by having sperm frozen before undergoing radiation or chemotherapy. Women have not had a similar option.
Eggs, unlike sperm, do not survive freezing. Fertilized eggs do, but women with cancer may not be able to spend the time and take the hormones needed to stimulate the ovaries to produce the eggs needed for in vitro fertilization.
"For women who have not completed their families, being a parent is very, very important," said Dr. Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. "They may have a cancer with a good prognosis. To look for options for these women is very important."
One option under study is to remove an ovary, freeze it before cancer treatment and reimplant it later. The technique works in animals; mice and sheep have given birth after having frozen ovaries reimplanted.
Although some clinics have been experimentally freezing human ovaries, and at least one is selling the service, no woman has yet had a baby as a result.
But in September, Dr. Oktay and his colleagues announced that frozen ovarian tissue had begun working again after being reimplanted in the patient, a young woman whose ovaries had been removed at another hospital because of a noncancerous disorder. One of the ovaries turned out to be healthy and was cut into strips and frozen, and two years later, when the patient was 30, Dr. Oktay's team sewed the strips to a scaffold made of surgical foam, which they implanted in her abdomen.
A few months later, given hormones that made eggs mature, the woman ovulated and then had a menstrual period. Her case was the first on record in which frozen ovarian tissue began to function again. (She may be able to become pregnant, but would need in vitro fertilization, because her Fallopian tubes were removed.)
Dr. Oktay cautions that ovary freezing is unlikely to work for women over 30, because they have fewer eggs than younger women, and some eggs are lost in the processing. By the time the tissue is thawed, he said, there may not be enough healthy eggs left to achieve a pregnancy or to produce the hormones needed to keep menopause at bay.
That limitation on freezing for women in their 30's helped inspire him to try last week's operation. A standard procedure for sparing the woman's ovaries had been rejected: doctors sometimes surgically relocate the ovaries within the abdomen to get them out of the way of radiation. But in this case, the doctors did not think it would work.
So Dr. Katherine Economos removed the patient's ovaries, and Dr. Oktay sliced them into 16 thin strips that he and Dr. James Rucinski could slip under the skin of the arm. The strips would be better able than large segments to absorb nutrients from the nearby tissue and establish a blood supply.
The idea is not as farfetched as it may seem: a similar technique has been used successfully for about 20 years in operations on the parathyroid glands, which are sometimes transferred from the neck to the arm.
Still, no one knows whether it will work with ovaries. The woman will receive chemotherapy with the radiation, and the doctors could not be certain that the low doses given for cervical cancer would not harm the ovarian tissue. Higher doses given for other types of cancer do cause infertility.
The team estimated that it would take six months before they could tell whether the tissue was doing its job. Only one other woman has undergone the procedure, about six months ago, and Dr. Oktay said he still could not tell whether it had succeeded. In any case, even if the strips do work, there is no telling how long they will last.
"We're taking a chance," Dr. Economos said.
Dr. Oktay said it might eventually be possible to combine the two techniques he has been studying. If the fresh tissue transplanted into his patients' arms works, he said it might also work to put frozen ovarian strips -- from a patient whose ovary had to be removed before chemotherapy, for instance -- back into the arm instead of the pelvis. The advantage, he said, is that it would be much easier to harvest eggs from the arm for in vitro fertilization. But women with intact Fallopian tubes might prefer to have the tissue put back into the abdomen, to give them a chance to become pregnant naturally, without in vitro fertilization.
Dr. James Grifo, director of reproductive endocrinology at New York University Medical Center, said that for now, ovary freezing and relocating should be performed only as research, as Dr. Oktay is doing, and not offered to patients as if they were a proven treatment.
Patients must be informed that no babies have been born as a result, Dr. Grifo emphasized, adding that publicity about the research had misled people into thinking that the procedures had already been shown to work. He said some women had mistakenly believed that they could postpone childbearing, freeze an ovary and get it back years or even decades later to start a family. There is no proof that can be done, and it may not be good for a woman to have a healthy ovary removed needlessly.
Cancer patients who will become sterile anyway have less to lose by giving up an ovary, but they also must be told that the procedure is highly experimental, Dr. Grifo said. He does not perform it or recommend it.
"I had a patient with breast cancer who wanted me to take out her ovary and freeze it," he said. "I said I couldn't do it. When I told her we don't know if you can make viable eggs, she just lost it. People don't want to hear the truth. The technology is not there.
"Why would I expose somebody to the risks of general anesthesia and surgery, and then freeze the ovaries by techniques nobody has shown you can get a viable egg from? Why would you have eggs taken out at a time when you're very sick, so on top of the disease you're going through an expensive, time-consuming, physically draining procedure?"
Dr. Maurie Markman, director of the Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center, called the ovary transplant into the patient's arm "preposterous," adding: "An operation on a lady with advanced cancer so she can have estrogen coming out of her arm, so she can avoid taking a pill? It's nuts." But he said that if effective techniques were developed to preserve women's fertility after cancer treatment, "I wouldn't have a problem with that."
Dr. Grifo said: "This is great work. It should continue. There's a lot of things we can learn by doing it."

Chart: "Removed for Safekeeping"
In an experimental procedure intended to protect a woman's ovaries during radiation treatments for cancer, doctors have removed the ovaries and implanted the tissue in her forearm.
 
1. After removing the ovaries from the pelvis, the surgeon cut the ovary in half and discarded tissue from the center. The remaining egg-bearing tissue was sliced into thin strips, 2 inches long and less than a quarter-inch wide.
 
2. Working through a half-inch incision in the patient's forearm, the surgeon inserted 16 strips under the skin. The hope is that the strips will survive and secrete enough estrogen to keep the woman from going into menopause prematurely. (Juan Velasco/The New York Times)

A Home Of the Blues, Singing a New Tune

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: CLARKSDALE, Miss.

 BODY:
Driving into this sleepy upper Delta city toward the crossroads where Highway 49 meets Highway 61, the first thing one sees is a sign that boasts "Clarksdale: Home of the Big Frog." There is little mention that Clarksdale is famous for more than amphibians: it is probably the most legendary blues site in the South. Dozens of blues legends were born or lived in this city or its county, Coahoma, among them John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Charley Patton, Pinetop Perkins, Son House and W. C. Handy. Nearly every Delta blues musician of note performed in Clarksdale regularly, including Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf and Sonny Boy Williamson. And many of them died here, most notably Bessie Smith. To this day a visitor arriving on a lucky night can see a venerable musician rocking the barroom at one of the dozen crumbling juke joints downtown.
More than the blues came to life in Clarksdale: the soul singer Sam Cooke grew up here, as did Ike Turner and Jackie Brenston, who recorded what some credit as the first rock-and-roll song, "Rocket 88." Local legend has it that a young Elvis Presley used to come through and hang around the radio station (home to one of the country's first black disk jockeys) in hopes of getting a chance to sing on the air. 
 For decades, however, the only people who recognized the city's heritage were the international blues tourists who trickled in each year. There was little for them to see: a small, homey annual blues festival and a Delta Blues Museum tucked into the Carnegie Library there. The county had already let the House of Blues, the music club chain, dismantle the shack Muddy Waters once lived in and cart it off on a national tour.
But something strange has happpened in Clarksdale the last year or two. As if awakening from amnesia, many whites here have suddenly become aware of the town's blues heritage. Much of this is owed to a handful of unusual characters: John Ruskey, a blues fan who came floating down the Mississippi River on a raft from Memphis, landing in Clarksdale to stay; a home builder named Kinchen O'Keefe, better known as Bubba, who funneled his savings into creating a mini-tourism empire downtown; a former schoolteacher, and Molly Shields, who found a way to keep her aging boyfriend off the dangerous power lines he works on by opening what she calls a "blues pawn shop." There are Cathy and James Butler, who decided to subvert the legacy of the Hopson Plantation, inherited from Mrs. Butler's forebears, by renting out the sharecropper's shacks and turning the company store into a social club. Each has been trying to build a bridge to the city's cultural past, and a result may be to take Clarksdale into the next century as one of the South's most irresistible tourist meccas.
Or, as Mr. O'Keefe said, "We've got gold in the stream that needs mining."
With the new casinos in nearby Tunica County bringing in over one million visitors a year, Clarksdale -- which was a stop on President Clinton's four-day poverty tour this summer -- has experienced the impact that tourism can have on an economy. It has invested several million dollars into developing an area it calls Blues Alley (complete with a John Lee Hooker Lane) and it is working on putting its atrophied bus and train stations in order, partly to lure some of the tourists visiting Tunica and Memphis to the north.
"Everybody wants to keep the tourists in town for longer than 30 minutes," said Mr. Butler, who in addition to helping run Hopson is also the city's director of public works. "But the one thing I feel everybody's kept in their minds is that things can't get too clean and flashy. Keep it real or we won't have what we have now."
Clarksdale first came to life in the late 1800's as a lumber camp established by John Clark, whose daughter, Blanche, inspired the character of the same name in "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams, who also made his home in Clarksdale. With the advent of railways, Clarksdale blossomed in the early 20th century, becoming one of the most prosperous cities of its size in the nation and known as "little New York" because of all its millionaires. The city was where the majority black population came to shop, celebrate and listen to music on days off. But with World War II and the mechanization of the cotton industry, the city's population ebbedas sharecroppers moved to cities in the North, and bankruptcy abounded. Today Clarksdale has been cited as one of the poorest cities in the poorest state in the nation, with 30 percent of Clarksdale's residents below the poverty level.
One of the city's acknowledged treasures for over 20 years has been the Delta Blues Museum. But last year the museum's director died, and a successor has not been appointed. Mr. Ruskey, a curator who had left the museum to work as a river guide, stepped in to take care of museum business along with Mae Smith, who ran the gift shop. They helped reopen the Delta Blues Museum on Oct. 10 in a beautifully remodeled freight station bought by the city in Blues Alley.
On opening day, visitors wandered through three rooms of temporary exhibitions, including a wax figure of Muddy Waters, a headstone that once stood on Mississippi Fred McDowell's grave (it had been replaced because his name was misspelled), photographs of blues legends and dozens of other displays chronicling the history of blues and soul in the Delta.
On a concrete stage outside by the old train tracks, local musicians, including Mr. Ruskey and many teen-agers who were taught to play by the museum's blues education fund (most notably the group J. T. Express, favorites at nearby juke joints like the Do Drop Inn), performed for the small crowd.
The bluesman and museum teacher Johnnie Billington, who closed the show, walked around in the sweltering afternoon in a coat and tie. Since instructing his students to always dress formally in public so that they will be treated with respect, he has never been seen otherwise, residents say, even when mowing his yard on a sweltering summer afternoon.
A block and a half from the museum festivities, Mr. O'Keefe stood behind the counter in his new store, the Sunflower River Trading Company, surrounded by the local crafts, music and videos he was selling. With the boarded-up, discolored and dilapidated storefronts around it, the store looks like a rose that somehow sprouted from quicksand. Like many others here, Mr. O'Keefe has a story about growing up in blues country without ever being a part of it. "Mississippi Fred McDowell used to pump gas for my father," he said. "He used to go to festivals in Europe, then come back and pump gas."
Now Mr. O'Keefe has embarked on a one-man publicity and renovation campaign for Clarksdale. Across the street from his new store he bought the building that once housed WROX radio. He turned the ground floor into a children's store and the top floor into a professional-looking dance studio for local children, including his own. Between those floors are the empty radio studios where a young Elvis Presley used to pay the owner money to sing on the air, Ike Turner worked as a janitor and Sam Cooke was a protege of the disk jockey Early Wright, the Soul Man. That part of the building, he said, will become a museum and studio celebrating the station's glory days. He also plans to build the city's first cafe in the building and to organize package tours of the area.
Several blocks away Ms. Shields and Mr. Brower opened one of the city's odder attractions in June. Mr. Brower was working on the city's power lines when they decided to find a different line of work. So they opened Carmen's Blues Pawn Shop (named after Mr. Brower's daughter) downtown, where they also sell tourist souvenirs like autographed CD's by newer area blues acts like Super Chikan, key chains, and T-shirts. On the wall outside, their nephews have painted the city's first blues mural: giant caricatures of John Lee Hooker, Bessie Smith and Muddy Waters.
Ms. Shields said she was brought up in Clarksdale but never knew how famous her home was in blues lore until recently. "We get people from all over the world here," she said. "Last week we got 31 Norwegians. When people come to town, other than the blues museum there's nothing. And we wanted to have something where they can stand outside and take pictures and say these three people on this mural are famous and they're from Clarksdale."
Overnight guests began coming this year to Hopson Plantation, where the first mechanized cotton picker was developed and used and where musicians like Pinetop Perkins and Wesley Jefferson, the Mississippi Junebug, once lived. But in a twist on Southern plantation tourism, visitors do not stay in the big house but rather in the sharecropper shacks out back, which still retain some possessions of the original occupants. The owners say they plan to invite touring bands for warm-up shows in what used to be the company store, which has been fitted with a small stage and converted into a social club.
For now, Clarksdale remains a city in transition. Mr. Butler said bankers tend to scoff when he tries to offer a sharecropper's shack as collateral on a loan. And days go by when Mr. O'Keefe doesn't sell a single item in his store.
"This weekend was a hard weekend, because you struggle and say, 'Why am I trying to do this?' " Mr. O'Keefe said. "But if I don't do it, who will? If you turn your back on them, buildings start to decay and the people with stories about them start to die."

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: EX-TERRORIST TO MOVE -- At Yasir Arafat's request, Prime Minister Ehud Barak is permitting the former terrorist leader of a militant Palestinian political faction to move from Damascus to the Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Nayef Hawatmeh, 63, left, who as head of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine was held responsible for the killing of 24 Israeli schoolchildren in 1974, says he has renounced violence and wants to take part in politics in the Palestinian Authority. William A. Orme Jr. (NYT) 

TUNISIA: PRESIDENT RE-ELECTED -- In a result that was never in doubt, President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali won a third five-year term with nearly 100 percent of the vote, official results showed. Mr. Ben Ali, 62, won 3,269,000 out of 3,287,000 votes cast, Interior Minister Ali Chaouch said. For the first time, two token opposition candidates took part. They got a combined total of just over one half of 1 percent of the votes cast. (Reuters)
 
IRAQ: U.S. JETS ATTACK -- American jets patrolling the no-flight zone over northern Iraq bombed an Iraqi missile storage center south of Mosul in response to Iraqi antiaircraft fire, the United States military said. According to an Iraqi spokesman, two people were killed and seven were wounded. (AP, Agence France-Pressse)
 
EUROPE
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: RENEWED OPTIMISM -- Intensified talks in Belfast to break the impasse that has blocked progress in putting the peace accord into place produced guarded expressions of hope for a breakthrough this week when former Senator George J. Mitchell returns to finish his formal review. An Ulster Unionist negotiator, Alan McFarland, said, "There is a degree of trust creeping in" between his party and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
 SPAIN: KEY BASQUE DETAINED -- The French police arrested Belen Gonzalez Penalva, whom authorities say represented the Basque separatist group E.T.A. at the only peace talks, held last May, with the Spanish Government since they declared a cease-fire 13 months ago. Her arrest came a day after the rebels announced tougher demands for resuming the stalled peace talks, insisting that Madrid must first agree to Basque self-determination and the withdrawal of all state security forces from the region. The Government dismissed the initiative as propaganda. Al Goodman (NYT)
 
GERMANY: 'GREENHOUSE' MEETING -- Representatives from 168 countries opened a two-week conference in Bonn intended to cut emissions of so-called greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. They will discuss a timetable for carrying out the agreement reached at the 1997 United Nations conference in Kyoto, Japan, which set global standards for reducing pollution, including a cut in greenhouse emissions by 5.2 percent for industrialized nations from 1990 levels by 2008-2012. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
BOSNIA: SUSPECT SEIZED -- NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Bosnia detained a suspected Bosnian Serb war criminal, Damir Dosen, who is under indictment for crimes against humanity. A NATO statement issued in Brussels said Mr. Dosen would be transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague. It said he was shift commander in 1992 at a camp outside Prijedor, where detainees were "killed, sexually assaulted, tortured, beaten and otherwise subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment." (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: NOT GUILTY PLEA -- Dr. Walter Basson, the head of chemical warfare under the apartheid-era Government, pleaded not guilty to 61 criminal charges, including conspiracy to murder, fraud and drug dealing. Six murder charges against him have already been dismissed because those killings took place outside South Africa. Dr. Basson still faces 16 counts of murder and his trial is expected to last two years. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)

MEXICO: TOP REBEL SEIZED -- The recently-formed federal police said it captured the top commander of a guerrilla group operating in the violence-torn state of Guerrero. Jacobo Silva Nogales, known as Commander Antonio, was arrested in the state capital, Chilpancingo, along with three other people accused of leading the Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People. The year-old group has carried out a string of armed attacks on Government troops. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
VENEZUELA: CONTENTIOUS CLAUSE -- The assembly drawing up a new constitution expected to significantly expand the powers of President Hugo Chavez has approved a clause that would require all news organizations to publish only "truthful and impartial" information and guarantee anyone mentioned in a news report the right to a rebuttal. Critics in Venezuela and abroad have condemned the measure, saying it would give Mr. Chavez and his followers the power to silence opponents and could lead to censorship. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
HONG KONG: IMMIGRATION REVISITED -- Five months after it was reversed by Beijing on a landmark immigration ruling, the highest court in Hong Kong began hearing an appeal by 17 mainland Chinese who claim they have the right to live in the territory.

That ruling was overturned by Beijing, and legal experts said the court will have to rule on the validity of that action in deciding on those claims. Mark Landler (NYT)
 
INDIA: PARLIAMENT OPENED -- President K. R. Narayanan opened Parliament with a pledge that "bold strategy" would be used in economic reforms, pledging the creation of 10 million jobs each year.

HEADLINE: Higher Mortgage Rates Push Sales of Existing Homes Down

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell 2.1 percent in September as months of rising mortgage rates squeezed demand, but the housing market remains on track for a record year of sales, a real estate group said today.
The National Association of Realtors said existing homes sold at an annual rate of 5.13 million units, down from a 5.24 million pace in August. The September pace was below the 5.16 million units expected by economists but was still 3.4 percent above sales in September 1998. 
 September was the third consecutive decline since sales hit a record pace of 5.63 million units in June.
"Consumer demand for existing homes is still healthy despite several months of increased interest rates," said James Smith, the chief economist for the association. "The housing market will not be derailed, because economic factors that drive consumer confidence -- employment, inflation and household wealth -- are at healthy levels."
While demand for homes was weaker, the report held some good news for consumers as the median home sale price fell to $134,500 in September from $137,400 in August.
Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union, said the lower prices should offer solace to Federal Reserve policy makers as they consider whether to increase interest rates at their November meeting.
"The moderation in home prices has to be some comfort to the Fed," Mr. Vitner said. "While Alan Greenspan's comments about the stock market have gotten all the attention, the Fed chairman is also concerned about the prospects of excessive borrowing on inflated home values."
The interest rate on the average 30-year mortgage was 7.82 percent in September, modestly lower than August's average of 7.94 percent but sharply up from levels of 6.72 percent in the month a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac.
Despite the weaker home sales in September, the association said it still predicted a record sales pace of 5.2 million units this year, a 4.8 percent increase over the previous record of 4.97 million units, set last year. The group expects the housing market to cool further in the coming year, to a pace of 4.9 million units.

HEADLINE: Mega-Mergers, Mega-Influence

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten; Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, was Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade in the first Clinton Administration.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Congress is about to eliminate the legal walls that separate commercial banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies -- opening the doors to a new wave of mega-mergers. Critics worry that huge banks will dampen competition and pay less attention to the average customer.
But by itself, sheer size -- whether in finance or in other industries -- should not be a concern. The real problem could be the unchecked political influence of the new global goliaths. 
 In just the past few years corporate giants have emerged across all industries. Citibank and Travelers, Bank of America and Nationsbank, and Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are among the major mergers that have reshaped banking. In other industries, Daimler-Benz has linked up with Chrysler; AT&T with Mediaone; British Petroleum with Amoco; Aetna with Prudential Health. Still awaiting regulatory approval are some of the biggest combinations of all, including those between Exxon and Mobil, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, and Viacom and CBS.
We are likely to see much more of this. For starters, deregulation in Europe, Japan and countries like Brazil and South Korea is leading to many more possibilities for large acquisitions.
In the past, a similar wave of mergers would have produced an outcry over mass layoffs, but with unemployment at 30-year lows, few today are complaining. Nor are many alleging today that competition is being eliminated. Because the markets are global, no company is reaching the size and scale that should cause concern about monopolies.
If executives can manage these large entities effectively, Americans -- in their roles as consumers, investors and even employees -- ought to benefit from these new, competitive companies, receiving more and better goods and services at a lower cost.
The big problem is not with how these businesses are affecting competition, but with the inability of our political system to respond to potential problems resulting from economic globalization. Business leaders understandably operate on a global stage, while government leaders act in a way that fails to recognize the new global economy. Members of Congress spend infinitely more time dispensing pork in their hometowns than they do worrying about the stability of the global financial system or the strengthening of the World Trade Organization.
Their narrow perspective on globalization is reflected in their eagerness to slice the budgets of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department's antitrust division, the two institutions that have some ability to watch over global companies.
To put it another way, the seesaw of private and public power is seriously unbalanced.
Here is some of the fallout. Mega-banks like Citigroup or the new Bank of America have become too big to fail. Were they to falter, they could take the entire global financial system down with them.
Many mega-companies could be beyond the law, too. Their deep pockets can buy teams of lawyers that can stymie prosecutors for years. And if they lose in court, they can afford to pay huge fines without damaging their operations.
Moreover, no one should be surprised that mega-companies navigate our scandalously porous campaign financing system to influence tax policy, environmental standards, Social Security financing and other issues of national policy. Yes, companies have always lobbied, but these huge corporations often have more pull. Because there are fewer of them, their influence can be more focused, and in some cases, the country may be highly dependent on their survival.
For example, corporate giants can have enormous leverage when they focus on America's foreign and trade policy. Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, itself a result of a merger of two big firms, were able to exert extraordinarily powerful force to influence the Senate to approve the enlargement of NATO, a move that opened up new markets for American weapons sales to Poland and the Czech Republic.
Companies like Boeing, which not long ago acquired McDonnell Douglas, have expanded their already formidable influence on trade policy toward countries like China. Boeing is now the only American commercial aircraft manufacturer.
Corporations like Exxon-Mobil will negotiate with oil-producing countries almost as equals, conducting the most powerful private diplomacy since the 19th century, when the British East India Company wielded near-sovereign influence in Asia.
As long as the economy remains strong, the rise of corporate power with inadequate public oversight will not be high on the national agenda. But sooner or later -- perhaps starting with the next serious economic downturn -- the United States will have to confront one of the great challenges of our times: How does a sovereign nation govern itself effectively when politics are national and business is global? When the answers start coming, they could be as radical and as prolonged as the backlash against unbridled corporate power that took place during the first 40 years of this century.

U.S. Official Finishes Talks In Beijing

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The United States Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, finished two days of meetings in China today with both sides extolling financial cooperation and exuding friendship. But there was no sign of progress on the overarching issue, China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Still, by all accounts, the meetings Sunday with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and today with the Finance Minister, Xiang Huaicheng, and other senior officials were friendly and free of rancorous talk -- perhaps an achievement in itself since the countries are still emerging from the icy silence that followed the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last May. 
 Without discounting the difficult market-opening concessions that the United States demands of China before it will endorse membership in the global trade body, Mr. Summers and other American officials appeared optimistic that agreement was still possible in the coming month, before new global negotiations begin.
Mr. Summers and other senior economic and security officials came to China for a meeting of the China-U.S. Joint Economic Committee, a periodically scheduled exchange of ideas. Officials said no trade negotiations were held.
The leaders on both sides clearly wanted to present a cheerful public face and an exchange at today's news conference expressed the mood.
Asked about the prospects for a trade agreement, Mr. Summers said: "Any differences can be bridged with good will on both sides. But certainly there are differences that have to be resolved."
Mr. Xiang, smiling, replied, "I agree with the point that with good will, all the problems can be solved" -- subtly suggesting, perhaps, that a decision to give China some leeway was now required.
To which Mr. Summers quickly retorted, to laughs from the room of officials and journalists, "But there is something to be solved."
That "something" is, in the American view, concessions by China to allow global competitors gradually to enter protected, state-run sectors like financial services and telecommunications and to lower barriers to American farm products.
Mr. Summers, in meetings and in a speech today at Qinghua University extolling the merits of market forces and the free flow of information and technology, contended that China would be better off for allowing in competition. This is accepted in principle by many of China's leaders, but is difficult to carry out in a country with serious problems of unemployment, farmer unrest and a huge, dying state enterprise sector.
In a visit to Washington last April, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji was said to have made deep concessions that he hoped would secure the trade deal, but President Clinton decided the moves did not go far enough to satisfy Congress, which will ultimately have to cooperate.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Recover a Bit After Big Fall Early in Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds recouped early losses yesterday after yields at one point during the day climbed to a two-year high of 6.40 percent, luring buyers to the market.
"We still have some of the highest yields in the world on our government bonds," said Carl Ericson, who invests about $6 billion as director of taxable fixed-income securities at Colonial Asset Management in Boston. "We're nibbling" in the Treasury market, he added. 
 Ten-year American notes yield 429 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than 10-year Japanese Government bonds, 73 basis points more than 10-year German bonds and 38 more than 10-year British bonds.
Late in the day the 30-year bond was down 2/32 at a price of 97 1/32, sending its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.35 percent from 6.34 percent.
"Inflation is stepping up," said Steven Bohlin, who helps invest $1.9 billion at the Thornburg Management Company in Santa Fe, N.M. "This makes me say that the Fed's going to have to do more" in the way of raising rates. Bond yields may rise above 6.5 percent this year, he said, adding that he is stockpiling Treasury bills.
The Federal Reserve, which raised its target rate in June and September to the current 5.25 percent, said this month that it was leaning toward another increase. Policy-makers next meet Nov. 16.
The Fed is "slightly behind the curve" in fighting inflation, said Bruce Alston, who oversees $1.5 billion of bonds at Value Line Asset Management. He expects the Fed to raise rates at next month's meeting.
Treasury bond yields have risen more than 125 basis points this year, and consequently the benchmark bond has posted a year-to-date loss of 12.1 percent, taking reinvested interest into account.
In such an environment, the top-performing Government bond fund has spent 1999 betting against government bonds. Juno Fund, run by Rydex Mutual Funds in Rockville, Md., has risen almost 18 percent by following a strategy of short-selling, which allows it to climb when Treasuries fall, according to Morningstar Inc., a fund research firm in Chicago.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.737	97.414	High Rate	4.99%	5.11%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.33%	Low Rate	4.95%	5.06%	Median Rate	4.98%	5.11%	Total applied for	$31,587,200	$28,070,910	Accepted	$14,277,200	$11,084,969	Noncompetitive	$1,338,116	$1,068,690	

Both issues are dated Oct. 28, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 27, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on April 27, 2000.

HEADLINE: Earnings Are Up 13% at American Express

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its third-quarter profit had risen 13 percent, meeting expectations, as customers spent more with its credit cards and increased investments with its financial planners.
The company said it earned $648 million, or $1.42 a share, up from $574 million, or $1.25 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 12 percent, to $4.88 billion, from $4.34 billion. 
 The per-share earnings matched the $1.42 expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, but the company's shares fell $5.25 yesterday, to $143.375. Most financial stocks fell as bond yields rose to their highest levels in more than two years. American Express had gained 10 percent in the five trading days before yesterday and was up 40 percent for the year.
American Express increased profits partly because its chairman and chief executive, Harvey Golub, and its president and Mr. Golub's heir, Kenneth Chenault, are working to persuade clients to use the company's cards at grocery stores, gas stations and for other routine purchases.
The company is also benefiting from increased marketing spending and a nine-year economic boom that has been driven by consumer spending. Earnings at the travel-related services unit, which offers credit and charge cards and travel plans, rose 14 percent, to $413 million.
Customers increased spending on cards 14 percent from the year-earlier quarter, to an average $1,935 each. The company gained 900,000 card accounts in the third quarter. It has 2.3 million more cards in customers' hands than it had a year ago, excluding 1.6 million cards lost when American Express dropped a Government contract last year. Card loans, led by the Optima card, rose 34 percent while charge-card receivables increased 9 percent.
To get those accounts and loans, American Express spent $340 million on marketing, up from $310 million a year earlier.
Loan write-offs fell to 4.7 percent of total loans, from 5.3 percent in the previous quarter and 6.4 percent a year earlier.
Even with a falling stock market in the third quarter -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index fell 7 percent -- the company sold more mutual funds and other investments as it added 142 financial planners, giving it 10,631. Earnings at the company's money management subsidiary, American Express Financial Advisors Inc., increased 14 percent, to $240 million.
Profit at American Express Bank, which includes the company's travelers check business, fell 12 percent, to $38 million, from $43 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: 3M Reports Its Profits for the Third Quarter Were 18% Higher

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 25

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the maker of Post-It notes and Scotch tape, said today that its third-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, more than expected, as sales rose and the cost of raw materials fell.
Profit from operations rose to $462 million, or $1.14 a diluted share, compared with $392 million, or 97 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 6.1 percent, to $4 billion. 
 Analysts had expected 3M to earn $1.06 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
Earnings have now increased for two consecutive quarters after sliding the previous six. Sales in Asia buoyed profit by rising more than 30 percent as the region's economy recovered. In the United States, sales rose 3 percent, led by industrial and safety products and office supplies.
"They're producing good results, they are taking costs out, and that's what you like to see," said Rich Turgeon, an analyst at Society Asset Management, which owned more than 1.5 million 3M shares in June.
The company expects to meet analyst estimates of $1 a share for fourth-quarter earnings, Giulio Agostini, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call. The company also expects to reach its per-share earnings growth target of about 10 percent in 2000, he said.
Shares of 3M, based in St. Paul, rose 25 cents, to $92.8125. They have gained 30 percent this year.
The company took a series of gains and charges in the quarter. A $73 million pretax charge stems from a Federal jury's ruling that 3M violated antitrust laws involving its tape business. The company also had pretax gains totaling $69 million related to asset sales and to change the estimated cost of a restructuring. The company did not provide after-tax figures for the gains and charge.
The actions resulted in net income of $459 million, or $1.13 a share, in the quarter. In the period a year earlier, a charge of $214 million, or 53 cents a share, for job cuts and plant closings resulted in net income of $178 million, or 44 cents a share.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Ho-Hum. SlowDay at Office As Major Indexes Decline.

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices weakened a bit yesterday as traders in large-capitalization issues took some profits following last week's bounce in major averages. Market interest rates, which moved higher in the morning but later retreated and closed little changed, provided another source of instability.
For the most part, however, traders said the session was an unexceptional day at the office. 
 "It was a very slow day," said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jeffries & Company. "Barring some big outside event, I think the market will stay in a trading range for the remainder of the year. But one more interest rate increase before year-end could be a negative."
Worries about higher interest rates, which could put a crimp in future earnings, helped to drag down the Dow Jones industrial average.
Despite good earnings reports from a number of companies that are included in the Dow, the blue-chip index fell 120.32, or 1.15 percent, to 10,349.93.
American Express, Exxon and Chevron, which all reported quarterly earnings that either met or exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, fell by 2 points or more.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 8.02, or 0.62 percent, to 1,293.63, pulled down by weakness in oil, financial service and drug stocks. The Nasdaq composite index barely budged, dropping 0.57, to 2,815.95. Declines in issues like Intel and Qualcomm were offset by big gains in Internet stocks like Amazon.com and Ebay. And the Russell 2000 index of small stocks slipped 0.93, or 0.22 percent, to 417.76.
Volume was light, and declining issues again outnumbered those that gained in price.
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said the fact that the broader market continued to fare poorly suggested that additional declines might be in the offing soon.
"The rally we had last week was the weakest in terms of depth and participation," he said. "The Dow, the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq were all up between 3 percent and 5 percent. Yet the advance/decline figures for the week showed more declining issues than advancing ones on all three exchanges. It's the same old story: the big stocks rally and the rest of the market languishes."
American Express and J. P. Morgan led the Dow lower.
American Express fell 5 1/4, to 143 3/8. Traders sold the stock even though the company reported that third-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, a performance that met consensus forecasts. J. P. Morgan shed 5 7/16, to 120 3/16.
Both stocks, along with other big financial service firms, posted sharp gains last Friday after the Senate Banking Committee reached agreement on legislation that would overhaul the financial services industry.
Exxon and Chevron both fell despite posting healthy earnings. Other oil stocks fell in sympathy.
Exxon lost 2 7/8, to 74. Chevron fell 3 3/4, to 90, even though its earnings were better than expected.
Elsewhere, MidAmerican Energy Holdings jumped 6 1/8, to 33 3/8, after Berkshire Hathaway said it was leading an investor group that would buy the company for $35.05 a share. The transaction would be the first energy purchase for Berkshire.
Internet stocks, which fell during the morning as long-term bond yields touched 6.40 percent, rallied as long-term rates fell.
Gains in stocks like Immunex, which rose 4 1/8, to 58 1/16, Amazon.com and Ebay helped to push TheStreet.com's Internet sector index up 2.2 percent.
Amazon.com gained 4 1/8, to 82 3/4, and Ebay jumped 8 1/4, to 150 7/8.
