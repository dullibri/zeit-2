HEADLINE: More Power to the Tribes

BYLINE: By Bill Richardson; Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Native American Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The nation tunes in to Indian issues only when there is a crisis like the mysterious illness plaguing the Navajo reservation in Arizona. Or when Donald Trump files a lawsuit to stop Indian gaming. Or when a movie like "Dances with Wolves" attracts movie stars lamenting the plight of our reservations.
Indian reservations are among the poorest areas in the United States: 93,000 Indians are homeless or have inadequate housing, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Of the 1.8 million Native Americans, 603,000 live below the poverty line. 
 Unemployment on reservations has always exceeded 50 percent nationally and sometimes reaches more than 80 percent. Indians have the highest rates of diabetes and tuberculosis and the lowest life expectancy.
These troubles have a long history, but in recent years there has been one obvious culprit: the wasteful and patriarchal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which in large measure has held back tribes from helping themselves. Although Indian tribes are sovereign, many tribal governmental activities are mired in the Federal bureaucracy.
It is time to junk or radically transform the bureau, which has a central office in Washington and more than 100 other offices scattered around the country. We need a system under which the money goes directly to the reservation rather than to an inflated bureaucracy. Perhaps the most egregious example of the bureau's mind-boggling inefficiency is its mismanagement of nearly $2 billion in funds belonging to Indian people and tribes, who have no say in how their money is handled. Since 1820, the Government has held tribal funds in trust, and it was not until 1966 that it even began investing the funds.
Today, according to the General Accounting Office, the bureau has a poor accounting system, weak internal controls and a badly trained staff. Though it functions as a bank, the bureau has no regular audits and cannot say how much money is in the accounts.
Revenue from oil and gas royalties on Indian lands, grazing fees and other income isn't directly distributed to the tribes or individuals. Instead, it is deposited in a variety of bank accounts that the bureau has not been able to reconcile. In the last two years, Congress has pressed for an audit of the accounts, but business goes on as usual.
A creative new approach that encourages tribes to take control of their own futures would also get them out from under the bureau. It is a bold experimental project, started in 1988, in which 30 tribes bypass the bureau and enter into self-governance compacts with the Interior Secretary. Instead of the bureau providing services to the reservation, the tribes participating in this experiment establish their own spending priorities with the Secretary. This kind of tribal self-determination will not only save the taxpayers money, it will give the tribes more autonomy. Congress needs to encourage such initiatives, and we will be drafting legislation to make the project permanent, so that it will be an option for all tribes.
Indians should be given the means to attract investment on reservations: tax incentives, enterprise zones and development banks. Indian gaming, only 3 percent of the gambling industry nationwide, is a $6 billion industry in Indian America and has successfully reduced unemployment on many reservations and made some tribes self-sufficient.
Why must the Government help Indians at all? Besides the obvious moral obligation, there is a legal responsibility. Since the founding of the country, the U.S. has promised to uphold the rights of Indian tribes, and became the trustee of Indian lands and resources. The U.S. vowed that Indians would be housed, educated and provided with decent health care. We have failed on nearly every count, and every one of the more than 300 treaties with tribes has been broken.
When Federal and state agencies were searching for the cause of the epidemic that began on the Navajo reservation, they had the wisdom to listen to the tribal medicine men, who pointed to a key food source that attracts rats, the probable carriers of the disease. So it is with Indian policy. Only the tribal perspective holds the cure to the lingering injustices and poverty in Indian country.

HEADLINE: Lend Russia Money and a Tough Accountant

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Waffling and Wavering on Russian Aid" (Op-Ed, June 27), Dimitri Simes is unhappy with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for refusing "to relax their loan requirements" and the I.M.F. director for "stonewalling on Russian aid." He recommends that the Group of Seven set up a "public-and-private entity on the model of the Marshall Plan," presumably with less stringent criteria, for shaping Russian aid. 
 It is difficult to see how softer conditions on aid will help the Russian Government close unviable factories, cut back state subsidies, trim currency outflow and strengthen the ruble. The model of the Marshall Plan can help Russian reformers, not because it was lenient, but because it was strict on use of American dollars appropriated by Congress for Western Europe and channeled by the European Cooperation Administration.
Despite the quick tempo of Russian sales of shops, restaurants and trading and service outlets to private owners, and conversion of large factories to joint stock companies, readiness to shed labor and to junk idle machines is hardly in evidence.
In my recent visits to factories and interviews with managers, the answer to whether or not workers would be laid off for factory restructuring was a resounding nyet. A manager of a submarine plant turning out household heating systems, irons and tea kettles, said: "I have risen to the rank of a manager after 30 years in this factory. The workers are my family. When they have problems, they do not run to Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov, who threaten their livelihood. They come to me."
Another manager of a large Moscow factory acknowledged that workers on part-time employment were moonlighting elsewhere, but laying them off was complicated. If they were fired and removed from the factory payroll, they would lose their housing. The large factories in company towns are eager to be free from providing subsidized apartments to the vast labor force and the responsibilities of maintaining dilapidated housing. But the local administrations are unwilling to pick up the tab, and the privatization of factory housing is at a standstill.
Then there is the insider-outsider conflict in privatized units in which the citizens have placed vouchers in exchange for shares. The outsiders fear that the labor collectives may decide to convert a bakery into a boutique and a Moscow supermarket into a five-star hotel. The fears are so real that a recent shareholders' meeting of the Bolshevik Biscuit Factory broke into a pandemonium.
In the meantime, creating employment opportunities in privatized shops and new trading and service outlets is hobbled by crippling taxes, erratic prices and extortion charges by the mafia, which are keeping ahead of the inflation. The dynamic, young manager of a Nizhni Novgorod restaurant mentioned tax rates of 70 percent to 90 percent on the income in the restaurant and 16 shops in his ownership. The marketing and accounting staff everywhere is juggling tax payments, hassling with volatile price quotations from suppliers, fighting off demands for higher wages and bonuses from employees and keeping the mafia at bay.
Many among the young and the daring would take on the challenges of private activities in sales and service if they were less risky.
The Government must pick winners and losers among the factories, select candidates here and there for bankruptcy proceedings. Last March, Izvestia reported that an official, four-page list of bankrupt enterprises to be subjected to slow demise had mysteriously disappeared. In the meantime, the I.M.F. representative in Russia complained about the lack of a policy on which enterprises should be supported, which should be closed and which should survive on their own. The Russian cabinet, meeting last May, failed to agree on a selective subsidy plan because the new first deputy prime minister, Oleg Lobov, wanted to include more sectors for state support.
The I.M.F., contrary to Dimitri Simes's assertion, has been pressured to release support for a member country that has failed to fulfill its pledge on earlier funds: the Russian commitment to keep the budget deficit at 5 percent of domestic income (the condition for releasing a $1 billion I.M.F. loan in July 1992). Indeed, the credit-financed purchases of machines, materials and spare parts were sold by the Government to Russian buyers at such throwaway prices that the 1992 budget deficit (including massive subsidization of imports) was estimated at a whopping 20 percent. On the eve of the Tokyo meetings, the I.M.F. has just released the first installment of $1.5 billion in aid.
The I.M.F. traditionally rewards positive performance with more financing and penalizes nonfulfillment of a pledge by canceling additional credits. This on-again, off-again approach has worked. But standard I.M.F. monitoring cannot succeed in Russia, where a policy consensus is missing, a commitment to carry out obligations is absent despite good intentions, and serious economic indicators such as the inflation rate and budget deficit have lost importance.
Besides, softer aid conditions for Russia are unfair to Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and developing countries that have undertaken market reforms. They also set a bad precedent for other former Soviet states, like Ukraine, a mini-nuclear power that is in a worse situation.
Hence the need for a special agency with an intrusive role of tracking and insuring the use of aid funds to serve a definite goal. For example, imports financed by the Russian Government with official credits should be sold to domestic Russian buyers at close to market prices. The resulting counterpart (ruble) fund on government account should be used for budgetary support to retrain and relocate workers of factories targeted for shutdown.
Such was the way the European Cooperation Administration operated in Western Europe during Marshall Plan days under President Harry S. Truman. Contrary to Mr. Simes's interpretation, the Marshall Plan mechanism was a coercive device for insuring that United States funds were used to fulfill the goals for which they were voted by Congress. The generous donor was a strict accountant, an on-the-scene operator and a pragmatic manipulator. Speedy European recovery could not have been managed without such underpinning.
More than four decades later, will another Democratic President rise to the challenge and secure market reforms in Russia?

HEADLINE: Lend Russia Money and a Tough Accountant;
Stemming Corruption

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Dimitri Simes fails to discuss corruption in "Waffling and Wavering on Russian Aid" (Op-Ed, June 27). He argues for increasing aid to Russia. However, current assistance to Russia is inefficient because of the corruption on the receiving end.
It is part of the Russian character to seek out and profit from loopholes in the bureaucratic structure. Gogol's character Chichikov profited from a loophole by buying up dead souls. The Soviet period did not alter this because Marxism did not contain an explicit ethical system. 
 Today, exploiting loopholes and other scams have led to outright criminal activity, from counterfeiting to phony voucher investment funds.
The International Monetary Fund has proceeded with proper caution. Its managing director commented that the I.M.F. is afraid to grant a $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble because the money would end up in European bank accounts days later.
Production in Russian oilfields drops each year, yet oil exports have increased. One of three barrels of oil is exported to the West for hard currency by unofficial means. The revenue goes to private bank accounts. How has President Boris N. Yeltsin dealt with this problem? According to the Russian Petroleum Investor, Mr. Yeltsin allegedly abolished the Commission on Combatting Corruption after pressure by the Russian oil and gas producers accused by the commission of illegal exports and hard currency violations.
What can the United States do about this problem? I propose expanding the Peace Corps for Russia to include not only business advisers and teachers of English, but also American observers fluent in Russian to help prevent the diversion of food and medical supplies to the black market. The minimal costs needed would be more than offset by getting aid to the right people. Using most Russian officials to deliver Western aid is analogous to distributing food aid to Somalia through Somali warlords.

HEADLINE: Pact Reached On Incinerator For Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Thursday, July 8

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a compromise Wednesday that would allow New York City to build a much disputed garbage incinerator in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But in doing so, they imposed new hurdles that could slow the project or make it more expensive.
The agreement, which will partly exempt the incinerator from strict air-pollution regulations, left both its proponents and critics claiming victory. 
 The compromise came late Wednesday afternoon, as the Legislature rushed to close an extended 1993 session. In a flurry of activity, dozens of bills that had languished in what has been a slow and largely unproductive year came under last-minute consideration.
 
New Hurdles for City
 Later Wednesday, negotiators for Mr. Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, were trying to wrap up several major bills before daybreak today, when the lawmakers were hoping to adjourn until the fall.
Just minutes before midnight Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo signed legislation to extend rent-stabilization laws for four more years. The law includes new provisions, the first major changes to the rent regulations in 20 years, that are intended to remove rent protections from wealthier tenants by exempting apartments that rent for $2,000 a month or more from the laws.
The Dinkins administration said the legislative compromise on the incinerator removed a major obstacle and would allow the city to move ahead with its application for state permits on the project. But they acknowledged that the agreement, by only partially exempting the city from the air-pollution rules, could still lead to delays or drive up the cost of the $450 million incinerator, which is scheduled to begin operation in 2000.
"As it's framed now, it does leave some hurdles and that we'd rather not have," said Emily Lloyd, the city's Commissioner of Sanitation. "But it makes official the idea that our solid-waste management plan does go a long way to improving air quality."
Opponents of the project, including environmentalists and community groups from neighborhoods surrounding the Brooklyn Navy Yard, said the compromise -- while not killing the project outright as they had hoped -- provided them with new ammunition to attack it.
"It definitely provides new openings to delay or block it," said Larry Shapiro, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization.
 
Last-Minute Hitches
 The compromise was reached after 24 hours of fitful and sometimes frantic negotiating in which a tentative agreement to exempt the incinerator completely from the regulations was reached on Tuesday afternoon only to be scuttled after a late-night lobbying effort by opponents, mainly Democratic Assembly members from Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The Dinkins administration has lobbied vigorously to exempt the incinerator fully from the regulations, saying the air pollution rules would place impossible demands on the city and virtually kill the project. Those regulations say that before the city opens the incinerator, it must first reduce more air pollution citywide than the incinerator is expected to create.
The Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator, which is designed to burn 3,000 tons of waste daily, will enable the city to close aging incinerators in Queens and Brooklyn and reduce its dependency on the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, city officials say.
Wednesday's agreement still requires the city to reduce air pollution citywide by a greater amount than what the Brooklyn incinerator would produce. But it allows the city to do that largely by taking into account the closing of old incinerators in Maspeth, Queens, and in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as well as dozens of small apartment incinerators around the city. The apartment incinerators and the Maspeth incinerators have already been shut down.
Under the agreement, the city must study the possible health affects of the incinerator on the neighborhoods surrounding the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Opponents of the incinerator have said it would increase air pollution and pose a cancer risk to residents in neighboring areas like Williamsburg and Fort Greene.
 
More Review
 The agreement also requires the city to study the health effects of the incinerator in neighborhoods within three miles of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the city is seeking to begin other municipal projects.
Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and a leading opponent of the incinerator, said the city will have to conduct such a study before it builds a planned sanitation garage on South Street in his district.
Whether the city might have to shut down additional sources of air pollution to satisfy the regulations remains unclear. If so, it could delay the project or increase its cost. But aides to Governor Cuomo said they did not believe that would be necessary.
"The one thing this clearly does is provide better air quality for the city," said Andrew Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff. "We don't believe this ultimately impacts the plant."
The incinerator agreement, which is expected to pass both the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled Assembly, is part of broad legislation intended to bring New York State into compliance with 1990 changes to the Federal Clean Air Act. The state could have faced the loss of $1 billion in Federal transportation funds if it had not passed the legislation this year.
 
Pressure on Legislature
 "This will clean up the air, especially downstate, and it will do so without sitting on the downstate economy," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and chairman of the Environmental Committee.
This morning, negotiators for Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders appeared close to a agreement on a plan to create a dedicated fund that would be used to purchase and preserve environmentally sensitive land around the state.
After being deadlocked for weeks over how to pay for the fund, the negotiators had tentatively agreed to provide $25 million starting in May 1994. Most of the money would be nonrecurring budget items, or one-shots, including $18 million from the refinancing of state debt and $5 million from the sale of state lands. The recurring sources of money would include $1 million a year from the sale of special license plates and $1 million a year from the leasing of underwater state properties.
But many details about the fund were still being discussed this morning, with just hours left in the session. Though aides to Mr. Cuomo said the fund would increase to $100 million in 1995, it was not decided where that money would come from. It was also not clear whether the Legislature and local municipalities would have any say in what land the state could buy, a power some Republicans have endorsed. And it was not clear that the fund would be fully dedicated to land preservation.
Despite the uncertainties, environmental lobbyists said they were pleased that money would again be provided for land preservation. "The three branches of government have made a commitment tonight that the environment deserves a permanent line in the budget," said Neil F. Woodworth, counsel to the Adirondack Mountain Club. "Now they can change their minds, but they basically have made a commitment."
And although money would not be available from the fund until 1994, environmentalists said, the promise of a dedicated state fund would help to preserve endangered parcels in the Long Island Pine Barrens and the Adirondack Park.
In the Pine Barrens, Suffolk County has said it will make available $10 million to finance the first stages of a preservation plan if the state promises to provide $10 million in 1994.
There was little sign early today that the Legislature would reach an agreement with Mr. Cuomo on a plan to take the savings produced by closing state psychiatric hospitals and funneling the money to community mental health programs. Aides to Mr. Weprin were not saying whether a bill agreed to by Senate and Assembly negotiators would be voted on in the Assembly.
Mr. Cuomo opposes the bill because it would restrict his ability to deal with budget shortfalls, and Mr. Weprin has said he may not want to pass a bill only to invite a veto.
In other action, the Assembly gave final approval Wednesday to a measure that would regulate what is becoming a veritable futures market in death, in which people who are terminally ill sell their life insurance policies to companies so that they can have some cash while they are still alive.
The legislation, which was passed by the Senate on Tuesday, seeks to protect AIDS patients, among others who sell their policies, from the practices of some brokers.

HEADLINE: Recalling '88 Drought's Disaster, Farmers Say Deluge Is Not as Bad

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NICHOLS, Iowa, July 6

 BODY:
Five summers ago the worst drought in half a century left the fields around this tiny Iowa town as dry as bleached bones, stunting corn, killing soybeans and driving farmers out of business.
Farmers are recalling that dry summer with some measure of longing this week as the Middle West continues to be pelted by the heavy rain that has flooded the upper Mississippi River. 
 But the fond memories stopped there. The 1988 drought destroyed 45 percent of the nation's corn crop, causing losses of more than $10 billion and forcing thousands of farmers out of business.
No one is predicting those kinds of losses from this year's flood, despite weeks of heavy rains this spring and summer that have cut the production of corn and soybeans in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and northern Illinois by 10 to 20 percent from what had been expected.
Moreover, experts say that while the flooding is pushing up the prices that farmers are paid for their commodities, it should not significantly increase consumer prices for food.
"This is nothing near the damage from the 1988 drought," said Dick Loewy, a commodity analyst in Chicago.
 
$1 Billion in Crop Losses
 That is not to say the losses are insignificant. The Department of Agriculture has estimated that the heavy rains and subsequent flooding along the upper Mississippi and its tributaries have caused $1 billion in crop losses.
And that figure may go much higher. The Iowa Department of Agriculture has put the crop losses in this state alone at $750 million, and some analysts say crop losses may already total as much as $2 billion.
Commodities markets have reacted sharply to the drenching in the upper Midwest with the swiftest rise in prices since the 1988 drought. Soybean futures prices for delivery in November have climbed by $1.25 in the last 20 days, to more than $7 a bushel. Corn futures prices have risen 20 cents to $2.58 a bushel.
[The soybean market closed on Wednesday at $7.15, up 17.25 cents from Tuesday. Corn prices dropped slightly Wednesday to $2.57.]
Nonetheless, commodity analysts and economists say that if the agricultural damage does not grow worse, food prices are not likely to be significantly affected. Though crops in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and northern Illinois have been ruined, other important growing regions are thriving. Farmers in Ohio, Indiana and central Illinois are likely to produce record crops, the analysts said.
 
Meat Prices May Go Down
 Most of the nation's corn and soybeans are fed to livestock and poultry and account for a small percentage of the overall cost of the price of meat in the supermarkets, they said. Corn and soybean meal, for instance, make up about 15 cents of the cost of a pound of hamburger that retails for $1.30, said Michael Sands, an economist with the Western Livestock Marketing Project, a Federal and state research project in Denver.
Mr. Sands said meat prices may actually decrease. As the cost of feed climbs, beef producers often cull from their herds the least productive animals, like cows that have trouble becoming pregnant. As a result, the supply of meat is likely to rise and meat prices are likely to fall for the rest of 1993, followed by falling supplies and rising prices in 1994 as the producers keep animals off the market to rebuild their herds. That was what happened after the drought in 1988.
"At least at this point it looks to us as though this event will be relatively minor as far as food costs," said Mr. Sands. "If your field is flooded, that's a different story. As far as the big picture, though, we're not talking about a major impact."
Grain traders said the effect of the Mississippi flooding on export sales is also likely to be temporary and slight.
 
River Is Overseas Link
 The river provides the link for Midwestern farmers with the foreign-bound freighters down river in New Orleans, but July is historically a slack period for the United States in the global grain trade. Analysts said that even with the corn and soybean losses, the nation would have ample stores of both crops to satisfy international buyers.
"The rains will not affect trade," said Richard Feltes, vice president and director of commodity research in Chicago for Refco Group Ltd., the world's largest futures brokerage house.
And though the rains are no help, the losses are not expected to drive nearly as many farmers out of business as did the 1988 drought, farm consultants and farmers say.
Five years ago, they said, many more farmers were burdened by high debts from buying land and machinery in the late 1970's; losses from the drought then drove thousands into insolvency. Farm debt is significantly lower in the 1990's, the consultants said, and exceptionally good crops were produced last year and the year before. As a result, farmers are in better financial shape overall than they have been in some time, the consultants said.
 
States With Worst Damage
 "I have 175 clients and less than a handful, maybe one or two or three, are hanging on by their teeth and could be forced out of business by the rains," said Dean Phelps, a farm accountant and adviser here. "That's still a lot when there are so few farmers. But in the 1980's, it was much different. There were auctions every week."
In spite of the general view that the flood will not be as devastating as the 1988 drought, some growers feel the opposite. "This will be worst crop losses this farm has ever had," said Gayle Kaalberg, who farms 770 acres just outside this town of 200. "We could use a few weeks of dry weather. But it doesn't seem to be going that way, does it?"
The heaviest damage from the rains has occurred in the two states north and northwest of Iowa -- Minnesota and South Dakota. In Minnesota, according to state agriculture officials, farmers were expected to plant 6.3 million acres of corn, but perhaps as many as 500,000 acres were not planted. State officials estimated that another 400,000 acres are flooded. Corn generally dies or is severely stunted if its roots are under water for longer than four or five days.
In South Dakota, some 250,000 acres of the state's 3.6-million-acre corn crop was not planted because the fields were too muddy, Federal farm officials said.
And here in Iowa, the nation's largest corn-producing state, farmers were expected to plant 12.1 million acres of corn, as well as some 7.3 million acres of soybeans.
 
Water Is Everywhere
 The state's Secretary of Agriculture, Dale Cochran, said that at least 375,000 acres of corn and 1 million acres of soybeans had not been planted. Another million acres of both crops have been damaged from soaking rains and flooded streams.
Economists at Iowa State University, in their latest estimate, predicted that rains would cost Iowa farmers $750 million in crop damage.
Evidence of why that is so is easy to see across Muscatine County, which is drained by the Iowa and Cedar Rivers. Both rivers overran their banks weeks ago, flooding thousands of acres of fields that are now impossible to plant.
Rain runoff from the rolling countryside has burst many drainage pipes and culverts, flooding thousands more acres. And even land on the sides of hills that should be well drained is so saturated that troughs of deep water lie in the furrows between crop rows.
Gary Mincer, a 55-year-old farmer from Riverside, Iowa, a few miles west of here, said a quarter of his 480-acre farm is beneath the water from the Iowa River. "And the planting dates have expired," he said.
But Mr. Mincer said he is in better condition than he was during the 1988 drought. "The higher land away from the streams is going to be damaged by the rain but not to the extent it was in 1988."

HEADLINE: Perot Bloc Is Here to Stay, Clinton Pollster Finds

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Voters who supported Ross Perot in last year's election remain deeply committed to him and are "increasingly skeptical" of President Clinton, who wants their support to win re-election, a national survey released today by Mr. Clinton's pollster has found.
While the pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, said Mr. Clinton could draw support from Mr. Perot's backers, the findings underscored how difficult that effort could be. Mr. Clinton would have to prove that his policies fundamentally improved the economy, the study said, and to persuade the Perot voters that he had significantly changed Government by cutting waste and bureaucracy and greatly curbing the influence of special interests. 
 The survey was commissioned by the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group that was a base for Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign and that has since battled Democratic liberals over what the new President's White House should represent. Today, the council's leaders sought to use the findings to make a case that Mr. Clinton should follow many of its recommendations to draw Perot voters into his camp.
In a strategy for expanding Mr. Clinton's support beyond the 43 percent of the electorate that voted for him and for drawing some of the 19 percent that voted for Mr. Perot, the council cited the survey as evidence that the President must create new jobs, reform Government, demonstrate that he spent taxpayer money with discipline, be more assertive toward Congress and more clearly invoke the values of work, family and individual responsibility.
Given the Perot voters' disaffection with the political parties, Mr. Greenberg said it would not be easy to win their support. "We're dealing with something that's big," he said. "The depth of alienation is so strong and deep, it's hard to imagine they will be moved over to any direction until there is evidence of change."
 
Survey and Focus Groups
 Mr. Greenberg said he had agreed to conduct the study over the last three months because he and the White House were concerned that Mr. Perot could be a serious threat to Mr. Clinton's political future. He said the White House was not involved in the poll and had no role in producing or releasing it, though he planned to share the results with officials there.
The telephone survey of 1,200 Perot voters nationwide was the most comprehensive of that voting group taken since the election, said Mr. Greenberg, who later conducted discussions with six focus groups among Perot backers in California, Maine and Ohio. The survey also included 800 voters who did not support Mr. Perot.
The national survey was conducted from April 12 to April 20, and the margin of error for the full sample of Perot voters was plus or minus three percentage points. The focus groups were held May 13 to May 18, after which the results were collated and studied.
"The Perot block is for real and has considerable staying power," the study concluded. "Perot voters remain committed to their 1992 vote and, for the moment, want to stick with Perot in 1996, even if he were to run as a Republican. That is a measure of their independence and alienation, which will remain important in our future national elections."
 
Opportunity or Danger?
 Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, said Mr. Clinton had an opportunity to form a governing majority just as President Richard M. Nixon did when he followed a "Southern strategy" to win support from disaffected Democrats who had voted for George Wallace in 1968. "Perot supporters, unlike those of third party candidates in the past, have not aligned with either party since the election," Mr. From said. "Rather, they remain a defiantly independent force."
There are obvious contradictions if Mr. Clinton is to pursue the strategy envisioned by Mr. From and Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group affiliated with Mr. From's group. For example, they noted that the Perot supporters were more critical of Congress than any other voting group and urged the President to take on Congress more aggressively.
But such a move could further damage Mr. Clinton's relations with lawmakers in his own party, threatening the future of legislation on health care, change in welfare and other initiatives that Mr. From and Mr. Marshall said the President must get through.
Mr. From played down the damage Mr. Clinton could possibly suffer if he takes on Capitol Hill, saying, "I'm not recommending that he bash Congress but that he take a welfare reform package and push it through, even if there's opposition within his own party."
 
Dethroning the Deficit
 The survey challenged the conventional wisdom that reducing the deficit was the overriding concern of Perot voters. It found that only one-fourth of them cited the deficit as the first or second most important problem facing the country. Far more gave higher priority to the economy, jobs and health care.
While Perot voters wanted Mr. Clinton to succeed and were not particularly critical of his policies, their biggest doubts -- what Mr. Marshall called "a wall of skepticism" -- concerned whether he could deliver what he promised, the survey found.
Mr. Marshall said it was critical that the President demonstrate "much bolder and assertive leadership" or "risk blowing an historic opportunity to bring about realignment."
The survey said the Perot voters represented the "radical middle" made up of conservatives and liberal/ moderates, in addition to traditional independents. Their voting histories were largely Republican, but they were alienated from both major political parties. On important policy questions like improving the economy and family values, they were divided about which party had a better position.
About one-quarter of the Perot voters have Democratic leanings, and another quarter have Republican leanings, the survey found. The poll identified nearly half of the Perot voters as "straight independents" who "stand out for their intense anti-Government and anti-establishment views."
As evidence of the loyalty of Mr. Perot's supporters, the poll found that three-quarters of them now said they would back the Texas businessman if he ran in 1996 against Mr. Clinton or "a serious candidate" on the Republican side, like Bob Dole or Jack F. Kemp. About 13 percent said they would go back to the Republicans, with Mr. Clinton getting 9 percent.
Though Congress is distrusted by most Americans, the survey found that Perot voters were particularly critical of the institution.
"Ross Perot emerges in some sense as the antidote to Congress," Mr. Greenberg said, "somebody who can break through this mess and get things done."
 
Questions on Temperament
 But the survey did find that even his supporters had doubts about Mr. Perot's temperament and questioned whether he would be a reliable leader. But they also see that independence as attractive.
Mr. Greenberg said the easiest group of Perot voters to convert to the Clinton camp would be the almost 20 percent under age 30, who are considered the most politically rootless. Their disaffection is driven by their being among the most financially pressed Perot voters. But they are viewed as open to Democratic appeals because they are anti-establishment but not anti-Government, and 60 percent have never voted for a Republican.
The toughest for Mr. Clinton to win over, Mr. Greenberg said, would be the college-educated Perot backers who clearly would have voted for President Bush had Mr. Perot not been in the race.
Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand America, criticized the survey as a waste of money. "America needs someone who cares for the people and earns their vote," said Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's spokeswoman, "not another study about how to capture the vote."

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
A Switch From Hill to Foggy Bottom Offers a Suddenly Expanding World

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Despite 18 years as a lawmaker on Capitol Hill, Timothy E. Wirth, now Counselor for the State Department and the Administration's point man on global issues, allows that he still has a lot to learn.
There was, for instance, the meeting he convened on May 20, attended by 25 representatives of refugee advocacy groups, experts who every day confront the issue of the many thousands of displaced people in places like Bosnia and Angola. 
 To the advocates' dismay, Mr. Wirth, who has worked to expand his areas of expertise from population control and the environment to other subjects in his new portfolio like human rights, spent most of his time at the meeting lecturing the group to the effect that major causes of refugee problems were overpopulation and pollution.
"Bosnia," one participant said later, "has absolutely nothing to do with environmental degradation."
 
Brighter Moments
 But if there have been some inauspicious moments in the post, there have also been some bright ones. Just nine days before his poorly received meeting on refugees, for example, Mr. Wirth told a United Nations conference that the United States was ending a decade of antipathy to population stabilization programs. As participants cheered, he also declared that his Government now believed that abortion should be made safe and available worldwide. Mr. Wirth calls that speech "the most important thing I have ever done."
Mr. Wirth's appointment last winter was widely seen in Washington as a consolation prize: the 53-year-old former Democratic Senator from Colorado had hoped to be named to a Cabinet post in the new Administration.
But in the several months since then he has embraced his new job with its bulging portfolio, delving into a host of unfamiliar subjects.
The education is necessary for the job, with its wide focus on "transnational issues" -- problems that transcend national borders and are deemed to pose global threats. His province includes the environment, population, refugees, narcotics, counterterrorism and human rights, subjects that Vice President Al Gore calls "central to the world's agenda."
"These are subjects that may have been at times peripheral for diplomats during the cold war but are essential now," Mr. Gore said in a recent interview. "They have already created new international realities that can produce nightmares if we don't deal with them successfully."
 
Advocate for New Agenda
 The Administration says that by consolidating these issues under one official with a rank equivalent to that of Under Secretary, it has elevated them to the same level of importance as bilateral relations with other countries. Mr. Wirth's task is to push to include them in all aspects of American foreign policy.
"That's what I've been asked to do here," he said, "to be an advocate for a new set of issues and to build that into American foreign policy. I'm not shy about trying to get these things done."
Already there have been some pronounced shifts from the policies of the Bush Administration. In addition to announcing the change in global population and abortion policy, Mr. Wirth represented the United States in recently signing the Biodiversity Treaty, which is intended to protect the world's plants and animals.
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, the United States, maintaining that the treaty would be a threat to economic growth, was the only major industrialized country that refused to endorse it. In contrast, at a meeting of a commission in June to translate the Rio accords into action, Mr. Wirth led an American delegation that won praise for proposals on bridging the gap in development between rich and poor countries and on sharing technology to protect the environment.
But as his experience with refugee groups shows, Mr. Wirth has demonstrated little expertise in areas other than the environment and population control. And his diverse portfolio has left him spread thin. "I've had a lot to learn," he said. "It's like cramming for exams every week for the last four months."
Congressional staff members who have worked with Mr. Wirth say he is a serious student who throws himself into his subjects. "He's very smart, and he does his homework," said an aide who has worked with Mr. Wirth on military issues.
Still, he faces other barriers to his effectiveness. He is unschooled in the State Department's bureaucracy, for instance, and despite calling himself an advocate for refugees, he has been unable to move the Haitian and Bosnian refugee problems to the front of American foreign policy concerns.
 
Legacy of Strained Relations
 His relations with Congress, particularly with his former colleagues in the Senate, whom he severely criticized in a magazine article last year, are still in need of repair. Some say his tendency to blurt out his views, unvarnished, has hampered him in building consensus with Congress and with foreign governments.
He also finds himself struggling against the impression that his post is a make-work job created for him at the last minute after he was passed over for Interior Secretary or Energy Secretary, the jobs his friends say he really wanted.
Although denying that he coveted the Energy Department, Mr. Wirth, a native Westerner, acknowledges that he "would have done Interior in a New York minute."
A year ago, friends say, Mr. Wirth was unsure where he wanted to be, except that it was not in the United States Senate. Elected to the House with the reform-minded class of 1974, and to the Senate in 1986 to replace Gary Hart, he had become disgusted with a lawmaker's life, which he described as increasingly shallow.
In April 1992, he announced that he would not seek re-election. Last August, in an article in The New York Times Magazine, he poured out his contempt for the partisan bickering and political posturing that he described as typical of the Senate's work.
 
'Real Issues Get Lost'
 "How many times should we have to count the yeas and nays on Robert Mapplethorpe and the National Endowment for the Arts, or on flag burning or on such mischievous and misconceived ideas as the constitutional amendment to balance the budget?" Mr. Wirth wrote. "Meanwhile, the real issues get lost. The deficit looms larger. Campaign-contribution abuses grow. The Government in Washington, paralyzed by division, falls further into disrepute."
Looking back on that article now, Mr. Wirth says it was perhaps a mistake. "I suspect that if I had to do it again, I wouldn't do it," he said. "One's hindsight is perfect, right? On the other hand, I think it was a valuable commentary, and I think it was important to me to do that when I wrote it."
His friends and former staff members say Mr. Wirth's disillusionment with electoral politics was deepened by the death of a close friend and prep school classmate, Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania. Mr. Heinz was killed in an airplane crash in April 1991.
"When Jack Heinz was killed, he changed," a former aide said of Mr. Wirth. "I don't know what it was. I didn't see the fire in his eye anymore. It was almost as if he began to look at things differently."
Still, Mr. Wirth threw himself into Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign, focusing on environmentalists, the Western states and the youth vote. But despite Mr. Clinton's success with those constituencies, Mr. Wirth was not given a Cabinet post.
In part, friends and associates say, he was done in by the Administration's push to place members of minorities and women in Cabinet positions and by what associates describe as a Republican whispering campaign that tried to link him to a failed California savings and loan association.
 
Acceptance of Reality
 "He knew the reality," said Carter Eskew, a Democratic strategist and friend, explaining why Mr. Wirth did not protest his treatment publicly. "He knew where the problems were. He didn't want to get hung out to dry."
Mr. Wirth is reluctant to talk about all that. He says his goal now is to master his subjects, master the State Department bureaucracy and have an effect on American foreign policy.
"I have found it fascinating in dealing with a very large and very, very sophisticated and subtle bureaucracy," he said. "The State Department has developed to an art form the capacity to say no. But if you figure out how to use the State Department to get all these incredibly good elements going with you, you can have enormous impact. You can have a great success."

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 7

 BODY:
Even as the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies announced a breakthrough in their discussions on liberalizing the world trading system, Japan and the United States engaged in an increasingly tough war of words today over how to reduce Japan's huge trade surpluses, and their talks dragged on inconclusively.
Taking time off from what have turned into a parallel set of negotiations to the Group of Seven summit meeting here, American officials said they abandoned the talks with Japan once, but returned with some reluctance after a personal appeal from Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to President Clinton. Nonetheless, they said, progress has been modest at best. 
 Adding to the strains is the fact that the United States, which wants Japan to agree to measurable results in opening its markets to more foreign goods, wants the talks to continue for years.
Japanese officials have countered that the American proposal to battle Japan's surplus with the United States -- which is expected to top $50 billion this year -- with quotas and market-share targets threatens the principle of free trade, and thus the world trading system. That is why Japan has insisted that it will not budge in rejecting such targets.
 
Bitterness on Both Sides
 The bitterness of the exchanges results from the fact that the stakes are enormous, since the flow of goods between the two countries is so large, and because these negotiations appear to reflect a fundamental mistrust between the two countries.
The basic United States position is that all the years of trade agreements between the two countries have failed to achieve their basic aim: permanently reducing Japan's surpluses. Thus, American officials here said, unless Japan is forced to accept some measurable goals on reducing the surpluses, its markets will not open further.
Japan, on the other hand, is fearful that any benchmarks agreed upon to measure the openness of Japanese markets will be used by the United States as justification for retaliation if Japan does not meet the goals.
A Japanese Government official said that his country was willing to use some measures of progress in opening Japan's markets, but only those that were not based on fixed targets. He added that all that separated the two sides was a sentence the Japanese wanted inserted in the agreement stating that the United States would not seek to transform the agreements into rigid goals that had to be met on pain of being hit with penalties.
 
'Surprised and Confused'
 "We are surprised and confused and very much concerned that the Americans won't include that sentence," the official said. "It should be universally accepted that no target for the future can be allowed in a market economy."
Senior American officials flatly denied that such a sentence was holding up an agreement and also denied they were seeking quotas. They said they were only trying to apply such measures to parts of the Japanese economy that were being improperly controlled by the Government or cartels.
The officials explained today that the United States was prepared to walk away from the talks again, even if that means President Clinton will return home next week without having achieved one of his key aims.
They said that discussions had essentially broken down a week ago, and that the American delegation had flown back to Washington on June 28.
Bowman Cutter, the deputy head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, had just gone to bed, the officials said, when Koichiro Matsuura, Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister, telephoned at 3 A.M. Washington time asking for a resumption.
The call was followed by a round of visits by Japan's Ambassador to the United States to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other officials.
 
A 'Chilly Response'
 "He got a correct but chilly response," said one senior Administration official. That prompted Mr. Miyazawa's appeal, in a letter to Mr. Clinton that the official said asked that the talks be given another try and "hinted at some new ideas" without giving any specifics.
A number of Administration officials resisted the idea, but President Clinton prevailed on them to resume, a senior Administration official said.
The American officials said they have sought to include flexible tests to measure whether Japanese markets are open. For instance, the officials have said, they would consider using such measures as how many Japanese manufacturers were including American parts in the designs of their products, the degree to which American products have been picked up by Japanese wholesalers, or the degree to which American products are designed into Japanese-made finished goods. They said they United States could also use the aggressiveness of Japan's enforcement of its own antitrust laws as another possible benchmark.
"We cannot accept targets or commitments for the future," said a Japanese Government official involved in the discussions. "People would see that as a declaration of managed trade."
But the senior American official said that targets "will be in the agreement. It is non-negotiable."

HEADLINE: Housing Secretary Carves Out Role As a Lonely Clarion Against Racis

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has staked out a striking role: that of a Cabinet-level contrarian on the volatile question of race.
In an Administration that has been largely silent on the subject, Mr. Cisneros has gone out of his way to call racism a driving force behind many social ills, particularly urban poverty. 
 In a recent interview he criticized those he calls "quote, New Democrats," the party centrists being courted by President Clinton. He accuses them of "failing to acknowledge that the problems are as severe as they are." Mr. Cisneros called racism a "malignancy" and "the great Achilles' heel of our nation's future."
 
Change in Subsidized Housing
 Mr. Cisneros's role is more than rhetorical. He is moving to reverse decades of Federal housing policy that he says has not just tolerated racial segregation but promoted it. Most notably, he is trying to make subsidized housing less concentrated in central cities and more prevalent in white suburbs, an effort, he acknowledges, that will be met with fierce local opposition.
"I'm not naive about how difficult this is," he said. "Suburban settings don't want to accept public housing."
Mr. Cisneros, as is his manner, has been careful to avoid criticizing his colleagues by name, though he has cited disagreements with the Democratic Leadership Council, the organizational umbrella of "New Democrats" that Mr. Clinton once headed.
He has been careful to praise Mr. Clinton's racial sensibilities, saying, "I am perfectly respectful of where the President's instincts bring him out on this issue."
 
'Race Is Core of Problems'
 But Mr. Cisneros's critique of urban poverty places him at odds with a view endorsed by many Democrats, including some of the Administration's top appointees.
That view acknowledges the historic impact of racism. But it argues that the quandary of the black urban ghettos today stems more directly from other problems, like family break-up, drug abuse, failures in education and the economic shifts that have reduced the number of well-paying, low-skilled jobs.
By contrast, Mr. Cisneros insists that "race is at the core of the problems which confront America's urban areas" and says, "That is not a message that resonates well with some of the New Democrats."
Mr. Cisneros's housing proposals are also, in many regards, at odds with those of his predecessor, Jack F. Kemp. Mr. Kemp also criticized racial division and talked about the need for poor people and minorities to have choices in where they live. But he placed his greatest emphasis on plans to let inner-city residents improve, not flee, the ghettos, by buying their homes.
It is unclear how much support Mr. Cisneros will ultimately find at the White House. He said the President has been "very supportive" of his views, and in mid-April he gave a well-received presentation to senior White House aides.
But during the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton sought an image of independence from minority advocacy groups, which, like Mr. Cisneros, have argued that racism remains a central fact of American life. And Mr. Clinton has been seeking to court the centrist and conservative legislators most likely to be skeptical of Mr. Cisneros's actions and views.
In a recent interview in his office, Mr. Cisneros summoned several top aides for what became a mini-seminar on race in America.
Recounting a night he had recently spent in the Ida B. Wells public housing development on the South Side of Chicago, Mr. Cisneros painted an eerie portrait of waking to morning fog and young corpses, victims of gang warfare.
In telling the story, he emphasized what he called the "spatial separation" of that public housing complex and others from the rest of society. That isolation, he said, keeps residents away from good jobs and good schools and breeds such problems as violence and drug abuse.
 
New Policy in Dallas
 Conservative analysts have viewed the same circumstances and faulted inert bureaucracies in public schools, rampant teen-age pregnancy or leniency toward crime; Mr. Cisneros argues that the villain is racism.
"This was deliberate," said Mr. Cisneros, contending that even now, Federal rules cause public housing to be concentrated in areas dominated by poor minorities. "This didn't just happen." He characterized the Government's historic attitude as, "Let's just put them on the other side of the tracks and keep them there."
One tangible result of his thinking can be seen in Dallas, where Mr. Cisneros has said he will reverse a previous HUD plan to expand a sprawling public housing development, arguing that it would concentrate too many poor people and minorities in one place.
Mr. Cisneros has also begun negotiations with some suburban governments, like those outside Detroit, to encourage them to accept a larger share of a metropolitan area's subsidized housing. The department may offer financial incentives, like increased block grant money, to governments that cooperate.
Similarly, Mr. Cisneros is looking to expand voucher programs that give residents of public housing the opportunities to move to private apartments in the suburbs.
Beyond the area of subsidized housing, Mr. Cisneros has pledged stricter enforcement of the nation's fair housing laws, which forbid discrimination at any income level.
And he is seeking greater Government scrutiny of banks and insurance companies to prevent discrimination against minority customers.
Some conservatives have accused Mr. Cisneros of reviving a bankrupt philosophy that tries to portray poor minorities only as victims. In a recent article in Reason magazine, James P. Pinkerton, a domestic policy aide to President George Bush, assailed Mr. Cisneros as being "politically correct."
But many housing advocates are praising the new emphasis on race. "It's the most important shift in housing policy I've seen in 25 years," said Florence Roisman, a lawyer with the National Housing Law Center, which provides advice to lawyers for the poor.
 
An Equation of 2 Parts
 At times, Mr. Cisneros's comments seem a bit puzzling. While he has criticized the Democratic Leadership Council, for instance, he has also adopted a good amount of the group's thought and language.
That is the case when he argues, as he almost always does, that the focus on race should not obscure "other questions of behavior and individual responsibility."
Mr. Cisneros also approvingly cites the work of William Julius Wilson, a sociologist at the University of Chicago who has helped provide a theory of the black underclass that draws on both economic and social explanations. What is odd about the reference is that Mr. Wilson came to prominence by de-emphasizing the role of racism; he even wrote a book called "The Declining Significance of Race."
Mr. Cisneros responds by saying that he is simply trying to emphasize both parts of the equation, the role of racial discrimination and the importance of upright personal behavior.
The force of Mr. Cisneros's statements has invited the speculation that he may also be sending a subtle message beyond HUD, toward a President or a party that he may sense drifting toward the right.
Indeed, at one point in the interview while discussing racial issues, Mr. Cisneros sounded as if he might be reprising some of the criticism leveled against Mr. Clinton during the Presidential campaign. For instance, he criticized unidentified people who "play the wedge politics of winning favor with one group by disparaging another."
That sounded very much like what Mr. Clinton's critics had said of him, after he appeared before a group of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's supporters and criticized the rap performer Sister Souljah.
But Mr. Cisneros is known for courting, not confronting, his patrons, and he added that the "particular genius of President Clinton is his ability to find the language that bridges."
He insists that his argument is not with the Administration but with the culture at large.
"I know this is a difficult subject and that people tire of hearing of the role of race," he said. But he added: "It is so clear, the effect that it has in America's urban settings, that I think we have to deal with it."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
MANY LOOSE ENDS MUST BE TIED UP

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 7

 BODY:
An agreement to cut tariffs that was heralded here today as a significant achievement still leaves several contentious issues to be resolved before the completion of an accord to lower worldwide barriers to trade.
Officials at the meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies said today that despite its shortcomings, their agreement could end up as the biggest surprise and their most important accomplishment here, breathing new life into trade talks that have dragged on for years. 
 Under the agreement, reached today by the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Britain, tariffs would be eliminated on products ranging from beer to bulldozers, and from pharmaceuticals to furniture.
 
Beyond Expectations
 Details released today show that the "market access" package is less comprehensive than what had been hoped for, but is nonetheless broader than what had been expected, owing in part to a dramatic last-minute move by Japan to break a logjam by agreeing to eliminate tariffs on liquor.
The package is now expected to serve as the basis for resumption of global trade talks on Monday in Geneva. This talks, known as the Uruguay Round, are sponsored by the international convention known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Trade officials acknowledged that there is a great difference between restarting the seven-year-old Uruguay Round and finishing it by Dec. 15, the deadline for presenting the proposed treaty to Congress, which must vote on the accord without amending it.
In addition, some unesolved issues were just swept under the rug. In that sense, today's agreement is not so much a specific list of tariff cuts as it is a framework for how to proceed.
 
What Is Not Covered
 There was no real agreement, for instance, on tariff reductions for electronics products imported by Europe and wood imported by Japan, both of which would benefit United States companies. Nor is there an agreement on trade in services, leaving unresolved such contentious issues as laws that protect United States shipping companies and let Europe restrict foreign television programs.
In the case of United States imports of textiles and apparel, there is an expectation that some particularly high tariffs will be cut by up to a half, but that is subject to more talks. "The real negotiations on textiles have yet to take place," said Hugo Paemen, a European Community negotiator.
The renewed sense of optimism was nonetheless widely shared.
"Today was truly a breakthrough," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said at a news conference, describing the accord as the largest package of tariff cuts in history. He added that it would create jobs and give "new confidence in not only our trading system but in our economy."
Roderick Abbott, a European negotiator, estimated that the accord would reduce tariffs on trade between the United States and the European Community by 40 percent.
But even if the outstanding issues are resolved among the major traders, the other 100 or so members of GATT must rejoin negotiations and ratify the tariff cuts if they are to become truly global. Some less developed nations that depend on textile exports might want to see deeper cuts in textile tariffs by the United States.
Moreover, elimination of tariffs on industrial products is only one part of the broader GATT agreement being sought. The "market access" talks that took place here deliberately left out the most divisive issue standing in the way of a full agreement -- trade in farm products. Agriculture, as well as unresolved issues like unfair pricing, are to be addressed later this year.
Economists argue that free trade allows each country to produce what it makes best, so total world output rises. GATT estimates that extending global trading rules to cover services, textiles, agriculture and intellectual property could add $200 billion to the annual global income.
But elimination of tariffs and other protection can be painful for industries that are suddenly subject to foreign competition. With the world in recession, pressure for protectionism has been growing and the idea of free trade has been losing its luster.
 
The Trade Categories
 France's leaders have called for protection against products from low-wage countries and have expressed doubts about the market-access agreement. And while the United States supports the GATT process, anti-dumping duties levied on imported steel and the Administration's pursuit of numerical targets in trade with Japan are viewed by both Europe and Japan as violations of free-trade principles.
Today's agreement would phase out tariffs and non-tariff barriers on eight categories of products -- pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, beer and steel, and, subject to some exceptions, furniture, farm equipment and liquor. The United States is particularly strong in pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and might see increased exports.
Another category covers products on which tariffs are higher than 15 percent, which makes imports prohibitively expensive. These affect United States imports of textiles, apparel, glass and ceramics.
For these products, talks are to be held on halving the highest tariffs. United States negotiators said they are proposing phasing in tariff cuts to shield American companies.
Yet another category covers products for which no agreement could be reached. These are electronics, wood, paper, non-ferrous metals and scientific equipment.
For these items, four governments agreed to negotiate tariff cuts that average at least one-third over all the products. This gives countries room to protect certain industries. For instance, Europe might be able to avoid eliminating tariffs on semiconductors if it cuts tariffs for other products enough to average a 33 percent cut for the whole group.
Only two days ago, trade officials were pessimistic about getting much of an agreement. But on Tuesday, trade ministers met until late into the night to prevent what might have been the death of the Uruguay Round.
"There clearly was a looking-into-the-abyss kind of thing," said one participant.
As the clock approached 3 A.M., Japan came under pressure to reduce its tariffs on liquor. Yoshiro Mori, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, and Kabun Muto, the Foreign Minister, said they would have to consult with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and the meeting adjourned.
This morning, Mr. Mori announced Japan's willingness to eliminate tariffs on brandy and whiskey. With that concession, Canada agreed to eliminate tariffs on beer and furniture. The European Community, which had been seeking an end to Canadian tariffs on furniture, said it would reciprocate by eliminating tariffs on farm equipment.

What's $400-an-Ounce Gold Called? A Start

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Now investors know this gold rally has legs. But how's its stamina?
So far, pretty good. Spot gold prices flirted with the level of $400 an ounce yesterday for the first time in almost three years, continuing the blistering rally that began in mid-April. 
 Prices settled back at $395.80, up $4.15, at the London afternoon fixing. In later trading at the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery continued the run-up, settling $4.70 higher at $397.80 an ounce. [Page D15.]
With investors willing to pay almost as much for gold as they were during the Persian Gulf war, is gold readying itself to burst through the psychological barrier of $400 an ounce? Absolutely, say the gold bugs, and not because of some wisp of market opinion that could dissipate in the morning air. This rally, they say, will be around a while, largely because of long-term supply and demand imbalances and a renewed interest by longtime gold investors.
"This is no flash in the pan," said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metal marketing with Credit Suisse. "This is a long-term phenomenon. After more than a decade of poor fundamentals, things look good heading forward several years."
In recent trading, gold has closed near the highs of the day, often opening higher the next morning. The number of open gold futures contracts has risen along with the price, a sign traders say indicates investor comfort with these price levels.
That is not to say that gold is destined to head upward each trading session. Even the most bullish gold traders and analysts say they expect consolidation in coming weeks, as traders take profits. That alone could hold gold below the $400 mark anywhere from a day to several weeks.
And the experts say that gold is certain to hit more resistance between $425 and $450 an ounce, a range in which the prices begin to slow jewelry sales.
But the long-term trends will continue to point upward, as the long dormant market snaps alive again.
The trend underscores the unique investment nature of gold. Since it is both a commodity and monetary vehicle, its market is shaped by the widest range of events, from the collapse of the Soviet Union to violence in South Africa to drops in European interest rates to inflation in China to your neighbor's decision to buy his wife some jewelry for their anniversary.
To a large degree, the seeds of the resurgence of gold were planted during its precipitous fall in recent years that pushed it down as far as $325 an ounce just last fall.
Lack of market action for years pushed out many international traders, particularly Middle Easterners, who moved to other commodity markets where greater intraday movement meant more profit potential.
The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union created new pressure on gold, as the Russian central bank began dumping thousands of tons of it onto the marketplace in a rapid grab for sorely needed international capital. As the price fell, more of gold's biggest admirers lost their affection.
For example, Swiss investment advisers, who had long urged that clients hold at least 10 percent of their portfolios in gold, lowered that figure to zero as the price kept sliding. "One of the biggest factors in Europe's avoidance of the market was that change by the Swiss," Daniel Weissman, head precious metals trader at MTB Bank in New York, said.
The price fall fed itself. Last fall, with gold prices so much lower, Belgian and Dutch central banks sold off gold all the way down to the bottom. "The central banks' action was part of the reason for the lower prices," said Joseph Rosta, research director for the CPM Group, a precious metals and commodities consulting firm.
But all this pessimism set up the rally now under way. Mining companies cut back on exploration because low gold prices made much of it uneconomical. That move, which could not be quickly changed because of the years needed for a single project, was sure to tighten the gold supply.
Gold demand soon exceeded supply. This year, the estimated demand for gold for jewelry and industrial needs is 83 million ounces, according to the CPM Group, up 6 percent from last year. The supply is estimated at only 80 million ounces.
At the same time, more potential demand was being created. The growing popularity worldwide of mutual funds led to the creation of more gold funds -- a ready stable of cash sure to be thrown at the market at the earliest turn. Nine of the 17 offshore gold funds and 12 of the 33 registered domestic open-end gold funds have been established since 1988, according to Lipper Analytical Securities.
Inflation fears in China created another drive in demand for gold that traders estimate has accounted for some 30 percent of the rally. And a huge bet on gold in April by Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, and George Soros, a renowned fund manager and speculator, was the final spark the tinderbox needed.
Now, traders and analysts say, with the market's rise, Middle Eastern investors have jumped back in, pushing prices even higher. Swiss investment advisers raised their recommended holdings of gold to 10 percent again. Gold funds worldwide have been plowing capital into the markets, showing their strongest returns in years. Central banks no longer seem eager to sell gold.
"Small investors, medium-sized investors, institutional investors -- the whole myriad of investors are in now, from all over the world." Mr. Rosta said.

HEADLINE: Iraq and U.N. Open Talks on Limited Oil Sales

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 7

 BODY:
Negotiations on Iraq's request to sell a limited amount of oil to raise money for food and medicine opened at the United Nations today with the head of the Iraqi delegation saying he would stay in New York to negotiate for "as long as necessary."
After an initial two-hour session, the talks were adjourned until Thursday. 
 Riyadh al-Qaysi, the second ranking official in the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, arrived here on Tuesday to discuss a Security Council decision made almost two years ago that permits Iraq to resume limited sales of oil to raise money for humanitarian needs.
Iraq has all along spurned the offer, and therefore Iraq's apparent renewed interest in even restricted oil sales fueled speculation that the trade sanctions voted against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait have been having an effect, with Iraq's foreign reserves dwindling and its population suffering shortages of basic supplies.
The Security Council resolutions on Iraqi oil sales, passed in August and September 1991, allow the country to sell up to $1.6 billion worth of oil, but under strict conditions. About 30 percent of the money raised would have to be used to pay reparations to Kuwaiti victims of the 1990 Iraqi invasion; another portion would help defray the costs of United Nations teams working in Iraq and Kuwait. The portion of the proceeds that would go to Iraq would have to be used only for humanitarian purposes and its disbursement would be supervised by the United Nations.
In rejecting the offer, Iraq has complained that the restrictions were an intrusion on the country's sovereignty. Among the specific issues to be negotiated is a requirement that the oil sold by Iraq would have to be shipped via a pipeline through Turkey, which would be easier to monitor than if the sales were allowed at Iraq's own ports on the Persian Gulf. The Iraqis have said that the fees they would have to pay Turkey are too high.
The apparent desire of the Iraqis to make a breakthrough on the issue led oil prices to fall last week to their lowest level since the Persian Gulf War. The decline came after the American representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said the United States would not object to Iraqi oil sales if the Security Council's conditions are respected.

Iraq Bracing for U.N. Showdown
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 7 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Iraqi Government appeared to be preparing for another showdown with the United Nations Security Council today over its refusal to allow surveillance cameras at two missile testing stations. The cameras are to insure that no steps are taken to develop long-range missiles.
Development of such missiles is forbidden under the terms of the cease-fire agreement negotiated following the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Meeting in emergency session, the Iraqi Parliament voted overwhelmingly to stop the United Nations from carrying out "unfair action" against the country in the future and issued a threat to retaliate against any further American attacks.
"We respect the United Nations, its Security Council and Charter but we can't accept that the United Nations or its commissions take unfair action against Iraq and Iraqis," said the Parliament Speaker, Saadi Mahdi Saleh.

HEADLINE: Haitian Senator Resists Terms of Pact on Aristide

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 7

 BODY:
For Thomas Eddy Dupiton, a silky politician who lays claim to the presidency of Haiti's boisterous and badly split Senate, news that the United Nations is seeking a purge of some of his institution's members as part of a settlement of Haiti's crisis falls somewhere between a surprise and an annoyance.
Although Haiti's army signed an accord last week in New York that is expected to lead to a return of democracy, Mr. Dupiton, the leader of a bloc of parliamentarians who have fought for months to obstruct diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring the country's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, shows no signs yet of giving in.
 
A Donkey Out of Place?
 Told that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who presided over Father Aristide's overthrow in September 1991, had signed the accord on Saturday, Mr. Dupiton, a courtly man with a gift for the quick aphorism, exclaimed, "Each donkey should bray in its own pasture!" 
 United Nations mediators who brokered the agreement, intended to reinstall Father Aristide on Oct. 30, see the agreement of General Cedras as a crucial breakthrough, but in this country, where the political class is habitually frozen in irreconcilable schisms and the flair for political sabotage is highly developed, no one is taking Mr. Dupiton's resistance lightly.
Haiti's economy has ground almost to a complete halt under the weight of international sanctions, including a June 23 United Nations ban on oil shipments to the country. Under the terms of the recent settlement, the embargo cannot be lifted until the Parliament is purged of members who won office in a January election that is widely seen as illegitimate, after which Father Aristide's choice for a new Prime Minister must be ratified.
Although few see any chance that Mr. Dupiton will be able to craft a legislature that could prevent Father Aristide's return, diplomats and Haitian political analysts say that by merely stalling, he is stoking potentially explosive complications that could derail the hard-won settlement.
 
Link to Army Suspected
 In fact, given the adamancy of his resistance, many have begun to wonder if the 51-year-old former New York City messenger and social worker has secret backing from elements of the army.
Mr. Dupiton, a tall man given to fine suits and animated gestures, claims that he has been misunderstood all along. Rather than opposing Father Aristide, he says, he is eager to welcome him home with "a kiss of peace and a fraternal hug."
Mention of the nine contested senators and four deputies who were elected in January, however, elicits a more combative response.
"If Father Aristide persists in questioning the right of the parliamentarians in saving the country, we must understand that he wishes for the explosion of the state," he said. "The only thing I can do is maintain my serenity and wait for their attack, saying, 'Fall on me. You can hurt me, but you can never vanquish my spirit.' "
 
Preparations for Exile?
 Political adversaries say they have learned to watch carefully what Mr. Dupiton does and not what he says.
"He is buying goods and houses and land in New York, and I have precise information," said Rony Mondestin, a rival senator. "He is benefiting from this crisis."
Father Aristide's allies, meeting to figure out how to peacefully force the contested senators from office, have concentrated so far on conciliatory gestures. One widely circulated idea has been to offer jobs to two or three of the senators who would lose their positions, or promise not to oppose them in a future election, hoping the others would be forced to follow.
But so far, Mr. Dupiton has shown no sign of accepting a graceful way out.
"I don't know what people mean by the term normalizing the Senate," he said, "but since we already consider ourselves normal, the question is closed."

HEADLINE: State Police Link Possible 18th Victim to Suspect in Slayings

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 7

 BODY:
State police officials said today that they were intensifying their investigation of Joel Rifkin, the unemployed gardener who confessed to killing 17 women, after linking him Tuesday night to a possible 18th victim that he had not told them about.
The latest victim, Mary Katherine Williams, 31, an aspiring actress originally from Charlotte, N.C., was identified by the Yorktown police as the woman whose naked and badly decomposed body was found Dec. 21 in a wooded area of Westchester County. She is the first victim Mr. Rifkin did not confess to killing, but whose death has been connected to him through evidence the police collected in a search of his East Meadow bedroom.
 
Inquiry to Widen
 "It is clear that Mary Katherine Williams is now one of 18 possible victims," Capt. Walter Heesch of State Police Troop L Headquarters in East Farmingdale said in a statement. "Although Joel Rifkin did not state to investigators any details of that particular case, identification papers bearing her name were found in Rifkin's bedroom." 
 Credit cards belonging to Ms. Williams, taken from Mr. Rifkin's room, allowed the police to trace the victim to Charlotte, where her father, Dr. Egbert Williams, provided her dental records for a positive identification, said Lieut. Anthony Masi, of the Yorktown Police Department.
State police say the total number of Mr. Rifkin's victims, whom he described as prostitutes he had patronized, is unknown. So far, the police have connected 10 women by name to Mr. Rifkin and four others whose bodies have not been positively identified. Another newly identified victim was Maryann Holloman, 39, whose body was found in a 55-gallon drum in Coney Island Creek last July.
"The 17 number was based on his admitted cases," said State Trooper Kelly Shonholz, a spokeswoman. "This case in Yorktown, the whole investigation, came about based on evidence that we found in his home, not on his confession."
Officials say their investigation, the most extensive since the capture of another serial killer, Arthur Shawcross in Rochester in the early 1980's, would broaden. There are 50 state police investigators and troopers -- along with countless local law-enforcement officials -- sifting through evidence found in Mr. Rifkin's room and checking it against the records of women whose bodies have been discovered in the last few years.
Robert Sale, Mr. Rifkin's attorney, said he would not comment on the new allegations. In the past, he has complained that the police were unjustly seeking to blame Mr. Rifkin for a disparate array of unsolved crimes in the New York region.
 
Questions About Search
 Today, Mr. Sale said he had asked the Nassau County District Attorney, Denis E. Dillon, to investigate the search the police conducted of Mr. Rifkin's bedroom, about which he said he had "serious questions." He declined to specify his misgivings.
Ed Grilli, a spokesman for Mr. Dillon, said an assistant district attorney had so far found no irregularities.
Investigators declined to say whether Mr. Rifkin's link to Ms. Williams had altered their view of the confessed serial killer's selection of victims or his approach.
"I don't know if it indicates a different m.o. for him," Trooper Shonholz said, using the abbreviation for modus operandi. "It may indicate that he obviously didn't tell us everything. Not all of these women have been confirmed prostitutes either."

HEADLINE: $166 Million Distributed for Summer Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it was distributing $166.5 million to the states for additional summer jobs for poor teen-agers, bringing to 700,000 the number of jobs available to them. .
Despite the new money, the number of jobs is just half the 1.3 million the Administration had planned to provide this year. In his $16.3 billion proposal to stimulate the economy last winter, President Clinton sought $1 billion for summer jobs in addition to the $868 million left over from last summer and available from earlier appropriations. 
 But the request was withdrawn after a Senate filibuster led by Republicans, and Mr. Clinton had to settle for the $166.5 million, which was included in a $1 billion appropriations measure passed by Congress last Thursday.
The jobs for the poor aged 14 to 21 include clerical work in city offices, recreational work at parks, nursing assistance in hospitals and supervision of children at day-care centers.
A Labor Department survey of 40 cities in May and early June suggested that federally subsidized jobs would be available this summer for only about half the applicants.
The additional funds now being distributed include about $408,000 for states like Delaware, Hawaii, North and South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming, to $12 million for New York and more than $21 million for California.

HEADLINE: Office Rents Tops in Tokyo

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 7

 BODY:
Office rents in Tokyo were the highest in the world in a 1992 survey of such charges in major cities, but placed second to London if other costs like taxes and management fees were included, Japan's Economic Planning Agency said today.
An agency official attributed the high rents to demand in Tokyo, noting a vacancy rate of 5 percent compared with 15 percent in New York. He said the agency surveyed office rents in the best business districts in major cities. 
 The official said the average monthly rent for 37 square feet of office space in Tokyo was $379. It was followed by Paris at $306; London, $251; Frankfurt, $217; New York, $182; Chicago, $134; Los Angeles, $126, and Brussels, $100.

HEADLINE: George Squibb Dies; Drug Executive, 78, Chided the Industry

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
George S. Squibb, a retired drug company executive who sometimes criticized the pharmaceutical industry, died on Sunday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 78 and lived in Jamestown, R.I.
The cause of death was heart failure, a family spokesman said. 
 Mr. Squibb worked for 30 years for E. R. Squibb & Sons, which was founded by his great-grandfather, Edward.
Early in his career, Mr. Squibb worked in the company's distribution and sales divisions. In 1949 he was promoted to secretary of the company and in 1953 became the director of domestic administrative operations. Later he was the vice president in charge of sales and marketing.
In 1967, after he retired, he gave testimony critical of the pharmaceutical industry before the Senate Subcommittee on Monopoly.
He accused some in the industry of "exploitation of medicines used in life-preserving situations by setting prices far above the cost." He said this was wrong "no matter what justification or economic temptation is felt by the manufacturer."
Because of the public need for medicine, he said, the industry has a special obligation and should lower prices even if it means lower profits. He also said the industry sometimes did poor research and wasted money.
Mr. Squibb was born in Brookline, Mass., and grew up in Providence. He graduated from Harvard in 1936 and earned a law degree at New York University in 1953.
He was the former commodore of the Larchmont and Saunderstown Yacht Clubs and past president of the National Club Association of Washington and the Dunes Club in Narragansett, R.I.
His first two wives, the former Ida Ellerson and Beatrice Read, are dead.
He is survived by his wife, the former Thayer Keeler; two sons, George S. 3d of Pomfret, Vt., and John E. of North Branford, Conn.; two daughters, Colin Reeves of Little Rock, Ark., and Mary Patterson Squibb of Denver, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Prices Continue Rally As Fears of Inflation Grow

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures continued their move higher on New York's Commodity Exchange yesterday as interest rate cuts in Europe helped touch off inflation fears.
On other markets, soybeans rallied while grains fell, energy futures declined, copper rose and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Trading in gold futures followed movement in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 key commodity prices, considered an indicator of inflation.
The index fluctuated broadly in reaction to the selloff in grain and energy futures, and gold responded in kind, Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said. But gold recovered well and maintained its gains, she said, approaching the $400 threshold.
Contributing to gold's strength was instability in the currency markets, where traders were shifting some money to gold, Ms. Raptopoulos said. She also noted that Germany and other European countries had cut interest rates to stimulate their economies, which could cause inflation.
Gold for August delivery settled $4.70 higher at $397.80 a troy ounce; July silver was four-tenths of a cent higher at $5.10 a troy ounce.
Soybean futures continued their rally on the Chicago Board of Trade as wet weather plagued the Midwest crop area and forecasts called for more rain.
The Agriculture Department's crop progress figures, released Tuesday, indicated that more than four million acres intended for soybeans remained unplanted through Sunday. Some acres that have been planted are threatened by flooding and disease because of the rain.
Grain futures fell as traders decided to take profits from Tuesday's price surge.
Crude oil futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange on weakness of gasoline futures, which declined on rumors that several ships carrying European gasoline were sailing to the United States.

HEADLINE: 9 New Jersey Hospitals Sue Blue Cross Over Ban

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 7

 BODY:
Nine hospitals that were excluded from a program of managed medical care filed suit in Federal court here today against Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Jersey, charging that the program violated antitrust laws.
Blue Cross-Blue Shield, New Jersey's largest health insurer with 2.3 million customers, eventually wants to enroll most of its policyholders in a health maintenance organization. It announced in April that it had signed up 56 of the state's 85 acute care hospitals for the program; they would provide services at reduced rates in exchange for high patient volume that allows some economy of scale. 
 The issues in the suit reflect the turmoil that underlies the national debate over health-care reform, as insurers, doctors and patients confront the fact that reduced costs often equal reduced choices on where medical care is offered.
 
29 Hospitals Left Out
 "What you are seeing here is someone trying to stop a runaway train by standing on the tracks and waving their hands and yelling, 'Stop!' " said Fred Hillmann, a spokesman for New Jersey Blue Cross.
He said the insurer was aware of the suit, although it had not yet seen it. "From everything we know, it is a frivolous suit and proves that anyone can hire a lawyer," Mr. Hillman said.
Although 29 hospitals were left out of the new managed care network, only nine of them joined in the lawsuit, he noted. "If this is such a critical question, why aren't the 20 others involved in this suit?" Mr. Hillman said.
Representatives of the hospitals bringing the suit said the others had chosen to seek remedies through legislative or other paths.
 
Hardship on Patients Seen
 Dr. Joseph N. Micale, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey, said that while the society is not a party to the lawsuit, it "shares the concerns over access and quality of care with the hospitals filing the lawsuit."
While the society understands the need to look at the role of managed care in the health-care system, he said, "Blue Cross's recent decision to exclude certain hospitals from its HMO Blue network places a tremendous hardship on many patients who have had their access to care severely reduced."
Judah I. Labovitz, the lawyer for the nine hospitals in the suit, said that a major issue is a Blue Cross requirement that participating hospitals agree not to charge a competitive insurer a rate any less than it charges Blue Cross without automatically giving Blue Cross that same rate.
In doing so, Mr. Labovitz said, "Blue Cross has sought to fix prices and restrain competition from alternative health care plans."
He also said that the big insurer had discriminated against non-network hospitals by announcing that it would pay subscriber claims to network hospitals within 48 hours, but could take up to 60 days to make payments to non-network hospitals under law.
Mr. Hillmann of Blue Cross said, "If we do that, it is part of getting an additional discount" for quick payment. "We negotiate contracts to benefit our subscriber base," he said.
Mr. Labovitz said that no date had been set for a hearing in the case. He also said that he would seek an injunction to stop implementation of the new managed care plan, but acknowledged that he had not yet done so pending some response from the insurer.
The nine hospitals taking part in the suit are Beth Israel, Passaic; Dover General, Dover; Hospital Center, Orange; Montclair Community, Montclair; Newcomb Medical Center, Vineland; Palisades General, North Bergen; St. Elizabeth, Elizabeth; St. Mary's, Passaic; and Warren Hospital at Phillipsburg.

HEADLINE: Revolution of People Power Wells Up in the Bronx;
Residents Who Survived Bad Times Alter Development Plans for Their Neighborhood

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Tissue-thin maps laced with a tangle of free-hand drawings covered the tables and walls of an urban planning studio where small clumps of architects and designers were sketching their vision for a new 30-block community in the South Bronx.
Theirs is an atypical atelier -- a ground-floor apartment on Courtlandt Avenue in Melrose. Even unlikelier, however, are their partners in planning -- a group of neighborhood people who not long ago beat back the plan and the possibility of eviction from their houses, apartments and stores. 
 Tales of scrappy residents heading off development schemes are reasonably standard fare in a city that roots for the underdog. But what's going on in Melrose is something else again: In an effort that city officials admit must be the wave of the urban-renewal future, Yolanda Garcia, Glen Stupart, Pedro Cintron and dozens of their neighbors have become grass-roots planners in dissecting, discussing and developing a new design for Melrose Commons, a housing development proposed for an area long buffeted by arson, abandonment and crime.
With each park, building and plaza they help design, residents say, they are insuring that they will not be rewarded for staying put during the lean years by being pushed out to make way for progress.
It is a sign of changing times -- or grass-roots revenge -- that this comes in a borough whose decline some trace to the master builder Robert Moses and his community-be-damned attitude when the Cross Bronx Expressway steamrolled through neighborhoods that never quite rebounded.
"If this area deteriorated, it wasn't because of the people -- it deteriorated because of poor city planning," said Yolanda Garcia, a leader of the We're Staying Committee whose family has owned a carpet store on Third Avenue for decades. "If we kept our area up when it was in dire need of repair, we should be part of the progress."
Officials say the collaboration has caused them to question how they have planned in the past, adding that such grass-roots partnerships that involve residents in planning rather than after-the-fact reviewing will increasingly determine the fortunes of any large, publicly financed urban renewal project.
"People have to feel they have to create and own whatever is happening in their communities in order to feel an interest in sustaining it," said Richard A. Kahan, chairman of the steering committee for the Bronx Center, a major development plan that encompasses Melrose Commons. "This is the strongest and most effective way to carry out an urban renewal process. The priorities have to be from the community. It's not about us selling our priorities."
 
Scaling Back
 Plans for Melrose Commons date back to the early 1980's, when city planners and housing officials tossed about ideas for development of what had become the largest contiguous stretch of municipally owned land in the city -- a tract that snaked through the area south of 161st Street, to the east of Yankee Stadium. At one point, they envisioned a middle-income community of 4,000 units spread out among 30 city blocks of small, attached houses. The plan changed as officials grappled with financing, and in its most recent incarnation was scaled back to 2,600 units and became part of the Bronx Center, a 300-block agenda of government, housing and commercial construction.
The planners now envision a mixed-income Melrose Commons. But there has been one constant throughout -- relocation. An environmental impact statement conducted in preparation for certification by planners and the City Council estimated that at worst, 78 private homes, 80 businesses employing 500 workers and 400 tenants might be displaced. While certification would have provided for a public comment period, some members of the plan's steering committee said Melrose Commons was being touted as a fait accompli.
"That was consistent with this whole idea that there's nothing there so let's clear it out anyway," said Harry DeRienzo, a housing advocate and member of the Bronx Center steering committee. "There was a whole community there, but no one ever walked the streets to talk to these people."
 
Angry Confrontation
 Residents said they first learned about Melrose Commons last summer, when one of their neighbors bumped into a city worker who was taking notes outside her house. When the Bronx Center people conducted a series of public forums late last year, Pedro Cintron angrily confronted city and borough officials.
"I got up and told them, 'Hell, no!" said Mr. Cintron, who has lived in Melrose for some 30 years. "How are you going to come here and bring out-of-town people and advocate on our behalf? They don't even know we're here."
Mr. Kahan, who had sat wordlessly in the audience, said it was a turning point in his thinking about the project. The abstractions of computer screens and blueprints had collided headlong with the realities of flesh-and-blood people.
"There was an issue here and a group of people here that we hadn't reached," said Mr. Kahan, who once headed the state's Urban Development Corporation. "This is about people living here who want to stay. We may have touched on it in an intellectual way, but after that meeting it was a very visceral issue."
With the encouragement of the office of Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, the group met several times with city officials and were given the services of an organizer, who helped them form the We're Staying Committee. Borough officials also helped to halt the plan's certification while the group canvassed residents and met regularly to redraw the plan.
 
Gaining a Constant Role
 Among the group's goals are a gaining a constant role in the new plans, eliminating the need for relocation, and if some relocation is unavoidable having current residents receive priority for any new housing.
Working out of office space donated by a longtime resident, the group convenes weekly, sometimes traveling downtown to learn of new programs from various city agencies. During a recent meeting they discussed the possibility of attracting Federal funds for housing for the elderly as well as debating how much parking is needed for new houses.
They had already met with officials from the Department of Transportation to go over street patterns, which cannot be substantially disrupted without requiring additional environmental impact studies. They had also scrapped plans for a four-acre park that would have been in the development's center, after residents criticized it as an indefensible magnet for addicts and criminals. Instead, they are discussing the possibility of a series of mews running through the area, as well as smaller parks and plazas that would become the focus of neighborhood life.
The group gathered around a long table and began to toss out ideas for what to do with a proposed park near public restrooms on East 161st Street near Courtlandt Avenue.
"We want the comfort station to stay and become a market, a taxpayer where the merchants could take care of the park, too," she said.
Glen Stupart, who has lived in the area for 15 years, scanned the maps at a recent meeting and explained how he wanted the plan to respect the community's old-fashioned values.
"We have mom-and-pop stores, extended families and there's a certain manner the community has established, a way of life we have that's not commonplace everywhere," he said. "Those are ideas that have served this community well."
 
'Aware of What's Happening'
 "We got people understanding and aware of what's happening," said Hector Rodriguez, a member of the We're Staying Committee. "They really have an idea of what's about to happen, and the city came forward and gave us an opportunity to work on it."
City planners and housing officials said they have been impressed with the group's commitment to making the plan work. "Where we are now is at a very collaborative effort," said Sarah Gerecke, Assistant Commissioner for Production and Planning at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "They're interested in learning what it takes to make this happen."
Bernd Zimmerman, the former head of the Bronx city planning office who now works for the Borough President, said there was some truth to the resident's complaints that they were mostly unaware of what was in store for their area unless they happened to speak with their community board or with other city agencies.
While many of the public officials involved in the project portray it as a successful example of government's heeding the demands of the people, many in Melrose remain wary. After all, residents said, they are dealing with the same people who formulated the original concept.
Indeed, committee members vowed to continue organizing their neighbors to remind politicians that they cannot be taken for granted and they have set a deadline of July 26 for the final revised plan, well in advance of the primaries. To drive home their point, they have also embarked on a voter registration campaign.
"The government is cooperating but by no means are they the savior," Ms. Garcia said. "We want to make sure all the promises are kept. If the project takes 10 years to complete, we'll be around for 20."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Yields Stay Near Lows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Interest rates were little changed yesterday as traders and investors marked time while yields on Treasury notes and bonds remained near their lowest levels in 20 years or more.
With yields so low, many investors are wary about new purchases of long-term Treasury issues. But with short-term interest rates barely above 3 percent, they are not willing to ignore the long-term market completely. 
 Three-month Treasury bills are at their lowest level since 1963, according to a Salomon Brothers compilation of monthly average interest rates since 1945. Two-year notes are about the lowest since early 1965, and long bonds are the lowest since early 1973.
For many investors, the answer has been to follow a middle road, buying issues that seem unusually cheap and avoiding investments aimed at profiting from a rise or fall in rates. These investors figure that even if bond yields rise, causing prices to fall, the extra yield they have earned by holding bonds rather than short-term issues will more than compensate for the price declines.
 
 
Market Is 'Too Choppy'
 "The market has become too choppy, with a big swing to higher rates when inflation looks like it is rising, and then a few weeks later another swing in the opposite direction when inflation looks lower," said Eric K. Cheung, a vice president and manager of fixed-income securities at the Wellington Trust Company of Delaware.
For the moment, the Treasury market is "fairly priced," Mr. Cheung said, as long as the Federal Reserve keeps the overnight rate for bank loans at 3 percent and inflation stays in a range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent. But he expects higher rates by next year, particularly for short-term maturities, as people become more willing to spend rather than to accumulate savings at very low interest rates.
Late yesterday, the Treasury's new 4 1/8 percent notes due in 1995 were offered at 100 1/4, unchanged, to yield 3.99 percent, while the 7 1/8 percent bonds due in 2023 were 105 25/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 6.67 percent, down from 6.68 percent on Tuesday.
 
 
New Mania for Munis
 In the municipal market, securities dealers anticipate stronger demand when investors recognize that Federal tax rates will rise for those with high incomes. In addition, they believe that many investors whose bonds were retired before maturity when local governments issued new bonds have still not reinvested the proceeds.
Such expectations led securities dealers to set yields on a new $355.3 million issue of the New York Local Government Assistance Corporation high enough to insure a quick sellout.
A member of the syndicate of securities dealers that handled the sale said, "There was some good institutional demand, but underwriters still took down some of the issue, and there are bonds available on the street."
The Local Government Assistance Corporation, which was created in 1990 to issue bonds to finance New York State's accumulated deficit and eliminate the state's annual spring borrowing, is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. The S.& P. rating is slightly higher than the A- rating it assigns to New York State's bonds because the state is required to put a fourth of its sales tax receipts in a special reserve fund, which can be used only to pay interest and principal on the corporation's bonds. In addition the corporation is allowed by law to issue no more than $4.7 billion of bonds.
 
 
State Corporation's Offering
 The corporation's bonds were offered yesterday through Goldman, Sachs & Company, with yields ranging from 4.4 percent for bonds due in 1999 to 5 percent in 2003 and 5.59 percent in 2011. Longer-term bonds included issues yielding 5.63 percent in 2013 and 2017 and 5.760 percent in 2018.
Investors seeking higher yields on bonds whose interest payments are exempt from New York State, New York City and Federal income tax may wait until the week of July 19, when New York City is expected to come to market with an offering of more than $700 million.
Dealers estimated yesterday that a city bond due in five years would yield about 4.9 or 5 percent, with 10-year bonds at 5.40 or 5.50 percent and bonds due in 20 years and more yielding slightly more than 6 percent. Those yields were unchanged from late last week when S.& P. said it would retain its A- rating on city bonds. Moody's reduced its rating on city bonds to Baa-1 a few years ago.
The city is one of the few issuers in New York that offers a 6 percent yield. This keeps demand strong enough that few of its bonds are available, except when new issues are offered.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Up but Dips Vs. Yen as Group of 7 Meets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against major European currencies but weakened against the Japanese yen as leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations met in Tokyo.
Randolph Donney, the director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, said trading was relatively quiet, with news reports fueling the dollar's action against the yen and European denominations. 
 "It was pretty much waiting and watching to see what comes out of the G-7 at this stage," Mr. Donney said.
A Japanese news account quoted unnamed finance ministry officials as suggesting an exchange rate of 95 to 105 yen to the dollar was acceptable to the Japanese Government. That helped depress the dollar toward that range.
The dollar recovered somewhat on news from the meeting that the United States and its major trading partners had reportedly rescued stalled trade talks by agreeing to lower tariffs on hundreds of goods.
In New York, the dollar was quoted late yesterday at 107.65 yen, down from 108.83 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 108.55 yen, up 0.30 yen from the Tuesday close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 107.68 yen.
Mr. Donney said a British news report that interest rates in Britain could come down in the near future had bolstered the dollar against the British pound. That strengthening also helped the dollar gain against other European currencies.
 
British Pound Lower
 Lower domestic interest rates tend to weaken a country's currency, because investors will often seek higher returns elsewhere.
In New York, the pound was trading at $1.4935, down from $1.5025 on Tuesday. In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.4925, down from $1.5104 late Tuesday.
Other late New York dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.7065 German marks, up from 1.7050; 1.5130 Swiss francs, up from 1.5115; 5.7735 French francs, up from 5.7668; 1,551.00 Italian lire, up from 1,546.00, and 1.2852 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2844.
Other European rates for the dollar, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.7072 marks, up from 1.6997; 1.5160 Swiss francs, up from 1.5103; 5.7760 French francs, up from 5.7520; 1.9181 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9100; 1,550.00 Italian lire, up from 1,544.00.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Health Care in Rich and Poor Lands: Some Issues Are the Same.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"Government needs to promote greater diversity in the financing and delivery of health services. . . . Regulation can strengthen private insurance markets by improving incentives for wide coverage and cost control. . . . Spending on health should be redirected to more cost-effective programs that do more to help the poor."
THE message sounds familiar. The medium, however, is not Hillary Rodham Clinton but the World Bank's latest World Development Report, published this week. And the subject is not the $800 billion lavished on the care of 250 million Americans, but the frugal $170 billion worth of services doled out to the 4.1 billion citizens of the globe's low- and middle-income countries. 
 The World Bank's focus is necessarily on who gets access to penicillin and clean drinking water rather than who is eligible for the fruits of modern medical technology like MRI scans and bone marrow transplants. Yet the core economic problems in rationing health services efficiently without much help from free markets (or moral philosophers) seem remarkably similar.
While very little is spent on health in the poorest two-thirds of the world, the report suggests that a little goes a long way. Child mortality has plummeted and life expectancy risen sharply over the last two decades, even in places that are testing humans' lower limits of subsistence.
This is modest comfort, however. The probability of a child dying before the age of 5 is still 30 times higher in Mozambique than in Singapore. By the World Bank's broadest measure of health -- the portion of the average life lost to disabling illness or premature death -- the rich industrial economies are five times healthier than sub-Saharan Africa and three times healthier than India.
Economic growth and education remain the fixes of choice, the main chance for people who are weakened by malnutrition and lacking knowledge of the rules of survival in a world seething with disease. But the bank's economists also point to the failure of poor countries to squeeze the biggest possible bang from a buck spent on health.
For example, basic treatment of leukemia typically adds just one-tenth of a year to an adult's life at a cost of about $5,000. Shifting the $5,000 to the provision of vitamin A supplements for children could generate 10,000 additional years of healthy life. Or it could mean an extra 1,500 to 5,000 years of life if invested in measles immunization.
By the same token, the payoff from relatively cheap improvements in the environment could be awesome. Keeping human and animal waste out of drinking water would reduce the total burden of disease in poor countries by 10 percent. More surprising, eliminating the smoke inside dwellings from cooking and heating could cut childhood pneumonia by half and reduce the burden of disease by 5 percent.
The World Bank staff estimates that a bare-bones package of public health services plus clinical care might cost as little as $12 a person in the neediest countries, yet reduce the burden of disease by 25 percent. Total cost: an extra $15 billion a year, a barely noticeable sum in a global economy with purchasing power that exceeds $20 trillion.
All this may seem frustrating, like one of those public service ads that promise to transform your pocket change into enough powdered milk to nourish a thousand starving infants for a year. If life-saving is so cheap, what are governments doing with the billions from charity and foreign aid?
An easy answer is that a good chunk of the money sent to poor countries is spent on toys for the ruling classes, weapons in particular. The answer emphasized in the World Bank report, one that links the health-care problems of the richest countries to the poorest, is that it is very hard to deliver any service efficiently without a lot of help from free markets. Third parties that only incidentally benefit from cost-effective outcomes -- insurance companies, governments, health delivery bureaucrats -- are not likely to make the right decisions.
For example, poor countries generally spend far too much of their health-care budgets on urban hospitals that offer sophisticated services to a tiny fraction of the population. By no coincidence, much of the subsidies for medical care go to middle- and upper-income families who have the least moral claim to public resources.
A part of the solution, the World Bank report argues, is to decentralize delivery and force deliverers to compete on cost and health outcomes -- in a phrase, to manage competition. But just as there is no panacea for health-care reform in America, there is none for the third world. Someone has to make basic choices about who gets what quality of medical care, and that someone is probably government.
Efficient health-care systems, it seems, may not be able to live with big government. But as a practical matter, they probably cannot live without it.

HEADLINE: First-Aid Kit: Forget Caboodle

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
STATISTICS compiled by the National Safety Council show that each year nearly 13 million children suffer preventable injuries serious enough to require medical attention. Yet too often, the medicine cabinet holds four brands of toothpaste but nothing for a sting or scald. Only after an accident or onset of illness does a panicky hunt begin for items to clean, cure and comfort.
Medical experts say that while a wisely stocked, convenient and orderly first-aid kit may not fully treat a health crisis, its value is in helping to limit pain and complications until a doctor's examination. 
 "It's idiotic not to have one," said Theodore Tyberg, a cardiologist at New York Hospital who helps patients set up kits for home and travel.
Beverly Hoover, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, said: "Cost is no excuse. And you don't need to be a medical student to put a good one together."
What should a thorough kit contain? Experts agree that consumers should not assume that any kit, even one bought in a surgical supply store, is complete, nor that the contents are necessarily safe.
Packaging differences can be confusing. Fancy kits marketed for boaters, campers or hikers may be identical to a generic home kit. And sizes range from wallet to attache case. So priorities must be clear. Is portability, say in a diaper or school bag, important? Do individual doses of ointments make more or less sense than full-size quantities?
Most often, a prepackaged kit will contain much of what you should have. But some items typically in kits are held in disfavor these days. Hydrogen peroxide, not long ago the most popular wound cleanser, "can damage tissue as it's bubbling dirt out," said Inspector Charles DeGaetano of New York City's Emergency Medical Service. Items like tourniquets require expertise; unskilled users can cause a loss of limb or fatally infect the victim's bloodstream.
Skeptically examine the label, which typically says a kit contains perhaps 200 items. "Be careful that most of what you're getting isn't just a million and one adhesive strips in a million and one sizes, and tiny samples and droplets of everything else," Mr. DeGaetano said. Helpful staples, yes. But far from a MASH unit. In addition, know that a lot of what's in some kits may never be used or will expire before they might be needed. Do not let a boast of scissors or tweezers be a deciding factor in paying more. In most kits, they're little better than toys. Buy good efficient instruments separately.
Other extras depend upon household needs. Children need more adhesive bandages, while an elderly person might need ammonia salts. So, a kit you build from scratch may or may not be more economical. Bought a la carte, costlier name-brand items are no better than generic ones. "If you're bleeding, it won't matter whose name is on the bandage," said Dr. Palmo Pasquariello, a Manhattan pediatrician.
Nearly all commercial kits contain basic pamphlets on first aid. Some kits meet American Red Cross standards and are often for sale at fund-raising activities through the organization's 2,700 chapters. Those made by Johnson & Johnson and by First Aid Only are among those that meet the criteria. All hold gauze pads bathed in iodine, antibacterial cream and alcohol, gauze stretch bandages, first-aid cream and antiseptic wipes.
First Aid Only, based in Vancouver, Wash., packages kits in 40 styles that are sold at drug and office supply stores, lumberyards and auto repair shops. The pocket-size "Personal Pack" and the children's "Ow-wee Pack," each with 29 items (of which 18 are adhesive strips), and "Sting Aid Pack, with 25 items (11 adhesive strips), are priced at $3, but discount stores often sell them for half that.
The comprehensive kit of 129 items ($25, often found for $20) contains gauze dressing pads (18), breathable, fabric adhesive bandages (52), an ammonia inhalant, latex gloves (disease barriers), "instant ice" compress, iodine, alcohol and antibacterial pads, eye pads, finger splints and, yes, scissors and tweezers. Versions with flashlight, a survival blanket and flares cost about $10 more.
Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes three popular kits at $5 to $12.
The New York Baby Proofing Company, 476 Columbus Avenue (83d Street), carries seven kits. Its best seller, said Tony Simnowski, a store owner, is the "Boo Boo and Comfort Kit," $35, made by Quality Kids Products in Santa Rosa, Calif.; (707) 527-1727 for direct orders. It holds generous bottles and tubes of antibiotic cream, calamine lotion, acetaminophen elixir, Ipecac syrup, tape and gauze pads, an "instant ice" compress, fever strips and cotton. Tweezers and scissors are a bit better than in the other kits. Animal motifs adorn the graduated toddler-style medicine spoon and adhesive bandages. Ignore the hydrogen peroxide.
Finally, the best first-aid kits are not meant to be portable emergency rooms. "They are there for acute issues," Dr. Pasquariello said. "Let an ambulance do the rest."


GRAPHIC: Here are things to include in a basic first-aid kit, as suggested by a variety of experts. Putting them in a brightly labeled toolbox will keep them organized and easy to locate.
 
FRAGRANCE-FREE SOAP to clean hands and wounds.
 
PAIN-RELIEF TABLETS and children's acetaminophen exlixir.
 
ANGLE-EDGE TWEEZERS to pluck glass and splinters.

New Agency Wins A Toyota Account

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Four former executives at Martin, Davis, Omon & Partners of New York have left the agency to open their own shop: Oasis International Group Ltd. Oasis was awarded the Toyota corporate advertising account last month. The account, previously at Martin, Davis, Omon, has billings estimated at $5 million to $10 million.
The four partners are: Paul Bernasconi, 27, creative director; Rand Pearsall, 36, account director; Eric McClure, 30, media director, and Hilde Oord, 35, planning director. 
 Mr. Bernasconi said Oasis (the name is an acronym for "outstanding advertising sells itself") planned to hire six more employees and seek other accounts.
Tim Andree, group manager of external affairs at Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America in New York, said Oasis was awarded the account after a review that included other agencies, but he declined to disclose their identities.

HEADLINE: Drugs, Crime and Punishment;
The War On Drugs Is Self-Defeating

BYLINE: By Jack B. Weinstein; Jack B. Weinstein is a judge in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
In the debate over national drug policy, too many policy makers, unsure of what might work or why, appear to rely upon what seems politically safe: harsher law enforcement based on more prison time.
A nonpartisan Federal Commission on Drugs needs to be formed. Its object should be to report candidly on the costs, benefits, risks and advantages of present and potential national drug policies. Such a commission could provide the fact-finding and serious analysis lacking in the political climate surrounding drugs. 
 The nation can look for guidance to the Wickersham Commission, appointed by President Hoover in 1929, whose report led to a full debate on Prohibition laws and a constitutional amendment returning responsibility to the states for control of alcohol. Also instructive is the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, appointed by President Nixon in 1971, which recommended ending prosecution for possession of marijuana for private use.
So urgent is the issue that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in a speech in June said, "The law by itself is not going to solve the problems of drugs and violence," raising "questions of public policy which must be decided, not by lawyers, judges or other experts, but by the popularly elected branches of government" -- and ultimately, I think, by a well-informed electorate.
Attorney General Janet Reno, confronting the problem of drug crime immediately upon assuming office, emphasized the importance of reconsidering the existing policy.
America has had three national drug policies. Before 1914, a freedom model reigned. Opiates were sold as over-the-counter household remedies and marijuana was a legal crop. In 1914, we began to tax narcotics to control them, but we, like Britain, relied primarily on a medical model of treatment and prescriptions.
In the 1930's, we embarked upon a strict punitive model, and the medical profession was largely pushed out of the field. The drug supplier-law enforcement complex was enormously expanded by the war on drugs in the 1980's at an annual cost of tens of billions of dollars.
Meanwhile, in my judicial district, the Federal probation service has had to radically cut its drug-testing and medical treatment program; many parents have no place to send their children for help; educational and other nonpenal controls are ineffective, and, too frequently, ghetto youths seek to emulate sellers and thugs who brazenly walk city streets.

Largely because of drug prosecutions, our justice system is in crisis. Nationally, over one-third of all new inmates are drug offenders. Over 60 percent of those in Federal prisons have been convicted of drug offenses.
In the Eastern District of New York, we sentence about 400 drug "mules" each year. These are usually poor people who smuggle drugs, primarily heroin, from Nigeria and cocaine and heroin from Colombia. They are cheaply hired for one trip. Before the adoption of guideline sentencing, they were sentenced to 30 months and paroled in about one year.
Now they must serve an average of two additional years, and sometimes a 10-year minimum, leading to at least 800 more penal years, at millions of dollars of added expense for incarceration in our district alone.
Largely because of mandated and unnecessarily harsh sentences for minor drug offenders, which fail to deter, I have exercised my option as a senior Federal judge not to try minor drug cases.
When I wrote a report on drug laws for the City Bar Association in the early 1950's and then served as chairman of the lay board of the North Brothers Island Hospital -- the first for teen-age narcotics users -- I believed a modified medical model was desirable. In the 60's, as a father I supported some form of criminal model because I thought that it might discourage drug use by young people. As a judge, in the 80's and 90's, I have become increasingly despondent over the cruelties and self-defeating character of our war on drugs.
A national commission could address the difficult questions. How should marijuana be treated? Has it become such a large and widely available cash crop that prohibition is neither attainable nor affordable? (In some districts Federal prosecutors decline cases involving less than a ton, while in other places people are sent to prison for years when they possess a few plants for their own use.)
How dangerous is marijuana? Does it have useful therapeutic values? How much money could be saved in law enforcement by decriminalizing its use? Would savings be offset by an increase in health and other costs attributable to a rise in consumption? Or would we find that noncriminal social controls -- ranging from taxation and bans on smoking in public places to peer pressure -- would reduce use, as they have for cigarette smoking?
For hard drugs, a national commission should consider the tradeoffs between medical controls and education, and our current punitive approach. Our investments in increased law enforcement are no longer providing adequate returns. If we reduce our criminal-penal efforts, how much of the savings could be better utilized for education and medical efforts to decrease demand? What is the optimal balance?
We must also consider moral and religious issues. Would decriminalization imply society's approval? Is there an overlooked moral dilemma in our penal approach that results, for example, in one in four black males in their 20's being under the control of the criminal justice system?
Different strategies might be required in dealing with different sectors of society. An airplane mechanic testified before me that he stopped using cocaine and marijuana when random drug testing was imposed, for fear of losing his job. Should we take greater advantage of alternative forms of control? Would such forms of control help those who may have lost hope for better lives?
Many such questions require analysis by economists, scientists, law enforcement specialists, sociologists, ethicists, religious leaders and others.
In considering loosening legal controls on narcotics, we must weigh the claim that our inner cities would be devastated against the price we now pay in daily body counts from gunfire. Unthinking acceptance of the current policy is unreasonable. It is time to compile the likely results of different drug policies. Only a national commission can do this. If we are fortunate, a national debate would follow. Perhaps then we could reduce the violence, moral degradation and waste associated with drugs in a more humane, effective and cost-efficient way.

HEADLINE: Drugs, Crime and Punishment;
Don't Let Judges Set Crooks Free

BYLINE: By Phil Gramm; Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, is a member of the Senate subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Two Federal judges recently announced that they would refuse to take drug cases because they oppose mandatory minimum sentences. One judge, Jack Weinstein of Brooklyn, confessed to a "sense of depression about much of the cruelty I have been party to in connection with the war on drugs." The other, Whitman Knapp of Manhattan, heartened that President Clinton "has not committed himself to the war on drugs in such a way as the Republican Administration had," hoped his action would influence the President to abandon tough mandatory sentencing.
If the Clinton Administration listens to these voices, and their echoes, and tries to roll back minimum mandatory sentences, it will certainly win applause from some criminal defense lawyers, judges and the media -- and no doubt many criminals -- but it will betray millions of Americans who took the President at his word when he promised to be tough on crime. 
 Contrary to conventional wisdom, most criminals are perfectly rational men and women. They don't commit crimes because they're in the grip of some irresistible impulse. They commit crimes because they think it pays. Unfortunately, in most cases they are right: In America today, crime does pay.
Morgan Reynolds, an economist at Texas A&M University, has calculated the amount of time that a person committing a serious crime in 1990 -- the last year for which we have complete statistics -- could reasonably expect to spend in prison. By analyzing the probability of arrest, prosecution, conviction, imprisonment and the average actual sentence served by convicts for particular crimes, Professor Reynolds has reached some shocking conclusions.
On average, a person committing murder in the United States today can expect to spend only 1.8 years in prison. For rape, the expected punishment is 60 days. Expected time in prison is 23 days for robbery, 6.7 days for arson and 6.4 days for aggravated assault. And for stealing a car, a person can reasonably expect to spend just a day and a half in prison.
Given this extremely low rate of expected punishment, is it any wonder that our nation is deluged by a tidal wave of crime? In trying to account for the six million violent crimes committed annually, analysts point to the breakdown of the family, the effects of television violence and the failure to teach moral values in our schools. While these factors have an impact, they overlook the main culprit: a criminal justice system in which the cost of committing crimes is so shamelessly cheap that it fails to deter potential criminals.
Mandatory minimum sentences deal with this problem directly. When a potential criminal knows that if he is convicted he is certain to be sentenced, and his sentence is certain to be stiff, his cost-benefit calculus changes dramatically and his willingness to engage in criminal activity takes a nose dive.
Again, Professor Reynolds's statistics are revealing. He found that since 1950, the expected punishment for a serious criminal has declined by two-thirds, while the annual number of crimes has risen seven-fold. In 1950, each perpetrator of a serious crime risked, on average, 24 days in prison. By 1988, the amount of risked time was 8.5 days. Over 38 years, soft sentencing -- treating criminals as victims of dysfunctional families, of predatory capitalism, of society at large -- has brought a dramatic decline in the cost of committing a crime and a dramatic increase in crime.
Critics of mandatory minimum sentences point out, often with considerable indignation, that mandatory sentencing denies judges discretion in imposing sentences. And they are perfectly right. That's what we want.
Americans have lost faith in our criminal justice systems. Too many violent criminals have walked away with light or even no prison sentences. Mandatory minimum sentencing is a massive no-confidence vote by the American people in the discretionary powers of our judges. If judges and parole boards were legally liable for the actions of convicted felons who walk the streets due to their decisions, I would have more confidence in their judgment. But they are not.
"But what about fairness?" critics of mandatory minimum sentencing ask. "Is it fair that someone who has never committed a crime in his life should go to prison for 10 years because one day he sold drugs to some kid? Shouldn't we distinguish between a major drug dealer and a minor drug offense?"
Once again, the critics are right: There is a distinction between major and minor drug offenses. A minor drug offense takes place when a pusher sells drugs to somebody else's child; a major drug offense takes place when he pushes drugs on yours. Only when our nation's elites are as outraged about what happens to someone else's child as they would be were it happening to their own will we deal with crime effectively.
Of course, there is the cost issue to be considered. At a time when we are desperately trying to reduce the Federal deficit, can we really afford to sentence more criminals to jail for lengthier periods of time?
Of course we can. In 1990, the Department of Justice's bureau of statistics found that it costs from $15,000 to $30,000 to keep a felon in prison for a year. A Rand Corporation study calculated that the active street criminal imposes a financial cost of $430,000 a year on the general public -- not to mention such immeasurable but very real costs as grief, fear and anger. By Washington standards (or anybody's, for that matter), spending $30,000 a year to save $430,000 a year is a brilliant allocation of resources.
In dealing with our nation's crime problem, cost is not the fundamental issue. Indifference is. I am appalled by the shoulder-shrugging approach some Americans take to the issue of crime in this country. Americans saw the pictures of starving children in Somalia and were outraged; we saw "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and were furious. But our outrage and fury evaporate when American children are the victims of criminals.
Like Judge Weinstein, all too many are ready to agonize over the "cruelty" that mandatory sentencing inflicts on drug pushers, and to overlook the cruelty that mandatory sentencing avoids by keeping these criminals off the streets and preventing them from brutalizing your children, mine or even Judge Weinstein's.
With the end of the cold war, domestic crime is now the greatest threat to the safety and well being of Americans. And just as the U.S. developed a military strategy -- "containment" -- to deter Soviet aggression by raising its costs, so today we need a legal strategy to contain, and reverse, the growth of violent crime.
That is why, along with many other Americans, I am a strong supporter of mandatory minimum sentences. In fact, I will go so far as to say that as long as I am in the Senate, we will be imposing more minimum sentences, not repealing them.

HEADLINE: Immigration Strains California Resources

 BODY:

To the Editor:
That Americans increasingly favor reduced levels of immigration, as a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows (front page, June 27), should come as no surprise. However, it is unfortunate that you use the unnecessarily pejorative terms "anti-immigrant feelings" and "hostility." 
 Previous eras of high immigration to the United States were followed by periods of very low immigration. From 1920 to 1970, immigration averaged only 180,000 a year. In recent years, rates have gone up and up, and now exceed one million a year.
Certainly the economy has something to do with changing sentiments. A recent study by Donald Huddle, a Rice University economics professor, concluded that immigration imposed a net cost of $45 billion on United States taxpayers last year, yet this report received scant attention.
There are myriad other reasons for reducing immigration. Here in California -- destination of almost half the country's immigrants -- the population growth rate exceeds that of India. Half the population growth is due to immigration. Recent immigrants, with their larger families, have driven up the state's fertility rate until it exceeds that of any industrialized country.
Population growth is California's most serious environmental problem. It also plays a major role in the state's educational, economic and budgetary crises.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
7 Nations Hasten Aid to Russia; Will Push for Growth and Trade

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 9

 BODY:
Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies agreed today to provide an immediate $3 billion in aid to Russia and pledged to push for economic growth and lower trade barriers.
The leaders also agreed to send senior officials to the United States this fall for what Administration officials have described as a "jobs summit" that would address the problem of unemployment that persists even when economies are growing. 
 After three days of talks, however, the seven heads of state broke no major new ground in addressing the world's economic problems.
The $3 billion in loans, grants and export credits for Russia was mostly a reallocation of funds previously committed, but the money is to be disbursed more quickly and directed more precisely toward putting state-owned companies into private hands.
The package was put together as President Boris N. Yeltsin arrived Thursday in Tokyo to join the seven leaders on their final day of talks.
The economic communique, a central feature of the talks, was described by Administration officials as reflecting Washington's concerns about the global environment. It also praised the United States for making "long overdue" efforts to reduce its budget deficit and encouraged European nations to lower interest rates.
 
Focus on Unemployment
 "What the leaders perceive is that there are common elements to the problem," said a senior Administration official.
The communique cited widespread unemployment as one of the single greatest threats, saying part of the response hinged on individual nations' efforts "to improve efficiency of markets, especially labor markets." An Administration official said such language was aimed primarily at Europe and Japan, where work rules are less flexible.
Acknowledging that many of the actions the leaders were calling for would require changes in each nation's domestic economic policies, the leaders pledged that their policies would be "mutually reinforcing and compatible with our shared goal of a strengthened and recovering world economy."
The leaders also agreed to "curb protectionism in all its manifestations." That passage is especially significant as Japan and the United States embark on last-ditch efforts today to reach an agreement to reduce the United States trade deficit with Japan.
President Clinton received a warm reception from many Japanese, who have expressed resentment of his harping on Japan's trade surplus and trade barriers.
Mr. Clinton, who has been jet-lagged and stretched thin by a hectic schedule since he arrived Monday, seemed buoyed today by the deal on Russian aid and by a request from the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, for a private meeting over dinner today.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States would contribute $375 million to the $3 billion aid package for Russia and had persuaded other members of the Group of Seven to chip in $125 million in cash and export credits. The balance of the package, he said, will include $1 billion in export credits and $1.5 billion from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other development agencies.
The $3 billion is to be distributed over 18 months.
 
'Real Success,' Clinton Says
 "I think based on where we were five or six weeks ago, this is a real success," Mr. Clinton told reporters Thursday night. "I'm very pleased."
In April the United States had proposed a $4 billion aid package to help Mr. Yeltsin's Government turn state industries over to private control, and suggested that half the money should come from the Group of Seven.
But that plan collapsed because few leaders were in the position to make the unpopular case for more foreign aid. Only Mr. Clinton has won such a battle with any ease; grants covering $125 million as part of the original United States proposal are making their way through Congress now.
In the revised package, the proportions of assistance were adjusted to reflect more in loans from international lending institutions and less in direct cash from foreign governments.
 
'A Huge New Market'
 "I think it shows the confidence in President Yeltsin, and that's very important," Mr. Bentsen said. "Obviously, this by itself cannot make that major a change, but it does give the initiative for them to be able to demonstrate what they can do toward further privatization and democratization of that Government."
Mr. Clinton said the new private industries helped by the aid would eventually provide "a huge new market for American goods and services."
Mr. Bentsen said in a statement: "The job of world leaders is to lead us. For years they've focused on maintaining a nuclear peace. Today, though, leadership is measured by the impact it has on our pocketbooks."
Mr. Clinton is also to meet today with Mr. Yeltsin, who came to Tokyo to make his own personal plea for aid. At a gala banquet at the Imperial Palace Thursday night, Mr. Clinton was seated next to Crown Princess Masako, a former diplomat, with Mr. Yeltsin on her other side.
 
An Important Meeting
 Administration officials were encouraged by Mr. Miyazawa's request for a second private session with the President after it appeared that the bilateral trade talks had stalled.
American officials said that there was no set agenda for the dinner today, but that the prospect of another session raised hopes for a breakthrough.
"I think they are interested in moving our relationships forward," Mr. Clinton said of the Japanese. "Whether we can agree on exactly what the shape of that should be at this time, I don't know."
The leaders sent a somewhat mixed message on Bosnia and Herzegovina, announcing that they would withhold reconstruction aid if a solution was not reached that was acceptable to the country's Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
 
Attack on 'Ethnic Cleansing'
 "If the Serbs and Croats persist in dismembering Bosnia through changes of border by force or 'ethnic cleansing,' they will place themselves beyond the pale of the international community and cannot expect any economic or commercial assistance, especially reconstruction aid," the political communique read.
But the statement did not go as far as the United States has in calling for lifting the arms embargo that prevents arms shipments to the beleaguered, Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government.
"I don't think it reflects a change in their position," an Administration official said, alluding to Western European resistance to military intervention in Bosnia or re-arming the Bosnian Government.
One of Mr. Clinton's smaller triumphs came Thursday with his effort to break down some of the formalities that govern summit meetings. The afternoon meeting ended an hour early, Mr. Clinton said, because the leaders dropped the formal roundtable structure of their previous discussions.
"And we agreed this afternoon to make next year's session even more informal so that we could focus on a few big things, cut out a lot of the bureaucracy and all the other stuff that goes with these summits," he said.

President Hears Complaints On Doing Business in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, July 9

 BODY:
President Clinton today got an earful of complaints from American business people about barriers to Japan's markets, as well as some strong endorsements for his efforts to negotiate a new trade agreement with Japan.
In a meeting with Americans who are trying to penetrate Japan's market, the President and Cabinet officials were told that it is possible for a foreign company to succeed in the world's second-largest market. 
 But they were also treated to a litany of difficulties about doing business here, from deliberate attempts by the Japanese Government to impede American banks to the cultural challenges faced by Domino's Pizza in delivering pies in a nation where streets are not named.
The nearly two-hour forum was meant to be a miniature version of the economic forum Mr. Clinton held in Little Rock in December. But the real audience wasn't the 350 American business people who had shown up at 6 A.M., but Japan's Government and consumers, who would see a united force of American executives and Government officials on television.
 
Clinton Seeks Advice
 Mr. Clinton, who appeared for only the last 35 minutes, said he came "to know what you think we should be doing to help you." He particularly asked for advice in what the Government could do in overcoming cultural -- as opposed to governmental -- problems that make it difficult for American companies in Japan.
The executives who participated in the panel discussion represented eight companies, including Apple Computer, Warner-Lambert and Chemical Bank, that have largely succeeded in Japan, rather than those, like auto companies, that have generally failed.
The idea was to show that even successful companies have problems in obtaining market access in Japan and to avoid the public relations problem encountered by former President George Bush when he came here in 1992 to drum up business for American automobile companies. The trip backfired because it was too easy for the Japanese to disparage the quality of American cars and the meager efforts made to sell them here.
 
Perception 'Lags Reality'
 "You can feel confident that you are representing high quality products," said Richard Dyck, representative director of Teradyne, a Boston-area electronics company, told Mr. Clinton.
"This is an area where public perception, even in the United States, lags reality," the President replied. "That's something we need to hammer home, and we have to hammer it home back home too."
Before Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher came, the business executives spoke with Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen, United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, and Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council. Flanking the stage were logos of American companies from Kodak to Kellogg's who are members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, which sponsored the event.
Some executives endorsed the efforts of the Administration to negotiate a new trade framework with Japan that would use numerical goals to measure Japan's progress in opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. Administration officials said that so far the two Governments remain divided, though there is still some chance an accord might be reached by the time the President leaves here Saturday.
William O. Howe, the president of the Japanese subsidiary of Intel Corporation, a maker of computer chips, said the company had benefited from a semiconductor trade agreement that set a goal of 20 percent foreign market share in Japan. The semiconductor agreement is considered a model for what the Administration wants to do with the broader new trade agreement.
"Without the semiconductor agreement, we would never have had a chance to compete," Mr. Howe said.
Mr. Dyck of Teradyne recommended giving Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company, Japan's main telephone company, an "ambitious goal" for purchases of foreign products. He said his company helped develop equipment to test the telephone company's phone lines in 1988, only to see much of the business of supplying that equipment go to Japanese companies.
"We were asked to become a member of a group of companies specifically to copy Teradyne's technology," he said. "That gives a new meaning to the word chutzpah."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
Yeltsin Arrives in Tokyo As Aid Plan Is Prepared

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
Arriving at the economic summit meeting as leaders of the seven leading industrial nations were preparing a new aid package for his country, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia offered unusually conciliatory words today in an effort to warm decades of icy relations with Japan.
The financial package, announced as a near certainty late today by Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen, includes funds for training, grants and loans to help put Russia's state-owned companies into private hands. 
 Although most of the $3 billion involves just a reallocation of money committed previously by the leading industrial nations, Government officials praised the package because it targets a critical aspect of Russian economic reform -- privatization of state-owned companies.
Mr. Yeltsin got the visit off to a strong start with a cordial statement at the airport. For the first time he stated clearly that Russia's relations with Japan -- a country Mr. Yeltsin has gone out of his way to snub in the past -- "constitute one of the highest priorities of Russian foreign policy."
 
Yeltsin Offers Regrets
 He also responded to a long-standing Japanese demand by offering his personal regrets for having abruptly canceled twice in the past year planned visits to Tokyo.
For some countries it would have been a standard arrival speech, but in the context of strained Japanese-Russian relations it was interpreted as a possibly historic step forward.
Mr. Yeltsin completed his grand entrance by joining the heads of the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- at a glittering banquet this evening at which he was seated next to Emperor Akihito. Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, was placed beside Empress Michiko. The image of this one-time Communist leader seated alongside the Japanese Emperor underscored Russia's rapid integration with the industrialized world.
 
Dispute From World War II
 Japan and Russia have failed to fully normalize relations because of a territorial dispute left from World War II. Japan has demanded that Russia return four islands at the southern end of the Kurile chain that the Red Army seized after hostilities ended in 1945. Even with the end of the cold war, Russia had rebuffed Japanese demands for talks on the issue.
Japan has contributed billions of dollars as part of the Group of Seven's financial assistance packages for Russia, but it has insisted that it will be inhibited from fully helping finance Russia's transformation into a market economy until the two sides tackle the dispute and sign a peace treaty.
Today that seemed to have changed.
"Russia is ready for an extensive and positive discussion of all the problems which are of interest to both sides," Mr. Yeltsin said. "It is my conviction that it is in our power to remove the obstructions of the past and to reach a final peaceful settlement in our relations."
In a 35-minute meeting later in the afternoon, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Mr. Yeltsin that Japan would not demand immediate negotiations over the islands, but he laid out Japan's basic policies of seeking a resolution of this festering problem before relations can be normalized.
Mr. Miyazawa rewarded Mr. Yeltsin by agreeing to proceed with discussions to set up a new date for an official visit by Mr. Yeltsin.
 
Complex Aid Package
 The aid package announced today was complex, and included many parts, but it was intended to push Russia more rapidly down the path of transforming its old centrally planned system into a market economy.
The package contained less cash and more credit than had been originally hoped; the original $4 billion proposal sought by the Clinton Administration would have been half cash.
Mr. Bentsen said that the plan, which was to be announced formally on Friday, the last day of the conference, would include $500 million of technical assistance to help put state-owned companies in private hands, $1 billion of credits to finance Russian imports of industrial equipment and other products, and $1 billion in loans from international lending bodies, such as the World Bank.
In addition, he said, the package would contain $500 million more from the World Bank to help communities where state-run enterprises had previously provided an array of social services. Those services are likely to be cut when the enterprises are sold to the private sector.
Treasury officials said that the United States would provide $125 million of technical assistance and $250 million of export credits. Japanese officials, who are expected to be the second-largest donors, said their Government would provide about $100 million of technical assistance funds and a little more than $200 million in export credits.
The package clearly amounted to less than met the eye. Much of this money, some experts pointed out, is just a reallocation of funds committed by the Governments of the Group of Seven in April, when they fashioned a $28 billion assistance program to boost the struggling Russian economy.
Nonetheless, the package had the advantage over the original plan of being targeted for relatively swift disbursement. Mr. Bentsen said that the aim is to provide the funds over the next 18 months. The original $4 billion plan was expected to run over a period of years.
"It is in the right direction," said a Japanese official. "The important thing now is implementation, not the amount."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO: Reshaping Japan;
Clinton Pushes Free Trade to a Nation More Interested in Cleaner Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
From the moment Air Force One touched down here three days ago, President Clinton has been riding the wave of change sweeping through Japan's political system, hoping to seize the moment by talking directly to Japanese voters about why they pay so much for food and feel so poor in one of the world's richest countries.
Already he has begun to win some praise: Newspapers are blaring the Japanese word for change -- henka -- across front pages here just a week and a half before the most critical election in Japan's post-war history. 
 The suspicion with which many Japanese viewed Mr. Clinton before his arrival has begun to melt a bit, particularly after he took time out from the summit meeting to put in a call to the parents of a Japanese exchange student slain in Louisiana and talked about the need for America to cure its own social ills.
 
What Kind of Change?
 But it is still unclear that the kind of henka Mr. Clinton is talking about, getting consumers here to join in his effort to break down trade barriers, is also the kind Japanese have in mind. Change, after all, means something very different on Tokyo's streets than on Washington's. And these days, most Japanese say that what really needs to be changed in Japan is the one-party rule that has abetted greed and corruption, not the fundamental policies that have built this country into the world's second-largest economic power.
"There are many meanings for the word 'change' in Japan," Shinichi Kitaoka, a professor of political science at Rikkyo University, said today. "People say the policies we have are good. It's just that the party is losing the capability to rule the country."
Without question, Mr. Clinton's comments are echoing through the political system here, perhaps more loudly than his advisers anticipated. Though the President has said repeatedly that he is strictly neutral in the June 18 election, in which the Liberal Democrats seem certain to lose power for the first time since 1955, Japanese newspapers noted this morning that his message about the need for change must hurt the elderly men who run the country.
 
A Boost for Party Rebels
 After 38 years in office the Liberal Democrats have a tough time convincing anyone that they stand for real change. As a result, Mr. Clinton's appeals to embrace economic changes that "will benefit both of us" are being interpreted as an endorsement of the rebel groups that have broken from the party, and some reformers who remain within it.
The Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, said on Wednesday that Mr. Clinton's comments have created the view that "even the U.S. Government has deserted Miyazawa's Government," a remarkable statement given four decades of American support for the Liberal Democrats.
The opposition leaders are clearly delighted. "I think the general public all feel Japan must change," Ichiro Ozawa, the power behind the largest group of defectors from the ruling party, said in an interview this morning. "So the President's words are received as quite natural. We are also stressing change, and our emphasis is that we must change in the direction of participating more in international society and that domestically we must have more deregulation. So we received his words very happily."
 
Discomfort for Ruling Party

"But it might have been a little uncomfortable for the L.D.P. and Mr. Miyazawa," Mr. Ozawa said.
Mr. Clinton's approach -- never before attempted by a President visiting Japan -- was set in a meeting late last week at the White House. Uncertain of the best strategy for dealing with Japan at a time of remarkable political turmoil, Mr. Clinton brought in a group of outsiders with considerable experience dealing with Japan.
Among them was the Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, who has come to Japan annually and gotten to know many younger members of the ruling party; Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who also comes here frequently; James Fallows, the Washington editor of The Atlantic magazine, who lived here for several years; Edward Lincoln of the Brookings Institution, and Susan J. Pharr, a professor of Japanese politics at Harvard University.
Each member of the group addressed the members of the Clinton Administration most involved in Japan policy, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and the Ambassador-designate to Japan, former Vice President Walter Mondale.
 
'Ride the Wave'
 "The trick was to find a way to ride the wave of without getting ahead of it, and without seeming to come down on one side of the election," said one participant in the meeting, who insisted on not being identified.
He said there was agreement that Mr. Clinton had to talk directly to consumers. But there were also some cautions: Mr. Clinton, it was decided at the meeting, should not go shopping -- which could invite price comparisons that would embarrass his hosts -- but should say, as he did at Waseda University, that "the average Japanese family pays more than twice as much of your income for food as the average American family."
"To me he has struck the right note, very appropriate," said Ms. Pharr. "He has sent out a line to everyone, treated Miyazawa with respect, and shown that whoever emerges he is well-positioned."
The only problem with such an approach is that Japan and the United States operate under quite different social contracts. Prices here have been sky-high for a decades, but no long-suffering consumers have taken to the streets. Japanese know they pay the highest prices in the world. But many say they believe that it is worth it if it keeps their economy strong, their factories running, their unemployment level at 2.3 percent.
"The President's approach," one of his senior aides conceded today, "presupposes the view that Japanese interests are moving from production-driven to consumer-driven. It is not clear how fast that is happening."
In fact, revolutions in Japan rarely start on the street. Nor is it clear whether the "reformers" that the President has met will actually bring about the kind of change he wants. The Socialist opposition, which could be an important part of a future coaliton government, has a long record of protectionism and dislike for American pressure. And Mr. Ozawa, a friend of America's, has yet to say what he will do internationally if his new party comes to power.

HEADLINE: Cash-Poor Cities Still Face Hard Choices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
After three difficult years, most American cities are learning to make do with less, according to an annual survey made public yesterday by the National League of Cities.
But with virtually no growth in revenues in the fiscal year 1993, there has been a price to pay: most cities balanced their budgets by moderately reducing such services as garbage collection and fire fighting while also raising taxes. Others reined in expenses even more by streamlining services and reducing labor costs. 
 "It's not a gloom-and-doom picture," said Michael A. Pagano, a professor of political science at Miami University in Ohio who wrote the survey of 688 cities. "Cities are not so much in fiscal crisis as they just haven't rebounded from the recession."
The Clinton Administration, which has been struggling with the sluggish recovery from the recession of 1990 and 1991 and the growing deficits of the 12 years of Republican rule, cannot offer much help.
Mayors, who were clamoring for more Federal assistance earlier this year, now say that their expectations from Washington have diminished. "We're getting more understanding of our problems and greater willingness to help from the Clinton Administration," said Mayor Donald M. Fraser of Milwaukee, a Democrat who is president of the National League of Cities. "But they are severely constrained by the budget deficit they inherited."
 
Appeal to Congress
 At a news conference yesterday in Washington, where the survey was made public, Mr. Fraser and other mayors cautioned Congress not to focus exclusively on the Federal deficit, saying that economic recovery would be hastened by investing more heavily in the cities.
"We're at a crisis turning point in our cities," Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, a Democrat, said in an interview after the news conference. "We can go forward, recognize the importance of cities by investing in them, or we can see more and more social problems developing that will drain our revenues."
The survey reports that city revenues grew by a meager eight-tenths of 1 percent from fiscal year 1992 to 1993. City spending, held under tight rein by city managers, grew by only 2 percent, or less than the estimated 3.3 percent rate of inflation. Cities made up the shortfall in revenue by reducing services and by increasing taxes and fees by $1.7 billion -- or less than half the increases imposed last year.
The survey reports cities' financial conditions in the fiscal year 1993, which coincides with the calendar year for most cities. For other cities, the fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.
 
No More Reserves
 Lean budgets have become the norm in recent years, and city officials say the situation is not easing. In fact, two-thirds of the budget officials surveyed said they were less able to cope with this year's expenses than they were with last year's, and nearly three in four officials predicted that the fiscal year 1994 would be even more difficult. That is largely because cities have exhausted funds they hold in reserve for balancing budgets, Professor Pagano said.
Most cities have reduced capital investments and deferred maintenance, decisions that save money immediately but often cost much more in the long run. In Tucson, Ariz., for instance, city officials again postponed buying garbage trucks in an effort to help reduce spending by $13.9 million and balance its $200 million budget, said Ronald L. Meyerson, director of operations.
"We're spending $2.65 a mile to operate each of our old garbage trucks, when a new truck would cost only $1.25 a mile to operate," Mr. Meyerson said. If the city had $650,000 to buy six new trucks a year, he said, the city would save about $900,000 a year in operating expenses.
 
Savings Prove Illusive
 Tucson was not alone in trying to hold back expenses by deferring either equipment or services; one in six cities did this. Kansas City, Mo., stopped collecting yard waste to try to save $800,000, but saved only $600,000 because people began illegally dumping leaves and trees on back roads, said Donald K. Ewbank, a city spokesman.
About 40 percent of the cities raised taxes, and the same percentage reduced the number of city employees by attrition or layoffs or by contracting with private companies to perform city services.
Services in many cities have been cut to the bone and into the marrow. "We've been cutting day care, foster care, services to AIDS patients and increasing classroom size," said Philip R. Michael, budget director for New York. "We're still functioning, but we could be doing a lot better."
The city, which began the fiscal year 1994 on July 1, has to close a $2 billion deficit in its $31.3 billion budget. The city will, among other things, eliminate through attrition 3,000 to 4,000 of its 210,000 employees. It also plans to raise fees by $174 million and sell $215 million in property acquired from delinquent taxpayers. The city is also starting to work on a projected $1.7 billion deficit in the fiscal year 1995.
The situation will not improve any time soon. "In the past four years, the city lost 350,000 jobs and $7 billion in anticipated revenue," Mr. Michael said. "We've bottomed out, but the city is going to recoup at a very slow pace over the next several years."
Western cities have had to deal with the largest budget shortages this year, but Northeastern cities felt the most pain because they had the least amount of cash reserves to offset their shortfalls. Most Midwestern cities are also coping with shortfalls this year, and Southern cities with growing populations are faring the best.
At the same time, austerity budgets can provide the impetus for streamlining management. Philadelphia, which has made a striking return to black ink, is on track in the first year of a five-year plan to save $1.1 billion by freezing the wages of unionized city employees, slashing health-care spending, laying off scores of political appointees and bringing efficiency to City Hall with the help of local businesses and universities.
"The good thing about fiscal austerity and the anti-government mood is that it makes it politically possible for cities to do the hard things that they can't do in better times," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.

HEADLINE: Holdout No More: U.S. Grabs Narrow Trade Deals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
A tariff-reduction agreement reached on Wednesday at the economic summit meeting in Tokyo signals a shift in the United States' negotiating stance toward pragmatically seizing opportunities to grab narrow but important deals instead of holding out indefinitely for broad ones.
Several politically complicated industrial issues, like European tariffs on computer chips or American textile barriers, were excluded from the deal in Tokyo in favor of cutting levies on other manufactured goods. 
 Wednesday's arrangement "is a serious agreement, but it's an agreement to settle for what's attainable, and a judgment to cash whatever chips are now available," said I. M. Destler, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland and a trade policy historian.
 
 
World Deal May Be Near
 The compromise in Tokyo by Japan, Canada, the United States and the European Community suggests that after seven years of stalled negotiations, a comprehensive world trade deal may be in sight. But whatever comes forth now seems likely to be more modest than many Bush Administration officials and economists had envisioned.
Last month, Congress set a deadline of Dec. 15 for completion of the talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "The chances are now better than even, perhaps even 70 percent, that we will have an agreement by the deadline," said John H. Jackson, a law professor at the University of Michigan who was President Richard M. Nixon's top trade lawyer.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has said several times that he envisioned a sweeping world trade deal. Wednesday's agreement was clearly presented as a preliminary compromise, with the expectation that negotiators in Geneva will try to broaden it to cover more industries.
"This is an indispensable step on the way to a broader agreement," a senior Administration trade official said today.
But Mr. Kantor's actions this week have followed a pattern that suggests the United States' goal now is less ambitious, in line with the policies of past Democratic Administrations that preferred to strike limited deals rather than seek to rewrite the rules of international trade all at once.
In his first three months, for example, Mr. Kantor partly settled a long squabble over the refusal of European state-owned utilities to buy American electrical-power-generation and telecommunications equipment. Mr. Kantor creatively persuaded the Europeans to accept American power-generation equipment while the two sides imposed modest trade sanctions to symbolize their disagreement over telecommunications equipment.
By settling on Wednesday for a deal that included no clear United States commitment to dismantle textile trade barriers, nor any European Community agreement to eliminate computer chip and electronics tariffs, Mr. Kantor runs the risk that neither industry will be made significantly more open to free trade in the final agreement. A weaker compromise on tariffs among industrial nations means that they have less to offer poor countries when they ask those nations to open their markets for banking, insurance and other services, said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia University.
 
 
Something to Show for It
 But the tariff compromise assured that world leaders had something to show beyond words from the Tokyo summit meeting. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had said here in March that if the participants labored mightily merely to produce another pledge of commitment to world trade talks, "there will be a roar of laughter."
Curiously, while the Republican Party has been the leading advocate of free trade for several decades, no Republican President since Dwight D. Eisenhower has concluded a round of GATT talks. Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan and Bush all struggled unsuccessfully for years to achieve ambitious deals.
Mr. Kantor seems instead to be following closely the example of his longtime mentor, adviser and confidant, Robert Strauss. Mr. Strauss, a former head of the Democratic Party who became President Jimmy Carter's United States trade representative, wrapped up the last world trade round in 1979 by abandoning the free-trade positions of his Republican predecessors on agriculture.
The 1979 deal excluded some of the same agricultural issues that have bogged down the current talks, and included separate, voluntary codes on procurement and subsidies that many GATT member nations never bothered to endorse. Yet the result was a deal that expanded international trade, although not as much as some experts had hoped.
Similarly, a world trade deal this year could lock in significant compromises made last year on curbing farm subsidies, protecting patents and copyrights and helping international investors.
The main sticking points now are farm quotas, trade in services and limits on unilateral trade sanctions. Congress is especially fond of laws that allow American officials to impose sanctions unilaterally on countries that subsidize exports, sell them at unfairly low prices or allow violations of American patents and trademarks. Yet restrictions on such sanctions are among the top demands of the European Community, Japan and Southeast Asian nations.

HEADLINE: Albany All-Nighter: Cleared Desks and Unresolved Issues

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 8

 BODY:
As it closed its 1993 session this morning, the New York State Legislature passed legislation to create a fund to preserve environmentally sensitive lands across the state, but failed to decide how to dispose of radioactive waste from power plants and hospitals.
In a challenge to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic-controlled State Assembly also passed legislation to divert savings from closed psychiatric hospitals to community mental health services, virtually defying the Governor, also a Democrat, to veto a proposal he has consistently opposed. The bill has already passed in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
 But legislators left several important issues unresolved, including proposals to change the way New York City schools are governed and a $9.5 billion plan to make scores of major bus and subway improvements.
The legislators pulled their annual all-nighter in a final frenetic sprint to end the session, clearing their desks of scores of bills that had piled up in the preceding and less productive six months.
 
Action on School Custodians
 Among the other measures approved here in the last 24 hours was a seven-month extension of bank deregulation laws, a bill intended to increase competition for medical malpractice insurance, and legislation that would cap the salaries of superintendents for Board of Cooperative Educational Services school districts.
The two chambers also agreed on legislation that would give New York City principals greater authority over school custodians. However, time ran out on the session before the Assembly could reconcile minor differences between its bill and a Senate version. The bills' sponsors said they expect the legislation to receive final approval in the fall.
Today, as weary Legislators packed their bags, Mr. Cuomo and Legislative leaders sought to put the best face on a languorous session that was extended by almost a week because of a bitter debate over rent-stabilization laws.
"All that was accomplished could have been accomplished much sooner and with less pain and confusion," Mr. Cuomo said today. "But the achievements of the whole session were more significant, in my opinion, than the delays that preceded it."
 
Mishap Before Departure
 To many, the Republicans' major accomplishment for the year was removing rent protections for wealthier tenants. But Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, soft-pedaled the victory, saying: "I'm just pleased that we were able to establish some Republican philosophy on the rent problem in New York." He added, "This was a beginning, and hopefully in four years hence we'll do more."
For Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, the last day of the session provided a particuarly painful moment. As he was leaving his hotel for a final news conference, Mr. Weprin tripped and fractured his upper right arm. He was treated at a local hospital before returning, arm in sling, to New York City.
In an end-of-the-session statement made before his accident, Mr. Weprin said passage of a clean-air bill and the land preservation fund had made 1993 "the year of the environment."
The land preservation fund created this morning was far more modest than proposals endorsed earlier this year by Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly Democrats, and closer in some ways to what Senate Republicans had sought.
 
Environment Fund to Grow
 Originally, Mr. Cuomo wanted a fund of $271 million a year, most of it coming from new taxes or fees, while the Assembly had sought a $248 million fund. The Republicans had proposed a $100 million fund to be paid for almost entirely out of the state's general operating fund.
Under the legislation passed this morning, $26.5 million would be placed in the fund starting in 1994, most of it coming from non-recurring sources, or "one-shots," including the refinancing of state debt. And in an odd twist, about $5 million a year will come from the sale of state land -- meaning the state will be selling property to acquire property.
The fund, which would also be used for landfill closures and recycling programs, would grow to $94.5 million by 1996, with the additional money coming from the state's real-estate transfer tax.
Mr. Cuomo, who has painted a rather grim picture of the state's economy all year, insisted today that the preservation fund will not create a hole in next year's budget because he expects the real-estate market to pick up over the coming three years.
 
Muted Praise of Measure
 But projections made in February by the state's budget division forecast that the real-estate tax will increase by only $40 million by 1996 -- $47 million less than what is needed to pay for the fund. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is financed partly through real estate transfer taxes, has also predicted that tax revenues will remain flat for the next three years.
Despite the tenuous nature of the fund, environmentalist said they were pleased that it passed, particularly after it was nearly killed just two hours before the Legislature adjourned.
The first parcels of land likely to be purchased through the fund are in the Long Island Island Pine Barrens and the Adirondack Park, including a 2,100-acre estate on Lake Champlain that was scheduled to be sold at auction in the coming weeks.
In a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Cuomo hinted strongly that he would veto legislation passed by both houses to direct more money into community mental-health programs as the number of patients in state psychiatric hospitals declines. He has said the bill would tie his hands in dealing with budget problems.
But proponents of the legislation asked why Mr. Cuomo had been able to find money in his budget over the last 48 hours for other programs. "Certainly his position is inconsistent, perhaps even disingenuous," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat and a sponsor of the bill.

HEADLINE: At G.O.P. Meeting, an Uninvited Guest

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 8

 BODY:
It was business as usual for the Republican Party at the opening of its annual meeting here today. Once again, Haley Barbour, the party chairman, offered President Clinton mock praise for uniting the Republicans.
But lurking upstairs was the unusual: a Democrat. Soon after Mr. Barbour got through assailing the Democrats, David Wilhelm, the Democratic chairman, held a news conference of his own to fight back. 
 This attack-counterattack behavior was prominent during last year's campaign: Workers from one party would pop up at meetings of the other to defend themselves.
Today it is clear that the practice has become a continuing feature of political life. There may be no campaign going on, but the Democrats are not about to let their opponents have the last word. With colorful charts comparing the two parties' economic proposals, they have set up shop for the next two days at the Stouffer Riviere Hotel, one floor above where the Republicans are meeting.
 
Potshots at the President
 Mr. Barbour made light of the invaders, and he used the Democrats' ploy to squeeze in another dig. With a broad smile, he welcomed Mr. Wilhelm: "Any time the Democrats want to come and talk about Bill Clinton's economic plan, I am proud to give 'em a platform."
He also noted that Mr. Clinton had not campaigned in Texas for Senator Bob Krueger, who was overwhelmingly defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison in a special senatorial election last month, and he said he would have been glad to pay for the President's plane ticket.
But before acknowledging the Democrats' presence, he his own attacks. Mr. Barbour announced that the Republican Party was beginning to broadcasting radio commercials around the country today that will make targets of 30 House and Senate Democrats in 20 states who voted for the President's economic package.
With background music from "Jaws," the announcer on the commercials urges listeners to call their representative to "send this package back." He warns: "It's Bill Clinton and the tax-and-pretend Democrats in Congress at it again -- raising taxes while pretending to cut spending."
Mr. Barbour said the party planned to spend $110,000 to broadcast the commercials, particularly in swing districts where lawmakers might be more likely to change their votes. The first ones playing today were in the districts of four Democrats: House Speaker Tom Foley of Washington and Representatives Peter Hoagland of Nebraska, Dan Glickman of Kansas and Louise Slaughter of New York. The ads give the lawmakers' telephone numbers.
Even as he sought to upstage Mr. Barbour's announcement with his own stunt, Mr. Wilhelm acknowledged that the Republican commercials, intended to rally public opposition to the President's budget, will "make it harder to get our message out."
While the Democratic Party has radio commercials that promote Mr. Clinton's plan while urging people to call their representatives and tell them to "stand up to special interests," Mr. Wilhelm said the party would not hesitate to produce new ads that answer the Republicans directly.
"I'm here to talk about something Haley doesn't talk about very often and that is mentioned nowhere in his radio ads," he said. "And that is the Republican economic plan. I believe that there's a good reason for this: Because it is more of the same, because it goes to extraordinary lengths to protect the rich."
Despite his effort to answer the Republicans, Mr. Wilhelm insisted that he would not make a habit of trailing Mr. Barbour, and said he was here today anyway for a meeting of state attorneys general.
"I don't plan to follow Haley Barbour around," he said, but he added, "We're getting used to each other."

HEADLINE: THE WICKED WEATHER;
Clinton to Seek Federal Aid For Midwest Flood Victims

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he would ask Congress to approve emergency Federal disaster aid for victims of the Midwest flooding, which experts called one of the worst on record.
The flooding, afflicting eight states, has already claimed 16 lives and caused property damage estimated at more than $1 billion, Federal officials say. The President toured the area last weekend and pledged $1.2 billion in emergency funds for crop loss and damage to homes and businesses. 
 High water has disrupted highway, rail and barge traffic in a wide area of the Midwest. Barge traffic has been halted on the Mississippi River since last week, and was halted for the most part on the Missouri River on Tuesday.
Highways and railroad tracks are under water, and many bridges over the rivers are closed. All commercial airports were open, but six small airfields serving non-commercial aircraft were closed.
 
Safety, Then Transportation
 "Our first priority is safety," said Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena. "Our second priority is to move relief supplies into the area and to keep as much of the transportation system operational as possible."
Mr. Clinton, who is in Japan attending his first economic summit meeting, made a radio address from Tokyo in which he told flood victims that their plight had not been subordinated to the demands of geopolitics, but did not announce any new aid plans.
"I am determined to have a Federal response that rises to the occasion and deals effectively with the problems you're facing," the President said.
The Army Corps of Engineers described the flooding as one of the worst in history. The Mississippi has already crested at a record 23.34 feet in Burlington, Iowa, nearly two feet higher than the previous record of 21.5 feet set in 1973.
The 1973 flood caused property damage of $1.15 billion, which would total $3.9 billion in today's dollars.
 
Eight States Affected
 Last Friday Mr. Clinton declared parts of Wisconsin a Federal disaster area. Illinois has requested the same status. Flooding has also occurred along rivers in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota.
"This is one of the broadest geographic areas that we've ever seen flooded," said George Halford, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers.
The designation as a disaster area is made by the President, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency said, and is determined on the basis of the extent of the damage and its economic impact on a community.
Residents and businesses in a disaster area are eligible for Federal grants and loans for a wide range of programs. These include:
*Rental payments for temporary housing for up to 18 months for those whose homes are unlivable.
*Minimal repairs to homes.
*Unemployment payments for workers who temporarily lost jobs because of the flooding.
*Low-interest loans of up to 8 percent to cover uninsured private and business property losses.
*Loans of up to $500,000 for small businesses with disaster-related cash-flow problems.
*Loans of up to $500,000 for farmers.
 
Other Agencies Involved
 These grants and loans are processed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was severely criticized for a widespread breakdown in its efforts to deliver this kind of disaster aid last year after Hurricane Andrew battered South Florida on Aug. 24.
Other Federal agencies active in the stricken area include the Department of Agriculture, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Transportation.
Private insurance is expected to make up only a small part of the flood losses, because private insurance companies do not insure against floods. Flood insurance is provided by the Federal Government, but only about 20 percent of those eligible buy this insurance, according to Marc H. Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute.
One of the the largest floods on the upper Mississippi River occurred in 1927, but there is no record of how big an area was affected. In 1965 the river crested up to four and a half feet above previous levels in some places.
 
Train Service Disrupted
 The flooding this year has disrupted passenger train service. Amtrak announced that the California Zephyr would detour between Chicago and Omaha, missing stops in Illinois and Iowa. Amtrak suspended service between St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo., and announced that the Southwest Chief would not make station stops at Fort Madison, Iowa.
Freight traffic was also disrupted. The Burlington Northern and Union Pacific railroads were hardest hit, the Association of American Railroads reported.
Union Pacific was working to open one of its two tracks between Kansas City and St. Louis. The Union Pacific line between Kansas City and Omaha line was under water in Atchison, Kan.
The Burlington Northern reported delays ranging from 24 to 48 hours as it rerouted rail traffic from its main line, between St. Louis and Kansas City, which was closed.

HEADLINE: Fewer Seeking Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Applications for jobless benefits from newly laid-off Americans fell last week to the lowest level in five months, the Labor Department said today.
First-time claims for unemployment insurance dropped by 12,000, the second decline in two weeks. The 327,000 new claims were the fewest since 325,000 applications were filed in the week that ended on Feb. 13. Many analysts had predicted an increase of several thousand. 
 The four-week moving average, which smooths out the volatility of the weekly claims and is considered a better gauge, fell by 4,000, to 340,500 -- the lowest level since the average stood at 339,500 in the four weeks that ended on May 22.

HEADLINE: Borrowing Declined in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing declined in May for the first time in 10 months, though the reason for the decrease was more technical than it was a reflection of spending habits.
The $802 million decline in May consumer credit outstanding contributed to a 1.3 percent decrease in the annual rate of borrowing, the Federal Reserve said in its report today. 
 The Fed's report tracks credit card borrowing, auto loans, mobile home loans and personal loans. It does not include home-equity loans, which have grown in popularity.
But the bulk of the May loss reflected a shift of about $3 billion in mobile home loans and personal loans sold to companies not tracked by the Fed's monthly report.
Without this technical change, consumer borrowing would have climbed by $2.67 billion as auto borrowing rose $1.737 billion and credit card use climbed $942 million.
This would coincide with analysts' expectations for an increase of $2.36 billion in May consumer borrowing.
May's level of consumer credit, a seasonally adjusted $753.92 billion, follows a revised $2.99 billion gain in April to $754.72 billion. The gain was first reported as $2.3 billion.

DATELINE: Dollar Rises Against Yen And Gold Prices Fall Back

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday as traders looked to the summit meeting of the major industrial nations in Tokyo for clues about the direction of foreign currencies.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 108.54 Japanese yen, up from 107.65 yen late Wednesday. But the dollar slipped against the German mark, ending the day at 1.7023 marks, down from 1.7065. And the British pound rose to $1.4960 from $1.4935. 
 Gold prices fell back, breaking the rise toward $400 an ounce that brought the precious metal to levels it had not seen in more than two years.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery ended the day at $395.60 an ounce, down $2.20. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at a late bid of $393.50 an ounce, down $3.50.
Walter Simon, a first vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company, said traders had thought the United States wanted to help correct its trade deficit with Japan through a strengthened Japanese yen. That would make Japanese goods imported to the United States more expensive.
But since President Clinton and his team attending the summit talks did not concentrate on that aspect in Tokyo, but rather on opening up markets, "some of the upward pressure on the yen was relieved," Mr. Simon said.
 
Accord on Tariffs
 In fact, the first announcement out of the summit meeting that began on Wednesday was about an agreement to lower tariffs on hundreds of goods.
"Now the issue in Japan will refocus on politics there," with the fall of the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the elections set for July 18, Mr. Simon said. A country undergoing elections tends to see a flight from its currency until the uncertainty passes, he added.
Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager and vice president at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said "the market is still moderately bullish" but "is without incentive" and awaiting some statement from Mr. Miyazawa about which direction the Japanese want to go, Mr. Lawrie said.
"Over all in the New York session, things have been relatively quiet," Mr. Lawrie said. "Everything is hinging on the Tokyo summit and right behind it our inflation picture and the strength of our economy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Listerine, a venerable brand of mouthwash, has been rejuvenated by its minty line extension.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A BRAND born of anxiety, which found fame by persuading people it could cure a problem they never knew they had, is finding relief from anxieties of its own with a variation of its venerable formula.
A year after the Warner-Lambert Company introduced Cool Mint Listerine, a bluish, minty variety of its 115-year-old Listerine antiseptic, the new flavor is selling strongly. It has so far avoided significantly cannibalizing its amber-colored parent, the country's best-selling mouthwash, by stimulating garglers to buy more bottles or switch from rival brands. 
 That speaks to the ability of marketers to keep sales of some full-priced brands growing amid a shelfful of difficulties, from a sluggish economy to competition from cheaper rivals. It indicates that innovation, well-focused advertising and ample spending can overcome problems overwhelming brands like Marlboro and Pampers.
"Cool Mint Listerine exemplifies the power of brands, if you can take a No. 1 brand and grow it even further," said Susan Jacolow, Listerine product manager at Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains, N.J.
In the 52 weeks ending May 23, according to Nielsen Marketing Research data, Listerine's total share of the mouthwash market climbed 22.6 percent, to $221.1 million, in retail outlets the company tracks, which account for around 80 percent of mouthwash sales. That compared with a 4.3 percent increase, to $670.9 million, for the entire category.
Cool Mint Listerine, at $80.1 million, had already captured a hefty 11.9 percent of the market, more than compensating for a 21.8 percent decline in original Listerine's sales, now at almost $141 million.
An earlier attempt to mint up Listerine, a green minty brand called Listermint, continued to suffer a sales slide, by 29.8 percent, to $19.6 million, but that mouthwash is virtually moribund.
John P. O'Donnell, vice president and director of analytical services at Nielsen in Hackensack, N.J., said that research revealed the largest portion of Cool Mint Listerine's sales volume, at 36 percent, was attributable to Listerine users buying more mouthwash.
Ms. Jacolow said the new variety was proving particularly popular among consumers 25 to 45, supplementing the original product's strength among those 45 and older.
That is welcome news for Warner-Lambert because of fears that while previous generations dutifully submitted to unpleasant tasks, like gargling with a strong-tasting mouthwash, younger consumers shun them. That required a product not perceived as "medicine-y," to cite the tweaking term often heard in advertising for Procter & Gamble's Scope, Listerine's biggest rival.
Yet Listerine is predicated on its sometimes harsh taste serving as a signal that it is powerful enough to freshen breath and kill germs -- "the taste people hate twice a day," as recent ads proclaimed. Listerine was among the first mass-market products to succeed by, as critics of advertising would charge, creating anxieties in order to solve them.
In the 1920's and 1930's, "halitosis" -- Listerine's concocted term for bad breath -- was as menacing a threat as gangland rubouts in Chicago. Some of the hardest-selling ads of all time displayed distressed young women and the headline, "Often a bridesmaid but never a bride," with such mournful text as: "Edna's case was really a pathetic one. Like every woman, her primary ambition was to marry" -- an ambition thwarted, as she aged "toward that tragic 30 mark," by halitosis.
There is, however, a looming question that Warner-Lambert may find hard to swallow. If Listerine excelled by cautioning consumers that mouthwash must taste bad to work good, what does a good-tasting Listerine do?
"You sometimes can't be all things to all people," said Al Ries, chairman at Trout & Ries Inc., a marketing consulting company in Greenwich, Conn. "A good-tasting version of Listerine tends to undermine the core message of turning a negative into a positive."
He added: "People might say: 'Hey, these good-tasting mouthwashes really work. So I'll try Scope.' "
That is why, in $25 million worth of Cool Mint Listerine ads by J. Walter Thompson New York, a stern-voiced announcer simultaneously stressed that while it "works like Listerine," it "tastes like cool mint."
"The idea was to combine the brand's tremendous equity, the therapeutical benefits historically associated with amber Listerine, with the great mint taste," John Haskin, an account supervisor at Thompson New York, said.
So animated television commercials showed a heroically styled bottle of Cool Mint Listerine trekking, Tarzan-like, through a leafy green jungle -- a setting "perfect to talk about fresh, minty taste," Mr. Haskin explained -- to rendezvous with a bottle of the original flavor.

Wall St. gives Ericsson a second look, and likes what it sees.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
AS cellular telephone service continues to explode in the United States, with some 11,500 new subscribers every day, the companies that supply the radio transmitters, telephones and computer switching equipment that make wireless calls possible are also thriving.
L. M. Ericsson of Sweden is an unheralded success story in cellular, unlike its dominant rival, Motorola Inc. Ericsson has been piling up an impressive record of fat contracts -- it won more than $1.6 billion worldwide in the last 90 days, many of them from new customers in the United States, like a $150 million contract in Dallas two weeks ago. Much of the recent order growth, analysts say, is coming at Motorola's expense. 
 Analysts say Ericsson has about a third of the $1 billion cellular-equipment market in the United States and nearly half of the $1 billion market outside this country.
The huge order volume has begun to attract attention from Wall Street, which had been cool to the stock because of the company's poor earnings. Last year, Ericsson reported a profit of $11 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of $3.68 billion.
On Wednesday, Neil Barton, the London-based telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, raised his rating of Ericsson from "neutral" to "above average" for the intermediate term.
"They are experiencing tremendous success," he said in a telephone interview. "Their business is rather like mainframe computers in their heyday. When people bought I.B.M. and Honeywell computers in the 1960's, they would have to buy future machines from the original supplier. That is the same situation with Ericsson."
Mr. Barton also raised his 1993 earnings estimate to $1.13 for each American depository receipt, up from $1 a share previously. He expects 1994 earnings, fattened by recent contracts, to total $1.92 for each A.D.R., and in 1995 to total $2.37. One of Ericsson's American depository receipts, a method for foreign companies to raise equity capital in American markets, is equal to one Ericsson share.
Mr. Barton also sees Ericsson's compound annual growth rate in earnings per share totaling 30 percent in the 1992-97 period, up from his previous estimate of 20 percent, made only six months ago. Ericsson's earnings per-share growth in the last three years has been only 2.2 percent a year.
The stock of Ericsson has surged powerfully since October, when its A.D.R.'s languished in the low $20's. The stock price has settled into the $40's since May 11, when Ericsson reported a rise in first-quarter profit to 16 cents a share, compared with a loss of 31 cents a year earlier.
Ericsson's A.D.R.'s closed yesterday at $43.875, up 12.5 cents each, in Nasdaq trading.
Ericsson has prospered in part because it has spent heavily on research and development, resulting in products that are popular with its rarefied customer base of American regional Bells, cellular companies like McCaw Cellular and government-owned carriers in China, Greece and Hungary.
Ericsson's spending has been especially heavy in cellular, which will make up about 40 percent of the company's 1993 annual revenue, up from 25 percent in 1990. Mr. Barton of Merrill Lynch estimates that Ericsson spent 45 cents of every dollar received from cellular equipment on cellular research and development.
Its earnings were hurt because it began the heavy investment just before the European recession of several years standing, Mr. Barton said.
"Profitability evaporated because they continued to spend on their future," he said. "Well, the future has arrived."

X Dives Back Into the Turbulence

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
On Wednesday night at the Academy, John Doe of X looked down at the slam-dancers and said: "Now don't anybody hurt themselves down there. I know you kids are probably new at this." His tone was fatherly, and no wonder; as prime movers in Los Angeles punk-rock, X has seen uncounted slam-dancers since the band formed in 1977. The group disbanded after releasing a live album in 1988, but has reunited for a new album, "Hey Zeus!" (Big Life/Mercury), and a tour.
Although X helped create a wave of California punk-rock, it was always an idiosyncratic band. It revolved around the wide-spaced vocal harmonies and fractured, neo-Beat lyrics of Exene Cervenka and John Doe. The songs were usually loud and fast, but they were rarely symmetrical; they hurtled from one section to the next, earnest and urgent, revealing West Coast roots from Bakersfield-style country music to San Francisco psychedelic rock. And with Mr. Doe on bass and D.J. Bonebrake on drums, X boasted one of the best rhythm sections in punk-rock, at once driving and limber. 
 The current lineup is X's late-1980's configuration, with Tony Gilkyson on guitar rather than a founding member, Billy Zoom. Mr. Gilkyson is fond of Chuck Berry licks and countryish slides that shift the band even closer to country. But after its hiatus, the band still has its old fire, playing 13-year-old songs with the same fervency as the new ones. Ms. Cervenka rarely stopped dancing, even between songs.
The set bounced between selections from "Hey Zeus!" and X's oldest material: "Johnny Hit and Run Paulene," "In This House That I Call Home," "Nausea," "We're Desperate," "White Girl" and "The World's a Mess; It's in My Kiss."
While the new songs are just as propulsive as the old, there are some differences. Like much of punk-rock, X's early music was the work of talented outsiders, putting together songs without much regard for rules; the singers would wail, try a melodic hook, and wail some more. The newer songs are less free-form; they usually have clear-cut verses and choruses, trading only a little momentum for more catchiness.
The lyrics, while still nonlinear, have also changed. The band's early songs were about a scene that X was observing directly (and some apocalyptic fantasies that went with it); Ms. Cervenka and Mr. Doe, who were married and then divorced, also wrote tersely and tensely about romantic strife.
A decade later, both Mr. Doe and Ms. Cervenka are married (to other spouses) with children, thinking about the larger world, and new songs like "Country at War" and "Clean Like Tomorrow" consider the Los Angeles riots and the recession. But they can still create vivid, sharply observed images, and the band hurls them forward as if they're a matter of life and death.

Explosive Painting: The Path to Pop

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
"HAND-PAINTED Pop: American Art in Transition, 1955-62," organized by the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and opening today at the Whitney Museum of American Art, handsomely recalls American painting at one of its most fulminatory moments. Even decades after the works on view here were first exhibited, you can still sense the spunky rebelliousness, and in some cases outrageousness, that inspired them.
Right off the bat is one of the most calculatedly outrageous paintings of the era, Larry Rivers's "Washington Crossing the Delaware," a work that seemed to critics when first shown in 1953 to mock the heroic aspirations of Abstract Expressionism (not to mention one of America's heroes). In the next gallery is Robert Rauschenberg's "Small Rebus" (1956), with its melange of pseudo-Abstract Expressionist squiggles and drips, its incongruous collage of sports figures and its reproduction of Titian's "Rape of Europa" (amusingly misidentified in the show's catalogue as "a Baroque painting of a woman on the back of a bull"). 
 Coming as they did at a time when the first generation of the New York School had established lofty abstraction as the be-all of American art, Mr. Rivers's and Mr. Rauschenberg's works, with their populist allusions and their wry manipulations of paint, seemed like virtual declarations of war. Abstract Expressionism may have put American painting on the international art map once and for all, but American popular culture in the prosperous Eisenhower years had achieved its own worldwide renown, and it was from this largely untapped resource that younger artists sought to draw. The first generation New York School painters came of age during the Depression and World War II. This new generation, after all, was coming into its own in a very different kind of America, and their work necessarily reflected it.
"Hand-Painted Pop," which brings together 117 works by 21 artists, charts a course from paintings of the 50's like "Washington Crossing the Delaware" and "Small Rebus" to quintessential Pop creations of the early 60's like James Rosenquist's "President Elect," with its crisp, flat colors and near-billboard scale, and its archetypal all-American imagery of a smiling President John F. Kennedy juxtaposed with a shiny Chevrolet.
The show's thesis is not new: two years ago in London, a big and otherwise disappointing survey of international Pop art began with much the same point: that the seeds of American Pop, epitomized by the work of an artist like Mr. Rosenquist, were sown during the 1950's in the achievements of figures like Mr. Rivers and Mr. Rauschenberg. The classic definition of Pop is an art that derives not only its subject matter but its forms, as well, from popular culture and mass production: Roy Lichtenstein's comic-book reproductions in reproduction Ben Day dots. Yet Pop has in fact always been a fluid concept, and grew out of a much more varied, more "handmade" kind of painting. Contrary to the simplistic but still widely held view that it signified a complete break from Abstract Expressionism, the one movement actually evolved from the other.
"Blam! The Explosion of Pop, Minimalism and Performance, 1958-1964," at the Whitney Museum of American Art nine years ago, covered some of this ground even earlier than the London survey; and just within the last few years there have also been shows devoted to early Rauschenberg, early Ellsworth Kelly, early Warhol and early Rosenquist that each in its own way dealt with the same period.
But "Hand-Painted Pop," while retracing material from these shows and others, goes far beyond them all in describing how artists, beginning especially with Mr. Rivers and Grace Hartigan and continuing with Jasper Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg, picked up the path established by the New York School and pointed it toward Pop.
It turns out to be a path fraught with detours and dead ends, and one that could have been charted by this exhibition in various other ways. Why haven't Ed Kienholz's painted sculptures been included along with Oldenburg's painted reliefs? Why explore what is in this context the byway of Cy Twombly's art but not the early works of Agnes Martin, which included found objects, or of Mr. Kelly, who derived his abstractions partly from the life of the street, or Bob Thompson or George McNeil? Why Jess but not Ray Johnson?
To the credit of the organizers of "Hand-Painted Pop," Paul Schimmel and Donna De Salvo, they acknowledge in the catalogue the messy problems posed by a period in which American art, energized by the New York School and fueled by a booming economy, was moving in several directions at once.
There was, for instance, the direction Ms. Hartigan pursued. Reliant on the gestural and expressive qualities of the New York School, she also espoused figuration and relied on posters, magazine illustrations and Manhattan street life, among other things, for works like "Billboard," with its lively grid of brilliantly colored patches that teeter on the fence between abstraction and figuration. Pollock and de Kooning had already returned to figuration by the early 50's, and so Ms. Hartigan was actually following their lead. But she and Mr. Rivers (as well as Alex Katz, Mr. McNeil and others) extended considerably the range of figurative references, embracing above all the quotidian.
Ms. Hartigan did not, as it turned out, become a Pop artist, and in fact derided the movement as "not painting because painting must have content and emotion." The show is full of artists, not just Ms. Hartigan and Mr. Twombly, who cannot be described as Pop figures, although their work evolved in the same milieu and, the show aims to prove, helped in one or another way to establish a context for Pop.
John Wesley's work is also included. One sees in Mr. Wesley's works from the early 60's an emphasis on signs and symbols and a sharply delineated style that can appear at first blush to constitute Pop, but that was not always based on contemporary consumer culture and that had a cryptic and evocative quality altogether its own.
Certainly, Allan Kaprow's incorporation of everyday objects in his work inspired Pop painters, but Mr. Kaprow ultimately traveled far from Pop. Like Ms. Hartigan and Mr. Rivers, he at first learned from Mr. de Kooning and Pollock. Among the show's highlights are the pair of vigorously painted abstractions from the mid-50's that betray his New York School connections. Not such a long way from Mr. de Kooning's work, they are also not a long way from the Pop paintings of Jim Dine.
Nor did Wayne Thiebaud think of himself as a Pop painter, although his lightheartedness and his creamy, sensuous depictions of cakes and pies have sometimes led people to consider him one as well. In this exhibition, he holds especially high the banner of the Bay Area figurative painters of the late 50's and early 60's. They, too, were schooled in Abstract Expressionism before moving in their own direction: one that never quite severed links with abstraction while embracing the everyday.
The show has its share, in other words, of provocative choices of artists who nonetheless turn out to make a kind of sense in this context. One of the most unexpected inclusions is Jean Follett, whose relieflike paintings have largely been forgotten but who is nicely restored to public attention here. Not Pop, her works nonetheless incorporate banal objects in images of mythological intent that recall the mythic ideals of the New York School, but with a definite twist: feminized, modernized, tethered to the life of the street.
The show is also full of mainstream figures, of course, with rooms of important early works by Mr. Johns and Andy Warhol, by Roy Lichtenstein and Mr. Dine and Ed Ruscha. Warhol is shown at his most personal in paintings like "Strong Arms and Broads" and "Girl Sucking Forefinger," awkward in his scumbly, sketchy handling of paint but also more affecting than when he turned from the handmade to the mechanically produced.
And Mr. Lichtenstein is shown afresh, too, not only in the early freewheeling drawings of Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse of 1958 and in his surprising Abstract Expressionist "Untitled" of around the same time, when he was still clearly searching for his voice, but also in an even more youthful essay: his own version of "Washington Crossing the Delaware" predates Mr. Rivers's by two years and is, in its cartoonish, faux-primitive way, equally outrageous.
The show was even bigger and had more room to spread out at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it was first presented. At the Whitney it has by necessity a slightly crowded, helter-skelter quality. But this is a quibble, and anyway the installation is somehow appropriate for an exhibition documenting a time of remarkable vitality and rapid change in American postwar art.
"Hand-Painted Pop: American Art in Transition, 1955-62," remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Oct. 10. It is supported by a grant from Philip Morris Companies Inc.

A Return Trip From Paradise

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
THE good news is that nobody bought the house.
Thanks to the wonders of the real estate marketplace, it has remained the property of Joe and Marty McIlvaine long enough to provide a familiar place when their family makes its return from San Diego to Westchester. 
 At the end of a 34-month cross-continental adventure, which ended with an education in baseball's new economics in San Diego and the addition of exactly one word to the beginning of his old title with the Mets, the club's new executive vice president of baseball operations can soon move back with a thorough understanding of the professional baggage that was left behind.
That was not McIlvaine's plan. His introduction yesterday as the man to lead the baseball side of the reconstructed Met management, confirming weeks of expectation, would once have seemed about as likely as the possibility of the Mets having a poorer record than two expansion teams.
Nearly three years ago, his two tickets to paradise were one-way. There was no reason to expect anything else. McIlvaine, whose judgments contributed to both the rise and fall of the Mets throughout the past decade, had been given a team of his own.
The ownership of the Padres seemed ambitious. The scenery was breathtaking. The claustrophobic effect of New York was light years away. The area was a wonderful place to raise a family.
But that was before the pockets of ownership began to shrink, and McIlvaine's judgments of talent were affected by the organization's economic constraints. That was before the elimination of high salaries, San Diego's priority, led McIlvaine to leave and the Padres to follow the recent trend of youthful, more cost-effective replacements: Doogie Howser, G.M.
And that was before the free fall of the Mets made McIlvaine attractive to them and New York more livable to him.
But there is one unresolved problem in the homecoming of the man who yesterday admitted, "One of the reasons I get in trouble is I'm too honest." The worst aspects of the professional existence he left behind have gotten worse.
With media outlets in life-or-death conflict, the long-time New York competitiveness has been transformed into a clearly combative atmosphere. There are fewer and fewer distinctions between criticisms of individuals and their mistakes. If Davey Johnson's final days as manager in 1990 seemed harsh, don't ask Ray Handley about the end of his time as coach of the Giants.
"For 10 years, in New York, the media treatment, the fans, were, by and large, fair," McIlvaine said in early October 1990, the day after he accepted the San Diego job. "But the Davey Johnson thing last year, that was not. And this year, a lot of the front-office bashing was very unfair. . . .
"I said it before this year and I'll say it again: I think the media is taking on a National Enquirer mentality. And I think what's happening in New York is that there are too many over-thinkers who say and write their opinion instead of just reporting the story."
McIlvaine's past success has come in the fragile ways of a business in which one organization can use a first-round draft choice to select a player named Augie Schmidt, another can select a pitcher named Dwight Gooden shortly afterward, and one of the two disappears forever.
The success of McIlvaine's return, and his team's reconstruction, will be based in part on his ability to maintain a sense of conviction, and the patience he values so highly, as all the Mad Dogs in these parts have their say. In a corridor beneath the first base stands at Shea Stadium, even as a passing worker said, "Welcome back, Joe," McIlvaine heard the words National Enquirer and smiled. Does he have more of an ability to cope with that environment?
"I have to," he said. "You hope as you become more experienced, you get better at things like that. I think the process of becoming a public figure is passing from being thin-skinned, like most people, to being thick-skinned. That's my own definition.
"I've been here before. It's not like somebody coming in who hasn't been here before. I had another opportunity in the interim, and I hope that makes me better. If you're not trying to improve in your life, you're not getting any better. You're always trying to get better every day."
Early in the first game of an oppressive doubleheader, a missed cutoff man by Vince Coleman began a comically ineffective three-throw sequence. Once upon a Polo Grounds, there might have been laughter.
In Joe McIlvaine's old and new world, Shangri-La is a high draft choice, soft real estate market, thick skin, deep pockets and an air-conditioned office.

HEADLINE: Hyping the Trade Agreement

 BODY:
Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative, declared the trade agreement announced by the industrialized countries in Tokyo the "biggest tariff-cutting agreement in history." Not to be outdone, John Major, the British Prime Minister, declared that the pact was "infinitely bigger than anything we have seen before."
But the extravagant rhetoric owes more to the desperate need of leaders to boost their sagging popularity at home than to the modest accord itself. None of the announced tariff cuts will take place unless the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks is successfully completed. And for that to take place, these leaders will have to summon far more courage than so far displayed. 
 All they did in Tokyo was announce tariff cuts on manufactured goods that for the most part had already been offered. Meanwhile, they sidestepped controversies that have deadlocked the Uruguay Round. Had they failed to agree to cut tariffs on manufactured goods, the Uruguay Round -- which could add trillions to the world's output over the next decade -- would have been stillborn. In that sense, the trade pact is important. But it's only a small step in the right direction.
The trade agreement would largely eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and seven other categories of manufactured products. These across-the-board tariff cuts are welcomed because they will reduce consumer prices and therefore lift living standards around the world.
But the agreement didn't resolve tariff cuts on textiles and apparel, and other sectors where protectionist opposition has been ferocious. The leaders didn't touch trade in the service industries or agriculture. Nor did they resolve important disputes such as Washington's liberal use of sanctions to punish what it unilaterally regards as unfair trading practices by partners.
These are profound omissions. If the U.S. refuses to open its borders to foreign textiles, for example, the underdeveloped nations aren't likely to agree to honor copyrights and patents or open their markets to U.S. exports of financial services and movies. And if the U.S. doesn't win such access, Congress is unlikely to approve the final agreement.
None of the leaders displayed much bravery this week. Mr. Clinton refused to take on the maritime or the textile and apparel industries -- which is understandable since he will need every Southern Democrat's vote he can get to push his economic package through Congress. But the same political calculus impelled the Europeans to protect their electronics manufacturers and movie industries and Japan to protect its farm sector, wood products and financial services.
Cutting manufacturing tariffs was a necessary step toward an international trade agreement. But it was also a modest step, and time is running out; Congress has given Mr. Clinton until Dec. 15 to complete negotiations. He and the other industrialized nations' leaders may leave Tokyo smiling, but they still have to go back home and tackle strong protectionist forces. Only then will consumers reap the benefits that an international trade agreement will spread around the globe.

HEADLINE: Time to Normalize Relations With Vietnam

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The change in United States policy to permit loans by the International Monetary Fund to Vietnam (front page, July 1) is welcome news to the many American nongovernmental organizations with projects in Vietnam. They will provide more than $15 million in relief and development assistance this year.
Press accounts make it seem as if debate over this issue is a self-interested controversy between business on the one hand and prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action family groups on the other. A third dimension is reflected in the 200 organizations and institutions represented at the fourth annual conference of the United States Nongovernmental Organization Forum on Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos that was held at Marymount University in Arlington, Va., June 17 to 20. 
 These humanitarian, religious and educational institutions have not only been laying the groundwork for normalization between American and Vietnamese society for 18 years, but they are also a less visible pressure group for policy change. Attending the conference were large, long-established humanitarian aid and development organizations along with new, smaller groups founded by Vietnam veterans.
Representatives of universities, people-to-people exchanges, English-teaching programs and Indochinese-American groups play an increasingly important role in our meetings. A growing number of people from business and United States Government agencies also take part.
About half the participants signed a letter to President Clinton urging that he end American objection to loans from international financial institutions, lift the United States trade embargo and move toward normalization, including establishment of diplomatic liaison offices with consular authority.

HEADLINE: Skills Serve as Passport To a Liberal Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tony Kushner deplores the recommendation of W. Ann Reynolds, Chancellor of the City University of New York, to eliminate 97 degree programs "chiefly in the humanities" in institutions "with the highest percentages of African-American and Latino students" ("University or Trade School?", Op-Ed, June 28).
These programs would be replaced by "technical and occupational programs." Beyond question this is unfortunate. However, the point is not that minority students need not be trained, as Mr. Kushner says, "as thinkers, writers and artists but rather as service-economy employees," but that they, like all students, must first have the skills and means to do so. Students need the sense of well-being and self-reliance that comes through learning a marketable skill. 
 Yes, reading and the thinking that it induces are what the humanities are about, but if students have not trained themselves to make their way in the world, their anger and frustration will crush them. Good books and libraries are available everywhere and so are the reading lists to go with them. I too am a teacher and lament the narrowing of educational opportunity, but with a marketable skill, such courses will become accessible.

HEADLINE: Mexico Rejects U.S. Request To Hold Chinese Found at Sea

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 9

 BODY:
The Mexican Government tonight refused a request by the United States to detain three shiploads of illegal Chinese immigrants intercepted this week by the Coast Guard.
Earlier in the day, the Administration had asked Mexico to allow the ships to dock in Mexican port, presumably under armed escort by the Coast Guard, which intercepted the ships on Thursday and discovered 659 Chinese aliens on board. 
 Coast Guard officials said the three ships were part of a fleet of seven tramp steamers attempting to smuggle immigrants into the United States.
The State Department, in its first test of President Clinton's vow to stop uncontrolled immigration, had argued that when intercepted, the ships had been closer to the Mexican coast than to the shores of the United States.
 
Delicate Problem for U.S.
 The United States' plan called for the Chinese to be allowed to land in Mexico, where they would be interviewed by United Nations officials to determine whether they had legitimate claims to political asylum.
"The only people who can determine legal refugee status in Mexico is the Mexican Government," a senior Mexico foreign ministry official said tonight.
Just after 11 P.M. New York time, Mexico's foreign ministry, the Secretariat of Exterior Relations, issued a statement saying that in strict adherence to international law, it was not in a position to accept the United States' proposal.
However, the Mexican Government's statement added that if the immigrants were to enter the 200-mile international waters boundary of Mexico, they would be treated as illegal aliens and immediately sent back to China.
The intent of that statement was not clear, since the United States Coast Guard had already escorted the three ships to a rendezvous within 70 miles of Mexico's coast, well within the 200-mile boundary.
The statement said that if the aliens were detained, they would be given humantiarian assistance, if needed, but that the tramp steamers on which they were being smuggled would be confiscated, and the crews and anyone else involved in bringing the aliens to Mexico would be prosecuted.
Mexico's refusal leaves the Administration with a delicate and potentially embarrassing problem, since the ships were intercepted in international waters southwest of San Diego.
State Department officials could not be reached late tonight for comment, and a White House press spokesman, Jeff Eller, said the Administration was still awaiting Mexico's response.
A diplomat in the United States embassy here said that embassy officials had met with Mexican authorities throughout much of the day, but were unaware that the request had been turned down.
The Administration hoped that intercepting smugglers' ships on the high seas would send a signal to the 100,000 Chinese who try to enter the United States aboard such vessels each year.
"We want to put a stop to the practice," Joe Snyder, a State Department spokesman, said earlier today. "The idea is that if you can show the people who are organizing these ventures -- and the victims, the poor souls who get caught up in them -- it's not going to result in their coming to the United States, then we won't have to worry about the problem in the future."
The four other ships in the flotilla, all seven of which are sailing under the flag of Taiwan, are still headed east toward the mainland. They are believed to be carrying hundreds more Chinese immigrants.
Mexico's refusal leaves the United States with a potentially volatie international problem on its hands. It is one thing to send Haitian refugees a few hundred miles back to Haiti, as Washington has done, and quite another to send Chinese refugees thousands of miles back across the Pacific Ocean.
United States immigration officials and immigrants' advocates said Mexico had no legal obligation to honor the United States' request. "The Coast Guard took these people into custody in international waters and bears responsibility for them," said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst at the United States Committee for Refugees, an advocacy group in Washington. "If we repatriate them we have the potential of their blood on our hands."
The Chinese Government jailed and fined 112 people who were intercepted in the Pacific and repatriated by the United States in May, immigration officials said.
The three ships -- the Sing Li, with 236 passengers aboard, the Long Sen, with 169, and the To Ching, with 254 -- were spotted on July 3 by a Coast Guard jet on "a stepped-up air patrol due to the recent influx of undocumented aliens," said Petty Officer Liz Brannan, a Coast Guard official in Long Beach, Calif.
The plight of Chinese paying small fortunes to smugglers for a cramped passage to the United States came into sharp focus on June 6, when a shipwreck spilled nearly 300 immigrants seeking political asylum onto New York City's shores. At least eight passengers died in the wreck.
On June 18, President Clinton approved a plan aimed at stopping such smuggling operations, and the Administration stepped up its efforts to patrol international waters and seize suspect ships.
That plan was strengthened on June 21 by a Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Haitian refugees. The Court ruled that the President had unlimited power to order the Coast Guard to repatriate aliens intercepted on the high seas. The White House is now applying the ruling globally, using military and intelligence agencies to track ships in the Atlantic and Pacific.
The United States can reject people fleeing economic hardship rather than political persecution. But under the law, a request for political asylum by an illegal immigrant triggers potentially lengthy court proceedings.

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, July 10

 BODY:
President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reached a major accord this morning on a hard-fought "framework" for resolving a series of mounting trade disputes between the two nations. Mr. Clinton said it committed Japan to bring about "a highly significant reduction" in Japan's huge trade surpluses with the United States and the world.
The accord was announced after negotiations that lasted all night -- including a decisive 2 a.m. meeting in the President's hotel suite -- and hours after the Group of Seven summit meeting ended Friday, with Mr. Clinton declaring that his first major effort to create jobs through international trade negotiations had been a success. 
 The trade accord, the source of intense and often heated arguments between the two countries for more than three months, defines a series of five areas in which separate agreements will seek to close the $50 billion trade gap between the two countries.
 
U.S. Backs Down
 But the United States appeared to have backed down considerably from its earlier insistence on highly specific targets -- goals for increased shares of the Japanese market, for example -- by which it will measure the results achieved by future trade agreements. [Page 4].
Administration officials, clearly attempting to portray the agreement as a major victory for Mr. Clinton, insisted that they had persuaded Japan to agree on "objective criteria" that would enable them to assess how much progress they were making in cracking the Japanese market.
"For years we have had trade agreements that have failed to reduce our chronic deficits," President Clinton said this morning at a hastily-called news conference with Mr. Miyazawa. "Those agreements have not worked because they lacked a commitment to tangible results, and they lacked a means to measure success."
He termed this agreement "results-oriented," a phrase Mr. Miyazawa -- who in the past has denounced such an approach as a step toward managed trade -- declined to utter himself. "There is a definition problem," a Japanese trade official said this morning, saying his government was not making specific commitments for the future.
American officials said that the "highly significant" reduction in the trade gap meant that Japan would bring its surplus to under 2 percent of its gross national product. It is now more than 3 percent. But at Japan's insistence the agreement itself contains no such numbers. David Gergen, the president's special counselor, conceded that "there's a lot here subject to interpretation."
The deal also seemed to put off some of the hardest issues, such as what kind of precise measures of success will be used in the follow-on agreements in five specific areas. They include procurements by the Japanese government, deregulation, Japan's import of American autos and automobile parts, and direct investment in the United States and Japan.
The trade breakthrough capped what appeared to be one of Mr. Clinton's most successful weeks on the international stage.
 
Talks With Yeltsin
 This morning, just hours before he was scheduled to leave for South Korea, Mr. Clinton also ended talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, and declared that Moscow was continuing its "march toward democracy and free markets."
Mr. Yeltsin said that the two men had "cleared about 25 items" between them, and that his talks were "a guarantee of further developments and progress."
The all-night negotiations began Friday night after the leaders of major industrial nations ended their three-day meeting with a ringing call for more free trade.
Mr. Clinton, looking confident and relaxed at a news conference Friday night, said he had already met his goals for the summit: spurring on the world trade talks, gaining agreement among the Western allies on a Russian aid program, and taking steps "to restore the ability of all of our countries to create jobs and opportunities."
The tariff reduction accord was widely seen as only a step toward a complete agreement. It called for lower tariffs on a range of manufactured products, from bulldozers to pharmaceuticals, but such steps were contingent on solving a series of far harder disputes on agriculture and financial services by the end of the year.
"All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start," Mr. Clinton said. "We have to figure out how to unlock the doors for people who are left behind in this new global economy."
For Mr. Clinton, the most challenging element of the summit proved to be dealing with his hosts, the Japanese.
In April he and Mr. Miyazawa pledged to put a framework for future trade negotiations together by the beginning of the Tokyo meeting, but failed amid an increasingly bitter dispute over how to measure whether any progress is being made in opening Japan's markets.
The United States insistence on "targets" made the Japanese think they might be subject to unilateral retaliation if they were not met.
Even as negotiators were trying to overcome the deadlock, Mr. Clinton seemed determined to put the Japanese-American relationship on a far better footing, saying he wanted to "go beyond the rhetoric and finger-pointing of both sides."
After spending a lot of the first part of his trip conspicuously courting the political opposition to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, he worked hard not to snub Mr. Miyazawa, who is widely expected to resign after elections here on July 18.
The two men had a sushi meal Friday night at the Hotel Okura, where Mr. Clinton is staying, in what was described as a purely social dinner that contained no negotiating save for what kind of fish to order.
As the negotiators toiled in hotel rooms, Mr. Clinton was racing around the city, clearly enjoying his role as the central figure of his first summit. On Friday morning he wandered out of his hotel and wound through the twisting streets of Tokyo until he came to a baseball field, where he greeted young Japanese players.
Then he moved on to a meeting of American business executives here, and delved into a discussion of the difficulties of delivering pizza in a city without street names.
 
Meets Canadian Leader
 In the afternoon he met at length with Canada's new Prime Minister, Kim Campbell, promising to create a special post in the White House to deal with Canadian relations, especially trade. After his dinner with Mr. Miyazawa, Mr. Clinton strolled his hotel lobby posing for pictures with American guests.
The only presence who rivaled him in Tokyo was Mr. Yeltsin, who came to argue that his country was already "getting to the level of normal functioning of a free-market economy," and urging aid beyond the $3 billion in privatization funds that were finally arranged in the week.
Mr. Yeltsin's most surprising encounter, however, came alongside Mr. Miyazawa. The Russian President had refused two other visits to Japan because of pressures at home not to give up four Kurile islands the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II and that Japan is now demanding back.
Both Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Yeltsin seemed eager to play down their past differences, and they said they would schedule a full, official visit in October. But Mr. Yeltsin warned that if he acted too quickly on the question of giving back territory, "I might require a visa to get back to Russia.
For Germany and Japan, the meetings here came just as they were both formally notifying the United Nations that they want to join the Security Council. The Clinton Administration has backed the move, though several current members fear it would dilute their influence.
The Japanese were careful during the summit meeting to say little in public about their ambitions.
Mr. Yeltsin also seemed to be pressing for an expanded role in the world, as a member of a "Group of Eight" industrialized nations, rather than as a guest at the Group of Seven summit meetings.
"Time is on our side," he said at his press conference with Mr. Miyazawa. "We are bound to be a G-8," he added, "one year sooner, or one year later, who knows?"
Later Mr. Clinton, asked about Mr. Yeltsin's comments, said, he did not "want to make the argument against keeping Russia out of the G-7."
"I think that there will come a time when Russia will probably join this group, when there is a consensus" that it has become one of the world's most economically powerful nations.
On Friday, Mr. Yeltsin was invited to next year's summit meeting in Naples.
Despite the summit meeting successes, in some key areas there is reason to question how much was done.
The biggest success, however, may have been the agreement to reduce tariffs and open markets for manufactured goods under the Uruguay Round talks for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 118-member world body that sets international trading rules. The negotiations had seemed hopelessly deadlocked.
An unusually delicate issue Mr. Clnton handled on his tour here, however, was the out-of-sight, away-from-the-microphones role played by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Through the entire summit she was barely heard from. Yesterday she went sightseeing in Kamakura, an ancient Japanese capital near Tokyo. Mr. Clinton denied today that she had been muzzled, saying "she did what she wanted to do."
"I've been, frankly, impressed and gratified by the response that she's gotten from just the people in the street, especialy the young working women as well as the students at the university the other day," he said.
 
 
 
TALKING (AND TALKING AND TALKING) TRADE
 In Tokyo, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations expressed optimism that the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which began in 1986, could end in an agreement this year. It was not an unprecedented sentiment. Here are excerpts from the official communiques of the past seven meetings of the group of nations.
 
Venice summit, June 10, 1987:
"We note rising protectionist pressures with grave concern. The Uruguay Round can play an important role in maintaining and strengthening the multilateral trading system, and achieving increased liberalization of trade for the benefit of all countries. . . . We call on all contracting parties to negotiate comprehensively, in good faith and with all due dispatch, with a view to ensuring mutual advantage and increased benefits to all participants."
 
Toronto summit, June 21, 1988:
"A successful Uruguay Round will assure the integrity of an open, predictable multilateral trading system based on clear rules and will lead to trade expansion and enhanced economic growth."
 
Paris summit, July 16, 1989:
"We express our full commitment to making further substantive progress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of 1990."
 
Houston summit, July 11, 1990:
"The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round has the highest priority on the international economic agenda. Consequently, we stress our determination to take the difficult political decisions necessary to achieve far-reaching, substantial results in all areas of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year."
 
London summit, July 18, 1991:
"We . . . commit ourselves to an ambitious, global and balanced package of results from the [ Uruguay] Round, with the widest possible participation by both developed and developing countries. The aim of all contracting parties should be to complete the round before the end of 1991. We shall each remain personally involved in this process, ready to intervene with one another if differences can only be resolved at the highest level."
 
Munich summit, July 8, 1992:
"A successful Uruguay round would be a significant contribution to the future of the world economy. . . . We regret the slow pace of negotiations since we met in London last year, but there has been progress in recent months . . . We expect that an agreement can be reached in 1992."
 
Tokyo summit, July 9, 1993:
"Our highest priority is a successful conclusion to the Uruguay round. ... There remain important issues to be resolved. We renew our determination to resolve them and to achieve with all our partners a global and balanced agreement by the end of the year."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO: How It Happened;
U.S. Appears to Retreat From Setting Targets to Increase Japan's Imports

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Saturday, July 10

 BODY:
In reaching an agreement covering trade relations with Japan today, the United States seems to have backed down from its earlier efforts to establish numerical targets for increasing Japan's imports and reducing its trade surplus.
The agreement, announced by President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, contains wording that will allow both sides to claim victory. American negotiators said the agreement goes much further than ever before in being "results-oriented." 
 But that very vagueness of wording leaves a lot of room for intepretation. And already there are signs that the United States and Japan are interpreting the accord differently. If that is the case, the pact will merely postpone disputes until later and will fail to accomplish one of its major goals -- reducing trade friction between the two nations.
The new trade framework calls for Japan to take action to bring about a "highly significant" reduction in its massive trade surplus, which is about $50 billion with the United States alone. But it does not specify a numerical goal for reduction of Japan's global trade surplus, as the United States had wanted.
As for opening specific markets, the agreement calls for setting up "objective criteria" to judge progress. But it does not commit Japan to setting targets.
The agreement came at the end of an intensive week of negotiations aimed at reaching a conclusion while President Clinton was in Tokyo for the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations.
The American negotiation team met in the President's suite last night just before 2 A.M., briefing Mr. Clinton on the agreement. Final negotiations with the Japanese continued until early this morning.
The so-called framework is not an agreement on specific market opening measures. Rather it sets the ground rules for a series of talks that will forge more specific agreements within six months or a year, and then follow the implementation of those agreements over several years. "This establishes the rules of the game," W. Bowman Cutter, the chief American negotiator, said today. "The game is yet to be played."
 
More Imports by Japan
 These talks will develop plans for increasing Japan's imports of certain products, like automobiles or auto parts, and also allow for reforming its economic structure, for example by deregulating financial industries or toughening enforcement of anti-trust laws. The talks might also cover efforts to cut the United States budget deficit and reform some of its trade practices, like "Buy American" laws in Government procurement.
The United States had wanted Japan to agree to the principle of setting quantitative or qualitative goals for opening certain markets to foreign products or restructuring its economy. Japan had opposed this as "managed trade." The final agreement does not mention targets. It merely says the two nations will set up "objective criteria" that will allow them to agree on how to measure progress in opening Japan's markets.
A Japanese official said this means that targets will not be set. For instance, the two sides might agree that the way to judge the opening of Japan's auto parts market would be to count how many foreign products are designed into Japanese cars. But, he said, no targets for how many such "design-ins" will be set in advance. In that way, Japan has avoided the managed trade it abhors.
But Mr. Cutter, who is deputy chairman of the National Economic Council, said today that American negotiators "got precisely what we told ourselves we wanted a few months ago." American officials explained that since there are ways to measure progress and since Japan is committed to progress, the agreement will work. But this seems to leave open the possibility that the two nations will be arguing in the future over whether progress has been sufficient.
In addition, a Japanese official said, the agreement does not contain an explicit prohibition of targets, as Japan had wanted. That will allow Washington to claim victory.
In terms of Japan's overall trade surplus, the agreement does not include a key American demand that Japan agree to cut its current account surplus to 1 to 2 percent of its economic output from the current level of more than 3 percent.
United States officials said they interpret the "highly significant" reduction that Japan has committed to make in its trade surplus to mean getting the surplus below 2 percent of economic output. But Japanese officials say they do not interpret the phrase that way.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO;
President Clinton on Summit Conference: 'We Have Made a Serious Start'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday in Tokyo after the 19th summit meeting by the Group of Seven industrial nations, as recorded by the Associated Press:
 
STATEMENT
The summit we have concluded sends a message of hope to America and to the world. 
 Some have called this a jobs summit, and they are right, because the creation of new jobs in the United States and in all the other countries here present was at the center of all of our discussions. All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start.
We reached an agreement here that can open manufacturing markets to American products and to all other products in ways that we have not seen in many years. Indeed, the agreement, if finally concluded, could bring the largest reduction in tariffs in world history.
While tough negotiations still remain, this world trade agreement captures the momentum that we have needed in these negotiations for a long time. We now can move toward completion of a broader trade agreement that could spur the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next decade in the United States, and millions throughout the world.
We also agreed that the other industrialized nations will send their top education, labor and economic ministers to Washington in the fall for a serious conference on the creation of jobs. All of the advanced nations are having difficulty creating new jobs, even when their economies are growing.
This was a constant cause of concern in all of our conversations, and we are now going to make a serious effort to examine the problem from every angle, and to try to come up with new and innovative solutions, which can be helpful in the United States and throughout the G-7 countries. We have to figure out how to unlock the doors for people who are left behind in this new global economy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
$3 Billion Aid to Russia
This summit also held out fresh hope for other peoples of the world, especially those involved in democratic reform in Russia, led by President Yeltsin, who joined us here.
The $3 billion program we announced here to help Russia move to a market system will not only bolster prospects for freedom there, it is a very solid investment for the United States; funds to move state-owned industries to private hands to make the free enterprise system work, funds to make available operations for new enterprises, funds from the World Bank, and funds for credits for export. All these things will help Americans to do more business in Russia, and will help Russia to succeed in a way that will continue the path chartered by the end of the cold war; fewer nuclear weapons, fewer defense investments, more opportunities to invest in people and jobs, and a peaceful future.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I have said before, and I will say again, I came to this summit in the hope that we could get an agreement to open more markets to manufactured products, in the hope that we could get a strong program for Russian aid, in the hope that together we would demonstrate resolve to restore the ability of all of our countries to create jobs and opportunities for our people. I believe those objectives were achieved and I am pleased at the first of these G-7 meetings which I was able to attend.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. A host of Presidents have tried to convince Japan that trade is a two-way street. What makes you think you can convince them? What is the chance of getting an agreement on trade talks and what did you learn at the summit that you didn't know before?
A. I think we do have a chance to get an agreement and I think in part it is because we are coming to a common understanding that the serious imbalance in trade between our two nations cannot continue, and that in the end it is not in the interest of either country.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. You mentioned that further negotiation must be done toward a new world trade agreement. One of the major sticking points for a number of years has of course been the issue of agriculture subsidies, and agriculture generally. I wondered what, if anything, you may have heard here from your counterparts from Europe and the E.C., and from Japan that renews your hope, if it does, that such a thing may be possible by December, as you have suggested?
A. Well, if all the Europeans will adhere to the Blair House Accords, I think there is a good chance we can have an agricultural agreement. As you know, France has some problems with it, and has expressed those, and it was an issue in the last election in France. But as I pointed out, the United States cut our agricultural subsidies unilaterally and substantially in 1990 and we have proposed further reductions this year as part of the deficit reduction package.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Before the summit started it was noted widely that your own approval ratings, as unhappy as you sometimes may be with them, were higher than those of any other political leader here. Virtually all of these people are either on the way out or in some great difficulty at home. How does that diminish this summit? And having been to one now and seeing how bureaucratic they can be, do you really think in these days of modern communications that these sorts of extravaganzas are necessary at all?
A. Well, first of all, I think that it did not diminish the summit. In fact, there was more done here, and there was more energy and more zip in it than I thought there would be. And I think part of it was -- apparently this summit was less bureaucratic than its predecessors. We ended two of our meetings an hour early, which I liked awful well, and there was an amazing amount of open, free flow of honest exchange, it was very, very good.
I think that anytime you have the world economies -- the major economies of the world in the doldrums, combined in some of these countries with a real impetus toward political reform, and a felt need of the people to make their political systems work better, you can't expect to see high poll numbers. When people are having a tough time making ends meet, they don't tend to be very happy with their political leaders. So that is a given.
Notwithstanding that, this summit produced real, substantive benefits for the people who sent these leaders here. Now, there was a reaffirmation, a unanimous reaffirmation on the part of the heads of state in this meeting, to make this process less bureaucratic, less expensive, and less cumbersome. And I think you will see an even more streamlined summit next year in Italy, one in which all the delegations are smaller and in which there is more flexibility and I think we -- I hope that something was learned out of this summit, that if you focus on one or two objectives and really work at it, and work at it, you can get something done.

Hillary Clinton Causes a Stir
Q. Your wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has caused quite a stir in Japan, and yet she's followed a very traditional wives' schedule here, which frankly doesn't seem much like her. I wonder if she's been muzzled here, perhaps to avoid offending Japanese sensibilities.
A. No. She did what she wanted to do. She thought about it quite a lot, and I think that it was -- I've been, frankly, impressed and gratified by the response that she's gotten from just the people in the street, especially the young working women, as well as the students at the university the other day. And I think it's a real indication of the aspirations of younger Japanese people to see that everybody here has a chance to live up to their potential. I was really very pleased by it.
Q. When you return home in a few days, you're going to be facing kind of a do-or-die situation with the budget bill which got you so much play here. How do you relate your accomplishments from this week to what faces you when you get back next week?
A. Well, this certainly ought to strengthen the resolve of the Congress to carry through on this. There's no question that the other countries were very much encouraged by the determination of the United States to reduce its deficit, that they believe that's one of the things that has distorted the world economy for the last several years. And likewise, there is no question that some of our job growth we're going to have to do on our own. So a lot of these investments, both the private and the public investments in the economic plan to create jobs, should be adopted.
So, I am hoping that what happened this week will strengthen the resolve of the Congress to go ahead and pass the economic plan and to do it in short order so that we can go on to other things. We all, after all, have a lot of other things to do. We have to get the health-care cost controls in and provide basic health-care security to American families. We have to continue to deal with the transformation from a defense to a domestic economy and try to help people accommodate all those changes. We've got an enormous amount of work to do. We've got a crime bill we need to pass. We've got a lot of other things on the agenda, so we've got to get this economic plan passed.

 	 	 		.. .	 	Q. Within this city the Japanese Prime Minister said that he pitied the United States. It was a remark that you cited often in the campaign. In your talks with the Prime Minister, did you detect any change in that attitude, or do you think there is still pity for the United States?
A. I did detect a change, but I have to tell you, I have tried very hard to move this dialogue into a constructive frame of mind.
When I spoke to, at Waseda University, I acknowledged that one of the reasons that there was such a big trade deficit with Japan in the 1980's was that we had such a huge Government deficit we needed a lot of Japanese money to pay for our debt to keep our interest rates down. In other words, I tried to, to go beyond the rhetoric and finger-pointing of both sides. I also pointed out, however, that we have now had ten years of high manufacturing productivity growth, that, that we really are the high-quality, low-cost producer of many goods and services, and that we have to recognize we have to have a new relationship.
I think we should focus on things that are positive for both of us and be very, very firm about the need to change. But I don't sense a lot of ridicule here, and as a matter of fact, what I was hoping was that the Japanese would not be too concerned about all the changes going on in this country. I mean, I, a lot of the political changes are without precedent in the postwar era, post-World War II era. But they are the inevitable part of growing in a democracy and changing.

HEADLINE: Miami's Cuban Exiles May Lose TV Station

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 9

 BODY:
In a striking illustration of the waning influence of an organization that has dominated Cuban exile politics here and in Washington for a decade, Congress is making its most serious effort to eliminate TV Marti and drastically cut funds for Radio Marti, the last vestiges of cold-war broadcasting to the Soviet bloc.
The exile organization, the Cuban-American National Foundation, successfully lobbied the Reagan Administration to begin the broadcasts in 1985. Both the foundation and the advisory board of the Marti stations are led by Jorge Mas Canosa, a multimillionaire Cuban contractor who has built a power base here that resembles a government in exile, waiting for the fall of President Fidel Castro. 
 Though strongly identified with the Republican Party, the foundation made large campaign contributions during the 1980's through its political action committee to powerful Democrats in Congress, including Representative Dante B. Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. But with the retirements of Mr. Fascell and several other well-placed Florida Democrats this year, only two junior Republicans, both Cuban-Americans, remain to champion the foundation's cause.
That political erosion, combined with an increasing diversity of views within the Cuban-American community and the pressure to cut the Federal budget, led to the decision late last month by the House Appropriations Committee to eliminate all $14 million in financing for TV Marti and to halve the support for Radio Marti to $8 million. The issue will come up before the full House and the Senate, which are due to return next week. The Senate is expected to restore some money for Radio Marti.
But Congress is likely to eliminate TV Marti, run by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, a division of the Voice of America. Begun in 1990 at a cost of more than $65 million, the station has never reached many Cubans. Cuba has jammed all of its programming since it went on the air, and the blimp that transmitted the signal has been grounded for repairs since March. The signal is now being broadcast by satellite, so only owners of satellite dishes can receive the broadcasts.
 
Complaints From Rivals
 Rival exile groups here say that Mr. Mas, who founded the Cuban-American National Foundation in 1981 at the behest of the Reagan Administration, has used his position to insure that his activities are extensively and favorably covered by TV and Radio Marti, while other groups do not get the same treatment. Worsening conditions in Cuba have set off a widening debate in the exile community, and among dissidents on the island, about matters ranging from the efficacy of the United States' 30-year-old economic embargo of Cuba to the composition and policies of a post-Castro government, and competition to have those diverse views heard in Cuba is fierce.
With Radio Marti, the problem is not the size of its audience, which even critics acknowledge to be substantial, but the content of its broadcasts. As Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat from Puerto Rico who is chairman of the Hispanic Caucus, put it during a recent debate, Congress is concerned that the station has become "a personal toy" for "a few people in Miami" seeking to advance their own interests.
Ernesto Betancourt, who was director of Radio Marti from its inception until he resigned in 1990, contends that the government stations have become a foundation satrapy. "I quit because Radio Marti was being converted into a vehicle of propaganda for Mr. Mas," Mr. Betancourt said last week. "Not only that, the station was taking decisions on foreign policy that completely contradict the State Department" but support the foundation, he added.
In December 1991, a Presidential task force, citing concerns about the impartiality of the station's coverage, recommended that the advisory board headed by Mr. Mas be abolished and that control of Radio Marti be transferred to the Board of International Broadcasting. The Bush Administration, however, took no action.
 
Impartiality Questioned
 With the advent of the Clinton Administration, new concerns about the impartiality of programming are again being raised by Radio Marti employees. On May 25, more than 60 workers sent a petition to Joseph D. Duffey -- who, as the new director of the United States Information Agency, oversees all foreign broadcasting -- to ask that the station "be maintained above any competing political factions existing within the Cuban exile community."
In the statement, the employees said they believed that "Radio Marti must broadcast with utmost objectivity while reflecting all possible viewpoints." They also requested that station directors and advisory board members "guarantee Radio Marti's objectivity and impartiality, and preclude any appearance of conflict of interest."
Rolando Bonachea, who supervises both Radio and TV Marti as the acting director of the Office for Cuba Broadcasting, said, "The people of Cuba are entitled to know all viewpoints, so I am not going to exclude anyone from participating in a responsible fashion in the programming of Radio Marti." He added that he was "convinced the value of Radio Marti is to continue to go right through the center, without allowing any particular person, group or faction to exercise control."
Mr. Mas has a policy of not responding to inquiries from The New York Times, explaining through a press spokesman that he has been dissatisfied with the paper's coverage of Cuba since the mid-1950's. Francisco Hernandez, president of the foundation, said neither Mr. Mas nor any other official of the organization dictated news coverage at Radio Marti.
Mr. Hernandez asked, "Isn't it fair that if we produce or generate 80 percent of the news related to Cuba in this community, we should get 80 percent of the air time?"
Current and former employees of Radio Marti said in recent interviews that they had been forced to lobby for the foundation during working hours.
Eugenio Rodriguez, a former reporter and union shop steward at the station, said reporters had distributed invitations to a foundation social event, "which damaged our credibility because it made it appear to the people we covered that we were working for Jorge Mas and not Radio Marti."

HEADLINE: Industry Too Must Share National Park Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There are several reasons visitors to our national parks should not be forced to pay the full cost of operating them, as Terry L. Anderson suggests in "The Forest and the Fees" (Op-Ed, June 28). 
 Our country has many public institutions whose benefits are enjoyed by all Americans, regardless of whether or not they are on the premises. Should the entire budget of the Library of Congress be borne by those who use the main reading room? Should students and their parents underwrite the budget of West Point? Should every road assess tolls?
The national parks provide much more than recreational opportunities. They serve as natural laboratories, conserve biological diversity, help clean the air and water, preserve our history and lure foreign visitors, who boost our economy. One group should not be solely responsible for the costs of maintaining them.
Another problem with Mr. Anderson's proposal is that it would discourage use by those with limited incomes. Citing wilderness use figures, he claims that the nonwealthy rarely go to the parks anyway. But wilderness permit holders are not representative of park visitors.
If Mr. Anderson had surveyed the more than 21 million people who visited New York's Gateway and San Francisco's Golden Gate National Recreation Areas last year, he would have found very few with Park Avenue addresses. The parks in and around cities are natural lifelines for people of modest means.
Before park visitors are asked to absorb large fee increases, the Federal Government should stop subsidizing those companies that make profits off the public lands -- and often enjoy a taxpayer subsidy to boot. Last year American taxpayers underwrote at least $1 billion in subsidies for mining, grazing and logging interests that use national forests and other lands belonging to the public. That is more than Congress appropriated to finance park operations.
Additional help should also come from companies running concessions inside the parks. While enjoying monopoly conditions, they pay the Government only 2.5 percent of the money they take in from visitors.
Changes in national park finances are in order, and modest park entrance fee increases can be part of the mix. But soaking the visitor is indefensible.

HEADLINE: Pep Rally for Jobs;
Clinton Plan for Unemployment Conference Is Aimed at Stirring Up Public Support

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
President Clinton's international conference on job creation, announced on the eve of the economic summit meeting in Tokyo, is shaping up as part educational seminar, part public relations for the White House and part pep rally to get people and governments to support new and perhaps expensive strategies to fight unemployment.
The meeting, which some call a "jobs summit" to heighten its significance in the public mind, will bring together labor, education and economics ministers from the seven most powerful industrial nations in an effort to get them to explore the causes of stubbornly high unemployment and to push for strategies to combat this problem. 
 Some Administration officials confess that they are unsure what the meeting, scheduled for this fall, will achieve. But if nothing else, they are confident that it will concentrate the leaders' minds on what the public perceives as the No. 1 economic problem: high unemployment. In the United States, after two years of recovery, the jobless rate remains stuck at 7 percent, while unemployment has surged in Europe to 11 percent.
At a news conference today at the Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo, President Clinton made clear that he thought his proposed jobs conference could rally support for new programs to fight unemployment. "If there are tough decisions to be made, he said, "It will be easier for each country to make them if the people who live in each country are aware that this is a worldwide problem and that there have to be some new and different directions taken."
President Clinton proposed the jobs meeting on Monday in a speech in San Francisco, in which he termed unemployment a "global crisis." Administration and European leaders have thrown up their hands at why, after years of economic recovery, unemployment remains so high.
Officials on both sides of the Atlantic say joblessness is still high because technological change is displacing many workers, especially unskilled ones, and because of heightened foreign competition, especially from developing countries. American officials are also convinced that foreign competition is a big factor behind American wage stagnation since 1973, especially among unskilled workers.
"Globalization has depressed the wage growth of low-wage workers," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "It's been a reason for the increasing wage gap between high-wage and low-wage workers."
The ministers are likely to recommend that improved education and job training are a vital antidote to both long-term unemployment and wage stagnation. The jobs conference could help line up public support for Mr. Clinton's plans to increase spending on schools and training programs.
"The demand for workers seems to have shifted toward well-educated and skilled workers and away from relatively uneducated and unskilled workers," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview.
Administration officials say one question the conference will examine is whether, for the first time in history, technological change is resulting in a net decrease in jobs rather than an overall increase.
Some officials fear that the meeting could prove risky because it will focus public attention on a nagging problem that the President cannot possibly solve quickly. The meeting also runs the risk of becoming yet another highly trumpeted gathering that produces high-flown oratory but little action.
 
 
'Educating People'
 Offsetting those risks, the Administration is likely to use the meeting to remind the public that Mr. Clinton did not create high unemployment. The Administration will also undoubtedly seek to show that the President, after being elected to turn around the economy, is doing his best to smite the unemployment dragon.
"It will be good for educating people on the nation's long-term problems and to explain that you can't solve long-term problems overnight," said Gene Sperling, an assistant to the President for economic policy.
While Western Europe has benefited from strong productivity growth and wage growth over two decades, Europeans are alarmed that their private sector has scarcely added any jobs in 20 years. America's plight has been largely the opposite: employment growth has been strong, but productivity growth has been sluggish, while real hourly wages have declined for 20 years.
In some ways, Mr. Clinton has asked the ministers to search for the Holy Grail of economics: achieving strong productivity growth and strong job growth at the same time.
European countries have invested generously in new equipment and job training, increasing productivity and creating high-paying jobs. But this approach has not produced a net increase in private-sector jobs.
 
 
More Low-Paying Jobs
 In the United States, partly because investment has been low in equipment and training, both productivity and wage growth have been slow. But there has been a boom in the number of low-paying jobs.
"Do industrial nations face a tragic choice between more jobs and better jobs?" Mr. Reich said. "Superficially, it would look that way, but there may be other alternatives."
In Tokyo, Group of Seven leaders pointed to several possible solutions. Their communiques talked about greater investment in education and training. And in an implicit reference to Europe, they said that greater wage flexibility was needed and that costly social insurance programs "that unduly discourage employment creation should be re-examined."
 Many European officials and economists are convinced that continental Europe's high minimum wages, high payroll taxes and restrictions on hiring temporary workers have hurt job creation. Changing any of those could meet stiff union opposition, however.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN TOKYO: News Analysis;
A Clinton Debut: Fancy Footwork and a Bow

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
TOKYO, Saturday, July 10 -- Even before his negotiators wrested a last-second agreement from the Japanese on how to attack its enormous trade imbalance with the United States, it had been a big week for Bill Clinton.
Achieving the long-sought breakthrough with Japan, however tentative a first step it represents in an arduous process, sent the President and his entourage away from his debut in summit diplomacy in an ebullient mood. Even the determinedly dour Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, permitted himself the faintest touch of braggadocio. 
 "I want to avoid unnecessary bugling," Mr. Christopher said. "But it does seem to me that President Clinton has arrived on the world scene with a good deal of emphasis."
Mr. Clinton won last November by promising to put domestic policy ahead of foreign policy. In his campaign and in the early weeks of his Presidency, he argued that the national security of the United States, in the post-cold-war era, depended on rebuilding the domestic economy -- that economic strength at home and national success abroad were inseparable.
This week's summit conference of the seven leading industrial democracies gave him at last, on his first overseas jaunt as President, a chance to put those ideas into action instead of merely talking about them.
In addition, it gave him the chance, which he seized with all the zest of a rookie, to assume the leader's mantle. Politically weak as he may seem in the opinion polls, he was a Brobdingnagian among Lilliputians here, viewed against the untested and the shopworn leaders with whom he conferred.
To a considerable degree, he usurped the host's role, but then the Japanese were in no position to complain, with the governing Liberal Democratic Party wracked by scandal and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa almost certainly in his last 10 days in office.
There is little doubt that, even if he failed to move the Japanese as far as he tried to, even if he fell somewhat short in numerous other ways, he did better than his immediate predecessor, George Bush, who came here in January, 1992. Mr. Bush left without credible evidence that he had created the "jobs, jobs, jobs" that he sought.
There is little doubt, either, that Mr. Clinton went some way toward putting to rest the doubts that Japanese, European and even a few Canadian officials have had about his capacity to exercise world leadership on behalf of the United States, the only plausible candidate for that role at the moment. His handling of the Bosnian situation and the early fumbles of his senior White House staff had generated widespread cynicism in recent weeks.
"The vacuum is not so profound as we leave Tokyo," said a British official. "This week showed that he can stay focused if he tries to."
A German politician commented: "Clinton moved quickly to the center of things, without showing off, without being rude, without offending."
Mr. Clinton is not about to turn into a foreign-policy President. He may have spent this week on the far side of the Pacific Ocean, but he found time in a punishing schedule to record a radio address about the Mississippi River floods.
And everyone remembered the campaign motto: "It's the economy, stupid." The agreement to reduce tariffs on a broad range of manufactured goods would create 1.4 million new American jobs, said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, in a piece of artful hyperbole that no one could disprove.
Could the United States really afford aid for the Russians? "There's a lot of business to be done in Russia by Americans to create American jobs," the President said Friday. A "jobs summit" was cooked up by the White House and sold to the leaders of the six other nations represented here. A trade deal with Japan was touted by Bill Clinton, traveling salesman, as something that would "mean lots more jobs for our folks" and for Japan, too.
The White House labored mightily to turn discussions about arcane terms of trade and international economic formulas into tangible pocketbook issues. The President capped the effort at his news conference Friday night with the comment that it would be fair to describe this as "a jobs summit."
"When people are having a tough time making ends meet, they don't tend to be very happy with their political leaders," Mr. Clinton acknowledged, but he added: "Notwithstanding that, this summit produced real substantive benefits for the people who sent these leaders here."
 
Fell Short, in Some Ways
 Relatively little was said about what had not been accomplished in the quest for fuller employment. The vexing subject of agricultural tariffs, which sharply divides the United States from France and, to a lesser degree, the other European nations, was barely addressed here. The economic communique contained no 3 percent target for annual growth, as the United States had urged. There was less aid for the Soviet Union than Mr. Clinton wanted.
As he said at the news conference, Mr. Clinton was strengthened here by his success in pushing his budget package, with its deficit-reduction measures, through both houses of Congress. He was able to urge lower European interest rates and more accessible Japanese markets without fearing the rejoinder that Ronald Reagan and George Bush heard so often from their colleagues: First cut your deficit and then we'll listen to your sermons.
But that could prove a most transitory thing. The President will return to Washington to face the immensely complicated task of persuading both houses to pass the same bill. Failure would put Mr. Clinton back very close to square one.
"I am hoping," the President said at his news conference, "that what happened this week will strengthen the resolve of the Congress to go ahead and pass the economic plan and to do it in short order.
A number of journalists and officials marveled at a typical piece of intellectual gymnastics. Just as the President dazzled American specialists at his economic round-table meeting in Little Rock before taking office, he wowed many here by his off-the-cuff command of the subtleties of the European economic situation.
In much that happened in Tokyo, the hand of David Gergen, Mr. Clinton's new counselor, was clearly visible. But Mr. Bentsen, who has been less visible than expected in the first months of the new Democratic regime, also stepped smartly to the fore here.
The summit, Mr. Clinton remarked, had "more energy and more zip" than he expected. The consensus in the conference corridors as the leaders and their aides packed their bags then left town was that the new American on the block had provided much of it.

HEADLINE: Asians Seek To Restrict U.S. Airlines

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 9

 BODY:
In a spirit of unity never seen in the Asian airline industry, most of Asia's large airlines are banding together to overturn what they consider to be one-sided agreements that give American airlines the right to pick up passengers in Asia and fly them to other destinations in Asia, a right Asian carriers do not have in America.
Fifteen major Asian carriers here have announced that they will lobby their governments to scrap, or at least drastically revise, decades-old air-service accords with Washington that date to when the Asian carriers were in their infancy. 
 The move by the Asian airlines could not come at a worse time for their large American rivals, especially United Airlines and Northwest Airlines, the largest American carriers in Asia, which had come to see flights in Asia, the world's fastest-growing air travel market, as one of the last sure opportunities for growth.
The American carriers are seeking help from the Clinton Administration, which has announced its intention to assist them.
The Orient Airlines Association -- which represents Asian and South Pacific airlines, including Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong and Qantas Airways of Australia -- started their collective attack last month.
The association's chairman, Chatrachai Bunya-Ananta, who is also the president of Thai Airways, said he would "urge Asia government negotiators to establish new, fairer agreements which provide a level playing field on which O.A.A. carriers can compete with U.S. carriers."
Under the current agreements, American air carriers were given broad freedoms to transport passengers from one point in Asia to another. But no similar rights were granted to the Asian carriers, which caused no great concern at a time when few Asian carriers flew to the United States.
Now, the reasons for the concern of Asian airlines is clear every day at major airports across this continent: It is possible for an American traveler to visit every major Asian business center on a single trip without flying on an Asian airline.
In Bangkok, travelers wishing to fly to Japan can choose from several daily flights on Thai Airways or Japan Airlines. They can also catch a late-night United flight or an early-morning Northwest flight. Both flights go on to the United States.
But Thai Airways flies to only one city in the United States, Los Angeles. Although it has the right to fly to other American cities, it cannot pick up passengers in one American city and drop them off in another.
Asian carriers say it can be difficult to compete with the American carriers, which lure passengers with deep discounts and with frequent-flier programs. Several major carriers in Southeast Asia, including Thai and Singapore, are starting their own frequent-flier programs this summer.
"The Asian airlines have quite a strong argument," said Stephen Miller, an airline consultant with Trinity Aviation in Hong Kong. "If the American airlines can fly from Taipei to Bangkok, or from Singapore to Hong Kong, the Asian carriers want the right to fly within the United States. But then the American side says, hey, you can't do this, because these are domestic routes."
Elliott Seiden, vice president for law and government affairs at Northwest Airlines, said his airline might be willing to support giving Asian carriers the authority to fly passengers within the United States, so long as American carriers retained their broad rights in Asia.
He said that Asian governments would take a serious risk if they tried to limit the American carriers.
"You can't close down airline markets without having a significant impact on free and open trade," he said, "and these are economies that are utterly dependent on free and open trade with the United States."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Threatened With U.N. Pullout, 2 U.S. Reports Say

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
As the humanitarian crisis in Bosnia worsens, two classified Administration reports say the international mediators in the Balkans are holding out the threat of seeking United Nations withdrawal from the country unless the Bosnian Muslims agree to negotiate on a partition plan.
In recent days, the mediators representing the United Nations and the European Community in the 15-month-old war have publicly warned that the deteriorating conditions could lead the United Nations to reconsider its mandate. Bosnian Government officials interpret the remarks as part of a pressure campaign intended to force them to accept the partition plan. 
 If true, the classified reports would suggest that the mediators are willing to use pressure tactics to push the Bosnian Muslims to the negotiating table. But it is not clear from the reports whether the mediators talked directly to the Bosnians about a United Nations withdrawal or were simply circulating the idea among other diplomats.
In Sarajevo, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government today renewed its appeal to the United States for political and military support in its fight to maintain Bosnia as a viable, multiethnic country. [Page 6.]
It also announced that it would reject a Serbian and Croatian proposal to end the war by dividing the former Yugoslav republic into three ethnic states.
If the United Nations pulls out, the Bosnian Muslims will lose their only outside source of protection and relief assistance.
The situation in Sarajevo has become so dire that an American disaster relief team that left the Bosnian capital this week reported to the State Department by telephone on Thursday that the city had become "the world's largest concentration camp" because there was no drinking water or fuel, and could collapse within 10 days.
 
Possibility of U.N. Pullout
 A State Department cable, sent from the United States mission in Geneva this week, quoted Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as saying the two mediators had told her recently "that if the Bosnian Muslims did not agree soon to negotiate on the basis of the Serb-Croat partition plan," they will recommend to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "that the U.N. withdraw from Bosnia."
The cable added, "If the U.N. decided to withdraw from Bosnia, Ogata made clear that U.N.H.C.R. would be part of that withdrawal."
Senior Administration officials said another classified report circulating within the United States Government today also reported that Lord Owen, who represents the European Community, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator, were raising the possibility of a United Nations withdrawal from Bosnia.
But in a telephone interview from Zagreb, Lord Owen denied that he and Mr. Stoltenberg were trying to blackmail the Bosnians into agreeing to a partition of their country.
"It's absolute nonsense," he said. "There isn't any dream, any possibility of that. There is no attempt to blackmail the Bosnian presidency. It must make its own decision."
In recent months, the increased fighting in Bosnia, attacks on United Nations workers by the three warring sides and the economic strangulation of Sarajevo and other urban centers by the Serbs and Croats have severely hampered the ability of United Nations peacekeepers to help deliver relief supplies.
Indeed, Nicholas Morris, the new head of the United Nations refugee operation in Bosnia, bluntly told diplomats last week that because of the dangers in delivering aid and the Serbian practice of demanding a portion of the aid as a price to allow delivery, "this operation should not be taking place and would not be initiated now if the U.N.H.C.R. were not already there," a separate classified State Department cable said.
United Nations officials announced on June 30 that because of the hazards and declining international contributions to the relief effort in Bosnia, shipments of food and other relief supplies would be cut by up to 50 percent in some parts of the country.
Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian representative at the United Nations, said United Nations relief officials had told Bosnian officials that relief assistance would end if they did not accept the principles of the partition plan proposed by the Serbs and Croats. "I have asked the Security Council for an explanation," he said.
But John Mills, the spokesman for Mr. Stoltenberg, said in a telephone interview from Belgrade that the desire to get the Bosnian Muslims to negotiate was not related to warnings about a potential future withdrawal of United Nations operations.
 
'That Stage May Come'
 "That stage may come," Mr. Mills said, referring to a United Nations pullout. "But it won't come as a consequence of the Bosnian presidency rejecting negotiations."
A senior State Department official traveling with Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Tokyo said that Mr. Christopher was unaware of any threats by the mediators to the Bosnian Muslims, but that he would consider any effort to pressure them by threatening a withdrawal of relief assistance "a highly unacceptable tactic."
Another senior State Department official, familiar with the matter, suggested that Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Owen were in effect indirectly putting pressure on the Bosnian Government.
"My understanding is that they are saying if there is no negotiation soon, the situation will spin out of control and the ability of the peacekeeping and humanitarian operations to operate is about to evaporate," the official said. "By implication one might interpret that as a kind of take-it-or-leave-it proposition."
Another State Department official said that neither Mr. Owen nor Mr. Stoltenberg had informed the United States of any threat to recommend a United Nations withdrawal from Bosnia.
"Any decision to withdraw would have to be made by Security Council," the official said. "We would not favor any such action."
President Clinton, meanwhile, was said to have been so disturbed in Tokyo by television reports on the situation in Sarajevo that his aides had called the State Department on Wednesday to find ways to help provide the city with food, medicine and clean water.
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 In SARAJEVO yesterday, the Muslim-led Government of BOSNIA said it would reject a Serbian-Croatian plan to divide the country it into three ethnic states. Two Clinton Administration reports say mediators are holding out the threat of seeking the U.N.'s withdrawal from BOSNIA unless its Muslim leaders agree to negotiate on the plan.
In BELGRADE, Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader, and his wife, Danica, were released from jail on orders from President Slobodan Milosevic of SERBIA.

HEADLINE: Health Limbo for Early Retirees

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The White House is consulting with business and labor groups on measures that would assure medical coverage for millions of workers who retire before they are eligible for Federal Medicare insurance.
Although no decisions have been made on how to pay for care for either active or retired workers under the proposed national health-care plan, Clinton Administration officials are discussing ways of raising money for the program, according to people who attended meetings in the last 10 days with Ira Magaziner, the White House health-care adviser. 
 Some large industries, including auto makers, as well as the A.F.L.-C.I.O., prefer an income-based payroll tax, these people said, while other industries were more receptive to paying a flat premium per employee, and some employers wanted the costs paid from general tax revenues.
 
Other Possibilities
 Ceilings on the tax or premium payments, reduced charges for small businesses and special treatment for low-income employees are also being considered.
Under the Administration plan, people who retire before age 65 could join regional alliances of health-care consumers; these groups presumably could buy health coverage at favorable prices.
With the cost of medical care climbing, many companies are requiring retirees to pay a growing share of their own health costs, which have been rising faster than general inflation for years. Some companies have announced that they will eliminate retiree coverage.
Administration officials and members of Congress said in interviews that protecting retirees would be essential in securing support for the Administration's program of sweeping changes in health care.
"It is critical to include retirees, including those who are eligible for Medicare, in reform of the system," said Dr. Mary Jane England, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, an association of 200 large employers.
Claire Hushbeck, an analyst with the American Association of Retired Persons, said that protecting retirees' benefits was an issue that worried mainstream Americans. "Mom and dad and the next-door neighbors, people who basically did everything right all along the way, are at risk of losing their health benefits," she said.
Indeed, the General Accounting Office, in a report issued yesterday to a House subcommittee on small-business regulation, stated that "retiree health benefits are not secure." It noted that an employer's right to reduce retiree benefits had been upheld in a number of court cases.
The subcommittee chairman, Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said retiree coverage should be part of a "basic benefits package" that all employers must provide.
 
Variation in Reactions
 Sharon Canner, a health policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, said employers' views on the issue varied widely.
"It depends on the industry, high wage or low wage, the markets they are competing in, health costs, geography," she said. "High-tech industries with fewer retirees are more likely to lean toward a flat premium. Autos is likely to favor a payroll tax."
Depending on the financing setup of the Administration plan, costs might be reduced for employers like the auto makers that have many older workers and retirees.
Unions generally favor a payroll tax based on a percentage of income. "It would be one of the fairest ways to get the money," said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
 
Rapidly Rising Figure
 Employers currently have a $412 billion liability for retiree medical benefits, the General Accounting Office said, up from $227 billion in 1989. Rising medical costs and the aging population have swelled the total, said Donald C. Snyder, an assistant director of the G.A.O.
At least four million Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 consider themselves retired, and three million retirees under 65 and their spouses are now receiving retiree health benefits. The report said future retirees would have less employer-provided coverage.
Medical expenses are often a problem for people over age 55, who are not eligible for Medicare. Many are rejected by private insurers because of health problems and many cannot afford insurance premiums anyway. "This is a vulnerable age group," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan.
Mr. Magaziner discussed the retiree health issue on Thursday with executives of some of the nation's largest companies at the National Association of Manufacturers office in Washington. He met with labor union officials last Friday. Both groups welcomed the Administration's interest in the retiree issue.
"It is to their credit that they are trying to solve the issue," said Karen Ignagni, the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. employee benefits department.
Walter B. Maher, a health policy spokesman in Washington for the Chrysler Corporation, said that manufacturers that offer health benefits "are bearing a disproportionate share of American health costs" and that hurts their ability to compete with companies in foreign countries where more health expenses are covered by governments.
Ms. Canner of the National Association of Manufacturers pointed out that while mature industries like autos "were getting the biggest hit" on retiree costs, "eventually all companies are going to be mature."

HEADLINE: Fed Leaned Toward Higher Rates in May

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve announced today that its main policy-setting committee voted in May to lean toward raising interest rates if inflation did not slow. Many economists said the committee probably maintained that position when it met again on Tuesday and Wednesday.
According to a summary of the May 18 meeting that was issued today, couched in the Fed's typically elliptical prose, the policy-making committee voted 10 to 2 in favor of language that would leave the Fed poised to raise short-term interest rates, but only if there was more bad news about inflation. 
 The central bank's tilt toward tightening monetary policy was a response to an unexpected spurt in inflation early this year, when consumer price inflation rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, to a 4.3 percent annual rate, from 2.9 percent in 1992. The Fed did not increase interest rates after the May meeting, however, because inflation slowed markedly in May, rising by only one-tenth of 1 percent on the consumer level.
Economists say the policy-setting committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, probably voted this week to keep tilting toward higher rates because many Fed officials fear that inflationary pressures remain stronger than they were last year.
"I think they probably kept their bias toward tightening largely because they don't want to be seen as responding to every little change in economic reports from week to week," said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Some Administration officials suggested that the Federal Reserve had maintained its tilt toward tightening because it tends to move slowly, and probably fears that a change would give the impression that it believes inflation has been tamed.
Alicia Munnell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy, expressed confidence that raising rates would not be necessary this year.
"I am confident enough that inflation will remain low for the rest of the year and that raising short-term interest rates will not be an issue," she said.
A leaning toward raising rates normally gives the central bank's chairman some leeway to raise rates without consulting the full committee. The Federal Reserve has pegged its important Federal funds rate -- at which banks lend money to each other overnight -- at 3 percent since last September.
 
Commodity Prices Cited
 At the May meeting, Wayne D. Angell, a Federal Reserve Board member, voted against a slight bias toward tightening on the ground that that was too weak. He favored an immediate increase in short-term rates because he was worried that commodity prices were rising and that the bond markets appeared to fear inflationary pressures.
Edward G. Boehne, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, dissented against the bias toward tightening because he was convinced that there was no fundamental upward shift in inflation. He believed that the economy might weaken further and that "underlying economic conditions did not point toward an extended period of higher inflation."
Mr. Boehne's views appear to have been vindicated by the slight May rise in consumer prices and by the flurry of recent reports pointing to slow growth.
The Federal Open Market Committee includes the Federal Reserve Board's seven members and five presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks. The central bank traditionally waits six weeks before releasing summaries of open market committee meetings.
Using the Fed's often dense language, the summary of the May meeting said, "In the view of a majority of the members, wage and price developments over recent months were sufficiently worrisome to warrant positioning policy for a move toward restraint should signs of continuing inflation continue to multiply."
But the majority decided that "given the special nature of current inflation and attendant uncertainties," the committee agreed with a proposal from Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, that there should be further consultations "in the event that a tightening move were to be contemplated."
The majority's position was that even "if a policy tightening action were not needed," a tilt toward higher rates "would nonetheless underscore the committee's concern about recent inflation readings."
The debate swirled around the hypertechnical jargon of a Federal Reserve directive. The language that was approved stated that "slightly greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable." Translators of Fed jargon say this use of "would" is far stronger than this use of "might" and is enough to make bond buyers do somersaults. This language means that the Fed prefers greater reserve restraint; that is, a tilt toward higher rates.

HEADLINE: Yemen's Democracy Gives U.S. the Jitters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The first true multiparty democracy in Middle Eastern history has emerged in the mountain country of Yemen, despite the best efforts of the United States to abort it. With almost no natural resource base, Yemen has until recently sustained a growth rate rivaling that of the "dragons" of east Asia, more than 6 percent a year from 1970 to 1988. 
 But in the last two years, as a consequence of the Persian Gulf war, Yemen's economy has collapsed. Saudi Arabia, our strategic ally, has made beggaring Yemen a prime foreign policy objective. To this end, and with tacit United States acceptance, Saudi Arabia has forcibly ejected from its soil almost a million Yemenites, most of whom were forced to leave prosperous businesses and properties behind. The Saudis have also funneled money and aid to a fifth column of religious fundamentalists.
As a consequence, more than one-third of the population of Yemen is unemployed, and many are in refugee camps. The Yemeni currency, the riyal, has lost 75 percent of its international value. The economy has been devastated.
The last few years have seen droughts equal to those in Somalia and Ethiopia. Yemen has been visited by a plague of locusts that are destroying crops throughout the land.
Yet starvation has been staved off, and Yemen's refugees have been fed by their own people. The United States, while pumping streams of money or missiles to the region, has avoided offending our petrol partners by acknowledging this little democracy. As a transplanted Yemenite, I ache with pride. But as a first-generation American, I burn with shame.

HEADLINE: Guy Noyes, 79, Dies; Economist for Bank And Federal Reserve

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Guy Emerson Noyes, an economist who directed research and analyzed trends for the Federal Reserve Board and later for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, died on Sunday at the Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 79 and lived in Naples.
His wife, Irene, said the cause of death was massive infection. 
 Mr. Noyes joined the Federal Reserve System in 1948 as an adviser to its board of governors and served as director of research and statistics from 1960 to 1965, when he joined Morgan Guaranty as senior vice president and economist.
Reflecting on that move in an interview, he said, "After you have been pushing buttons in Washington for years to get the economy to behave the way you want it to, there's a certain intellectual fascination about wanting to try it on the other side -- to see how policy from Washington affects the private decision-making process."
During his 13 years at Morgan he centralized its various economic analysis units and established the company's economic research unit as one of the strongest on Wall Street.
Mr. Noyes, who was generally known as Jack, was a native of Columbia, Mo., and the son of the dean of the University of Missouri's Medical School. After graduating from Missouri he studied banking as a graduate student at Yale University.
In World War II he served as Army Reserve officer in London. After the war he became a research director at the State Department, where he remained two years before going to the Federal Reserve Board.
His first marriage ended with the death of his wife, the former Patricia Hartnett, in 1972. Besides his wife Irene, he is survived by a son, Guy Jr., of Seattle; a daughter, Pamela, of Great Falls, Va., and a grandchild.

HEADLINE: Talk of German Rate Drop Spurs Dollar Against Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a 20-month high against the German mark yesterday after a large purchase in Europe set off what traders said was a chain reaction of buying in a thin market. Dealers said the identity of the buyer was unknown.
Meanwhile, gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery dropped $3.30 an ounce, to $392.30. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put spot gold at $391.55 an ounce, down $3.20 from Thursday. 
 Talk of further German interest-rate cuts also spurred demand for dollars, dealers said. The talk was rekindled by a statement from the Group of Seven industrial nations meeting in Tokyo calling for lower European interest rates to help stimulate the world economy.
The dollar benefits from lower German interest rates, which make the mark less attractive to investors.
Jitters about the viability of Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, which links the currencies of eight European Community nations, also helped the dollar. The fears stemmed from the continued weakness of the French franc, which came under attack Thursday after a weak economic report.
"The dollar is clearly drawing support from renewed tension in the E.R.M. and from all this talk about German interest rates being cut again this month," said David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London.
The dollar also advanced on the yen amid reports that United States and Japanese officials were close to a possible agreement on the framework for a trade pact. Officials were working on the pact as the Group of Seven was wrapping up its meeting in Tokyo.
Progress toward a bilateral agreement has quelled talk that the United States would look to a stronger yen as a tool for paring Japan's huge trade surplus.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7210 marks, from 1.7030 marks late Thursday. The dollar was also quoted at 109.96 yen in New York, up from 108.54 yen Thursday.
The British pound, meanwhile, settled at $1.4810 in New York, down from $1.4965 Thursday.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Journal;
A New Graphic Message From Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 9

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein's latest attempt to get even with the man who forced him out of Kuwait is a larger-than-life mosaic of a snarling George Bush on the floor at the entrance to the Rashid Hotel, the best in Baghdad.
Visitors leave dusty footprints on the image of Mr. Bush, who led the allied coalition in the Persian Gulf war. "Bush Is Criminal," says the legend underneath. 
 It is a futile gesture and, in the view of an Arab ambassador here, "unnecessary and counterproductive." But it illustrates the two-track Iraqi response to nearly three years of trade sanctions and diplomatic isolation.
 
Defiance and Appeals
 On the one hand, foreign diplomats here say, Iraq is making its most serious effort since the war to build bridges to Washington and to get sanctions lifted as the country slides into deepening economic distress.
But the Government is still shouting defiance and trying to rally the people to blame Washington and its allies for all its troubles.
On Thursday the Information Ministry issued a book on the Persian Gulf war. Its triumphant opening sentence says: "The course of the Mother of Battles is a continuation of the holy war of our great ancestors at the dawn of Islam in fighting the atheists and the unjust."
Last summer Iraqi television showed a 52-part serial, "Mirage or Reality," explaining Iraq's historical claim to Kuwait. This summer it is showing a 22-part series on the origins of the Saudi royal family, asserting that King Fahd is descended from Jewish merchants who lived in Basra, in southern Iraq, at the end of the 18th century.
The program can be picked up in Kuwait and parts of Saudi Arabia.
The United States has accused Iraq of masterminding a bomb plot against Mr. Bush when the former President was visiting Kuwait in April. And Iraq is now locked in another standoff with United Nations arms inspectors, who want to install surveillance cameras at what are thought to be missile-testing stations.
Such actions are hard to reconcile with Baghdad's insistence that it wants special relations with the Clinton Administration.
The leadership's reaction to the American missile raid on June 27, which Washington said was in retaliation for the reported plot against Mr. Bush, has been astonishingly conciliatory. President Hussein has not said a word in public since the raid, evidently because he fears being forced to criticize the United States.
In recent months, diplomats say, Baghdad has welcomed industrialists from Japan and Europe and dangled the prospects of big contracts if they can persuade their governments to get sanctions lifted.
Harassment of United Nations personnel, rampant a year ago when the windows of their jeeps were regularly broken and the tires slashed, has virtually ended. Mohammed Zejjari, the United Nations aid coordinator here, says he no longer has difficulty getting relief convoys to Kurds in northern Iraq, whose lands have been blockaded by the Iraqi Army.
Since the Persian Gulf war, in 1991, President Hussein has blamed external forces for the country's economic woes and has used the fear of another attack to rally the people.
From this point of view, the recent American attack played into his hands without doing any discernible damage to his security system.
"Frankly, when I heard the explosions I thought it was a coup, because everything has been so quiet here for months," an Asian ambassador said. "But once I learned what it was, I knew Saddam was safe a while longer."
But other actions are seen as part of an Iraqi campaign to test the Security Council's will to maintain sanctions with the coalition from the war less unified and with poor neighboring countries like Turkey complaining that the embargo costs them billions of dollars in lost trade.
In an attempt to mobilize Islamic opinion in favor of unfreezing its overseas bank accounts, Baghdad recently offered to give $50 million to a Palestinian housing project in the Israeli-occupied West Bank if funds are released and to spend $10 million on Korans for schools there.
Similarly, Iraq opposes installing surveillance cameras at missile-testing sites because it sees this as an attempt by Washington to impose new conditions for ending the embargo.
This is why Baghdad has asked the Council to lay out exactly what Iraq must do to have sanctions lifted. The United States and its allies want Iraq to comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions, in addition to abandoning its weapons of mass destruction, before trade restrictions are eased.
This means Iraq must end its repression of the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south and accept the less favorable border with Kuwait that the United Nations has drawn. "That frontier is going to be the most difficult condition of all for Iraq to meet," the Arab ambassador said.
 
Feeling the Pinch
 There is also a widespread feeling here that Iraq is running critically short of resources and may be willing to show greater flexibility.
Both bread and butter have vanished from the restaurants of the Rashid, and the hotel no longer provides soap in the bathrooms or towels at the swimming pool. At meetings with ambassadors, the Foreign Minister no longer gives them note pads; if a diplomat asks for paper, he is offered a single sheet.
Iraq has its cement and fertilizer industries working again, and there is evidence it is exporting both commodities to Iran. But Turkish merchants have complained to their embassy that they can no longer get dollars for the food they bring in.
Last year popular resentment at high prices led President Hussein to execute 43 merchants for profiteering. This year he banned the import and sale of a long list of luxury goods. Foreign cosmetics, beer and electrical items have all disappeared from Baghdad shops.
A year ago the Government-owned foreign currency shop here was stuffed with European goods. Today it stocks virtually nothing but Scotch whisky, which, curiously, has not been banned.

HEADLINE: Treasury Yield Falls to Low of 6.64%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Optimism ahead of next week's inflation figures continued to give a lift to long-term Treasury prices yesterday, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to a record low for the second straight session.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 1/4 point, or $2.50 for $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to a low of 6.64 percent, from 6.65 percent Thursday. 
 Intermediate maturities were 1/32 point to 1/8 point higher. But prices of shorter-term securities retreated slightly by 1/32 point, the Telerate financial information service reported.
Trading was thin, with traders awaiting next week's two June inflation reports: the Producer Price Index, scheduled for Tuesday, and the Consumer Price Index, on Wednesday.
Most economists expect the figures to show a low annual rate of inflation, which would bode favorably for bonds. Higher inflation tends to diminish the value of Treasury securities, particularly bonds that do not mature for many years.
Many economists believe that producer prices will be unchanged to down three-tenths of a percent in June. Consumer prices, meanwhile, are expected to increase by one-tenth to two-tenths of a percent.
With their attention on inflation concerns, participants continued to react positively to a decline in daily commodity prices. Yesterday, the Commodity Research Bureau Index fell 0.7, to 216.05, as grains and precious metals declined in price.
 
'Groping in the Dark'
 The decline in the index, a widely watched indicator of inflation trends, is fueling optimism that inflation reports for the months following June will also show inflation under control, said Robert Brusca, chief economist in the fixed-income department at Nikko Securities International.
"The bond market is sort of groping in the dark, trying to see where it can go," Mr. Brusca said.
A sharp advance in the dollar against key foreign currencies also lent some psychological support to the Treasury market, said Mead Briggs, head of risk trading at Deutsche Bank Government Securities.
Some investors stepping up their purchases of dollars in European trading, which opens before New York's session, decided to funnel the United States currency into Treasury securities, Mr. Briggs said.
Demand for long-term bonds has also benefited from a favorable supply outlook. The Treasury has whittled down the supply of 30-year bonds as part of its new debt management mix. As a result, the Government's auction of long bonds in August is the last until February.
That has lent a favorable undercurrent to prices, since fewer bonds help the value of existing securities.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 3.07 percent as the discount was steady at 3.01 percent. Six-month yields were up to 3.19 percent as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point, to 3.11 percent. One-year yields were up to 3.38 percent as the discount was up 0.01 point, to 3.26 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10223/32 , up 1/16 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.71 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Hit Right Notes, Gaining 6.64, to 3,521.06

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Like an aging lounge act, the stock market turned in a solid but uninspired performance yesterday.
No trumpets sounded, but no screams were heard, either, as rising bond prices and good results earlier in the day on overseas markets helped lift most leading market indicators. For the first time since June 4, the Dow Jones industrial average finished higher than it did on the previous Friday, gaining 6.64 points, to 3,521.06. For the week, the Dow gained 37.09. 
 "It was pretty good for a Friday," said Lawrence R. Rice, a market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "A nonevent, I'd say."
 
 
Volume Was Surprising
 The one surprise, he said, was that trading on the New York Stock Exchange, was moderately heavy for the start of a summer weekend, at 234 million shares, compared with 284.1 on Thursday. "Figured everybody would be gone," he said.
The markets managed to overcome some profit taking during the morning after two days of solid gains. The exception was among transportation stocks, with the airlines in particular suffering after a rally on Thursday. "They bid them up a little too high," Mr. Rice said. "You continue to have a lack of traffic in the industry, and discounting."
Partly because of the weakened airline stocks, the Dow Jones transportation average finished down 10.09 points at 1,509.16. The American Stock Exchange index was up 1.82, to 434.37, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 3.10, to 705.81. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost ground, dropping 0.51 point, to 448.13.
 
 
Auto Makers Gain
 The Big Three auto makers continued a surge that began on Tuesday, when they reported vigorous sales for late June, their best period since late December 1990. "They're coming from a disaster and looking pretty doggone good," said Arvid Jouppi, senior vice president for research for Keane Securities.
General Motors finished the day at 47 1/2, up 5/8. Ford Motor was up 7/8 at 52 1/8, and Chrysler was up 3/8 at 47 1/2.
The upturn for the Big Three may bode well for the economy as a whole. Mr. Jouppi cited the auto makers' performance in 1982, when an August rally in auto stocks presaged the stock market's recovery that fall. For that reason, he said, he expects no more quantum leaps in auto stocks. "There will be other values that will compete for investment dollars in the not-too-distant future," he said.
Among the big gainers yesterday was Best Buy, an electronics retailer. Its shares rose 3 3/8, to 41 1/2, still riding high from its report on Thursday that June same-store sales rose 28 percent from the period in 1992.
Steven M. Ashley, a vice president of Cleary Gull Reiland & McDevitt, attributed the sharp sales improvement to Best Buy's decision to begin carrying personal computers and to a new personnel strategy that relies on clerks paid by the hour. "They have taken aggressive commission salesmen out of the stores," he said. "It is not that used-car-salesman feeling."
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 188.72 points, or 0.96 percent, to 19,877.39. For the week, the Nikkei rose 255.93.

HEADLINE: Henry Hazlitt, 98, a Journalist Who Concentrated on Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Henry Hazlitt, a self-taught economist who popularized the subject as a journalist and wrote a best-selling book about it, died yesterday at the Carolton Chronic Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Conn. He was 98 and had lived at the hospital for nearly seven years.
"Economics in One Lesson," the best-known of Mr. Hazlitt's 17 books, was unstinting in its praise of free markets. In the simplest language, rarely citing statistics, he laid out what he called the fallacies of regulating economic activity -- like trying, for example, to raise wage levels through minimum wage laws or union bargaining. 
 And without naming Karl Marx or John Maynard Keynes, whose theories were so prominent in 1946 when the book was published, Mr. Hazlitt rejected their interventionist solutions.
"Fallacies, when they have reached the popular stage, become anonymous anyway," he wrote in his 222-page book, which sold more than 600,000 copies. "The subtleties or obscurities to be found in the authors most responsible for propagating them are washed off."
 
Economics and Some Fiction
 Mainly a journalist, by the time he was 38 years old in 1933 Mr. Hazlitt had written on economics for The Wall Street Journal, served as financial editor for The New York Evening Mail, written editorials for The New York Herald and The New York Sun and, switching specialties, served as literary editor of The Sun and then The Nation.
That brought him to the attention of the writer and critic H. L. Mencken, who asked Mr. Hazlitt in 1933 to succeed him as editor of the American Mercury, a widely read magazine founded by Mr. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, best known for its iconoclastic commentaries on American ways. The following year, Mr. Hazlitt joined The New York Times as an editorial writer specializing in economics, remaining at The Times until 1946. For the next 20 years he wrote a column entitled Business Tides for Newsweek magazine.
Mr. Hazlitt was born on Nov. 28, 1894, in Philadelphia. He had planned to go to Harvard and major in psychology. But "something called a shortage of funds," as he later put it, forced him to go to City College instead, and a few months later he left even that tuition-free school "to go to work to support my mother as well as myself." The Wall Street Journal gave him that first job.
Mr. Hazlitt lived in Wilton, Conn., before entering Carolton. His wife, the former Frances S. Kanes, died in 1991.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Youths With Potential Honor a Helping Hand

BYLINE: By Felicia R. Lee

 BODY:
IT was the year that both the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were slain, the musical "Hair" enthralled Broadway and defiance marked attitudes. It was also the year that 14 male New Yorkers gathered to consider being young, gifted, black and Catholic in a time of turmoil.
The men will come together a week from today to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Archbishop's Leadership Project, which began in June 1968 under the Archbishop of New York, Terence Cardinal Cooke. Initially archdiocesan leaders planned to use the group to promote the priesthood as a vocation among blacks, but it quickly became a kind of crucible for personal development. 
 The young men from Catholic high schools were chosen for their academic and personal potential. They spent their two years in the project attending cultural events, debating issues like assimilation versus revolution, listening to guest speakers and going on weekend retreats that were a mix of adolescent shenanigans and soul-searching.
Of the men in that first group, most have gone on to do good things. They are now fathers and husbands, bankers, lawyers, a psychiatrist. And now the first from the leadership project has become a priest.
On a recent sweltering Sunday at St. Mark the Evangelist Church in Harlem, the Rev. Gregory C. Chisholm celebrated a Mass of thanksgiving to mark his ordination.
Ordained in June, Father Chisholm represents a most positive development in a church that has had to contend with dwindling numbers of priests, the loss of many black and Hispanic parishioners and many priests accused of sexual abuse.
That Sunday Father Chisholm looked at the beaming faces squeezed into the pews at St. Mark's, the place where generations of his family have been christened, married and mourned. He grinned.
"I know," he said, "there are many of you who thought you'd never see this." Laughter rang out, bouncing off the walls with the traditional stained-glass renditions of a Jesus with white skin and a large painting of a brown-skinned man on a cross.
Father Chisholm and his friends from the first leadership group credit the project and its coordinator, the Rev. John T. Meehan, an Irish-American priest, as bringing them to a more profound understanding of their role in transforming a society whose barriers had never seemed more fluid.
They learned ways to define manhood that went beyond sexuality and rhetoric, they said. They learned that there is a place where their racial heritage meets their faith. Their hope is that the project -- now coed and led by a laywoman -- can continue to inspire.
"My whole life I owe to it," said Irv Cooke, a tax auditor who grew up in Harlem. "It made me realize my self-worth. Growing up where I did, you never saw the outside world for what it was. I learned that you can be successful by giving it your all."
Gerald Adolph, a management consultant, recalled, "It was taking this group with a bunch of energy and a bunch of mouth and channeling it into something positive. It helped me stand up and formulate some thoughts in an intelligent way."
Father Chisholm was one of the stars of that first group, the men recall. Tall and handsome, he came to the priesthood at age 42 after obtaining a doctorate in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working as an engineer and studying philosophy and theology in London.
On Sunday those various strands came together in a homily that breathed passion and social analysis. Father Chisholm said the Harlem of his youth, the Harlem where professionals and blue-collar workers dwelled side by side and a spirit of collective purpose infused the air, was gone.
What has taken its place, he said, was economic decline, the intrusion of AIDS and crack and a feeling among some of his people that they wanted to distance themselves from "that mess."
"The whiter, more dominant culture will never let any African-American run away from their heritage and their legacy," he said. "Many of us will recognize that the 90's, the last 15 years, represent the worse time in our history."
The Archbishop's Leadership Project reflects some of the changes that make these times terrible ones, Father Chisholm said later. The young people who join these days tend to come from more troubled families and have less understanding of black history, he said. More profoundly, they fail to see themselves as part of a battle waged by their people not simply for economic viability but for human dignity and purpose.
"Those were angry times, but the focus in the group was on our helping, our doing something," Father Chisholm recalled. "We were trained to be self-assured, to be self-aware and to be generous."
So next weekend, between the beers and the back-slapping and the feeling of sustenance that comes from touching one's roots, the men and the women of the project hope to find ways to extend the ladder that they so proudly climbed.

HEADLINE: Muni Funds Provide Hideaway From Taxes

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
President Clinton's pledge to increase the top income tax rate from 31 to 36 percent (39.6 percent for the wealthiest) has many investors scrambling for shelter.
One good place to hide is a municipal bond fund, which invests in the bonds and notes of states and municipalities. The issues, used to finance public projects and services, are backed by the taxing power of issuers or by revenues from toll roads or other projects. 
 The accompanying chart lists the 10 top-performing national muni bond funds ranked by three-year returns, the 9 best muni funds investing in New York and the 10 best for California. The chart excludes funds with annual expenses of more than three-quarters of 1 percent, the average for the group. It also eliminates the most volatile funds and adjusts returns for front-end sales charges.
The chief appeal of these funds, of course, is that their income is free from Federal income taxes (although taxes are owed on any capital gains). In the case of the New York and California funds, which invest in debt issued by those states, their municipalities or agencies, income is free from Federal, state and local taxes for state residents.
So while munis may yield less than taxable funds, investors keep more after taxes are paid.
A fund's "taxable equivalent yield" shows how much a taxable investment would have to pay to match the yield of a tax-free fund. To calculate, divide the actual yield by 1 minus your Federal tax rate expressed in decimals. For a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket, the taxable equivalent yield for a muni bond fund yielding 4.83 percent -- the average for these funds in June -- is 6.71 percent (after subtracting .28 from 1, then dividing 4.83 by .72).
Also, interest on issues of specific states is free of state taxes for state residents. Funds note this amount on your end-of-year tax statement.
To figure the rough after-tax yield on the single-state funds, divide the fund's yield by one minus your combined Federal and state tax rates, expressed in decimals.
Some national and single-state muni funds own "private purpose" paper, issued by some municipalities to finance nonessential projects like student loans. Interest on private purpose paper is free from Federal income taxes but subject to the alternative minimum tax.
To compensate for the tax liability, private purpose paper normally pays slightly more than regular issues. People who do not expect to owe the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., can increase their yields by owning shares in funds that own more A.M.T. paper. Fund companies can provide this information.
While most people view muni funds as solid investments, they carry a serious risk. In general, bond fund prices fall when interest rates rise; the longer the term of the bond, the farther prices fall when rates rise. Most muni funds carry maturities of more than 20 years.
While the top-performing muni funds over time are those with longer maturities, the interim interest-rate risk may be too much for conservative investors. By shortening maturities, investors reduce risk. If interest rates rise 1 percent, an intermediate- term fund's share price should drop only 3 percent, compared with 7 percent for share prices of longer-term funds, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds.
Of course what is gained in safety is lost in yield. The 59 muni funds sporting short to intermediate maturities yield about three-quarters of a percentage point less than their longer cousins.
Because of differences in the quality and maturity of bonds held by the funds, yields vary. So it pays to shop around. The average 12-month yield of the long-term New York funds tracked by Morningstar was 5.49 percent in June. But Putnam New York Tax-Exempt Opportunities yields 6.48 percent, while the laggard, the Warburg Pincus New York Municipal Bond Fund yields only 4.45 percent. The long-term California funds yielded an average of 5.53 percent, but Prudential California Municipal Income A yields 6.51 percent and Muir California Tax-Free Bond Fund yields 4.02 percent.
Because of the general erosion in some states' economies, investors in New York and Massachusetts in particular, should keep no more than 40 or 50 percent of their total tax-free portfolio in state bonds, said James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter published in New York. Even in better-managed states, he advised tying up no more than 75 percent of tax-free assets in-state.
One way to minimize risk is to buy funds that invest in insured bonds or regular munis that the fund insures itself. The 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply System was a harsh reminder that munis are not risk-free. Yet experts say that defaults on individual issues should not pose a problem for investors in funds, because they have diversified portfolios.
The price for the added security is negligible because the insurance premium is small. As a group, regular munis returned 10.1 percent for the year ended in June, compared with 10.3 percent for the 76 insured muni funds.

HEADLINE: Plotting a Course to a Secure Retirement

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Saving for retirement has become a critical issue for Americans. Companies are slashing pension benefits; the Federal agency that guarantees corporate pensions, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, is struggling, and the Social Security system faces the burden of an aging population.
Personal savings will almost certainly have to fill any gap between benefits and needs. But most Americans are in dismal shape. People 25 to 44 are saving at a rate that will provide them with only about a third of what they will need to maintain their current style of living when they retire, a recent study commissioned by Merrill Lynch & Company found. 
 Even the money squirreled away may be placed unwisely. Many investors are choosing conservative investments that will not provide adequately for their retirement. The returns on money stashed for 10 years or more in supposedly safe certificates of deposit or other fixed-rate accounts could be seriously eroded by inflation.
Then again, the stock market could be poised for a fall.
Where's an investor to turn? For guidance, five mutual fund experts were asked how they would invest $50,000 for retirement in 20 years or more. The experts generally adhered to the maxim that stock funds were best for long-term investments.
But several expressed concern about the stock market's lofty prices -- close to a record high -- and chose more conservative portfolios than they would have in years past. Sprinkled among the stock selections are balanced funds, which own stocks and bonds, and growth-and-income and equity-income funds, which own stocks whose high dividends can offset falling share prices.
"All my portfolios have a conservative stance," said Sheldon Jacobs, who edits The No-Load Fund Investor newsletter in Irvington, N.Y. To achieve that goal, he limited the number of aggressive growth and growth funds and opted for some growth-and-income funds.
Eric Kobren, the president of Insight Management, a Wellesley, Mass., investment firm specializing in Fidelity Investment funds and the editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter, said, "The market is pretty pricey on most fundamental measures, but having some stock market exposure pays off." Besides avoiding the most aggressive types of stock funds, he used bond funds as a buffer in his portfolio.
Despite high stock prices, fund experts recommend that most people move into stock funds as soon as possible. Over time, the market rises more than it falls. And investors will need that portfolio growth.
 The Merrill Lynch study on retirement planning found that the shortfall between retirement needs and savings was greatest among people at high income levels.
Married couples earning more than $100,000 had saved on average only 28 percent of the amount needed to maintain themselves comfortably. Married couples earning $20,000 to $40,000 had saved 49 percent.
How much is enough? People covered by pension plans should accumulate two and a half to six times their annual pre-retirement earnings, said B. Douglas Bernheim, a professor of economics and business policy at Princeton University, who conducted the study. People who do not have pension coverage should aim for four to eight times their peak annual earnings before retirement, he said.
Savers shifting retirement money from C.D.'s and nonequity investments into funds may want to move slowly for psychological reasons, said Harold Evensky, of Evensky & Brown, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. A gradual shift will help minimize the loss should the market drop suddenly. He advises moving 20 to 30 percent into equities immediately and then dollar-cost averaging monthly over the next 60 months. Dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount regularly; by doing so, you buy more shares when the share price is lower.
For people nearing retirement, several experts suggested modifications of their portfolios. The advice: shift money gradually out of stock funds into bond or money market funds. Start about 10 years before retirement, with a goal of reducing stocks to 60 percent of your portfolio by retirement. One rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 100 to derive a percentage for equities. A 65-year-old would keep 35 percent in stocks, 65 percent in bonds.
Our experts were asked to limit their portfolios to 10 selections and to mutual funds that are open to new investors. Their performance will be tracked periodically in this space, and they will have the opportunity, at quarterly intervals, to make changes.
Mr. Jacobs, who manages private money using no-load mutual funds in addition to editing the newsletter, chose the most funds, at nine, and stayed with an all-equity portfolio. "I believe this extra diversification will provide good growth with less risk than if I were to use fewer funds," he said. Of those, three invest overseas, "allowing me to target the area with the most potential," he said. He would lower the risk of the portfolio for investors nearing retirement by replacing American Heritage and Windsor II with T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income.
Mr. Evensky, who develops portfolios using public and institutional no-load funds, also dedicated his portfolio to stocks because "my primary concern is purchasing power." He struck a balance between large- and small-capitalization stocks, and funds that use various approaches to picking stocks. The SoGen fund is sold no-load through Charles Schwab & Company; otherwise, a 3.75 percent upfront load applies.
For people within 10 years of retiring, Mr. Evensky would reduce the equity portion to about 80 percent.
John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, Chicago, split his portfolio among five no-load stock funds and the Third Avenue Value, an unusual 5.75 percent load fund specializing in bankruptcies and corporate turnarounds. He would shift the Janus portion into Financial Industrial Income, a more conservative stock fund, within 10 years of retirement.
Jack A. Brill, an investment adviser in San Diego, specializes in socially responsible investing and was co-author of "Investing From the Heart" (Crown Publishers, 1993). To build a portfolio, he made choices from among the 20 or so "social responsibility" funds, which pick securities based on ethical or social criteria. To offset risk, he uses two balanced funds -- Pax World and Working Assets Citizens Balanced -- and an income fund, Working Assets Citizens Income. He would modify this mix for people nearing retirement by reducing the growth funds to 15 percent each, eliminating Progressive Environmental and Pax World, adding Vanguard GNMA (20 percent), Calvert Social Managed Growth (20 percent) and increasing Working Assets Balanced (20 percent).
Mr. Kobren, the Fidelity specialist, constructed an all-Fidelity portfolio with the idea of "being in areas of the market that won't be hurt as much if we hit some bumps." Thus he selected Fidelity Value, a stock fund that owns economically sensitive companies. He balanced that fund's large capitalization bias with a new, quantitatively managed small stock fund, sold with a 3 percent sales load. He reduced risk further by splitting 30 percent of the portfolio between two bond funds. He said he would make no changes for investors within 10 years of retiring.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Same Game, But With New Players

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
AS major league baseball prepares to celebrate All-Star week, the nation's pastime continues to be haunted by the legacy of segregation, which it formally brought to an end in 1946 with the signing of Jackie Robinson.
This morning, the Baltimore Orioles will hold a breakfast for 25 veterans of the Negro Leagues. Later this afternoon, before a game with Chicago, the Orioles will honor the men who competed in a league that flourished because of segregation, then eventually folded because of integration. 
 On Tuesday, 500 demonstrators are expected to picket Baltimore's Camden Yards during the All-Star Game in a protest organized by the Rainbow Commission on Fairness in Athletics. The purpose of the protest is to call attention to baseball's sluggish minority hiring and its failure to establish ties with black-owned businesses.
Earlier this week, the Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in its annual report card, gave major league baseball a C for its minority hiring record, pointing to the lack of a single black general manager. The center gave pro football a B and for the fourth consecutive year the National Basketball Association received an A.
The report card was issued the same day the Mets announced the hiring of Joe McIlvaine for a second tour of duty with the team. Alexander and Associates, the consulting firm hired by major league baseball in 1987 to improve minority hiring, had advised the Mets to widen their search.
"We suggested to the Mets that they conduct a more adequate inclusionary search," said Clifford Alexander, president of the consulting firm. "They told us the process was too far along."
Alexander is in the unenviable position of having to defend a league that moves at a snail's pace of progress. And it's not just baseball.
The Center for the Study of Sport gave the N.B.A. an A. The Rainbow Commission, however, blasted the N.B.A. recently, releasing statistics showing that despite being 70 percent black on the court, the N.B.A. was woefully underrepresented by African-Americans in key decision-making positions.
"That grade is preposterous," said Charles Grantham, executive director of the N.B.A. Players Association. "You get an A when there is a black commissioner. There is not a black deputy commissioner, no team president who is black, no black team physicians or black comptrollers. You don't get A for effort. Where does the A come from? This is a classic case of grade inflation."
The push for equality in sports has gone beyond fretting over issues that were silly to begin with: Can blacks play quarterback? Can they manage? Can they function in the front office? In fact, numbers are no longer the primary ammunition in the battle for empowerment. The new impetus is forcing professional franchises -- by threat of pickets, boycotts and lawsuits -- to deal with minority-owned enterprises.
There are new players as well. And those conspicuous by their absence are the players -- the athletes -- themselves.
Last week in Baltimore, the Rev. Ben Chavis, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, concluded an unprecedented "fair-share agreement" with a business group in Charlotte being considered for a National Football League expansion franchise. Jerry Richardson, the president and chief executive officer of Flagstar Companies Inc., pledged that if his group is successful in bringing a franchise to Charlotte, N.C., his group will hire 15 to 20 percent minorities in management, spend from 5 to 10 percent of his advertising budget with minority firms and make 10 to 20 percent of purchases through minority vendors.
On Thursday, the Orioles signed an agreement with the African-American Task Force of Professional Sports in Maryland, saying the team would allocate 37 percent of its advertising budget to media outlets with predominantly black readerships and agreeing to deposit $100,000 in a black-owned bank in Baltimore.
In the past, sport franchises rarely worried about having their feet put to the fire. Athletes were too fearful of retribution, and political leaders and community activists in the black community, with other more pressing issues, largely ignored sports.
All of that is changing now. A new group of players are coming to sit at the table -- wise, old veterans of the civil rights movement. They may not be able to shoot jump shots or run off tackle. But they know how to use the courts and mobilize mass support to force change.
The hammer seems to be falling.

HEADLINE: Beethoven's 9 Symphonies in Y Season

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The complete Beethoven symphony cycle, played by the New York Chamber Symphony with Gerard Schwarz conducting, is the centerpiece of the 1993-94 music schedule at the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y. Also notable among the center's plans are a traversal of Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues by the Russian pianist Tatyana Nikolayeva, a Bach series by the pianist Vladimir Feltsman and a three-concert overview of the guitar repertory by John Williams.
After two seasons in which economic pressures led the center to trim its offerings, the Y has reconsidered its balance of orchestral programs, recitals and chamber music. In the new mix, two orchestral performances that were dropped last year have been restored. 
 But the budget for next season is about the same as this year's, roughly $3.5 million.
The Beethoven cycle begins on Oct. 2 with the Fifth Symphony, on a program that also includes a new version of Mendelssohn's "Midsummer Night's Dream" incidental music, with Christopher Plummer narrating his own new text for the work. The only Beethoven concert that will not be performed at the 92d Street Y is the program that brings together the First and Ninth Symphonies; it will take place on Jan. 30 at Carnegie Hall.
 
A Conductor Bows Out
 The New York Chamber Symphony is also continuing its four-concert Baroque music series, which opens with a performance of Handel's "Judas Maccabeus" on Nov. 27 and includes Nadia Salerno-Sonnenberg's debut as a conductor on April 30. Other guest conductors are Dmitry Sitkovetsky and Helmuth Rilling.
Mr. Schwarz is to conduct all seven concerts in the orchestra's main series, including one that was to have been led by Paul Sacher, who is listed in the season's prospectus. The 87-year-old Swiss conductor was advised by his doctors to withdraw from the engagement.
In addition to the Beethoven symphonies, the programs include the premieres of works by David Diamond, the center's resident composer, and Aaron Jay Kernis. Mr. Diamond has also composed a Guitar Quintet for the Y's chamber music series. The Cleveland Quartet and the guitarist Sharon Isbin are to give the work its premiere on Oct. 26. The other concerts in the series feature the center's resident ensemble, the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio, with the pianist Leon Fleisher, the bassist Julius Levine and the tenor Paul Groves among their collaborators.
 
A Series of Cycles
 The center has dropped its long-running Distinguished Artists series in favor of two- and three-concert cycles by ensembles and soloists. The Emerson String Quartet, for example, is examining the late quartets of Shostakovich and Beethoven on Oct. 23, Jan. 22 and Feb. 26. Miss Nikolayeva is making her New York debut playing the Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3.
Mr. Feltsman is playing Bach's "Goldberg" Variations on Dec. 19; the "Well-Tempered Clavier," Book I, on Jan. 16, and a program that includes the first two Partitas, the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue and the Italian Concerto on Feb. 20. And Mr. Williams is presenting a program of Baroque transcriptions on March 10, contemporary works on March 15 and Spanish and Latin works on March 19.
Also on the schedule is a series of performances by young musicians, including Maxim Vengerov, a violinist, and Andreas Haefliger and Christopher O'Riley, pianists. Young Concert Artists will present four programs at the center, and the pianist Jeffrey Siegel will present four of his Keyboard Conversation programs. In addition to classical music, the center is offering a jazz series July 20 to 22 and four cabaret concerts in the fall and winter.

For a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket, the taxable equivalent yield for a muni bond fund yielding 4.83 percent -- the average for these funds in June -- is 6.71 percent (after subtracting .28 from 1, then dividing 4.83 by .72).
Also, interest on issues of specific states is free of state taxes for state residents. Funds note this amount on your end-of-year tax statement.
To figure the rough after-tax yield on the single-state funds, divide the fund's yield by one minus your combined Federal and state tax rates, expressed in decimals.
Some national and single-state muni funds own "private purpose" paper, issued by some municipalities to finance nonessential projects like student loans. Interest on private purpose paper is free from Federal income taxes but subject to the alternative minimum tax.
To compensate for the tax liability, private purpose paper normally pays slightly more than regular issues. People who do not expect to owe the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., can increase their yields by owning shares in funds that own more A.M.T. paper. Fund companies can provide this information.
While most people view muni funds as solid investments, they carry a serious risk. In general, bond fund prices fall when interest rates rise; the longer the term of the bond, the farther prices fall when rates rise. Most muni funds carry maturities of more than 20 years.
While the top-performing muni funds over time are those with longer maturities, the interim interest-rate risk may be too much for conservative investors. By shortening maturities, investors reduce risk. If interest rates rise 1 percent, an intermediate- term fund's share price should drop only 3 percent, compared with 7 percent for share prices of longer-term funds, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds.
Of course what is gained in safety is lost in yield. The 59 muni funds sporting short to intermediate maturities yield about three-quarters of a percentage point less than their longer cousins.
Because of differences in the quality and maturity of bonds held by the funds, yields vary. So it pays to shop around. The average 12-month yield of the long-term New York funds tracked by Morningstar was 5.49 percent in June. But Putnam New York Tax-Exempt Opportunities yields 6.48 percent, while the laggard, the Warburg Pincus New York Municipal Bond Fund yields only 4.45 percent. The long-term California funds yielded an average of 5.53 percent, but Prudential California Municipal Income A yields 6.51 percent and Muir California Tax-Free Bond Fund yields 4.02 percent.
Because of the general erosion in some states' economies, investors in New York and Massachusetts in particular, should keep no more than 40 or 50 percent of their total tax-free portfolio in state bonds, said James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter published in New York. Even in better-managed states, he advised tying up no more than 75 percent of tax-free assets in-state.
One way to minimize risk is to buy funds that invest in insured bonds or regular munis that the fund insures itself. The 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply System was a harsh reminder that munis are not risk-free. Yet experts say that defaults on individual issues should not pose a problem for investors in funds, because they have diversified portfolios.
The price for the added security is negligible because the insurance premium is small. As a group, regular munis returned 10.1 percent for the year ended in June, compared with 10.3 percent for the 76 insured muni funds.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 16, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Tables in the "Your Money" pages on Saturday about the performance of mutual funds misstated the returns for two funds because of calculation errors by Morningstar Inc., which supplied the data. The Scudder California Tax-Free Fund had a return of 3.6 percent in the second quarter and 13.9 percent for the 12 months ended June 30. Its average annual return was 10.8 percent over the last five years. The Scudder New York Tax-Free Fund had a second-quarter return of 3.8 percent and a 12-month return of 13.4 percent. Its five-year average return was 10.5 percent. As a result, neither fund should have appeared on the list of poorest-performing municipal bond funds.

THE MYTH OF FREE TRADE
A Plan for America's Economic Revival.
By Ravi Batra.
274 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $23. 
 WHEN a prophecy fails, propose a little something to make it come true. That seems to have been the spirit animating Ravi Batra as he cranked out his latest wacky wake-up call to America, "The Myth of Free Trade."
Mr. Batra's most recent books -- "The Great Depression of 1990" and its sequel, "Surviving the Great Depression of 1990" -- made him one of the best-selling economists of all time. But, as everyone now knows, the "worst economic crisis in history" never happened. So now the Southern Methodist University professor turned prophet has decided that the United States is well on the way to becoming the basket case of the Western world. The villain this time isn't "the unprecedented concentration of wealth," his bugbear in "The Great Depression of 1990," but the nation's foolish fling with free trade.
His nutty solution: to stop Americans from importing so many Armanis and Toyotas, and American companies from sending their products abroad, erect a 19th-century-style tariff wall around the United States by, among other things, raising existing import levies fivefold.
Hmmm, haven't we tried that before? The Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 sparked a trade war that helped turn a spreading financial crisis into a full-blown world depression. Instead of merely beggaring our neighbors, which we certainly succeeded in doing, we ended up suffering horribly as well, and there's no reason to think Smoot-Hawley II wouldn't have a similar effect.
Indeed, Mr. Batra himself was saying so a mere book or so ago. "The world is much more interdependent today than in the past," he wrote in "The Great Depression of 1990," "hence, protectionist pressures should be resisted at all costs. If not, the worldwide depression will be much deeper than otherwise." But then, as the professor puts it in "The Myth of Free Trade," "Old ideas become obsolete, creating the need for new thought."
It's not just the notion that the United States should replace the former Soviet Union as the world's biggest autarky that's loony. It's the whole book.
Take the claim that 80 percent of Americans have seen living standards plunge since 1973. It's absurd in light of the fact that consumer spending is half again as high today as in the early 1970's. Besides, though the growth of productivity and living standards slowed in the United States in the 1970's and 1980's, it slowed even more sharply in Europe and Japan.
Or take the assertion that 1973 was a watershed year, in which the United States plunged down the slippery slope of free trade. Lots of things, many unpleasant, like the quadrupling of oil prices, happened in 1973. Just about the only thing that did not happen was a shift in American trade policy. The Nixon Administration did not suddenly sweep away tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers.
True, Americans are importing and exporting more now than they were then, but that trend -- properly measured, as Mr. Batra does not measure it -- got under way around 1960, long before his magical year of 1973, and is anyway the product of millions of private decisions, not Government trade policy.
You'll start to feel positively disoriented by the time you get to Mr. Batra's novel take on our nation's economic history. America's rise to the world's pre-eminent economic power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in his view, owes almost nothing to technology, enlightened commercial policy, immigration or natural resources, but everything to protectionism. If that were true, deadbeat nations like Argentina and Burma, with their long histories of high trade barriers, not industrial powerhouses like Korea and Germany, would have much to celebrate.
The author, whose real talent lies not in analyzing the American economy but in tapping into Americans' angst about their economic well-being, says he has no choice but to unburden himself in print: "It is a tremendous burden and responsibility to have information and foresight that you know could shape the destiny of nations. How can you then remain silent?"
Too bad he and the folks at Scribners couldn't figure out a way.

HEADLINE: The Spectacular Boom In Andrea Electronics

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris; Floyd Norris is a financial columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The economist John Maynard Keynes once wrote that the stock market is like a 1930's newspaper contest, in which readers were asked to select the 6 prettiest women from pictures of 100 candidates. The winning entry was the one that most closely matched the overall "favorites."
To win, Keynes noted, you didn't choose the women you deemed the best-looking, or even those you thought the public believed to be the prettiest. Instead, he said, you chose the women the public thought the public believed to be the prettiest. 
 It was that way with stocks, Keynes went on. The winning investor chooses stocks the public is likely to conclude will go up because other investors will buy them. Such stocks may or may not offer real value. What they must have is that appealing something.
Andrea Electronics Corporation has that something: a device to filter out street noise from pay-telephone calls.
On the face of it, a noise-reduction device doesn't sound like much. And Andrea is unfamiliar to most telephone companies. Until this year, it was one of the sleepier defense contractors, a company that hadn't made much of an impact even though it had been around for nearly 60 years. But there are about two million pay telephones in the United States alone, and phone companies are working to get computers to identify voices -- which means extraneous noise needs to be blocked out. Buyers of Andrea stock are therefore betting that phone companies will be showering purchase orders on this tiny, family-controlled New York company based in Long Island City, Queens -- that Andrea will be another example of a new technology's propelling a small company to superstardom.
So hot has Andrea stock become in recent months that an investment of about $700 last November was worth more than $25,000 in June. For the time being, wildly hopeful investors are in control, reinforcing the Keynesian principle that investors can rush into a stock for no better reason than believing other investors will follow. Andrea's rise also illustrates the gravity-defying way in which a stock can become a big winner long before the underlying business succeeds. And it shows how public investors can be left without an easy way to establish the value of a company's stock, despite rules requiring disclosure of material facts to shareholders.
FEW COMPANIES HAVE SEEN A STOCK RUN LIKE ANDREA'S. Last November, with the stock trading at about $7 a share -- or a bit less than in 1960 -- Andrea announced it had demonstrated a device at a convention of pay-telephone operators that could suppress street noise in pay telephones, making it easier for people calling from busy intersections to be heard. The company said it hoped to make sales to "several major telecommunications companies," but didn't name any.
When a company is small, with few outstanding shares, a little buying will push the stock price up, and that movement can attract other investors. Late last year, although Andrea was unknown to all but a select few, any investor looking for unusual activity in a stock could, by tapping into a computer, see the relatively busy trading in Andrea and call up the company's press release announcing the demonstration of the noise-suppression device.
Some of the curious bought the stock, and within a couple of weeks it was trading at $36 a share. Far more amazing was the volume. With only 508,000 shares outstanding, more than half controlled by the Andrea family, the American Stock Exchange reported a volume of 333,000 shares on Nov. 20. The shares available for public trading were being (Continued on page 51)
exchanged at a feverish rate, one that Jules L. Winters, the chief operating officer of the Amex, calls unprecedented. (In 1991, total Andrea volume for the entire year was less than one million shares.)
Things calmed down for a while, but the activity intensified this spring in anticipation of Andrea's annual meeting on May 20, when the company was to show off the device: a computer chip to be inserted in each pay telephone. On the eve of the meeting the shares soared to $93, prompting the Amex to step in and change the rules. No longer could anyone buy the shares on margin -- that is, on borrowed money.
Such a move, which is seldom made, is designed to curb speculation and warn investors of dangerously inflated prices. In Andrea's case, the move brought the stock to the attention of even more investors. The price did slide for a few days, but after dipping to $59 it began another surge. On May 27, the company split the shares five-for-one, which in normal times would cause the price of a single share to decline to one-fifth of its former level. But these are not normal times, and Andrea stock has continued to soar. By early June, the post-split shares were trading at $53 each -- the equivalent of $265 for each old share.
WHY THE FRENZY? Part of the answer lies in the Wall Street dream of finding another Haloid. In the late 1950's, that tiny company had a then questionable technology to photocopy documents. Haloid became Xerox, and early investors in the company realized phenomenal profits. Since then, more money has probably been lost looking for other Haloids than was made on the original one, but hope springs eternal, as any gambler knows.
Andrea's technology cannot be said to be a sure thing; it has yet to announce its first sale to a telephone company. Bellcore, the research arm of the regional Bell companies, has looked at the product, but won't say what it has found, and calls to several Bell companies have shown scant interest in Andrea's device. GTE Corporation, the largest non-Bell operator of pay telephones, says it has not heard from Andrea and is happy with other available products.
Many investors, however, seem to have paid little attention to any of this. To buy the stock at the high prices it has commanded and expect to make money in the long term, one would have to assume a succession of very successful products. Some in the industry, however, say Andrea's system is not compatible with most pay phones. They also say there are other ways to solve the problem of extraneous noise.
"They have some advanced circuitry that reduces the noise level," says David M. Lubensky, a scientist with the Advanced Speech Systems Group of Nynex, the parent company of New York Telephone. "It's a solution. I don't think it is the only solution. There are others that are just as satisfactory."
Noise suppression is highly important, Lubensky says. Phone companies are working on computer technology not only to identify voices but also to recognize whether the speaker is using English or Japanese or any of the dozens of other spoken languages. Much of the work is being done on ways to suppress extraneous noise at the central office rather than at every telephone.
Although phones are designed so that users don't notice it, someone speaking on the phone hears his own voice through the earpiece as well as the voice of the person at the other end of the line. Extraneous noise, like a passing fire engine, is heard both through the ear away from the phone and through the ear pressed to the receiver. At GTE, Terry Fisher, who is a manager of pay-phone operations, says his company has installed some pay telephones with volume controls, enabling a caller to turn up the volume. These pay phones also have circuitry to suppress some extraneous noise, whether from nearby conversations or from passing traffic.
The GTE phones use equipment made by Communications Development Services Corporation, a privately held company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Weaver Jordan, the company's president, says he talked to Andrea about its technology but concluded its product might be too expensive and could require not only new pay telephones but even redesigned telephone booths. He says Andrea has had problems fitting all the needed circuitry into a pay-telephone box without getting interference from equipment used for tasks like confirming that the caller has deposited coins.
And what do Andrea officials have to say about such criticism? Nothing. Ever since the stock began to soar, they have declined to talk to reporters. Winters, the Amex official, praises the company for not issuing press releases to promote the stock. But the company's lack of public communications has not made it any easier for investors to evaluate a fair price for the stock.
SO FAR, THERE HAVE BEEN NO reports of heavy selling by the company's officials, usually a signal to (Continued on page 56)
observant investors that jumping ship is probably in order. (Federal rules allow disclosures of trading by corporate officials to be delayed for as many as 40 days, but because penalties for late filing are so mild many executives flout those rules.) If the people at Andrea have reservations about the company's future, there are no signs.
Unlike many companies that become overnight stock sensations, Andrea has been around for a while. It began as Andrea Radio in 1934, became a public company in 1960 and has always been controlled by the Andrea family. Frank A. D. Andrea Jr., now 66, is the chairman. He took over the company from his father in 1965, and kept control until last year, when he surrendered the operational responsibility to his sons -- John, 35, and Douglas, 30 -- who are now co-presidents. At the end of 1992, the company had 75 employees, including an engineering staff of 8.
For years, Andrea went mostly nowhere, and the end of the cold war made its future bleaker by depressing military demand for communications apparatus. It stopped earning money in 1989 and stopped paying dividends to shareholders in 1990. In 1991, it lost $490,000 on sales of $2.4 million. Outsiders saw no reason to expect a turnaround. Not that there were many outsiders paying attention.
Nonetheless, a harbinger appeared in the 1991 annual report. In it, Frank Andrea wrote that "new product development is the foundation for future solid growth" and that the company had hired engineers -- experts in "digital signal processing" -- whom he hoped to use to develop new products.
The noise-suppression device is the first such product.
Company officials showed how much potential they saw in that technology. Andrea had gone for many years without issuing stock options to its executives. But on Dec. 31, 1991, its board approved a plan to issue them for up to 200,000 shares, almost 40 percent of the shares outstanding. If the new technology worked, or if Wall Street concluded it did, the holders of those options would reap huge profits. Of course, if the technology failed, they would not have invested a cent.
Andrea has so far reported issuing options for 184,000 shares, or, after the five-for-one split, 920,000 shares. The largest holder is Frank Andrea, the chairman, who has the right to buy 250,000 shares of post-split stock for $313,700. In early June, the market value of those shares was $13.4 million.
Issuing so many options usually dilutes the stake of public shareholders, who controlled 48 percent of the company before the options program began, with the Andrea family controlling the rest. If all the options are exercised, as they will be if the stock price does not collapse, the family and the executives who received the options will have a 65 percent stake in the company, while the public stake will be down to 35 percent.
THE LEAPS AND bounds in the value of Andrea stock have cost some speculators -- the "shorts" -- big money. In fact, "shorts" probably helped push up the stock price.
The legal way to gamble on the probability that a stock price will fall is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and then sell them -- a short sale. Say Stock X is worth $10 today and you believe the price will drop. You borrow 100 shares from a brokerage house and sell them at $10 per share. The brokerage house puts $1,000 into your account, a sum you may not be able to touch until you've made good on your loan. Say the value of Stock X then drops to $5. You buy 100 shares to return to the brokerage house. Your profit: $500 less commissions.
But if the reverse happens, you lose your bet. To make good on shares you've borrowed and to cut your losses, you buy shares before the price goes any higher. Such purchases may drive the price even higher.
In early May, about 10 percent of the publicly held shares of Andrea had been sold short. That was an unusually large proportion, but it was twice as high in early June, just as the price soared. Some speculators leaped in to buy, hoping the short sellers would be forced to pay even higher prices.
Some traders believe there has also been "naked" shorting, or selling a stock without borrowing it, usually because there are no shares available to borrow. Naked shorting is illegal (brokers can do it only under some circumstances), but it is a way for a trader who thinks a stock is flagrantly overvalued to bet the price will fall.
A naked short cannot deliver the stock when the trade is supposed to be settled, usually a week after it is made. If the price has fallen in the meantime, then all is well, and he can quickly buy the stock for a profit. But if the price has soared, the naked short can lose a lot of money very quickly.
Andrea's rapid rise has also prompted talk of "corners," whereby a group of investors buys the available shares. If the stock price soars, the unfortunates who shorted the shares are at the mercy of those who've cornered the stock. When a corner is in place, the price of a stock can rise rapidly and beyond all reason.
Corners are illegal, and in the Andrea case, no evidence has yet been made public that a corner was or is under way. Winters, the Amex official, says the exchange has monitored the trading in Andrea and does not find the buying concentrated among customers of one company or even a small group of companies, as would be expected in a corner. (The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has looked into the Andrea trading, will not say what it has found.)
ANDREA'S SHARE PRICE has not shot straight up. Even on its best days there have been the wild swings that characterize an inefficient market populated by traders with little idea of the stock's real value. Probably the wildest day was Monday, June 7. The previous Friday, an Andrea official, in a rare public comment, had told the Bloomberg Business News service the company was "right on track" to introduce the product before the end of the third quarter. He noted that there are two million pay phones in the United States and another three million outside the country.
That helped push up the stock, and the American Stock Exchange halted trading before the close Friday, citing an imbalance of buy orders. The last trade of the day was at $37.50 per share. On Monday, there was no trading for the first two hours as an Amex specialist -- the broker responsible for maintaining an orderly market -- tried to match orders. Specialists are expected to do limited trading from their own holdings in stocks to balance the inflow of public buy and sell orders. Finally, the stock opened at $51. Within minutes, it fell to $38.50, then bounced back to $50, only to slump and rebound again. It closed the day at $53.75, having more than doubled in just two days. The vast majority of the trades were of a few hundred shares at most, the hallmark of individual investors. Institutions -- pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds -- have largely stayed clear.
"The activity was extremely orderly," says Winters. By that he means the price did not move by more than a dollar on any one trade, and usually by much smaller amounts. He praises the specialist for doing a good job of maintaining an orderly market.
The total volume of June 4 and June 7 was 1.4 million shares. The number of post-split shares not owned by the Andrea family was 1.2 million. At the $53.75 price reached on June 7, the company's market value was $186 million, counting the shares available to be issued for the management options. From the perspective of last year's balance sheet -- a loss of $691,000 on sales of $3.4 million -- such a valuation is absurd. But if you assume that the device is installed in every one of the two million pay phones and that better devices will follow, then perhaps you could come up with estimates that begin to make the stock price seem reasonable.
Keynes knew it can be more important to figure out what will entrance the public than to ascertain real long-term value. But even he might have been astounded by the fevered clamoring for Andrea stock, whose valuation is based on little more than expectations of success for a product that has yet to find a single buyer.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Labeling Prime-Time Violence Is Still a Band-Aid Solution

BYLINE: BY JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
V is for victory? Some members of Congress would also like V to stand for violence, and to serve as the warning signal the broadcast networks have promised to alert parents to especially bloody prime-time programs starting this fall. Catch No. 1: The networks themselves would judge violence levels. Catch No. 2: They will also devise the warning. The current nebuluous contender, to be broadcast just before a show, is: "Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised." So, in the latest posturings between Government regulators and the networks, V is still very much for victory as far as the television industry is concerned.
This small concession to Congress has demolished for now the prospect -- never very likely in any case -- of stringent Federal sanctions, among them an imposed ratings system and the installation of a computer chip in every television set that would allow viewers to block out programs electronically coded for violence. 
 More telling, Congress's powder-puff debate on violence was carefully limited to the networks and prime time, even as independent stations and cable have become major stops on today's television highway. Violence in prime-time network entertainment is relatively contained, compared with the widespread mayhem, explicit or implied, in local newscasts, syndicated talk shows, music videos or, perhaps most significant, sports events. The television violence problem is far more enormous and complicated than either the industry or politicians have been admitting. Little wonder that Washington hears a growing public outrage rumbling across the land.
Violence has long permeated this nation's history, from the ethnic cleansing of American Indians to the shoot-'em-up lore of the Wild West. Homicide statistics are an embarrassment when compared with those of most other "civilized" countries. Serial killers, drive-by shootings, schools caught in the crossfire of drug wars -- the dreadfully familiar litany is numbing.
The latest trend: A study on violence among young Americans finds that disturbing behavior once detected in adolescence is now emerging in early childhood. Just ask these children what television and movies they've been watching, and how frequently. A friend who teaches third grade in East Harlem recalls that when he asked his students this year what they wanted to be when they grew up, all the boys opted for being football players. Why? Money, fame and the open-ended license to knock people down. Sports are associated exclusively with winning and violence.
All the blame cannot be heaped on television. But, as innumerable studies have been indicating for at least four decades, the medium plays a major role in the problem. Among the many people supporting that view is John P. Murray, head of Kansas State University's department of human development and family studies.
In a recent debate, Professor Murray cited a 1992 study of one day's programming, from 6 A.M. to midnight, on Washington's broadcasting and cable channels. About 1,800 violent scenes, many of murder and assault, were stuffed into a mere 18 hours. Further, he noted, surveys have shown that the principal aggressors on prime time and Saturday-morning cartoons "tend to be white males, while their chief victims tend to be female, nonwhite, foreign-born or elderly." He added: "This is more than a message about violence. It's about power -- the power of life and death -- and about who matters and who doesn't in our culture."
It can be argued that the very existence of television has done considerable violence to what we were as a society and individuals. Thoughtfulness has been increasingly sacrificed on the altar of the short attention span. Image has become almighty. Now, critics of the medium charge, it's not so much a matter of what people believe or how they act; it's how they look.
Yes, but what then? Television is hardly going to disappear. It is the future, and together with the computer it will be the heart of the entertainment and data superhighways. Whatever its weaknesses and dangers, furthermore, television has been a remarkably superb provider of great comedy, powerful drama, memorable sports spectacles and historic news events transmitted as they happened.
The escalating uproar over violence content inevitably raises sensitive issues of control and censorship. The point, at least for the moment, is that these issues be faced honestly. A classic instance of doublespeak: When a new law to regulate and elevate children's broadcasting was finally passed in 1990, some stations simply defined their customary cartoons -- "The Jetsons" and "G. I. Joe" among them -- as educational.
In fact, prime-time violence on the networks nowadays is largely confined to some of the made-for-television movies that are based on fact. In May, did the nation really need ABC's "Murder in the Heartland," a four-hour re-creation of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate's killing spree 35 years ago?
Angry attention from conservative watchdog groups, traditionally focused on sex far more than violence, is currently aimed in the direction of the new Steven Bochco series, "N.Y.P.D. Blue," coming this fall on ABC. While Mr. Bochco does, as they say, push the envelope, his track record, including "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law," is outstanding. Room must be made for this caliber of talent, even if only after 10 P.M.
When it comes to the rest of the television schedule, issues can become explosive, especially regarding children. Why should the commercial networks stand on the embattled front lines when pay-cable channels can show all the Terminators and Lethal Weapons they want, uncut? (Violence in Hollywood films, by the way, can make television shows look like sylvan glades.)
Children, naturally, are more likely to watch television during the day. Census Bureau numbers indicate that almost one-quarter of the children born in the 1980's and 90's are living with a single parent. These and many others are "latchkey children," left on their own after school as parents juggle jobs. Readily at hand are discussions of everything from sexual abuses to Satanic cults on the Oprah-Donahue-Geraldo circuits, and local early-evening news reports partial to grisly footage.
Then there are sportscasts, thought by many to reflect the true soul of the nation. And, indeed, once there was something called sportsmanship, having to do not with winning but the way one played the game. Today, even as more athletes command salaries that are little short of obscene, grabbing attention is the name of the game and violence is a handy weapon. That's true not just in football or hockey. Tantrums and foul language have become part of the once-tranquil tennis scene. The spectacle of a Michael Jordan slugging players on a basketball court, for example, probably sends a more immediate and damaging message to the youth of this country than all the violence on network entertainment programs.
Few, even among the most vociferous critics, would rush into controls that might hobble the industry economically or reduce the bulk of television programming to pablum. Yet the industry too often seems ready to stonewall any proposals for change, no matter how modest. Commenting on the proposed computer chip that would let viewers block out all programming that carried an electronic V label, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, argued before the House Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications: "We are opposed to a chip, which, with one push of a single button, blots out an entire program day or week. That is not making individual judgmental decisions. It amounts to indictment without appraisal, and is not an exercise of parental judgment."
It isn't? As interactive television blossoms in the immediate future, the idea that parents should have as much right as the industry over the flow of programming through their sets seem eminently reasonable. The street now runs two ways.
There are, be assured, thoughtful people in the industry concerned with television's problems. In the current issue of Mother Jones magazine, Michael Krasny, host of a talk show on KQED, a public radio station in San Francisco, interviews Joshua Brand, who with his partner, John Falsey, has created some of the medium's most distinguished series, including "Northern Exposure" and "I'll Fly Away." While he recognizes that pandering to audiences can "pollute the emotional and spiritual environment," Mr. Brand nonetheless warns: "Regulations are dangerous, particularly when dealing with the free expression of ideas. I do believe that some of those ideas are like pollutants, but there isn't one thing you can do. A panacea doesn't exist."
But perhaps solutions do. Let's get on with the search. Time is really of the essence.

Be Smart as a Lemming, Orchestras Are Told

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
What is wrong with American orchestras? Last year, at the annual meeting of the American Symphony Orchestra League, a report on orchestral finances warned of coming disasters: bankrupt organizations, crippling union and scheduling commitments, dwindling audiences. At its meeting last month, the league unveiled another report, "Americanizing the American Orchestra," summarizing the findings of a national task force of 156 musicians, critics and managers.
The report's title reveals its premise: The American orchestra is too European. By extension, it is elitist and irrelevant to its surrounding community. In fact, the orchestra has resisted sharing the "secrets and norms of participation," creating the image of an "exclusive, arrogant, possibly racist institution." 
 The prescription is blunt: "American orchestras should reflect more closely the cultural mix, needs and interests of their communities." This means creating affirmative action programs in hiring and programming and performing more pop, jazz and crossover music. Orchestras should overhaul themselves, from the repertory to the board room, to become more "representative" of their communities. They should alter "attitudes, thinking and behaviors" that have impeded inclusiveness, and hire consultants to begin "diversity sensitivity training." These actions will help guarantee the orchestra's future as a "vital American institution."
The analysis is not novel; it has been percolating in the music world for some time, adapted from more general political arguments. But -- to be as blunt as the report -- it is thoroughly wrongheaded, an abdication of the tradition orchestras represent and a refusal to accept the responsibilities of artistic leadership. Some music professionals, reluctant to oppose the powerful league openly, have correctly argued that the recommendations will themselves insure the irrelevance of the American orchestra.
The report's distortions begin with its premise. American orchestras are already quite American. Their management styles and structures, involving the use of volunteers and boards and fund-raising, differ radically from those of most European orchestras, which are connected directly to municipalities. The unionization of musicians began here and has greatly affected the internal culture of orchestras.
And while much of the repertory is European in origin, the absence of American composers is not a result of specific neglect but a sign of a more general problem: a split between much of the art music of this century and contemporary audiences. Programming the symphonies of Howard Hanson or William Schuman will not substantially change the relationship of American orchestras to the American public; the report can barely pretend it will.
Instead, the report is preoccupied with supposed injustice. The league claims that orchestra members are limited to those whose "family and community circumstances" can "accommodate the costs of instruments and lessons." But the orchestra has traditionally had roots in the middle and lower-middle classes. Generations of impoverished players have joined professional orchestras, having studied at community schools or settlement houses. Orchestras have been filled not by elites but by immigrants bringing the performance styles of their native countries -- Germans, Russians, French, Italians and now Japanese and Koreans.
One need only consider the relatively homogeneous composition of many European orchestras to see how diverse the American orchestra already is. The report notes that just 7 percent of American orchestra members are black, Asian American, American Indian or Hispanic. (The league regularly publishes lists of professional orchestra musicians from each category.) Yet within a single generation, many American orchestras have become integrated sexually. And there need be little worry about Asian Americans; the future of the American orchestra is visible at the Juilliard School, where 30 percent of all music students are of Asian descent.
The report's obsession with diversity is actually simpler: a concern with the relative scarcity of black and Hispanic players and audience members. This concern is so overwhelming that the very future of the orchestra is made to hinge on it. But the reasons are not clear. Thanks to blind auditions, discrimination in player hiring is no longer significant. The best explanation for the current situation is that different cultural groups tend to have different cultural interests.
The league acknowledges as much, then asks that orchestras radically alter themselves to respond to these different interests. As urban demographics change, it warns, orchestras risk "becoming increasingly isolated from the social, political and economic realities of American society." The fear is that with the failure of public education and the lack of interest from new ethnic majorities, orchestras will be orphaned.
That may be, though the league barely acknowledges that the real reason to call for full participation of black and Hispanic Americans is that an important part of society is missing something valuable: an acquaintance with one of the more transcendent human accomplishments.
The only long-term solution to this deprivation is strong and disciplined arts education. It would touch on the styles of many cultures and demonstrate why the orchestral tradition and its achievements should be part of every American's heritage. The report stresses the need for education, then undercuts its own supposed idealism, noting that a "key point" of arts education is the fulfillment of diversity goals. Education is the means to a political end.
Indeed, the music itself is treated as a means. The orchestra is asked to become a "provider of music to the total community." What total community? Should the orchestra perform Jamaican folk music or present throat singers from Tuva? Other organizations can better assume such roles. The orchestra has a more specific mandate: to present a remarkable body of work that evolved over three centuries in more than a dozen countries.
Even when the report focuses on that tradition, problems arise. It suggests that music by black Americans be part of the repertory, and surely, it would be refreshing to hear different works, whether justly or unjustly neglected. But such programming will not solve the orchestra's ills; the Detroit Symphony's annual celebration of black composers has not had a major impact on attendance. The results are likely to resemble those of pops concerts, which were once seen as entryways to the standard season; in fact, there is no crossover.
Boards, it is said, must change, too. Members with different cultural orientations are encouraged not to "assimilate" to the organization; so presumably, cultural and ethnic struggles will enter the board rooms. For while the report genuflects to the idea that music can transcend ethnic background, it asserts that ethnicity and race are basic in wooing audiences and programming concerts.
Rather than insist that the orchestra retain artistic autonomy and make some judgment about what is good rather than what is demanded, the league urges complete submission to political authorities. It calls for "agreed upon methods of evaluating progress toward the cultural diversity goal." It asks that orchestras create diversity measurements to provide evidence "to political leaders, community members and funding sources of the orchestra's commitment to diversity." Those financing sources -- including influential foundations, some of which supported this report -- are urged to make "more general grants contingent on the inclusion of certain kinds of repertoire."
This is not artistic leadership; the league is actually threatening its constituents: We know what is best for orchestras, and if you orchestras don't listen, our views will be imposed; your financing depends on your compliance.
For all the report's obeisances, this policy shows little allegiance to music or to the orchestra and almost total allegiance to commercial success and financial security. Cynically led by its managerial class, the orchestra is explicitly urged to lean toward pop and make courting audiences its primary activity. The only people being asked to "assimilate" culturally are those who uphold the importance of the orchestral tradition.
In addition, concerts are to be "dumbed down," to use the vernacular; the report suggests that performances be accompanied by choreographed images on video screens, that halls be "dressed" by visual designers and that applause between movements be encouraged. Orchestras will be run by political whims and populist tastes -- a typically American approach to the arts -- and become nondescript community music organizations.
Orchestras have grievous problems involving repertory, audience and mission. Buried in this report are good ideas about education and the need to involve various communities in the life of an orchestra. But this panicked attempt to Americanize the American orchestra is so fearful of the elite demands of art that it is content with a musical culture determined by demography. In bringing the racial politics of the streets into the concert halls, it may very well Americanize the orchestra into extinction.
This report is a disgrace.

Miami Virtue: Arquitectonica's Low-Rent Housing

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Bernardo fort-Brescia tried to steer me away from Edison Terrace, a new apartment complex in Liberty City designed by his firm, Arquitectonica. He would be out of town that weekend, and hadn't I heard about the German woman? Pulled from her car and run over by thugs?
Yet the danger of visiting Edison Terrace added to the building's allure. Isn't Miami supposed to be the dark metropolis of sin and insurrection, the city where death lurks behind pastel facades? And isn't Arquitectonica the firm that helped to give the once dowdy city a racy new image? Alas, these thrilling stereotypes have had their day. Miami never had a monopoly on urban violence, and it has been five years since the last episode of "Miami Vice," the series that brought Arquitectonica instant notoriety with those glamorous shots of the Atlantis condominium complex and its fabulous "sky patio." Fringed with palms, bubbling with Jacuzzi effervescence, the patio became an architectural logo for a city basking in a lurid aura of opulent dissolution. 
 Edison Terrace is Miami Virtue. A low-income housing project, the first of two low-rental apartment buildings that Arquitectonica has designed for Liberty City, the building gives this poor, predominantly black community the kind of visual lift that these architects brought to the rich side of town with their residential high rises on Brickell Avenue. Architecture is sometimes described as frozen music. Arquitectonica makes something closer to frozen margarita: a tangy architectural cocktail with the power to inspire deliriously upbeat thoughts about the world. Architecture with a splash of tonic. Even the firm's name sounds like something you'd serve with a wedge of lime.
Not everyone is intoxicated by Arquitectonica's blend of tropical fizz. Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, fellow Floridian architects best known for the "neo-traditional" resort town of Seaside, have accused Arquitectonica of creating buildings that look good from moving cars. I can't dispute the accusation, at least in regard to Edison Terrace, since the young architect from Mr. Fort-Brescia's office who escorted me to the building was reluctant to let me out of his Rabbit convertible. We cruised around the building, but I saw its interior (two- and three-bedroom apartments, each with private balcony) only in floor plans. I guess you could call this a case of drive-by criticism.
Still, if you are located less than a block from I-95, it's not a vice to look great from a passing car. Though Edison Terrace is only six stories tall, its brightly painted stucco facade pops out like a billboard: If you lived here, you'd not only be home by now, you'd be smart. Simple shapes and clearly defined proportions make up the building's rhythmic, graphic effects. The facade, crisply punctured with square windows, is broken into three segments that are hinged at the edges by tiers of balconies. Stained a throbbing red, the balconies project slightly forward in shallow horizontal chevrons. Slim bays, painted a neutral green, anchor the block at both ends; they tie the building to the landscaped parking areas around it and set off its bright colors. An adjacent recreation building, also of green stucco, sports a snappy blue canopy supported by slim red columns.
Though slightly overscaled for this neighborhood of one- and two-story buildings, Edison Terrace is not an imposing tower disconnected from its surroundings. In fact, its height creates a welcome visual connection between the lower buildings of Liberty City and the highway overpass that runs through it and the neighboring Overtown, a name that suggests only too vividly a place reduced to a passing blur. Now the eyes will want to linger in this landscape, even if fear freezes an outsider's foot to the gas pedal.
Edison Terrace, whose project architect is Daniel Sabowsky, is not public housing but a private development, created under the enlightened auspices of the Tacolcy Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit, community-based organization. Financing from several public agencies, notably the Dade County Special Housing Program, has made it possible to keep rents about 25 percent below market rates. It's the 60 low-rent apartments, not the bright package Arquitectonica has wrapped them in, that makes Edison Terrace a community asset. Design is no substitute for public housing policies.
But Arquitectonica's formal vocabulary is well suited to the social dimension of this project. Its forms pulse with the energy that can result from the clash of cultures. The firm's work, like its name, asserts a Latin heritage. The rhythmic, angled geometry of its buildings, the bold, primary colors that excite abstract forms into sensual images, draw on the strain of European modernism that took root in Central and South America in the 1930's.
Some orthodox modernists looked askance at this exotic variation of the Bauhaus's hard, Germanic truth. Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian, believed that Le Corbusier had been infected by fantastic irrationalism on his 1936 visit to Brazil. Today, it's the element of fantasy that makes Latin modernism so invigorating. It shows how an internationalist ethos can be translated into a vibrant regional identity.
Arquitectonica has woven into these historical strands a thread that is even more international than the International Style: the athletic, casual style of contemporary popular culture. Mr. Fort-Brescia and his partner, Laurinda Spear, were the first architects of the baby-boom generation to put up large-scale buildings. They took pop style for granted as the classical order of the 20th-century city. Going beyond the conventionally bleak ideal of "worker's housing" promoted by the modern movement, Arquitectonica dipped into the image pool of the Coca-Cola red ribbon and Levi 501's, white sports cars and the city's nighttime visual jazz. It's as democratic a style as anyone has yet imagined, and it is exhilarating precisely because it demonstrates that American style is not meant to be an elite proposition. Mass is not without class.
Arquitectonica's work is uneven; it doesn't always hit the note of popular sophistication. But at Edison Terrace the architects are working in the form that made their Brickell Avenue buildings such bracing additions to the skyline. The project does not just bring a bit of Brickell Avenue to Liberty City. Rather, it shows that an architectural language can speak across social distances. Different economic circumstances need not wrench people into totally different cities. The eye can be quicker than a highway at connecting points in urban space.

HEADLINE: DATE RAPE'S OTHER VICTIM

 BODY:
Rape-crisis centers serve women from an enormous diversity of economic, educational and cultural backgrounds. For many women, the "rape crisis" that Roiphe so glibly dismisses can mean a chain of events leading to the loss of a job or a home. Rape-crisis centers can provide medical treatment, legal aid, housing referrals and psychological assessment.
Many of the services originated by college women now help large numbers of nonstudents. Because the news media pay so little attention to the needs of low-income women, campus activism is often the best hope for generating public awareness of rape and other violence. 
 Budget cuts have targeted every publicly funded rape-crisis center in San Francisco. Roiphe's "rape hype" is the kind of document that can be used to justify ill-informed political decisions.

HEADLINE: Jostling for Position on the Riverfront

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
MOTORISTS, yes. Bicyclists, too. Strollers, certainly. Sun bathers, ball players, nature lovers. They all stand to gain, officials say, from a rebuilt West Side Highway with a new Hudson River park at its side.
But what about developers? 
 Would the tandem park and roadway projects simply open four to five miles of ramshackle Manhattan waterfront to recreation? Or would they also fuel intense, even disruptive, speculation and development?
Eight years after the death of Westway, plans are progressing on several fronts to rebuild the corridor from Battery Park City to 59th Street; call it the West Side Highway, West Street, 12th Avenue or, as transportation officials do, Route 9A.
As these projects inch forward, the debate also grows over their implications. No matter how much planners insist that riverfront construction will be limited and appropriately scaled, the suspicion persists among community leaders and civic activists that these ample public works are part of a larger development agenda.
Five alternatives for Route 9A have been advanced by the New York State Transportation Department in a draft environmental impact statement. Choices run from leaving the roadway as it is, to enhancing it at a cost of $370 million, to building a $965 million highway with viaducts and depressed bypass lanes. After a round of public hearings last month, the state scheduled another session in September at the request of elected officials.
About a month after that hearing, it is expected that the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, will begin the design and environmental analysis of plans for the area from river to road, including 60 acres of parkland, 330 acres of water, four and a half miles of esplanade and 13 recreational piers.
The conservancy was created last year by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins to build the park and, in the language of their agreement, "identify and facilitate" any "private initiatives in the development sites" chosen by an earlier West Side Waterfront Panel. The largest of these would involve up to 1.775 million square feet of space atop the vast Pier 40 on the West Village waterfront.
Just how much a magnet the West Side waterfront can be -- at least for blue-sky thinking -- was made clear last month when talk turned to building a new Yankee Stadium over the Long Island Rail Road's John D. Caemmerer West Side Yard, which borders 12th Avenue from 30th to 33d Street.
Whether anything comes of the stadium or not, there are other signs of renewal.
A development team called Chelsea Piers Management has completed a draft environmental assessment of its plan to turn Piers 59 through 61, from 17th to 21st Street, into a sports center and film and television studio. Roland W. Betts, a partner in the group, said construction might begin the fall.
Twelve developers have expressed interest in devising new uses for the Passenger Ship Terminal, Piers 88 through 92, from 48th to 52d Street, at the invitation of the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, whose lease on the terminal expires at the end of 1994. Dan Maynard, a spokesman for the authority, emphasized that any plan would have to allow continuing use by cruise ships.
The Port Authority has also applied to the Corps of Engineers for permission to build a new Pier 34, from the foot of Canal Street to the Holland Tunnel ventilation and exit shaft, roughly 900 feet offshore. The pier would be composed of parallel 18-foot decks, one of which would be open to the public.
PIER 62, at 22d Street, will open to the public next Sunday, said Tom Fox, president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy. There will be ball courts and areas for picnicking, roller-skating and performances.
By Thursday, the conservancy expects to have received bids for construction of a 27-foot-wide interim pedestrian and bicycle path along West Street, from Chambers Street to Gansevoort Street. That may open to the public next spring, Mr. Fox said.
Gazing farther into the future, it is conceivable that major development might accompany the new Route 9A and waterfront park.
"The creation of an urban boulevard with landscaping and a bikeway/walkway may improve the overall ambience for development, particularly in locations close to the right-of-way," said the draft environmental impact statement for the Route 9A project.
Taken alone, the report said, "the effects of the highway on development trends, if any, would be imperceptible." But it added that "parkland is a physical and visual amenity that tends to raise property values and widen the market appeal of nearby properties, particularly residential properties."
Indeed, potential financing for the park is tied in part to the expectation that property values and construction will increase in the surrounding area. "Actually, we'll be banking on it," Mr. Fox said.
The West Side Waterfront Panel, predecessor to the conservancy, considered imposing an "impact fee" on new development within 700 or 1,500 feet of the park -- possibly $3 or $5 a square foot. It also considered a zone within 700 or 1,500 feet of the park where a special property tax levy would be assessed, akin to a business improvement district.
A study prepared for the waterfront panel by the planning consultants of Allee King Rosen & Fleming projected some 4.7 million square feet of new development by 1998 along a corridor within 700 feet of the park, from Chambers Street to 59th Street.
Among the projects identified by the consultants is Hudson 42, a plan by Silverstein Properties to build 1,500 housing units on a full city block between 41st and 42d Streets, 11th and 12th Avenues. Silverstein has owned the parcel for nine years, however, and it remains a parking lot. Another becalmed project is Hudson River Center, a hotel with roughly 40 stories and 1,500 rooms on Pier 36, across from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The development team, headed by Julien J. Studley, was designated six years ago.
Hudson 42 and Hudson River Center are among several private undertakings on the shoreline that have stalled or died. Judging from that record, Michael Slattery, senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, does not foresee an imminent building boom on the river's edge.
"WATERFRONT development has not been robust, to say the least," he said. "Either it has been heavily subsidized by the public or it has run into serious problems."
"The historical view here shouldn't be the development activity in the 80's but waterfront activity," he said. "Look at the limited number of projects that have gone forward: Battery Park City was subsidized and had substantial density. South Street Seaport had public investment in amenities. Roosevelt Island was subsidized."
A new waterfront zoning text is only weeks away from adoption by the City Planning Commission. Officials say it would open private parcels to public access, require visual corridors, limit building height, ban the transfer of development rights from underwater property to dry land and restrict the use of piers and platforms.
"The proposed amendment is a significant improvement," said Richard L. Schaffer, chairman of the commission. "But if someone wants no development on the edge of the city whatsover, this will not satisfy them."
While Mr. Slattery believes that the cost of following the new zoning rules would push waterfront development "beyond affordability," others think the government is setting the stage for future construction.
"You don't use an Urban Development Corporation to take over a public waterway unless you're planning development," argued Marcy Benstock, executive director of the New York City Clean Air Campaign.
"When they wanted to build a road, they didn't go to a public authority," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, Democrat of Manhattan. "They went to the state Transportation Department. If they really want to build a park, why don't they go to the people in the state and city Parks Departments?"
IN response, Mr. Fox noted the budgetary perils that faced those agencies. "How easy a lift is it for the city and state park systems to focus on constructing a new park on the West Side?" he asked. He also questioned how effective either department would be in dealing with the welter of public agencies that have waterfront jurisdiction.
"What is needed," Mr. Fox said, "is a centralized agency that represents both the city and state, with a specific mandate to build a park and the ability to bring both the city and state to bear in removing obstacles."
Last Sunday, the Assembly passed a bill sponsored by Mr. Gottfried that would strip power from the Hudson River Park Conservancy to acquire an interest in the right-of-way, spend money on or receive revenues from the property, or enter into contracts. The measure did not advance in the Senate, however, Mr. Gottfried said.
Opponents' suspicions were not allayed by the language in the agreement between Gov. Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins that the Hudson River Park Conservancy's proposals would be "subject to all applicable public review and approval procedures."
" 'Applicable' is a vast loophole," Ms. Benstock said. "Many local laws and public review and approval procedures are not applicable to state-chartered authorities such as the H.R.P.C."
Even sewer, drainage and utility relocation plans for Route 9A come in for wary scrutiny by those who wonder such work would provide infrastructure to serve development on the far side of the road.
"We're not opposed to replacing and bringing up to date the appropriate water and sewer lines," said Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, Democrat of Manhattan. "But we don't want those pipes upgraded to where they could carry a load far in excess of what currently exists. Then it appears that they are in fact using Route 9A as the nose of the camel, if you will."
But Douglas A. Currey, of the Route 9A office, said that "all of the infrastructure work that's costed out and included in the project alternatives is utility work necessitated by the roadway."
Mr. Fox concedes that "there's such a fear of government run amok that an attempt to have it focus on creating public works is treated with great suspicion."
"As we gather momentum," he said, "there will be less and less of that."
Mr. Fox said the detailed design of the park, esplanade and public piers would be undertaken with consultants from the affected community boards. That work will occur simultaneously with the environmental assessment, by Allee King Rosen & Fleming. A broad plan drawn up in 1990 identified three development sites:
* Piers 81 through 84, from 41st to 44th Street, might accommodate commercial structures up to 75 feet high, serving cruises and charter boats, possibly with dining and entertainment. These piers are across the highway from Silverstein's Hudson 42 site.
* The Chelsea Piers might accommodate up to 830,000 square feet of new and rehabilitated space, with 800 housing units and 110,000 square feet of commercial space. For the next 10 years, however, they would be leased to Chelsea Piers Management.
* Pier 40, at the foot of Houston Street, might accommodate up to 1.775 million square feet of new construction, with 1,700 residential units and 240,000 square feet of commercial space. Buildings might be 85 feet high, or about eight stories. The new floor area would be roughly equal to that of the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue.
"Pier" is almost a misnomer for the 14-acre structure, which is almost as wide (755 feet) as it is long (800 feet wide). On its deck sits a three-level structure with space for more than 2,000 cars and a center court that can park more than 100 buses and trucks.
When it opened in 1962, Pier 40 was the largest and most costly single steamship terminal ever built in the port of New York. It was originally leased to the Holland-America Line, for passenger and cargo operations.
Today, it is leased to the Port Authority, which sublets it in turn for parking, warehousing, shipping and storage. In addition, the prison barge Bibby Venture, no longer in use, is moored on its south side.
Community Board 2 in Greenwich Village is opposed to the density and size of development proposed for Pier 40. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan is opposed to residential development.
Other proposals in circulation include moving the wholesale flower market to Pier 40 from the Avenue of the Americas or simply converting the pier into parkland.
In a study of potential displacement pressures in the environmental impact statement for Route 9A, Allee King Rosen & Fleming noted that "the presence of the waterfront park and the removal of a large, visible transportation use on Pier 40 can be expected to strengthen the attractiveness of the westerly portions of the area for new residential development."
Because "redevelopment is most likely to take place on currently industrial or residential sites," the study said, "indirect displacement of residents would not be linked to new construction."
However, the study continued, the park could raise the value of existing housing in the area. Since tenants in unregulated apartments and single-room-occupancy hotels were already being squeezed by market forces, the study said, the "waterfront park has the potential to accelerate these underlying displacement pressures, particularly in locations west of Seventh Avenue."
ELSEWHERE, the waterfront park "would make residential Chelsea a more attractive place to live, would boost residential values and could contribute toward accelerating displacement pressures." The study concluded that the waterfront park would have little or no effect on social and economic conditions south of Chambers Street, around the Convention Center or in Clinton.
Ms. Benstock said the environmental assessment was inadequate. "As long as the U.D.C. intends to take title to the entire river," she said, the Route 9A impact statement "ought to project development and the traffic it would generate far in excess of what they are assuming -- on the scale of the developed sites of Battery Park City."
What the Hudson River Park Conservancy would get, under the 1992 agreement, is "possessory interest" in the property from the roadway to the pierhead line. Mr. Fox said that was not the name as "fee simple" -- that is, direct -- ownership. It might take the form of ownership with a restrictive covenant or scenic easement, he said.
A major hurdle that has yet to be overcome is the fact that the city and state may have to pay back $81 million to the Federal Government that was used to acquire the right-of-way for Westway. A waiver could be granted if local officials convinced the Federal Highway Administration that the new project represented a "transportation enhancement," like a pedestrian and bicycle path or a scenic area. An attempt to obtain a waiver in 1990 failed.
In a response to questions from the conservancy, the highway agency said last month that a park "may be consistent" with the scenic requirement but that "ball fields, marine facilities, or parks with food carts, benches, restrooms are not reuses which would, by themselves, qualify as transportation projects."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Flatiron Building;
Charm and Favorable Rents Nail Publishers Down

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
SO what if those glittery new office buildings have large open floors, and this quirky relic is laid out in triangles? And so what if the new buildings offer advanced electronics, while this one still depends on a hydraulic system to power its 90-year-old elevators?
It is, after all, the Flatiron Building, which has shined since 1902 as a grand architectural beacon at Broadway and 23d Street. One of New York City's earliest examples of a steel-skeleton skyscraper, it has also endured as an eccentric center of commerce far removed from the economic magnets of midtown and Wall Street. 
 Now, in a Manhattan real estate market that has been less than ebullient for at least five years, the Flatiron building is once again demonstrating its allure. Its two largest tenants, St. Martin's Press and Springer-Verlag -- both United States subsidiaries of European publishing companies -- said late last month that they had leased additional space and taken options to make further expansion possible. Eventually the two companies may occupy the entire 21-story building.
"It has character, and we love it," said Roy Gainsburg, the president of St. Martin's Press, which is owned by Macmillan Publishers Ltd. of London. His company first leased a small office in the Flatiron Building in 1969, and has steadily accumulated more space. Under its new lease, it will have 75,000 square feet, filling 10 floors, and an option to take more space when the leases of a smattering of small tenants expire.
The German publisher Springer-Verlag said it renewed its lease on 40,000 square feet -- six floors of the building. Its options under the new agreement set the stage for an expansion by 14,000 square feet on four more floors.
"There are core industries in Manhattan that are thriving, despite the recession, and publishing is one of them," said Robert Freedman, managing director of Williams Real Estate, which brokered the deal between the two publishers and the owner of the building, Flatiron Associates, a partnership headed by Jules Olsheim of Manhattan.
Unlike banks, law firms, brokerage houses and other Manhattan companies that have been forced to let the wattage of their computers and the flexibility of their office layouts dictate real estate decisions, he said publishers "don't care about unorthodox floor plates and don't need high-tech systems -- they can take advantage of charm and quirkiness."
INDEED, the Flatiron Building is not the only example of an old, offbeat office building south of midtown Manhattan that has lured publishing industry tenants. In a slow migration that began in the 1970's and accelerated greatly in the 1980's, more than a dozen publishing houses have moved from midtown to Chelsea, Greenwich Village, Ladies' Mile and the blocks near the Flatiron building.
Among the publishers that moved to these areas over the last decade are the Berkley Publishing Group, at 200 Madison Avenue, the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, at One Park Avenue, Scholastic Inc. and Workman Publishing at 708 Broadway, the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, at 170 Fifth Avenue, and Family Circle, at 110 Fifth Avenue.
They have joined dozens of companies in advertising, public relations, architecture and engineering, as well as not-for-profit organizations, that have taken office space south of 23d Street.
And while the charm and artistic style may have played a role, some experts say the main advantage can be measured in economics.
"It just costs less when you move south of midtown," said Tom McKee, executive vice president of the Association of American Publishers, a trade group, which itself moved in the early 1980's from 34th Street to 220 East 23d Street.
"Publishers have found good space at a lower price, and I'm not sure that charm means much compared to that," he added.
Cost was clearly a factor in the new Flatiron Building leases. Although those involved in the negotiations declined to provide details, Mr. Freedman said both publishing houses in the building would be paying less than $20 a square foot in rent.
AS has become commonplace in Manhattan's market, both tenants persuaded the building's owners to renegotiate their existing leases before they expired, and at a lower price. Mr. Freedman said the publishers, whose new leases run 12 years, would reduce their rent by more than 30 percent on the space they had already occupied in the building.
So substantial is the cost savings that both publishers may move workers into the building from suburban locations. Indeed, Springer-Verlag said it planned to move 15 workers to the Flatiron Building from an office it rents in Secaucus, N.J., and St. Martin's Press said it was considering a plan to move its accounting operations to the building from New Jersey.
"We never really went after the publishing industry, and I guess we just got lucky," said Mr. Olsheim, who heads a group of 15 partners who own the Flatiron Building, and has been manager of the building since 1951.
When he took over management, the economy and industrial mix of Manhattan -- particularly the area between Midtown and Greenwich Village -- was in some ways better suited to the Flatiron Building's peculiar mix of triangular floors and intricate limestone detail that extends from street level to its bold cornices, 21 stories over Broadway.
Mr. Olsheim said the building was fully occupied in the 1950's by design companies in the garment industry and toy industries. Later, as manufacturing steadily declined in New York City, those companies were replaced by an increasingly diverse mix of smaller businesses.
THE building's architectural stature, while appealing to many companies, has complicated life for its owners. Indeed, since it is listed as a landmark by both the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the National Register of Historic Places, maintenance and repair of its exterior are strictly regulated.
Over the last two years, Mr. Olsheim said, the building's exterior has been steam cleaned and repointed. Much of its terra-cotta detail has been restored, and its lobby renovated. A sidewalk bridge still surrounds the building because restoration of some of its detail remains in progress.
Mr. Freedman said one reason the Flatiron building and others in the neighborhood had attracted publishing houses is that many of their employees -- people with interests in scholarship and the arts -- chose to live in Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Gramercy Park or elsewhere in the neighborhood.
"Its a question of life style," he said. "Many of these people live in the neighborhood and would prefer to work there, even if the costs were not a lot lower than in Midtown."
Another attraction for the publishers has been a renaissance of the neighborhood as a center of restaurants, clothing stores and other retailers, which have always been attracted to Greenwich Village but moved by the hundreds over the last decade into the nearby blocks of Midtown South.
Publishers, authors and their agents "do go to lunch," said Mr. Gainsburg of St. Martin's Press. He added that the growing number of restaurants in the neighborhood had been "very much a factor" in luring publishing houses.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Westchester;
Knicks Sign Pact With SUNY Purchase

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
FOR years, Westchester County has been anxious to attract professional sports teams, both to make use of its existing athletic facilities and to develop new arenas and sports complexes that could generate new revenue.
The county recently scored a coup when the New York Knicks basketball team, which had been training at the State University of New York at Purchase since 1987, signed a 10-year contract to remain at the school. 
 According to the agreement, the team will pay $100,000 for the first two years, with an annual increase of 4 percent every year thereafter, totaling more than $1.16 million over the term of the deal.
Additionally, the Knicks will invest $1 million for improvements, including the construction of a new practice floor and coaches' offices and expansion of locker and training room facilities.
This is the first long-term agreement between a professional basketball team and a New York State college, according to Sheldon N. Grebstein, the president of the State University of New York at Purchase.
Previously the team had signed a one-year contract and then a four-year agreement. "This is the first long-term deal," Mr. Grebstein said.
For the last 12 years, Westchester has also been the practice home for the New York Rangers hockey team, which trains at Playland Ice Casino, in Rye, and has an agreement to stay there through June 1999.
Officials of both teams said they liked Westchester for its quality of life and convenient location.
"Our players and coaches live in the area," said Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' vice president for player personnel. "And we fly our team plane out of the Westchester County Airport."
Mr. Grunfeld said the team had looked around at other facilities and considered building a free-standing structure on the university campus at Purchase, which the Knicks would have shared with the Rangers.
"It turned out that the Rangers were happy at Rye and wanted to stay," Mr. Grunfeld said.
Also, the university's board of trustees decided that a separate facility for the exclusive use of professional teams was "not in keeping with the mission of the university," Mr. Grebstein said.
Neil Smith, the president and general manager of the Rangers, said he was never in favor of moving his team out of Playland, which was built on the shores of Long Island Sound in the 20's and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
"It's a grand old facility, which is very unique," Mr. Smith said. "Mentally it takes us away from the rush and push of New York City."
One of Mr. Smith's primary concerns about remaining at Playland is the "ticking of Father Time," he said.
"Considering the age of the facility, if a pipe under the ice broke or something, we might be forced out of our practice home," he said. That happened last season, Mr. Smith said, but it was not because of a broken pipe.
"A very severe storm brought the Sound crashing into our building, which knocked out the ice," Mr. Smith said. "We lost a day or two of practice time, and several of the players' cars were destroyed."
Before the Knicks agreed to remain in Purchase, the university had to agree to allow the team to upgrade the facility.
In addition to expanding the private offices and creating "a state-of-the-art weight room," Mr. Grunfeld said, the team had to replace the basketball floor, which was unsuitable for professional play.
"It was a wooden floor over concrete and was very hard," he said. "Considering the investment we make in our players, we don't want sore knees."
A new cushioned floor has been laid and the other construction is expected to be completed by the end of the summer.
The Knicks will use the new floor for 500 hours during the basketball season. The rest of the time it will be used for student athletic programs, Mr. Grebstein said.
The added revenue generated by the Knicks will be used to restore the school's men's basketball team, which was eliminated in 1987 ago because of a lack of funds.
The agreement with the Knicks is technically a 10-year permit because the New York State policy prohibits a lease arrangement. As such, the state reserves the right to revoke the agreement at any time which, at first, concerned the Knicks organization, Mr. Grebstein said.
"They wanted a lease," he said. "After all, they're making this investment and they didn't want us to force them out for some reason."
CARL AUSTIN, president of Austin Corporate Properties in White Plains and a university board member, helped negotiate the deal.
"The mechanics of it were somewhat different because of all the conditions and restrictions imposed by the state," he said. "But the Knicks got all the warranties they requested."
One of the conditions imposed by the school was a requirement that the Knicks mention the university in their promotional literature as their training home.
In exchange, the team can display its banners in the school gym and put its team logo, along with the school's, on the basketball floor.
"Having the Knicks here is important to the county because it establishes a sports presence and enhances our overall image," said Norma Drummond, an economic development specialist with the Westchester County Office of Commerce and Economic Development.
A consortium of business executives recently approached Ms. Drummond's office about forming a partnership to attract more professional teams to Westchester.
Stephen Acunto, the president of Chase Communications in Mount Vernon, who is leading "a group, loosely called the Westchester Pro Sports Partnership" said he and his partners "would like to see more sports in the county and will endeavor to make that happen."
There was a flurry of excitement recently when George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, was said to be considering a site adjacent to the Yonkers Raceway for a new baseball stadium.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke took the news seriously enough to write a letter to Mr. Steinbrenner.
"I told him, "We'd love to have you,' " Ms. Drummond said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Calm Before the Next Big Storm?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
LYNDON JOHNSON was seeking a full term as President, promising a "Great Society" at home and no escalation in Vietnam. The Beatles were the newest music sensation. America felt rich and successful, with economic growth topping 5 percent a year. And the stock market was rising ever so quietly, with virtually no volatility.
Life in 1993 appears to be very different from 1964. Economic growth above 3 percent now seems like a distant memory, and even a mild economic stimulus package is deemed unreasonable because of huge budget deficits. At last week's summit meeting in Tokyo, President Clinton went to great lengths to note that jobless prosperity is affecting all major industrial economies, not just this one. 
 But on Wall Street, 1993 is shaping up as being very similar to 1964. Stock prices have been rising ever so gently over the past year and a half, with minimal volatility. In the first six months of this year, the high for the Standard & Poor's 500 was just 6.4 percent above the low for the period. Only once since the index began in 1930 -- in the second half of 1964 -- has there been less volatility over a similar period. Then the figure was 6.1 percent.
Dick McCabe, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, notes that the normal pattern is for periods of high volatility to follow times of slow action. When low volatility lasts only a little while, there is no pattern to subsequent market performance. But when dull markets keep on going like the Energizer bunny, there does appear to be a pattern. Prices advance nicely amid the peaceful conditions. But when the peace ends, so do the profits.
The most similar period to the present one came in the mid-1960's. From mid-1963 through the end of 1965, every half-year period showed volatility of less than half the historic average of 21.6 percent. It was a great period to own stocks, with the S.& P. 500 up 33.2 percent. But in 1966 the average lost 13.1 percent.
Volatility can serve to remind investors that stocks are inherently risky. Without such reminders, it may be easier for valuation levels to move to extraordinary levels. By late 1965, the dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 had fallen to 2.91 percent, only a bit lower than the current level.
To bulls now, such valuations are not bothersome because interest rates are so low. Where, after all, can someone put money other than in the stock market? In 1965, Treasury bill rates were a bit higher than they are now, and they were rising. But long-term bond rates were under 4.5 percent, or well below current levels. That fact did not prevent the market from sliding in 1966.
There are numerous signs that this bull market is nearer an end than a beginning, ranging from the high levels of Nasdaq volume to the level of speculation indicated by the phenomenal rises of stocks in companies with more hope than history. But none of them prove that a bear market will come soon. Let's hope that this dull stock market will last for another year or two.

HEADLINE: Latin America's Oil Rush: Tapping Into Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: BRASILIA

 BODY:
LONG a crusty redoubt of nationalism, the Latin American oil industry is quietly opening to a flood of foreign investment.
In late June, attention focused briefly on the successful privatization of Argentina's state oil company, YPF S.A. But beyond that sale is a broad movement in the region to attract foreign oil capital and technology. 
 "Oil nationalism was born in Latin America, so it is quite a turnaround," said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "There is no question that Latin America is becoming a real hot spot for oil and gas investment and exploration."
Just how hot can be judged by the crowded waiting room outside the office of the new president of Petroperu, Emilio Zuniga. "I have been in this job for three weeks, and I already have received representatives of 23 foreign oil companies interested in investing in Peru," said Mr. Zuniga in an interview in late June. By the end of next year, Petroperu, Peru's largest state company, is to be sold to foreign investors.
The investors are lining up throughout the region for a variety of reasons. Some want to diversify their portfolios away from the politically unstable Middle East. For American companies, transportation to the United States is generally quicker and cheaper from Latin America than from the Persian Gulf and environmental standards are generally less stringent than in the United States. And, finally, the oil is here.
Latin America led the world in oil discoveries from 1982 to 1991, according to a recent survey of the region except for Mexico by Petroconsultants S.A., a Geneva-based firm. During that period, companies found 29.7 billion barrels of light, medium and heavy grades of oil in Latin America, or 35 percent of world discoveries. Overall, proven reserves in Latin America and the Caribbean come to 123 billion barrels, five times the level of United States reserves.
Yet in many countries in the region, the legacy of years of oil nationalism is declining production. Short of capital and modern technology, officials of state oil companies increasingly see the value of partnerships.
"The silent confrontation of the 1960's and 70's between North America and South America has eased greatly," said Gabriel Sanchez Sierra, secretary general of the Latin-American Energy Organization, an intergovernmental group in Quito, Ecuador.
The opportunities in the region range from huge privatizations like the one involving YPF to equally ambitious joint production ventures and construction contracts.
Still, despite the oil rush atmosphere, obstacles remain. Bucking regional trends toward free markets and capitalist development, anti-American feelings linger in some corners. And Marxist guerrilla groups in Peru and Colombia continue to target foreign oil interests. What's more, oil companies seeking to escape tight environmental restrictions will discover that Latin American countries are tightening traditionally lax enforcement of environmental laws.
What follows is a snapshot of industry changes in five key Latin countries.
 
Venezuela
 Unlike Argentina's wholesale privatization, Venezuela offers what will most likely be the oil policy prototype for Latin America in the 90's -- foreign companies nibbling at the edges of a state monopoly. In the case of Venezuela, the edges are juicy.
Last year, for the first time since the oil industry was nationalized in 1976, Venezuela signed agreements with foreign companies to produce oil. Next month, in a second round of bidding, 80 foreign companies will be vying to reactivate production in old fields, with reserves totaling 1.7 billion barrels.
Venezuela hopes to see $40 billion invested in the oil sector by the end of the decade, according to Gustavo Roosen, president of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., the state oil company. Short on capital, the company plans to invest $22 billion. The remaining $18 billion is to come from joint ventures, including $10.4 billion in deals expected to be approved by year-end.
"We're convinced that strategic associations -- that is, partnerships with international companies -- are a far better alternative than indebtedness," Mr. Roosen said.
In the largest project, Exxon, Mitsubishi and Royal Dutch/Shell would join Petroleos de Venezuela to convert natural gas into liquefied natural gas for export to the United States. In two other projects, the state company would work with Total S.A. of France, Itochu of Japan and Conoco Inc., a unit of E. I. du Pont de Nemours.

 
Mexico
 With national control of the oil industry exerting an almost mystical hold over Mexican politics, officials in Latin America's second-largest oil-producing nation maintain a strong nationalist front.
"Ownership and control of oil will remain unalterably in the hands of Mexicans," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said last March in a speech marking the 55th anniversary of the expropriation of foreign oil companies in Mexico.
But the monopoly is loosening slightly. Next year, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, plans to start selling some of its 60 petrochemical plants.
In other departures, foreign companies are financing a $1.4 billion refinery and have started drilling dozens of offshore oil wells. Pemex will lease the refinery and wells until construction costs are repaid.
 
Colombia
 Buoyed by a sea of oil that represents the largest find in the Americas since the discovery in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay in 1968, Colombia is embarking on an oil boom that could lead it to rival Mexico as a major source of imported oil for the United States.
The new find is Cusiana, a field of 2 billion barrels of low-sulfur oil that officially started pumping June 29. Half the oil is to go to Ecopetrol, Colombia's state company, and the rest is being divided among three foreign partners: British Petroleum, Total and the Triton Energy Corporation of Dallas.
To raise production to 600,000 barrels a day by 1997, the four companies are to invest $7 billion. In a measure of foreign confidence in the field, Ecopetrol successfully offered a $150 million Eurobond issue in late June, the first ever for a Colombian company.
With only one third of Colombia's oil-bearing area explored, Ecopetrol will accept a new round of exploration bids in October. So far, the state company has 86 joint ventures with foreign companies
But while Colombia's guerrillas believe the Government is giving away the nation's riches, many foreign oil companies complain that the Government is driving such hard bargains that it may kill the golden goose.
"Other countries are offering more attractive economic conditions," Stephen Newton, president of Occidental of Colombia, said in a recent interview with a Colombian newsweekly, El Corredor. For every barrel of oil pumped by Occidental, he said, 87 percent of revenues over operating costs go to Colombia in the form of royalties, taxes and production sharing with Ecopetrol.
 
Brazil
 Latin America's largest nation has the region's most conservative oil policies. With the exception of foreign-owned gas stations, the entire oil sector is a Government monopoly. But, in contrast to Mexico and Venezuela, Brazil imports about half of its oil. Petrobras, the state oil company, has little hope of reaching an often stated goal of rendering Brazil self-sufficient in oil in the 90's.
To hold down inflation, politicians routinely depress domestic gasoline prices. Since 1980, this policy has deprived Petrobras of $25 billion. Capital expenditures are now almost half the level of a decade ago, and 200 development plans are sitting on shelves.
Focusing on the Achilles heel of oil imports, Shell is coordinating a business group to lobby Brazil's Congress to loosen the oil monopoly. The move is well timed: starting in October, Congress will have the authority, by simple majority vote, to amend the nation's Constitution, which prohibits foreign investment in the industry. No amendments are now permitted.
A recent survey found that just 40 percent of members of Congress favor keeping the state monopoly intact.
Until the laws change, the only major area open to foreign participation is a $2 billion, 2,100-mile gas pipeline that is to be built from fields in eastern Bolivia, which hold six trillion cubic feet of natural gas, to Brazil's "industrial triangle" -- the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.
Tenneco and British Gas have shown interest in forming a consortium to construct the pipeline and thermo-electrical plants along the route. Pressuring Brazil to open the monopoly, multilateral lenders like the World Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank have indicated that they will not help finance the gas line if the project remains under Petrobras majority control.
 
Peru
 One of the most radical turnarounds in Latin America's oil patch is in Peru. With nationalizations in the 70's and legal tangles in the 80's, Peru made it clear that foreign oil companies were not welcome. Paying a price for hostility, Peruvians watched production and proven reserves drop in half during the 80's. By 1987, Peru, once an exporter, had started importing crude oil.
The turnaround came after Alberto K. Fujimori, a free-market pragmatist, became President in 1990. He immediately worked to create a pro-business environment by cutting Government controls and adopting one of Latin America's most liberal foreign investment codes. Since 1990, 14 foreign oil companies have signed exploration or production contracts and 14 more are expected to sign by the end of this year.
"Foreign companies are waiting in line," said Roger Alderson, general manager for Simon Petroleum Technology, part of an American consortium that signed an offshore exploration contract last month.
Further whetting foreign interest, Peru's Congress is expected to approve an oil investment bill this month that provides for international arbitration of disputes and a stable tax regime, among other things. And the Government plans to privatize Petroperu.
"Peru is now one of Latin America's most attractive nations in the oil sector," said Mr. Sanchez of the Latin-American Energy Organization.

HEADLINE: Profile/Marc J. Shapiro;
This Banker May Be Too Big for Texas

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
MARC J. SHAPIRO's incandescent rise in banking began here in his hometown 21 years ago, when the top graduate from Stanford Business School started designing systems for budgeting and profit analysis at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. after turning down a similar job at Citibank.
Now in his fourth year as president and chief executive of Texas Commerce, the lanky, 45-year-old Texan is riding a surge in profits and market share at the state's second-largest banking company. And soon he may be presented with another Houston-vs.-New York career choice -- one with much higher stakes. 
 The Chemical Banking Corporation, which acquired Texas Commerce on the brink of the state's banking crisis in 1987, is close to assigning several senior posts that will help set its course after Walter V. Shipley, now president, becomes chairman and chief executive at the end of the year.
Mr. Shipley, 57, will succeed John F. McGillicuddy in running the bank the two men created 18 months ago out of the rivals they headed, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover. The new bank is No. 3 in the nation, after Citicorp and BankAmerica.
Analysts and Chemical insiders say the top contenders for Mr. Shipley's current job are Chemical's two vice chairmen, Edward D. Miller and William B. Harrison.
Mr. Miller, from Manufacturers, is 52, and Mr. Harrison, whose roots are in the old Chemical, is 49. Mr. Miller heads the consumer bank and Mr. Harrison runs the global business at a time when both are comfortably profitable. But Mr. Shapiro's steady performance at Texas Commerce, and a reputation for razor-sharp analysis that dates from his Stanford days, has put him in the running for a high-level post in New York, perhaps as chief financial officer or eventually as president.
"Marc Shapiro is one of the best in the banking business, period," said James J. McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a research firm. Since the merger, he said, there has been talk "about a possible role for Marc at the holding company."
Mr. Shapiro, hand-picked by Texas Commerce's hard-driving founder, Ben F. Love, to be his successor, has had exquisite timing in filling the shoes of a man who was a powerful actor in both Texas banking and behind the scenes in Texas politics. A modest revival in the state economy was stirring when he took over late in 1989, and trade with Mexico -- a growing influence in Texas -- was gaining speed.
Last year, Texas Commerce registered its highest profit, $180 million, since its best-ever year of $183.3 million in 1984 -- just before collapsing energy and real estate prices pushed the Southwest deep into recession. By mid-1988, a year after Chemical paid $1.2 billion to buy Texas Commerce, in the first out-of-state merger for any top Texas bank, troubled loans had soared to 12 percent of assets, or $1.4 billion.
In New York, Mr. Shipley was criticized for buying Texas Commerce with no Federal aid, then adding $300 million to shore up its capital as losses surged. Meanwhile, two regional powerhouses, Nationsbank (then called NCNB) and Banc One, together collected $5 billion in Federal insurance against losses and marched past Texas Commerce by acquiring bigger Texas banking franchises.
THE Banc One deal was especially tough on Mr. Shapiro, who spent weeks crafting an acquisition bid for the 20 failed banks of Mcorp that regulators eventually put in Banc One's hands. That same year, just as Mr. Shapiro took command, Texas Commerce was forced to add sharply to its loss reserves for real estate, and the company lost $350 million, its worst year ever.
Now, though, Mr. Shipley's purchase of Texas Commerce is looking a lot wiser. Steadily rising earnings raised return on equity above 15 percent last year for the first time in eight years. The pile of nonperforming loans was just reduced for the 19th straight quarter, to $414 million, or just 2 percent of the bank's $21 billion in assets.
The bank increased its dominance of the state's corporate loan market to 51 percent at the end of 1992, or twice the level when Chemical took over, and is the biggest Texas lender to smaller businesses, too.
Texas Commerce still trails Nationsbank and Banc One in consumer lending in Texas. But Mr. Shapiro narrowed their lead in January when he paid $329 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for most retail branches and other assets of his troubled crosstown rival, the First City Bancorporation of Texas.
Mr. Shapiro said he expects to squeeze $200 million in costs from First City branches by paring employment and by eliminating duplicate operations.
In a deal that shows how Mr. Shapiro has pushed into nonlending activities, Texas Commerce agreed last week to pay about $130 million for the Texas trust operations once controlled by Mcorp.
The agreement increased Chemical's investment this year alone to more than $700 million in new ventures at Texas Commerce. This type of financial backing, Mr. Shapiro said, was a big reason why Texas Commerce sought a combination with Chemical in the first place.
"In 1984, half of our loan portfolio was in energy and real estate," he said. But when those markets collapsed, Texas Commerce entered a battle in which it would be the only survivor among top Texas banks.
"Energy and real estate lending was not going to come back to the way we knew them for a long period of time," Mr. Shapiro said. But Texas Commerce had loyal customers, so the key was to find more products and services to sell them -- and that, he said, was the logic for its marriage with Chemical.
"If we had a partner," he remembered thinking, "a strong, larger partner, we'd be able to build a lot faster while the other banks in Texas were still playing defense."
In one transaction beyond the bounds of traditional lending, the bank acted as investment adviser to a group in San Antonio that acquired the Spurs professional basketball team, at a price reported near $70 million.
Texas Commerce was also an adviser in the biggest corporate acquisition in Texas last year, when a Houston-area grocery chain, Randall's Food Markets Inc., acquired a debt-laden chain in north Texas, Tom Thumb Foods. The bank also provides financing in the commercial paper market.
FOR all the speculation, Mr. Shapiro is not expressing any great desire for a career shift into Chemical's corporate hierarchy. He and his wife, Jeri, who met as Houston high school students, have a daughter away at college and a son at a private high school in Houston. Mr. Shapiro's father, who operated a furniture-rental store before retiring, and mother also live in Houston.
The Shapiros do not own a second home, preferring to travel, usually with their children. Last summer, for instance, they spent 10 days in Paris and Normandy. Mr. Shapiro plays a casual round of golf every Sunday morning with friends.
And Mr. Shapiro schedules his frequent business trips across Texas, where Texas Commerce now has 120 branches, as one-day excursions so he can be home by dinner.
The only years he has been out of the city were spent studying economics at Harvard, where he graduated magna cum laude, and at Stanford. "I like the job that I'm doing," Mr. Shapiro says. "I'd rather not speculate on anything that might happen."
Being directly involved in making loans is something relatively new for him. Although he became Texas Commerce's chief financial officer at 29 and vice chairman at 34, Mr. Shapiro did not oversee lending operations until Mr. Love, with Mr. Shipley's backing, named him president of the flagship bank in Houston in 1987.
Colleagues say Mr. Shapiro has an informal style of public speaking, with a casual, comfortable use of humor and anecdotes, that surprises many who had considered him more soft-spoken and reserved than the imposing Mr. Love.
And if anything he spends more time on the road meeting with employees and customers. On Wednesday, he flew to Dallas in the morning, visited four branches, shaking hands with surprised customers, talked privately with employees, and, after lunch with several branch managers, met with some corporate customers. "We talked about what the bank was doing, how their companies were doing and how we could work together," he said. "A lot of this calling on customers is to reinforce the message that the bank does more things today with more products."
MR. SHAPIRO is happy in Houston for another reason: Chemical showed a remarkable hands-off attitude during the darkest days. Mr. Shapiro said that patience worked for Chemical; at some rivals, he said, Texans were axed in favor of out-of-state executives who did not grasp the market.
"Unless you were in Texas during that time, it was almost impossible to understand what happened," Mr. Shapiro said. "When Nationsbank catapulted all of those people in from North Carolina, I don't think they could begin to understand what happened."
"The popular version was, well, it must be a bunch of dumb Texans, or crooked Texans," he said. "But people living through it knew there were a lot of smart, honest people that got ruined. Because we were maybe a little more empathetic to what happened, we had the opportunity to gain a significant amount of market share."
Mr. Shipley is also playing his cards close to the vest about his successor and other lofty posts about to open at Chemical. He said that both Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Miller, the vice chairman, have photographic memories that give them a talent for instant recall of facts -- and, in occasional gin rummy games, card counting. "It's very disconcerting," he laughed. "I find myself asking, 'Is that what I said the last time?' "
He said Mr. Shapiro's task now is "managing Texas Commerce through a very important strategic phase in its evolution."
"We're all looking at our challenges as they are," he said, "and I suppose it's more than press people who are doing the speculation" about coming changes. "Marc is running a $20 billion banking company with a lot on his plate. He's got one big, big job to do down there, and it ain't finished."

Divining the Market's Next Big Turn

 BODY:
WITH the Dow Jones industrial average bouncing over, then under, 3,500 for the last several weeks, investors may well puzzle over its next big move -- and theirs. Should they avoid a market some call overheated? Or put more money into equities to catch the next big jump others say is ahead?
For guidance, The New York Times turned to eight top-flight mutual fund managers who have run their funds for at least a decade -- in two cases, for nearly a quarter of a century. As a group, they range mostly from neutral to bullish, with just two bears among them, both of whom are bargain hunting among unloved stocks. Here's what the eight had to say: 
 * "We've got an expensive stock market but a good economic outlook, so I think the stock market is fairly priced today," said G. Kenneth Heebner, manager of CGM Capital Development, top performer among 135 growth funds for the decade ended May 31 (up 19.6 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago; all gains mentioned are annualized averages).
He cites ample manufacturing capacity, a largely recovered banking system and rising industrial productivity. "Admittedly, the strength is in the industrial sector, not the consumer sector. But that's healthy -- we're investing in plant and equipment," he said.
His current strategy: cyclical plays in automobiles, airlines and steel. His biggest holding: Chrysler.
* Shelby M. C. Davis has run the New York Venture Fund for 24 years, winning third place in growth funds for the decade (up 16.8 percent), behind CGM and Fidelity Magellan. He recently also began managing Selected American Shares, a no-load growth-and-income fund. Both funds are fully invested.
"The market crossed 3,000 three years ago, so we're spending a lot of time between 3,000 and 3,500," he said. "We're in a trading range, but there's probably an upside move left when the cyclical stocks have their run and perhaps even the old leaders -- drug companies -- will have another turn." The funds are aiming to profit from "baby boom savings trends," he said, by investing in financial services companies.
* George Vanderheiden, who runs Fidelity Destiny I (up 16.7 percent), says he is "agnostic about the stock market" because the fund must be fully invested by policy. Success comes from moving among the sectors, he said. Autos, energy and industrials have shone. His strategy is unearthing sectors with rising pricing power. Autos are the biggest play; Chrysler is the fund's second-largest holding, after Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association). He avoids drugs, tobacco and consumer goods.
* "Call me a 'picky bull,' " said Michael Price, manager of Mutual Qualified, the best-performing growth-and-income fund of the decade (up 15.8 percent). "The Dow is real high, the bond market is real high, and I worry that when the bond market is hit, the equity market will follow." But he specializes in special situations -- "Every day I come in, there's more disasters to pick from," he said -- stocks down because of "worries about the health-care proposals, or the economy, or because they're in California, or the wrong industry, or the wrong sector." He likes Catellus, a large California real estate company, and the Dime Savings Bank.
* A meaner bear is John Neff, manager of the Vanguard Windsor Fund (up 15.4 percent), who has put 20 percent of the fund into cash because he predicts a correction of about 10 to 15 percent. Given that the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks are selling for more than 17 times earnings and yielding less than 3 percent, he said, "we're looking forward to either a great spurt in earnings to justify that valuation -- but I don't think so, because the economy is slow -- or a correction." Looking to buy into weakness, he has been purchasing in particularly hard-hit sectors, especially in food, tobacco and health care. His favorite sector is aluminum.
* Veering up to neutral is Russell E. Thompson, manager of United Income, the decade's top-performing equity-income fund (up 16.2 percent). "The economy is weak," he says, "because there's so much uncertainty in government and no driver for economic growth." Even so, cash accounts for only 5 percent to 7 percent of the portfolio based on his view that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again, giving a lift to stocks.
* Another neutral-to-mildly bullish manager is Matthew A. Weatherbie, who runs Putnam Voyager A, which took third place among aggressive growth funds (up 14.5 percent) in the decade. "I see a continuation of moderate economic growth with low inflation," he said. While equity prices are high, he said, they are "supportable because of low interest rates." Voyager is roughly 94 percent invested in equities, its usual stance. Of that, 20 percent is in what Mr. Weatherbie calls "opportunity stocks: large companies undergoing positive changes." Two favorites: Primerica and Textron.
* Ralph Wanger, manager of the decade's top-performing small-company fund, the Acorn Fund (up 16.4 percent), for 23 years, views the current landscape with some amusement: "I'm used to small stocks getting wrecked -- it's fun to see the big ones get smashed for a change." He says small companies are priced reasonably today relative to larger ones, but he has gone outside the United States for values, primarily in Europe; Acorn is 22 percent invested abroad. But he's no good at market timing, he says, so "we'll stay fully invested and take whatever comes -- it's like being a Mets fan."

HEADLINE: Cigarettes Can Take A Substantial Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Trouble With Punitive Smokers' Tax" (letter, July 2), Robert Tollison claims that a cigarette tax of 35 cents to 40 cents a pack will maximize tax revenues. He is responding to Michael Grossman, who argues in "For Best Revenue, Tax Cigarettes $1.26" (letter, June 18) that the Treasury would lose money if the Federal excise tax exceeded the figure that he prefers.
If Mr. Tollison's tax of 35 cents to 40 cents were revenue maximizing, then how come the Governor and Legislature in Massachusetts are now locked in combat as to how they spend the tens of millions of extra tax dollars that have been generated by that state's recent tax increase from 26 cents to 51 cents a pack? 
 If Mr. Grossman's $1.26 tax were revenue maximizing, then how come the Government of Canada collected billions of extra dollars when it raised provincial and federal taxes to more than $3 a pack (in United States dollars, that is), even in the face of cross-border cigarette smuggling?
Professors Tollison and Grossman both relied upon high-powered statistical studies of notoriously flawed data on state tax-paid cigarette sales. Both of them would be advised to stop citing their favorite econometric research and start looking at the evidence.

HEADLINE: Clinton Discovers That Even Japan Can Go For a Populist

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON and his Administration kept saying all week that this was a different kind of Group of Seven meeting. The lofty old talk of macroeconomic coordination and stable exchange rates was replaced by the mantras of the 90's: jobs and "structural reform," which means preparing governments, industries and workers geared to cold war prosperity for the new austerity.
"Some have called this a jobs summit," Mr. Clinton said. "And they are right, because the creation of new jobs in the United States and in all the other countries present here was at the center of all of our discussions." 
 But then, as if a ghost was rattling his chains louder the more he was ignored, came a reminder of the past. The final image from the summit was of President Clinton shaking hands with the smiling Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa over yet another in a decade-long series of agreements to reduce Japan's persistently bloated trade surpluses. President Clinton described it as a new start, full of new ideas; knowing Japanese bureaucrats said it was merely a continuation of the old, incremental negotiation process. Both sides conceded that, as a mere framework for future bargaining, it may take years to produce results.
That tortured, last-minute trade deal underscored the ambiguous character of this "new" summit, as well as the surprisingly strong personal stamp that President Clinton left on it. He seemed to find change an even tougher sell abroad than it has been at home. But among the leaders of the seven wealthiest industrial nations, weary from economic malaise, his personal appeal, energy and ambition to create a sense of momentum permitted him to make the summit agenda his own.
Mr. Clinton played a critical role in shaping the agreements on a major tariff-reduction scheme to spur world trade, a $3 billion package to help Russia change into a capitalist society and a commitment to stimulate faster economic growth. Each is promising but will prove as hollow as the pronouncements from previous summits without the sort of immensely difficult follow-up work that has often eluded these countries.
Nonetheless, a President who had been depicted as too weak at home to lead abroad had stomped onto the world stage with some force.
 
No More Acid and Condescension
 Nowhere was that more evident than in President Clinton's dealings with the Japanese, who before last week had responded to his aggressive trade policy and eagerness for change with a mixture of acid and con descension. For months, senior Japanese officials had been depicting him as a dangerous neophyte because of his insistence on prying open Japanese markets by endorsing market share targets for foreign products and by strengthening the value of the yen against the dollar. Both were considered examples of excessive government interference in the markets.
Speaking of President Clinton and his Cabinet, Mr. Miyazawa had once commented, "It may be that they do not yet understand well the nature of government, since they have just recently come into office." And when Clinton Administration officials had begun talking up the value of the yen, a senior Bank of Japan official abandoned his customary reserve and asserted, "I don't think the top man is receiving sufficient briefings on this."
 
The Personal Touch
 The bash-Clinton campaign collapsed last week. First of all, the President and his wife, Hillary, were treated like personable celebrities, not simply with the awe that American Presidents traditionally command here. In a country where aged political leaders have been seen for years as cogs in a thoroughly corrupt political machine, the Clintons were admired for their youth, sense of purpose and easy manner in public.
In fact, the President clearly sought to capitalize on the disillusionment with the old political order in Japan. A week from today, Japan will hold perhaps its most important parliamentary elections in the postwar era, with most Japanese expecting the governing Liberal Democratic Party to lose its majority for the first time since it was formed in 1955.
One of the things the party still has going for it is the fear among Japanese of disorder. President Clinton sought to alleviate such concerns by stressing in public that political change could improve the lot of the average Japanese by bringing in politicians more inclined to help consumers than producers. Few Japanese missed the message when Mr. Clinton spent the better part of a reception early in the week chatting amiably and at length with several opposition party leaders.
That did not mean President Clinton's ideas were always embraced with the same enthusiasm as his image. "The lecture sounded like a pamphlet appealing for brightness, cleanliness and cheerfulness," said a student after the President spoke at Waseda University. "I could not get a feel for his own character." On the other hand, Mr. Clinton was still an object of fascination for the Japanese media; for them, his image mattered as much if not more than his character.
More important, President Clinton appeared to have moved, if only slightly, the most important constituency in policy-making here: the bureaucrats. His ideas on using measurable targets to open Japanese markets still appall the bureaucrats, who regard this as a heavy-handed attempt to manage Japan. But in light of the President's popularity and strong hand in moving the summit meeting forward, they were not able to dismiss him as a policy lightweight any longer.
"Television was always following Bill and Hillary, and people loved that," said Yukio Okamoto, a business consultant and former official who negotiated several trade deals with the United States. "I think the bureaucracy was moved less than the Japanese people. But they now have a begrudging respect for the President."
Compromise, of course, played as much of a role in President Clinton's successes here as charisma, and that is why, ultimately, it may take a year or more to determine whether the Tokyo meeting produced a change in substance or just in image.
President Clinton, for instance, had sought a $4 billion fund to assist Russia, about half of which was to include cash for grants; he got a $3 billion fund with just $500 million in cash, most of it shuffled from one Russian aid program to this new one. The critical issue now is whether the Group of Seven nations can spend the money effectively and help state-owned Russian companies acquire private owners who know how to run them.
Equally, the question a year from now may be whether the industrial economies, given a blueprint this past week for lifting themselves out of their economic rut, are up to the job of making the changes, or whether that will be too ambitious a goal for these once-a-year gatherings, even when a celebrity President pushes his optimistic agenda.

HEADLINE: The Sheik Will Be Staying Put, for Now

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than a week ago, American officials abruptly informed Egypt that Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman could leave the United States for any country that would accept him unless the Egyptians quickly presented an extradition request, which they reluctantly did. That was the bad news. The good news came a few days later, when the Government here learned that the sheik might spend years locked up as an illegal immigrant while his lawyers fought the extradition request in the American courts.
And the really good news came when American legal experts poring over an 1874 treaty said extradition was not only a long way off, but fraught with so many hurdles that the blind and diabetic cleric might never make it back. 
 Sheik Abdel Rahman, spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, Egypt's main militant opposition, is thought to be the inspiration of the bombing of the World Trade Center last February, of a plot to conduct more bombings and assassinations in New York, and of a wave of attacks in Egypt that have killed 180 people and decimated the tourist industry. Egyptian officials executed seven of his followers last week, but fear chaos if the cleric himself returns for trial. Naturally, they were elated by the obstacles to his return.
"Now," mused an Egyptian official, "if some prison doctor would give him an injection of glucose instead of insulin, we would be rid of the whole mess."
The official was expressing a little-talked-about but nevertheless well-known fact of life here: Even if the sheik threatens Egypt's Government, the Government is not eager to confront him head-on, for in a test of strength, this Government cannot be sure it would win. It has not reduced the burden of poverty, it is known for corruption and inefficiency, and it has not even tried to espouse the kind of romantic ideals that in other places often distract the frustrated masses from such obvious failings in their leaders.
So it would be convenient indeed if a threat like the sheik could be bottled up indefinitely under guard in the United States, no longer able to record fiery sermons for his followers from an obscure New Jersey apartment.
The problem is that this does not address the reasons that the sheik and his teachings have appeal in Egypt in the first place. Even if it can be shown that there are links to outside powers like Iran, "the root cause of the unrest is the poverty and lack of opportunities that plague Egypt," said a Western diplomat. "Until these problems are solved, and until people feel they have a voice in their own destiny, the violence will not only continue, but probably get worse."
The danger to Egypt, many Western diplomats contend, arises not so much from the Islamic militants as from the attitudes and performance of the entrenched, well-fed bureaucrats and military officers who have ruled the country in the 40 years since Gamal Abdel Nasser and other young officers overthrew the monarchy in 1952.
At first, Nasser electrified the Arab world by articulating an idealistic pan-Arabism. His economic nationalization, involvement in Yemen's civil war and defeat in 1967 by Israel later dulled his luster, and when he died in 1970, Egypt was a bankrupt police state. Still, his legacy as the proponent of a grand dream is such, and the paucity of new ideologies is so great, that Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Hafez al-Assad in Syria still like to imagine that they have assumed his mantle.
Egypt has never recovered from Nasser. His successor, Anwar el-Sadat, became a darling of the West but never acquired Nasser's popular appeal. When he was assassinated in 1981 by Islamic militants, many Egyptians were ready for something new.
What they got, in President Hosni Mubarak, was a low-key general who eschewed Nasser's rhetoric and Mr. Sadat's pomposity. He set out to loosen censorship, build public works, liberalize the economy and keep Mr. Sadat's close ties with the West.
He has, in fact, proven to be one of the West's best allies in the region, working to further the Arab-Israeli peace talks and leading the Arab coalition against Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. That may be good reason for the United States to cooperate with his Government in containing the threat from the fundamentalists; it is also good reason to confront the weaknesses in the regime itself.
In the fortress-like embassy in Cairo that houses the largest American mission in the world, diplomats worry that Mr. Mubarak is out of touch. Washington has sent $30 billion in aid to Egypt since it agreed to peace with Israel at Camp David in 1978. Only Israel has received more. But diplomats say the ossified political structures, endemic corruption and inefficient state-controlled economy remain largely untouched.
American diplomats have nudged Egyptian officials to improve their human rights record, curb corruption and open up the political system. It is a measure of how deep these problems run, perhaps, that the Egyptians are responding now with bitter talk of betrayal and abandonment, especially since it became public in April that American Embassy employees had been meeting with leaders of the outlawed Islamic Group. "We do not need the Americans to come in here and tell us how to run Egypt," one official said. "Do they want us to treat men who toss nail bombs into crowded cafes, killing children and innocent people, with respect?"
The Americans say that is hardly the point. Criticism of human-rights abuses masks a deeper concern about the fundamental appeal of a regime on which so much strategic interest has been staked. As Egypt's overcrowding and poverty, housing shortages and unemployment persist, the political implications are made worse by the seeming lack of any vision for a better life. Egypt's current leaders have never replaced the Nasserite ideology since it was exposed as nothing more than a fossilized glorification of an Arab ideal that never existed. Nor do they believe it needs replacing.
"This is a one-party state where there is no real political participation by those on the street," said a Western diplomat, "and this has created a political vacuum that the militants are rapidly filling."
This month, President Mubarak will be nominated by Parliament as the only candidate for the presidency, in effect handing him a third six-year term. But no one, even within his Government, expects the next six years to be as stable as the last.
It is an atmosphere in which the heady visions of the Islamic utopians, colliding with the dismissive attitude of the old elite, could well push the country to a flash point.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Uninsured: 37 Million and Growing

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
"WE have met the uninsured, and they are us," is the message from Hillary and Bill Clinton these days as they try to prepare the public for sweeping health-care proposals this fall. They are not arguing for spiritual unity with the downtrodden. Rather, they are drawing on new evidence that startling numbers of even middle-class Americans are finding themselves without the security of health insurance at least temporarily, most often because they have changed or lost their jobs. And still more say they are suffering from "job lock," afraid to move or quit because they fear for their health coverage.
The estimated number of Americans without health insurance -- some 37 million and growing -- has become one of the verities of the health debate and a marker of national disgrace. But this snapshot figure conceals as much as it reveals. 
 Roughly six in 10 of the uninsured at any given time have been without for a year or more, according to Katherine Swartz, an economist at the Harvard School of Public Health. These are mainly lower-wage workers and their families, not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. Rounding out the total is an ever-changing mix of people who spend months without coverage before regaining it. According to an analysis by Families USA, a nonprofit group in Washington, 2 million people lose their health insurance monthly, though nearly all get it again soon, for a monthly net increase of perhaps 100,000.
And so the White House is seeking to redefine the issue, talking more about the urgent need to safeguard the haves than about the plight of the have-nots.
"If you just focus on the uninsured, you're missing the real problem," said Kenneth E. Thorpe, an economist at the Department of Health and Human Services and an architect of the Clinton plan. "Of all people who have health insurance today, one in four will be uninsured at some point over the next two years. That's the scarier part of the problem."
The shift in emphasis does not mean the President will abandon the have-nots, but that he has made a sensible political calculation.
He is expected to propose that all employers offer health benefits and that all individuals, working or not, be required to carry insurance, with subsidies for companies and families that need help. His plan will mean new taxes as well as controversial cost-cutting measures. But he clearly hopes that a growing sense of vulnerability among the vast middle class -- more and more of whom have had spells without health insurance or know someone who has -- will translate into powerful backing for his overall proposal.
"Security" has become Mrs. Clinton's mantra: "Security is what this debate is about," she says. "Everyone will get a health security card which will guarantee all Americans access to a comprehensive package of benefits, no matter where they work, where they live and whether or not they've ever been sick before."
Critics are seizing on the same data about the uninsured to say the problem has been overstated.
They argue that many who lack coverage do so out of choice, and that compelling everyone to carry comprehensive coverage will waste large public and private sums. John F. Sheils, vice president of Lewin-VHI, a consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., thinks the Clinton plan will force expensive insurance on younger, healthy workers who prefer to pay medical bills out of pocket, gambling that they will not become seriously ill.
"I think the biggest surprise of this whole thing will be the way the uninsured respond to having money taken out of their paychecks," said Mr. Sheils, who believes that simpler measures like changes in insurance rules and targeted assistance to low-income families would suffice.
But Clinton defenders say that universal coverage and the broader restructuring of health care form a seamless whole, and that no one should get a free ride. "I don't think there are that many young healthy people trying to shirk their responsibilities," said Arnold Bennett, a spokesman for Families USA. "They are not just risking their own health care, it's our money," he said, referring to the billions in unpaid hospital bills that are covered by the insured public.
As for the tens of millions of people who find themselves uninsured for months at a time, experts like Dr. Swartz say the perils are greater than ever. It is not just the chance that an ill-timed medical crisis will produce gargantuan bills. Increasingly, insurers are avoiding customers deemed at high risk of illness, and employers are refusing to cover pre-existing conditions. "What worries me," Dr. Swartz said, "is that if somebody develops a medical condition during their time off, it can affect their insurability for the rest of their lives."
The numbers of the long-term uninsured are gradually rising, too. In part it reflects the insurers' efforts to sort the healthy from the sick. More important, the economy is producing more jobs that lack benefits, Dr. Swartz said. Many manufacturing and white-collar jobs have disappeared, while lower-end service jobs, part-time work and independent consulting have risen and many new small businesses do not offer coverage.
 
With Insurance, Expenses Rise

 
 "All these trends add up to a growing sense of unease: 'Yes I'm insured today, but will I be tomorrow?' " said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Just how wide and deep that unease is will be tested in the coming year.
The major concern will be the cost of universal coverage. The uninsured do get care now, either paying for it out of pocket or seeking "free" care through hospital emergency rooms. But they also forgo routine care, put off treatment and are less likely to receive costly, advanced procedures. Studies indicate that with insurance their health expenses will rise, and should.
A wild range of numbers, from $30 billion to $150 billion a year, have been floating about as the price of universal coverage. Until Mr. Clinton sorts out just what the required benefits will be, how much companies and individuals will be expected to pay and who will be eligible for subsidies, it is impossible to estimate the cost to society or the Federal budget.
With the cost issue, too, the White House is trying to change the terms of the debate. Instead of focusing on subsidies for the needy, officials prefer to talk about the overall impact of health reform. They say their proposals to reorganize care and cap expenditures will save huge sums compared with existing trends, more than enough to offset the costs of universal coverage.
The trouble is, the savings are unlikely to be visible for several years, while subsidies will require money here and now. Hence the Clinton sales pitch. "If the President can convey the idea that a large proportion of the American work force is in jeopardy, then he can ask voters to make sacrifices," said Dr. Aaron. "That is the price for assured access to health insurance."

Black Enterprises Grow and Get Noticed

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
MANY black leaders in Chicago were upset last month when the Johnson Products Company, one of the nation's leading symbols of black enterprise, announced that it would be acquired by the IVAX Corporation, an international conglomerate.
For decades, Chicago-based Johnson Products dominated the market in personal and hair care for blacks with Ultra Sheen, Classy Curl and other products, and its sale means the loss of a very powerful institution, the black leaders lamented. 
 But the Johnson deal is also a measure of the progress that black-owned companies have made over the last 20 years in expanding and diversifying their businesses, so much so that these enterprises have become attractive buys to mainstream companies.
When Joan B. Johnson succeeded her husband as chief executive of Johnson Products in 1989, the company was valued at $11 million. IVAX, a Miami-based pharmaceutical company with skin care, chemical and veterinary businesses, agreed to pay $67 million for Johnson, reflecting the company's long-term growth potential.
Management experts who study black-owned businesses say they anticipate an increase in the number being acquired by large corporations as these enterprises continue to flourish and diversify.
"As black firms become more and more like the traditional business community in terms of expanding their operations and entering technologically advanced fields, we can expect to see more acquisitions like Johnson Products," said Margaret Simms, director of research for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization in Washington that specializes in minority issues.
While the majority of black enterprises are small and continue to concentrate in traditional areas, the nation's 100 largest black-owned companies posted a 14.1 percent increase in sales last year, bringing their revenue to $9 billion, according to a survey published in last month's issue of Black Enterprise magazine. The increase in 1991 was 10.4 percent.
 
When Motown Was No. 1
 When Black Enterprise first compiled its list of 100 top black businesses 20 years ago, they had annual revenues of $473 million and were dominated by manufacturing companies but included 16 auto dealers, most of whom started their businesses during the 1960's. In the top position that year was Motown Industries, Berry Gordy's recording company.
Black-owned companies have since expanded into areas where they no longer have to rely on black patronage alone. The more recent areas of growth and opportunity have included computer information systems and other technical services, telecommunications, manufacturing and finance.
Among the top 25 on the Black Enterprise list are the Burrell Communications Group of Chicago and the Uniworld Group Inc. of New York City, both advertising agencies; H.J. Russell & Co. of Atlanta, which is in construction and development as well as food services, and Black Entertainment Television Holdings Inc., the Washington-based cable and publishing concern.
"Black business is no longer just food service, hair care, or auto dealerships," said Earl G. Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise. "It's not ethnically skewed anymore. African Americans have moved into the mainstream."
 
Set-Aside Plans
 The growth and diversification has been spurred by a number of factors, in particular the rising number of programs at all levels of government that set aside contracts for minority-owned businesses in such areas as construction and computer and telecommunications services. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of black professionals with management experience who have decided to become entrepreneurs.
Moreover, the experts predict a rise in the number of acquisitions by black entrepreneurs, citing the 1987 purchase of the international operations of the Beatrice Companies by the late Reginald F. Lewis, who was chairman and chief executive of the food-processing and distribution company until his death this year. TLC Beatrice International Holdings is now the nation's largest black-owned business. The company, which is based in Manhattan but operates primarily in Western Europe, had $1.67 billion in revenues last year.
"Just as early black entrepreneurs went into the hair care and restaurant business because it was something they were familiar with, you now have a growing number of blacks who have worked in the computer, high-tech and finance fields and are now launching their own ventures," said Ms. Simms of the Joint Center for Economic and Political Studies.
She said that while minority-owned businesses serve an important role within their communities, providing jobs and economic development, successful entrepreneurs are distinguished from the others by their ability to acquire and build on capital from their enterprise.
David Huggins, chief executive of RMS Technologies Inc. in Marlton, N.J., started the computer and technical services company in 1977 with three employees. Last year, the company had sales of $103 million and ranked sixth on the Black Enterprise list of industrial and service companies.
Mr. Huggins said that his firm had benefited greatly from minority set-aside programs, but that the company had grown so much that it no longer qualifies for most of these programs and often finds itself searching for minority subcontractors to meet government requirements on large contracts.
Perhaps the major obstacle facing black-owned businesses is access to new capital, Mr. Huggins said. "Even when you have a thriving, expanding enterprise, there is still a reluctance and skepticism in taking black-owned firms public," Mr. Huggins said. "Racism is at work here, but you have to see it as a challenge and not a barrier."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Haiti's Future Can Be Undone Before It's Done

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
FOR many who have followed Haiti's multiple ups and downs since the fall of the Duvalier family dictatorship in 1986, attentions quickly turned -- once the news of a United Nations-brokered settlement of the country's latest political crisis had penetrated -- to speculation over what could go wrong next.
In this proud but star-crossed nation given to coups, countercoups, rampant demagoguery and permanent intrigue, the question seems even natural, given the elaborate choreography called for by the United Nations plan to restore the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to office on Oct. 30. 
 The United Nations, the Organization of American States and the four countries that have invested most heavily in the diplomatic efforts here -- the United States, Canada, Venezuela and France -- have wagered considerable prestige on making the plan work. But what is most required for its success, many agree, is that rarest commodity in Haitian politics: good will.
No sooner had the ink dried on the agreement between the two principals to Haiti's latest crisis, Father Aristide and the army commander who presided over his overthrow, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, than Haiti's cunning and often cutthroat political class, sensing an end to the military dominion, was galloping off with wildly divergent readings of the painstakingly charted road ahead.
The United Nations-devised settlement calls first for weeding out enemies of the President who were elected to Parliament last January in voting widely denounced as fraudulent and then for the nomination of a new prime minister by Father Aristide. Once his choice is ratified, international sanctions will be lifted and a massive international aid program begun. The effort to build a modern economy and restructure the armed forces involves sending as many as 1,000 experts in development, police, military affairs and other areas.
The senators who had only recently won their places, along with their allies among anti-Aristide legislators, have gone to the airwaves to vow resistance.
"No one on this earth, with the exception of someone armed with a machine gun, will get me to quit -- and even then it would be my cadaver they would drag from here," one senator pledged, his voice trembling, on national television.
Others, like Serge Gilles, a smooth party boss who has wavered fluidly between effective support for the army coup and calls for Father Aristide's return, have chosen audacity over melodrama by suggesting themselves as prime minister rather than the centrist businessman that Father Aristide is believed to favor.
Before any selection can be made, however, the settlement requires a sweeping parliamentary cleanup, and Senator Gilles, like his colleagues who won office early this year, is clinging tenaciously to his seat.
Until Father Aristide's choice of a prime minister is ratified, a crushing embargo that has turned the streets into ghost town sets by blocking Haiti's oil supplies will remain in effect. Many here secretly fear that if basic political questions like this cannot be resolved quickly, tensions rising from growing economic desperation could become explosive.
In order to overcome the parliamentary logjam, the United Nations will convene a meeting of Haitian political leaders and Father Aristide's representatives in New York next week. But for now, as a Creole proverb has it, where everyone is struggling to become somebody, the priority is avoiding becoming a nobody.
If diplomatic suasions can help settle the parliamentary mess, all, including Father Aristide and his closest allies, will anxiously wait to see how committed Haiti's army is to fulfilling the rest of the accord.
Intimates of General Cedras tell reporters nowadays that the army leader is determined to live to the letter of the agreement, which calls for his retirement shortly before Father Aristide's return. But many worry nonetheless that somewhere in the army hierarchy lurks an ambitious officer biding his time, ready to create an incident aimed at derailing the transition.
Haiti's army has wielded power throughout most of the country's rocky 189 years of independence, and an ideology that mixes volatile xenophobia with nationalism is widely thought to be alive and well in the institution.
The United Nations settlement ambitiously calls for Father Aristide's new Government to separate the police from the army and appoint a new commander. These would be only the first steps toward a wholesale renovation of the army that aims to get troops out of the streets, where opportunities for extortion and brutality are rife.
Finally, if all goes well until the transition, there is Father Aristide himself, who diplomats say showed little skill for coalition building or management during his nearly eight months in office, and sometimes appeared to tolerate violence by his supporters.
"We don't want to put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall just have him fall all over again," said one diplomat closely involved in designing the transition. In part for this reason, the settlement calls for a large and varied international presence in Haiti expected to last at least two years, along with copious foreign aid.
Those who have spent time with the Silesian-trained priest say he has grown tremendously in his 21 months of exile. One of the most encouraging signs, they say, is that Father Aristide's expected choice as prime minister, Robert Malval, is a widely respected businessman who is known for his open ear and his pragmatism.
"What we have grown used to in Haiti is extremes," Mr. Malval said in an interview. "A centrist force does not exist yet. What we have to work at is building a middle that would be the meeting place of the moderate wings of each end of the spectrum."

HEADLINE: Conversations/Herbert S. Okun;
What Comes After Containment? It May Be Son of Containment

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

 BODY:
HE was 16 in Brooklyn, the red-haired son of an emigre produce merchant, in the summer of 1947 when he read George F. Kennan's anonymous "Mr. X" article in Foreign Affairs. That essay, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct," recommended and swiftly came to define Western policy toward the Soviet threat for the next four decades as "containment."
Herbert S. Okun recalled: "I read it and said, 'That's what I want to do.' " From James Madison High School he went to Stanford, learned Russian, and applied to join the Foreign Service. The substance of his diplomatic career, ultimately as a United States ambassador, concerned the containment policy of the United States: postings to Moscow and East Berlin and assignments to help negotiate limitations on strategic arms and test bans. 
 Now, with the cold war becoming history, Mr. Okun sits in an office 21 floors above Lexington Avenue contemplating a world whose rules and institutions have virtually broken down in many areas. For 20 months, until May, he watched that collapse from the inside, taking part in the international negotiating efforts to end the fighting in the former Yugoslavia.
With that often-grueling experience under his belt, Mr. Okun ponders what comes after containment. Ponders out loud. Three hours at a stretch with hardly a pause.
"We've got the world's best factory for horseshoes, but the automobile has just been invented," he says. "All of the multilateral organizations, the United Nations, the European Community, NATO, are having big troubles adjusting." He pauses an instant for a sip of coffee from a plastic cup and canters onward: "History helps, but it doesn't give you answers. Knowing history is like a sailor knowing the tides. It doesn't tell you if it is going to rain tomorrow."
Mr. Okun considers his generation "all children of the cold war." It shows when he describes a contemporary in Munich from the mid-1950's and forms with his fingers the initials C, I, A, while mouthing them silently -- although that clandestine identity hardly matters four decades later.
"We have a sense of battle fatigue, cold-war fatigue," he says. "We need to disenthrall ourselves from, what is it Lincoln said? 'the dogmas of the quiet past.' The great horseshoe makers had great achievements -- NATO -- the most successful defense alliance in history. But it is not easy to go from collective defense to collective security."
 
A Country Dissolved
 He left the Foreign Service in early 1991 to help create Financial Services Volunteer Corps, a nonprofit organization set up with Government and private funding to assist countries of the former Soviet bloc in developing banking services, stock exchanges and other financial institutions essential to a market economy. Co-chairmen of the organization are former secretaries of state Cyrus R. Vance and John C. Whitehead.
It was but a short step in October 1991 to accompany Mr. Vance as senior deputy in the initial assignment from the Secretary General of the United Nations to negotiate a cease-fire in the war between Croats and Serbs. In contrast to previous international mediation attempts, that mission was successful. On the basis of a pact signed in Sarajevo, the guns around Dubrovnik and in Slavonia and Krajina fell silent on January 1992. United Nations troops were posted in Serbian-held territories of Croatia to keep the peace. But an even bloodier conflict loomed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With that emblematic Yugoslav republic being torn apart in a three-sided ethnic struggle, representatives of 30 governments met in late August in London to have another go at peacemaking. They enlisted Mr. Vance and Mr. Okun for the United Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community to stop the slaughter and redesign Bosnia and Herzegovina as a "multi-ethnic and pluralistic democracy." Mr. Okun, who had explored the region in 1957, paddling the Drina and Neretva rivers in a kayak, soon dubbed it "mission impossible."
Looking back on the tribulations of the Vance-Owen plan, Mr. Okun declines to cast blame, saying only: "What was always necessary was implementation -- sufficient peacekeeping forces or the threat of force. But the international community was not willing to cough up the troops. The international community was not unanimous."
Welcome to Son of Containment. Drawing on the cold war experience, Mr. Okun remarks that carrying out Kennan's containment dictum "took a lot of hard intellectual work" in the 1950's. "Are we doing that in the post-Communist world? We're not. We need the same intellectual vigor and vision." He recalls that the Pentagon spent billions of dollars developing what planners called an "escalatory ladder" of stages of engagement between the West and the Soviet empire.
 
A Ladder Up
 "We don't have the institutions that get at this new cliche called 'preventive diplomacy,' but now everyone says you have to get involved earlier in the Bosnias or in a Nagorno-Karabagh," he says. "We need to design a preventive diplomacy ladder."
With Mr. Vance, Mr. Okun visited the Nagorno-Karabagh enclave last year for the United Nations to view the ethnic conflict that is continuing between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He came away with the impression that it was "worse than Bosnia" partly because both sides were deploying heavy Soviet weapons.
Lacking a coherent plan for dealing with the newest wars, invasions and for the chaos that has descended on countries like Somalia, Mr. Okun sees that inchoate creature called the International Community "edging crabwise, usually unwillingly, into intervention without a visible end."
"WIC's" is his term for these objects of intervention, his acronym for "wards of the international community."
At stake, "roughly speaking," he says, are four principles: sovereignty, territorial integrity, self-determination and human rights. "The problem in former Yugoslavia, for instance, is that these principles bump up against each other. How do you get involved early if they don't want you? That's an infringement of sovereignty. My self-determination is your secession. My freedom fighter is your terrorist. Maybe it is time to start using the World Court. Otherwise, we'll go right back to 1913.
"The lesson for the future from Vance-Owen is that you have got to have the United States directly involved from the beginning," he says. "The United States is the only power that can regulate in the world. It is the Ordnungsmacht (German for the power that creates order). It has to be the policy fountain. That's not arrogance, it's a fact."
Mr. Okun is a reader, in Russian and German as well as English. Turgenev and Lermontov. The novels of Austria's Joseph Roth. And again, George F. Kennan. "Did you see 'The Balkan Crises,' his new essay?" he asks, referring to the July 15 issue of the New York Review of Books. "He draws everything together as only he can do, with the lesson that if you don't use force, you bear the consequences. Diplomacy without force is like baseball without a bat."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Writing New Rules For Criticizing Israel From Afar

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ISRAEL'S Ambassador in Washington, Itamar Rabinovich, was recently addressing a convention of the America-Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby, explaining Israel's peace policies. He said Israel seeks a package of peace and security, based on a compromise with the Arabs, that, at the end of the day, "might also involve some Israeli concessions."
The huge audience of American Jews greeted his remarks with a stony silence, save one solitary soul in the back of the hall who clapped. The resourceful ambassador paused for a moment, took in the sound of one hand clapping, and said: "I understand that it is very difficult to get an applause for the term 'concessions' here. So let us applaud the concessions the Arabs will have to make." 
 That got a rousing ovation.
That scene was no aberration. In recent months the Labor Government of Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, has increasingly found itself under attack by some prominent American Jews as being too willing to trade land for peace with the Arabs. And some hard-line Jewish intellectuals, who for years argued that it was heresy for any American Jews to criticize any Israeli government's policies, now argue that it is a necessity, indeed a moral imperative, to criticize the Rabin Government in order to save Israel from itself.
The most extreme form of this debate surfaced last week when a vice president of the Aipac lobby, Harvey Friedman, was forced to resign after calling Mr. Rabin's dovish Deputy Foreign Minister, Yossi Beilin, "a little slime ball" while denouncing him for a supposedly excessive willingness to trade land for peace.
Mr. Rabinovich says he has found himself lately in the position, unfamiliar for an Israeli ambassador, of "having at one and the same time to argue our case with the Arab side at the negotiating table, while explaining to a skeptical minority of our own supporters that there is merit to this peace process, even though it is yet unproven."
The chief stirrer of this debate is Norman Podhoretz, the conservative editor of the magazine Commentary. In a long essay in the April issue, he wrote that for many years, and especially from 1977 to 1992, when the right-wing Likud party dominated Israeli politics, he "took the position that American Jews had no moral right to criticize Israel's security policies; only those whose lives were on the line had the standing to participate in the public debate."
 
New Circumstances
 During those Likud years, it was Israeli policy to reject any territorial compromise on the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights or Jerusalem.
But in 1993, Mr. Podhoretz argued, "we have an entirely new" political and moral situation that has forced him and others to re-examine their objection to criticizing Israel. The Rabin Government, he said, seems to be walking into a negotiating trap set by Arabs intent on using the peace table, instead of the battlefield, to destroy Israel. Israel is misreading the real intentions of the Arab regimes, Mr. Podhoretz said, and if it does not desist, it may soon be trapped by pressures into creating a Palestinian state or giving up the Golan Heights.
"My basic point," Mr. Podhoretz said in an interview, "is that there is no evidence that either the Syrians or the Palestinians have changed their strategic objective with respect to Israel, which I still believe is the destruction of the state. It seemed to me in listening to statements coming from Israel and the Israeli Embassy in Washington that the Israelis were desperately eager to make a deal and were on the point of making dangerous concessions in order to consummate it."
Mr. Podhoretz admits "that I am being inconsistent on the moral issue of the right of a Jew living outside of Israel to participate in the debate over security." But, he argues, there is a difference "between my kind of criticism and the moral assault on Israel by some Jews, which contributed to the effort to delegitimize Israel in the 1970's and 1980's." He said it was more dangerous to add to that delegitimization than to make the criticisms he is making now, "when the Israeli Government itself is outstripping Washington in its eagerness to make concessions."
 
A Lack of Surprise
 Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, was one of many Jewish liberals who was denounced by the Jewish right as "anti-Israel" or "self-hating" when he disagreed with the Likud's uncompromising policies during the 1980's. He says he is not surprised that now that the left-of-center Labor Party is in power, Jewish hard-liners say it is all right to criticize. "I just underestimated the speed and shamelessness with which they did it," he said, adding that he wished the Rabin Government would be more aggressive in answering them.
It has not reacted vehemently, Israeli officials say, in part because many in the Labor Government have simply written off some American Jewish groups as irrelevant or irredeemably indoctrinated by the Likud. As Mr. Beilin said: "The firing of Harvey Friedman came on a much more grave background: the transformation of Aipac in recent years into a right-wing Jewish organization." Aipac vehemently denies this.
In part, it is also because Israeli officials are confident that the great majority of American Jews and mainstream Jewish leaders who have been silent in this debate support Mr. Rabin.
And in part it is because many Israeli intellectuals on the left believe the rightist argument rests on a ludicrous assumption that Mr. Rabin approaches the peace talks as a starry-eyed romantic who believes that Israel's Arab enemies have had political therapy and are now ready to reconcile with the Jewish state.
In fact, say Israeli diplomats, Mr. Rabin, whom no one ever called a romantic, bases his whole approach on a sober, functional analysis that there is no transformed Arab psyche, but that political and economic pressures on the Arab governments may make them amenable to a deal that will enable Israel to ease the burden of war with its neighbors -- on terms that will not endanger its security. Maybe, in the end, Israel won't find an Arab partner for such a secure peace, but it certainly has an interest in testing the waters. That, they say, is the deepest form of realism.
"The difference between me and Podhoretz," said the Israeli philosopher David Hartman, "is that when you live on Park Avenue you can afford to be 'worried' about the future of Israel. When you live in Jerusalem with your grandchildren, you can't afford to just worry. You have to believe that the future can in some way be different from the present. It might not be -- but you have an interest in doing everything you can to test that possibility. To be paralyzed by anxiety is a luxury we cannot afford."

HEADLINE: JULY 4-10: Keeping the Pressure On;
A Standoff in Iraq Raises Nervousnessc About New Raids

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

 BODY:
The air raid sirens that sounded in Baghdad last week proved to be a false alarm, but the Iraqi edginess was only one sign that last month's punitive American missile strike may not be the last.
There was still hope of compromise by week's end in the most serious current standoff between Iraq and the United Nations, which began more than a month ago. But Iraq's steadfast refusal to permit cameras at two missile-test sites moved the dispute closer to confrontation. A U.N. inspection team pulled out in protest. 
 With familiar dexterity, Baghdad masked its intransigence with conciliation. It agreed to destroy chemical wea pons stocks and expressed a new openness to a U.N. plan that would allow it to sell oil provided that the proceeds are used only to buy food for civilians and to support U.N. relief operations.
But with each gesture, Baghdad urged that the United Nations lift the sanctions it imposed after the gulf war; and the line it drew at the installation of the cameras spoke even more directly of its unwillingness to accept long-term Western monitoring. In Tokyo, the leaders attending the economic summit vowed to keep up the pressure on Iraq to accede to the U.N. directives. The view of Western officials in Washington was that such an effort may soon require more military might.

Mickey Lacks a Soupcon of Charm

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Battered by a European recession and still bewildered by European habits, Euro Disney put its entire future development under review last week after announcing disastrous summer losses. Being in the red during the cold winter months was predictable, but an April-June loss of $87 million sent the company's stock into a nosedive on the Paris Bourse.
Behind the 20 percent plunge in Euro Disney shares lies a growing uneasiness over whether the Walt Disney magicians may have misjudged more than the economic trends in Europe. Certainly, a recession has hit hotel attendance and spending, and higher-than expected interest rates have made Euro Disney's $3.7 billion of debt very expensive. 
 But the grumbling among Europeans is not just about prices. Euro Disney, through its infamous dress code stipulating what undergarments women employees should use and other kinds of corporate rigidity, has acquired a generally negative image in France.
The French are more irritated by lines than Americans, more insistent on booze with lunch (the company recently gave in and started serving wine at four restaurants), less willing to change their lunch hour -- and a touch more cynical.

HEADLINE: CLINTON, IN SEOUL, TELLS NORTH KOREA TO DROP ARMS PLAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sunday, July 11

 BODY:
Declaring that "no specter hangs over this peninsula or this region more darkly" than North Korea's nuclear-weapons project, President Clinton stepped up pressure Saturday on the Communist Government to abandon the program.
His aides suggested that the United States and South Korea would move swiftly to seek economic sanctions from the United Nations if North Korea failed to back down in coming weeks. 
 Arriving here after the close of the summit meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies in Tokyo, Mr. Clinton assured South Korea's anxious leaders that "our troops will stay here as long as the Korean people want and need us."
 
Two Presidents' Commitments
 Sharpening his own oratory, South Korea's new President, Kim Young Sam, said as Mr. Clinton stood next to him that the international community may soon have to take "appropriate countermeasures" to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
Speaking to the Korean National Assembly in what the White House termed his first major address on Asian security and nuclear non-proliferation, Mr. Clinton insisted that the only way to deter aggression from powers like North Korea and to continue Asia's economic growth is for the United States to remain "an active presence."
"To some in America there is a fear that America's global leadership is an outdated luxury we can no longer afford," said Mr. Clinton, clearly tired after four days of summit sessions. "Well, they are wrong. In truth, our global leadership has never been a more indispensable or a more worthwhile investment for us."
His comments seemed an oblique reference to conflicts within his Administration about the proper scope of United States influence around the world in the cold war's aftermath.
The biggest United States cutback in Asia so far came with the closing last year of the huge air and naval bases in the Philippines. American officials argue that those reductions did not signal any lessening commitment to the region because the bases were closed at the insistence of the Philippine Government, which had demanded a tremendous increase in the rent paid by the United States. The decision to close the air base was also speeded by the eruption of a volcano that buried it in ash.
While the United States has been unable to replicate the two installations, at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base, it has reached agreements for landing rights, refueling and small service sites in several nations in Southeast Asia.
 
The Role of Japan
 Mr. Clinton's speech Saturday came amid growing concern in the Administration that the North Korean nuclear program was already having an unsettling effect throughout the region.
At the talks in Tokyo, for example, Japan was the only country to indicate that it could not yet support an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty when it expires in 1995.
Japanese officials say that they have no intention of building nuclear weapons but that conservative members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party did not want to forever forgo the right to build them, especially given the threat they felt from North Korea.
Mr. Clinton reserved his harshest comments for the Communist Government of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's 81-year-old "Great Leader." Speaking only four days before the United States and North Korea are to hold another session of talks about the North's refusal to allow international inspectors into its most important nuclear sites, he said that stopping the spread of nuclear weapons would be a top priority of his "Pacific Community" strategy.
Noting that North Korea had recently tested a powerful missile with a range of more than 600 miles -- one that some believe will be capable of carrying nuclear weapons -- he said: "We cannot let the expanding threat of these deadly weapons replace the cold-war nightmare of nuclear annihilation. And today, that policy is too real."
Administration and Korean officials have estimated that North Korea already has enough plutonium for one or two bombs, but that it may not yet have all the technology it needs to detonate one.
Mr. Clinton described at length steps to improve the quality of United States forces in Korea and Japan and told the Korean National Assembly: "These are not signs of disengagement. These are signs that America intends to stay."
The message was quite similar to one that George Bush brought here in January 1992. But South Korea has been nervous about the Clinton Administration, fearing that a combination of budget cuts and the end of Communism's spread in Asia would diminish Washington's interest.
So far, officials say, the United States, Japan and South Korea have worked closely together to present a unified face to the North, dangling what Mr. Clinton Saturday termed "carrots" -- an end to isolation and the prospect of economic aid.
But some internal divisions have become evident in recent months, mostly over the question of whether carrots or sticks should be used first.
Since March, South Korea has veered from one extreme to the other on how the United States, which has no diplomatic relations with the North and had no dealings with it until recently, should play its diplomatic cards. Three months ago, for example, several South Korean leaders said they were concerned that Washington might overreact to North Korea's declaration that it would leave the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
But in recent weeks, other officials in Seoul have begun to argue that the Americans have gotten little out of their talks with the North, which suspended its withdrawal from the treaty last month. President Kim, for example, suggested in an interview last month that North Korea was simply dragging out the arms negotiations in a bid for time to produce its bomb.
 
Strong Words From Seoul
 President Clinton repeated his warning to North Korea today as he left to visit the demilitarized zone, the fiercely armed no man's land on the border with North Korea, to address American troops stationed near the border. He arrived later than expected because heavy rains forced him to travel to the zone by road instead of helicopter.
The stronger words, though, came from his South Korean hosts.
President Kim, who came to power this year as the first civilian elected President in more than three decades, said that if "North Korea does not demonstrate different attitudes toward the resolution of the nuclear issue, in spite of our sincere efforts, then the international community will inevitably have to come up with appropriate countermeasures to deal with the issue."
Mr. Clinton called that a "very accurate summary of the discussions that we have just held."
A senior Administration official traveling with Mr. Clinton said Saturday that the countermeasures in mind were United Nations economic sanctions. Studies by the United States Air Force and intelligence agencies suggest that a military strike against the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 100 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, had a relatively low chance of success because so much of the complex is hidden in hillsides or underground.
"Even if we wiped out everything we saw, we would never know if we got it all," one American official said.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim did not describe their talks in detail. But Mr. Clinton brought with him a number of his chief security specialists.
While American and Korean officials are loathe to set a deadline for progress in their talks with the North, for fear it would reduce their negotiating flexibility, several say that their patience will wear out by the end of the summer.
"North Korea must understand our intentions," Mr. Clinton said. "We are seeking to prevent aggression, not to initiate it. And so long as North Korea abides by the United Nations charter and international non-proliferation commitments, it has nothing to fear from America."
The key to making sanctions work is the support -- or at least the abstention -- of China, so it does not use its veto power in the Security Council. South Korean officials seem increasingly confident that if they can demonstrate that North Korea has turned down every chance to find a face-saving way out of the nuclear project, China will go along with sanctions.
"When the United States and South Korea were attempting to discourage North Korea from withdrawing from the NPT, China was quite helpful," Mr. Clinton said, referring to the Non-proliferation Treaty. "I think the Chinese Government is very interested in supporting the position we have taken here."

HEADLINE: 3 Ships Adrift in a Diplomatic Limbo

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 10

 BODY:
More than 650 undocumented Chinese men and women remained aboard three rusty tramp steamers about 60 miles west of Mexico's Pacific coast today as the Clinton Administration tried to figure out what to do with the aliens without either abandoning its new get-tough immigration policy or antagonizing the Mexican Government.
On Friday night Mexico turned down a request by the United States for assistance in dealing with the 659 illegal immigrants aboard the three ships. 
 The three are believed to be part of a seven-ship flotilla containing an estimated 1,400 aliens who were planning to illegally enter the United States, probably through Mexico. All seven are sailing under the flag of Taiwan.
When one ship's engine failed, the crew radioed for help on Tuesday. The United States Coast Guard towed it to a point in international waters about 60 miles west of Ensenada, Mexico, which is about 60 miles south of the United States-Mexico border.
The Coast Guard then escorted two other ships to the same point, where it is now providing the aliens with food and medical care while awaiting a decision from Washington about whether to turn the ships back or allow them to land. The other four ships are farther out to sea and still heading east.
 
Governments Still Cooperating
 On Friday, United States officials asked Mexico to allow the Chinese aliens to be brought to a Mexican port, where they could be interviewed by United Nations officials to determine whether they are political refugees, who could ask for asylum, or economic refugees, who would be repatriated.
The United States offered to help Mexico pay for the repatriations.
But on Friday night the Mexican Foreign Ministry, believed to be concerned about the issue of Mexican sovereignty, delicately rejected the request, saying it was "not in a position" to comply.
State Department officials in the United States, and diplomats in Mexico, said today that despite that response, the two governments had continued discussing ways to deal with the aliens.
"When you have interests that touch both countries, you keep on working," said a senior American diplomat involved in the discussions here. The official refused to describe the alternatives being discussed.
 
Stemming Flow of Boat People
 Mexican Government officials were not available today, and a spokeswoman at the foreign ministry said there were no plans to make any statement beyond the one issued Friday night, when Mexico announced it was turning down the United States' request.
The challenge facing both governments is to find a way to handle the aliens humanely while also abiding by Administration plans to try to stem the flow of Chinese boat people.
Last month, at least eight Chinese aliens died when a ship ran aground off a New York City beach. After the New York incident, President Clinton approved a plan aimed at stopping the smuggling of refugees into the United States, and the Administration stepped up its efforts to patrol international waters and seize suspect ships. The effort is similar to that used in the Caribbean for Haitian refugees.
But clearly there is a vast difference between sending leaky vessels a few hundred miles back to Haiti and sending them thousands of miles back across the Pacific to China, although that is an option that may not have been ruled out.
When asked whether the mechanical problems with one of the Chinese ships virtually assured that its occupants would have to be brought ashore and put on jets in order to be repatriated, the American diplomat in Mexico said "disabled boats get fixed, too."
The three ships now being held off the coast of the Mexican state of Baja California are not leaking, but Coast Guard mechanics have not been able to repair the engine of the disabled craft. A Coast Guard spokeswoman at the Long Beach, Calif., station described conditions on the ships as "fair," and said there had been no need to evacuate any of the aliens to a hospital.
The spokeswoman, Petty Officer Elizabeth M. Brannan, said Coast Guard personnel were cooking for the 236 people aboard the disabled vessel, the Sing Li No. 6, and were supplying rice and military-issue meals to those aboard the other two ships.
Petty Officer Brannan said the three ships would be held at the rendezvous point until orders came from an interagency group in Washington consisting of officials of the immigration service, the Justice and State Departments and the National Security Council.
An employee at the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Long Beach, Calif., who would not give his name, said that contingency preparations were being made there as well as in the San Diego and San Francisco offices to accommodate the aliens should a decision be made to bring them ashore in the United States.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Republicans Forget Clinton; the Big Worry Is Perot

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 10

 BODY:
After slashing Ross Perot as "a walking sound bite," "a great hit-and-run artist" and a free agent who can make a splash then "run back to Dallas on his private jet," Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, denied that he harbored any ill feelings.
"I talk to Ross Perot," he said. "I don't want to leave the impression that there's any hostility between myself and Ross Perot." 
 By showing such sensitivity about giving offense, Mr. Dole, never known for making nice to political foes, underscored at a party meeting here just how fearful Republicans are of Mr. Perot's political power.
While Mr. Perot, in his zeal to compete with Mr. Dole as President Clinton's fiercest critic, has neglected the Republicans lately, the party has reason to be more worried about him than the Democrats do: a recent survey by President Clinton's pollster showed that most of the 19 million people who voted for Mr. Perot last year were Republicans, and that they had little interest in returning to the fold.
 
Evidence on a Speedboat
 At the summer meeting here of the Republican National Committee, even the gleeful trading of stories about Mr. Clinton's foibles could not mask an undercurrent of nervousness -- one participant called it panic -- over Mr. Perot. The suspicions escalated recently when Mr. Perot surfaced on his speedboat with David R. Gergen, a onetime adviser to Republican Presidents who now works for Mr. Clinton. The two boaters insisted that they were coincidentally in Bermuda on separate vacations.
"The Democrats' fondest dream is for Perot candidates to run as independents in 1994, splitting the vote and allowing liberal Democrats to slip in the back door with 43 percent of the vote," said Haley Barbour, the Republican chairman. "My Democratic friends have all worn out two sets of knee pads: they're down on their knees praying for the Perot candidates to run as third-party candidates."
Mr. Barbour was not as eager to discuss his own party's even bigger fear: that Mr. Perot will again run as an independent Presidential candidate, siphoning votes from Republicans. Then there is their second-biggest fear: that Mr. Perot will join the Republican Party and run for President, complicating the party's efforts to reclaim the White House and possibly destroying the prospects of veteran Republicans (Mr. Dole comes to mind) who have thirsted for the Presidency.
 
Divided Over a Stand
 Perhaps with his own possible candidacy in mind, Mr. Dole dismissed Mr. Perot as someone who could not win Republican primaries. But he said another independent campaign by Mr. Perot would be worrisome because winning back Perot voters was "going to be very difficult."
Like Mr. Clinton, who has still not figured out whether to cozy up to or attack Mr. Perot, the Republicans are equally ambivalent over how to react. Even as Mr. Dole attacked, Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, paid $15 to join Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand, America.
So did Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who praised Mr. Perot at this conference for making the deficit "a definable, understandable issue." Suggesting that her fellow Republicans were overreacting, Mrs. Hutchison said: "Everyone talks about Ross running against Republicans or possibly running for President. But I've never heard him say that he wants to do that."
And at the luncheon today, Lynn Martin, a former Secretary of Labor, brought up Mr. Perot, telling the Republicans, "He has proven to all of us again that the American people are willing to listen about their future."
 
A Hard-Liner on Perot
 By contrast, William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary and Federal drug policy coordinator, vociferously argues that the party's uneasy alliance with Mr. Perot is nothing short of pandering. Saying he was distressed at the sight of admiring House Republicans flocking to Mr. Perot's side during a recent foray on Capitol Hill, Mr. Bennett warned at the time, "We could end up making him so big, he'll overshadow us."
These Republicans argue that the party should not be fooled because Mr. Perot has taken only a few swipes at Republicans, now that his longtime nemesis, George Bush, is out of office.
As executive director of the Texas Republican Party, Karen Hughes has watched Mr. Perot for years. And the last thing she wants is for him to run as an independent again in 1996. "The danger," she said, "is that we'd end up with the result that we had in 1992: Bill Clinton as President. That should be our biggest message. People are not going to want that to happen again in 1996."
The challenge for Republicans, Ms. Hughes said, "is to agree with Perot on the issues."
 
Uncomfortable With Views
 The problem, however, is that not all Republicans are comfortable with his stands. They do not like Mr. Perot's opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, his proposal (from which he has partly retreated) for tax increases larger than those recommended by Mr. Clinton, and his more liberal views on social issues like abortion.
"I think he's wrong on Nafta," said Don Bain, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, explaining that he would never vote for Mr. Perot if he ran as a Republican. "His personality, his quasi-military style, is ill-suited to the political process, which is inherently one of principles tempered with negotiation and compromise. But he's worrisome in that he's a potential kingmaker in major races."
(Characteristically, Mr. Perot only grins -- but dodges the question -- when asked whether he will field a slate of Congressional candidates in the 1994 midterm elections.)
 
Forums to Draw Voters
 With no unified strategy over how to deal with Mr. Perot, the Republicans, like the Democrats, have sought to shift the attention to "Perot voters." But there, too, the Republicans are trying to sort out game plans to win them over.
The party, whose meeting ends Sunday, devoted part of its closed session today to discussing its plans for an independent foundation to hold forums around the country. The forums are aimed squarely at drawing Mr. Perot's backers.
Mr. Dole put forth another idea. Citing polling data showing that Perot voters view Congress almost with contempt, he said Republicans should emphasize to Perot voters that "the Democrats have controlled Congress almost completely for the last 40 years" and should be voted out in next year's elections. "No wonder the Perot voters are upset," he said.
 
Still Another Perot View
 There is yet another school of thought: that Republicans should not dwell on wooing Mr. Perot or the people who voted for him.
"The principal reason why Perot was a serious factor was that Republicans felt betrayed by Bush on 'no news taxes,' " said Morton Blackwell, the Republican committeeman from Virginia. "He was a place for people to cast a protest vote. In 1996, we'll reunite the economic conservatives and the social conservatives."
But few other Republicans were willing to predict that Mr. Perot would fade from their political calculations (or their nightmares) any time soon. "In the long run, his message will be subsumed by the major parties and he'll disappear into the role of a caricature," said Mr. Bain, the Colorado chairman. "But that could take four to six years."

HEADLINE: Clinton in Korea: A Call for a Pacific Community Based on 'Shared Strength'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address to the South Korean National Assembly yesterday in Seoul, as transcribed by the Federal News Service and provided by the Reuters news agency:
When President Truman sent American troops to Korea's defense 43 years ago, he said he aimed to prove that, and I quote, "Free men, under God, can build a community of neighbors working together for the good of all." Our efforts together since then have benefited all our peoples, not only the people of our own countries, but in the Asian-Pacific region, all who seek to live in peace and freedom. Our relationship has made this region more secure, more prosperous, and more free. 
 Now, with the cold war over and profound changes sweeping throughout your country, this whole populous region, and indeed throughout the world, we must create a new vision of how we, as a community of neighbors, can live in peace. I believe the time has come to create a new Pacific community built on shared strength, shared prosperity, and a shared commitment to democratic values.
Today I want to discuss the fundamentals of security for that new Pacific community and the role the United States intends to play. I had the opportunity just a few days ago, at the G-7 summit in Tokyo, to travel to Waseda University to talk about the economic aspects of that new partnership. And I think clearly all the economic reforms that we can make will benefit a great market system like Korea. But we must always remember that Security comes first.
Above all, the United States intends to remain actively engaged in this region. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	To some in America there is a fear that America's global leadership is an outdated luxury we can no longer afford. Well, they are wrong. In truth, our global leadership has never been a more indispensable or a more worthwhile investment for us. So long as we remain bordered by oceans and powered by trade, so long as our flag is the symbol of democracy and hope to a fractious world, the imperative of America's leadership will remain.
I believe there are four priorities for the security of our new Pacific community. First, a continued American military commitment to this region; second, stronger efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; third, new regional dialogues on the full range of our common security challenges; and last, support for democracy and more open societies throughout this region.
 
Continued U.S. Military Presence

The bedrock of America's security role in the Asian-Pacific must be a continued military presence. In a period of change, we need to preserve what has been reliable. Today we therefore affirm our five bilateral security agreements with Korea, with Japan, with Australia, with the Philippines, and with Thailand. Those agreements work because they serve the interests of each of the states. They enable U.S. armed forces to maintain a substantial forward presence. At the same time, they have enabled Asia to focus less energy on an arms race and more energy on the peaceful race toward economic development and opportunity for the peoples of this region.
The contribution Japan and Korea make to defray the costs of stationing our forces underscores the importance of that presence to both of those countries. There is no better example of that commitment than our alliance with your nation. As the cold war recedes into history, a divided Korea remains one of its most bitter legacies. Our nation has always joined yours in believing that one day Korea's artificial division will end.
We support Korea's peaceful unification on terms acceptable to the Korean people. And when the re-unification comes, we will stand beside you in making the transition on the terms that you have outlined. But that day has not yet arrived. The demilitarized zone still traces a stark line between safety and danger.

 	 	 		. . .	 	So, let me say clearly, our commitment to Korea's security remains undiminished. The Korean peninsula remains a vital American interest. Our troops will stay here as long as the Korean people want and need us here.
We lost tens of thousands of America's best in Korea's mountains and mud and sky. But Korea lost millions. That sacrifice affirms some old truths; vulnerability invites aggression, peace depends upon deterrence. We cannot forget those lessons again. And so it is throughout the region. Our commitment to an active military presence remains. Our mutual agreement with the Philippines to close our bases there should not be cause for Asian alarm. The larger picture tells a different story.
We have obtained increased access for our forces throughout Southeast Asia, to facilitate our presence and, if necessary, to project our forces beyond the region. Here in Korea we have frozen American troop withdrawals and are modernizing Korean and American forces on the peninsula. We have deployed to Japan the Belleau Wood amphibious group and the U.S.S. Independence battle group, the largest and most modern in the world. These are not signs of disengagement. These are signs that America intends to stay.
 
The Threat of Nuclear Arms
 The second security priority for our new Pacific community is to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. We cannot let the expanding threat of these deadly weapons replace the cold war nightmare of nuclear annihilation. Today that possibility is too real. North Korea appears committed to indiscriminate sales of the Scud missiles that were such a source of terror and destruction in the Persian Gulf. Now it is developing, testing and looking to export a more powerful missile with a range of 600 miles or more; enough for North Korea to threaten Osaka, or for Iran to threaten Tel Aviv.
We have serious concerns as well about China's compliance with international standards against missile proliferation. And, since both you and we are attempting to engage China in a more extensive trade relationship, I hope together we can have a positive influence against that development.
The Pacific nations simply must develop new ways to combat the spread of biological, chemical and missile technologies. And, in the coming weeks, the U.S. will propose new efforts aimed at that goal. But no specter hangs over this peninsula or this region more darkly than the danger of nuclear proliferation. Nearly 160 nations have now joined to resist that threat through the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the most universally supported treaty in all history.
Now, for the first time since that treaty was opened for signatures, one of its members has threatened to withdraw. Our goal has remained firm. We seek a nonnuclear Korean peninsula and robust global rules against proliferation. That is why we urge North Korea to reaffirm its commitment to the nonproliferation treaty, to fulfill scope safeguards obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency, including I.A.E.A. inspections of undeclared nuclear sites, and to implement bilateral inspections under the South-North nuclear accord.
Our goal is not endless discussions, but certifiable compliance. North Korea must understand our intentions. We are seeking to prevent aggression, not to initiate it, and so long as North Korea abides by the U.N. charter and international nonproliferation commitments, it has nothing to fear from America.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The many economic discussions within the region also can play a role. . . .
The goal of all these efforts is to integrate, not isolate, the region's powers. China is a key example. We believe China cannot be a full partner in the world community until it respects human rights and international agreements on trade and weapons sales, but we also are prepared to involve China in building this region's new security and economic architecture. We need an involved and engaged China, not an isolated China.
Some in the U.S. have been reluctant to enter in to a regional security dialogue in Asia. They fear it would seem a pretext for American withdrawal from the area, but I see this as a way to supplement our alliances and forward military presence, not to supplant them. These dialogues can ensure that the end of the cold war does not provide an opening for regional rivalry, chaos, and arms races. They can build a foundation for our shared security well into the 21st century.
Ultimately, the guarantee of our security must rest in the character and the intentions of the region's nations themselves.

HEADLINE: Prostrate Haiti Looking to Foreign Aid for a Lift

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 9

 BODY:
The economic data pieced together here by foreign experts in recent weeks read like those of a country emerging from a devastating war: unemployment of more than 40 percent, uncontrolled inflation and a poverty line cutting off 70 percent or more of the population.
But even these figures do not give a full picture of the damage wrought not by armed conflict, but by nearly two years of political strife and mismanagement as well as international sanctions intended to help force the restoration of democracy after a coup by the Haitian military in September 1991. 
 Already the poorest country in the hemisphere before the overthrow of its first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti has been turned into an economic wasteland whose resurrection, experts say, will require hundreds of millions in aid and years of the kind of determined and judicious management that Haiti has rarely experienced in the past.
The settlement signed a week ago by Father Aristide and the Haitian military commander has lent momentum to international plans for economic aid, which revolve around creating 75,000 or more jobs in the country in the first year after Father Aristide's scheduled return to office on Oct. 30. Many of those jobs will involve unskilled labor in basic public works projects in neglected areas like sanitation and road repair.
 
U.S. Pledges $37.5 Million
 In its first year, the aid program will require more than $170 million from international donors. The United States recently pledged $37.5 million, and is expected to give more.
Over the longer term, experts say their hope is not just to put money in empty pockets, but to build a new Haitian economy.
The damage to Haiti's existing economy is visible everywhere. At an industrial park on the edge of the capital that blossomed in the 1980's to become the country's largest foreign exchange earner, only silence emanates from row after row of the hangarlike buildings where clothing was stitched and electronic components were soldered a few years ago.
On downtown streets that once bustled with vendors and chaotic traffic, cars are few and the trade is gone.
"My father died because I couldn't buy him medicine; now I can't feed my children because there is no more business," said Marceline Dukens, a produce vendor who has been trying to save up enough money for car fare to reach her village. "Please give me something so that I can take my family out of town."
 
Thousands Leave Capital
 Her appeal is a common one these days. With inflation running over 60 percent and business virtually dead, thousands of people have left the capital in recent months in the hope of eking out a subsistence in the countryside, where farming and barter have mostly replaced commerce.
The most immediate explanation for Haiti's current suffering is an international oil embargo imposed only last month by the United Nations. Although it forced the army to accept a political accord providing for Father Aristide's return, it has also had a crushing effect on almost everyone.
The flow of electricity in the capital, which depends on oil, is now down to less than 12 hours a day in most areas. Under a strict rationing program, cars lining up at gas stations snake around city blocks or, as is often the case where discipline breaks down, turn entire streets into helter-skelter parking lots.
"We will be lucky if our factory can make it through the end of next week," said a producer of fertilizers of the effect of the oil embargo. He requested anonymity so as "not to scare off foreign customers."
But if the oil sanctions are the most visible symbol of the country's woes, they are perhaps the most easily settled. They are to be lifted once Haiti's Parliament purges lawmakers who were elected in a fraudulent vote in January and then ratifies Father Aristide's choice of a new Prime Minister.
 
Economy in Stagnation
 "What you have is an economy that has been in stagnation since 1987," said Alberto Favilla, an economist and former World Bank official who has led efforts to put together an international recovery package for Haiti. "Virtually every sector has suffered severe damage, from agriculture and export industry to infrastructure. Government has done nothing to take care of the country, not so much as maintain roads or irrigation canals."
At the root of the economic crisis, economists say, is a sharply divided class system in Haiti that allows the wealthy few to thrive almost regardless of the plight of the rest of the population. The elite relies on rigged markets to preserve longstanding monopolies, the lack of tax collection and an institutionalized corruption that allows big importers to bring their goods into the country without paying duties or even standard port fees.
"Haiti has what you could call a franchise economy, where members of the elite have carved out their own niches and in effect employ the Government and the army to protect their holdings," said one expert on the Haitian economy, speaking on condition that he not be identified.
The system, which has evolved over decades, is so entrenched that ordinary public services, from schools and hospitals to fire stations and drinking water, have never been created for the general population.
Experts involved in planning the aid package for Haiti say it will seek not only to create new economic activity quickly and ease suffering, but also to redress the imbalances in the hope of creating a more stable and just political climate.
"What we are talking about is making a viable country where there was none before," said a diplomat who has been closely involved in the aid planning. "That means not only short-term aid, but longer term things like helping rebuild government ministries and developing Haitian expertise."
As prospects of Father Aristide's return to power have improved in recent months, diplomats say, so has the involvement of the President's aides in shaping policy decisions and economic planning in ways they hope will allow the program to get off the ground quickly.
 
Miami Meeting Planned
 Father Aristide, a populist priest viewed by many in the Haitian elite as an enemy, has been reaching out to some of the country's most conservative business leaders, inviting many of them to a meeting planned in Miami later this month aimed at allaying their fears.
"The President wants to tell them that he wants to work with them, not go after them," said Robert Malval, a businessman who is expected to be Father Aristide's choice for Prime Minister. "If we are going to rebuild this country, the President has said that everyone who rejects crime and corruption will have a place."

HEADLINE: IRAQ SEEKS TO KEEP MISSILE SITES OPEN

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 10

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein faces a new confrontation with the Security Council this weekend over the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction unless he allows United Nations inspectors to seal two missile-testing stations close to the capital, rendering them useless.
Today the Government made a counteroffer, saying it would give the inspectors constant access to the sites if they did not place seals on the buildings and equipment there, officials here said. 
 The United Nations special commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction tonight debated how to react to the Iraqi proposal. But it told its inspectors to visit the sites Sunday in any case.
Earlier today, the chief United Nations inspector expressed optimism that Iraq was ready to comply and let the sites be closed on Sunday.
"I have every confidence they will allow us to install the seals," said the team's leader, Mark Silver of the United States, adding that he had "no reason to believe" the Iraqis would block his mission. The two sites are about 40 miles south of Baghdad.
Other United Nations officials were similarly optimistic. They argued that any attempt to thwart the inspectors now would jeopardize plans for a United Nations review of Iraq's compliance with the terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war. Among the terms is the destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
 
Review Sought by Iraq
 Baghdad has asked for such a review as part of talks now under way in New York on easing the embargo on oil sales by Iraq so it can raise money for imports of food and medicine.
The United Nations special commission has demanded that the two missile-testing stations be neutralized until Iraq agrees to install surveillance cameras to insure it does not try to develop long-range missiles, which it is banned from doing under the terms of the cease-fire.
In South Korea, President Clinton warned that any further Iraqi defiance could lead to a new United States attack. In late June, the United States fired cruise missiles at an Iraqi intelligence compound in retaliation for Iraq's reported involvement in what Washington said was a bomb plot against George Bush during his visit to Kuwait in April.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher also warned that any further Iraqi obstruction would provoke a severe reaction. If Iraq refuses to cooperate, he told an American television interviewer, the special commission will order Baghdad to destroy both testing stations. "If that isn't done, the United Nations will have to react," he said, clearly hinting of another possible strike.
Since the end of the gulf war, Iraq has been striving to re-equip its forces and rebuild its military industry. United Nations officials here say Baghdad needs the two testing stations for development of a new surface-to-surface missile; the missile would have a range of about 50 miles, well below the 100-mile limit set by the cease-fire agreement.
But after three years of an increasingly debilitating economic embargo, Baghdad is also making an earnest effort to convince the Security Council that it is complying with the main terms of the cease-fire, the elimination of its most dangerous weapons, and should be rewarded by some easing of the sanctions.
 
Some Conciliatory Gestures
 Baghdad has made conciliatory gestures in other fields. It has reopened the talks with the United Nations that it broke off on partly lifting the ban on oil sales, and some days ago it ended its intermittent jamming of the Arabic broadcasts by the Voice of America, the BBC and Radio Monte Carlo.
In the dispute over the missile-testing sites, Baghdad has been careful not to reject outright the installation of surveillance cameras. Instead it asked the special commission first to review its compliance record and to explain what more Baghdad must do to meet all the terms of the cease-fire.
The commission responded by saying that if the sites were sealed by Sunday, it would invite an Iraqi team to New York to review compliance and prepare for further high-level talks in Baghdad later this month.
The commission remains dissatisfied with Baghdad's position on several other issues. It wants Iraq to provide a full list of all foreign companies that provided sensitive technology for weapons, and wants a full account of how these programs were organized and run. Finally, it wants Iraq to accept a plan for the long-term monitoring of its military industries.
But even if Iraq meets all these conditions, the Security Council seems unlikely to agree soon to any easing in sanctions, beyond possibly permitting some oil sales to allow Iraq to buy some essential goods, diplomats here say.
This is because the United States and its allies say the sanctions cannot be lifted fully until Iraq has complied with all other relevant Security Council resolutions.
Such compliance would mean that Iraq must accept the new and unfavorable frontier with Kuwait that the United Nations surveyed after the gulf war. It would also have to lift its economic blockade of the Kurds in the north and end harassment of Shiite dissidents in the south.

HEADLINE: Haven in Rio Quite Hostile For Angolans

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 10

 BODY:
Keeping one step ahead of Angola's political police, Manuel Neto dreamed only six months ago of escaping across the South Atlantic to Brazil.
"The Brazilians I worked with in Angola were nice," the Angolan refugee reminisced of managers of Angolan diamond mines. "We spoke the same language, Portuguese. I thought we were from one family." 
 But after arriving here in February, the 28-year-old business graduate quickly discovered that Rio de Janeiro's reputed open-arms welcome does not necessarily extend to Africans.
In April, Rio's Mayor, Cesar Maia, complained in a letter to Brazil's Foreign Ministry that the Angolan war refugees were bringing a new strain of the AIDS virus to Brazil, posing "a serious epidemiological risk."
 
The Mayor's Demands
 Mr. Maia, who lived as a political exile in Chile only 20 years ago, demanded that fewer tourist visas be issued to Angolans, that visa applicants be tested for AIDS in Angola, and that Angolan tourists who apply for political asylum in Rio be more "fairly" distributed among Brazilian cities.
"The sudden arrival of thousands of foreigners causes a real and negative impact," wrote the Mayor, whose beachfront city annually welcomes thousands of tourists from Europe and the United States.
Mr. Maia backtracked after the Foreign Ministry retorted that there was no medical evidence that the Angolan refugees carried H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. As many as a million Brazilians are infected with the virus.
But the Mayor's outburst reflects the widespread hostility here against the Angolans, who are easily identified by their tightly cropped hair.
"The Brazilians curse at us a lot," said Mr. Neto, who lives here with his wife, Maimona Dosimao. "One day I was walking with three other refugees, and a man pulled out a pistol and started shouting at us."
 
Racism and Desperation
 Rio's cold shoulder seems to result from centuries-old racism and from desperation linked to a deep recession.
"Some man shouted at me, 'We are going to kill you -- you are living off the Government,' " said another refugee, Agostinho Modizo.
In the last three months, one African was shot in the leg and another was stabbed in the stomach.
The recent surge in Angolan refugees began after Angola's main opposition group, Unita, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, refused to accept its loss in elections last September and resumed its 18-year guerrilla war.
"A truckload of Government police raped my mother, father and brothers and then killed them all," said Mr. Neto, whose father directed Unita's election propaganda in the Angolan capital, Luanda. After they were killed, he said, a family friend obtained a Brazilian visa for him and bribed airport officials to let him board the once-a-week flight from Luanda to Rio.
Since November, about 1,500 Angolans have sought refuge in Rio, the Angolan consulate here estimates, and about half have formally applied for political asylum with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees.
 
Restrictions on Visas
 Several refugees interviewed here said the Brazilian Embassy had been the only one in Luanda issuing tourist visas. Brazil was the first country to establish relations with Angola after the West African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It has also cultivated trade and investment links with Angola, which is rich in oil.
But after issuing 1,506 visas to Angolans last December, Brazil tightened restrictions, reducing the number of visas issued in March to 170.
Using $70,000 a month from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, the Roman Catholic charity Caritas provides each registered refugee with two meals a day and lodging in a $1.60-a-night boardinghouse. Contrary to a common perception here, Brazil's Government does not provide aid.
"By the end of the year, most of the refugees will have working papers," said Heloisa Santos Nunes, a Caritas social worker.
Although about half of Brazil's 155 million people trace all or part of their ancestry back to West Africa, Brazil barred non-European refugees from settling here until 1989. Judging from the hostility that Angolans have encountered, many Brazilians apparently would like to return to the racially exclusive policy.
 
Shifts in Immigration
 A nation molded by immigrants, Brazil stopped attracting emigres from Europe and Japan about 30 years ago. In the 1980's, Brazil reversed roles and started to export people. Today, an estimated one million Brazilians live overseas, fleeing a country in which population growth has outpaced economic growth and inflation is running at 30 percent a month.
Bleak as it may seem to Brazilians, life here is a step up for refugees from Angola, a country where the civil war grinds on without end.
So far, few people have offered to help the Angolans.
For example, Rio's black groups have long stressed their cultural links to Angola, since most of Rio's large black population is descended from Africans imported from Angola as slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. . But Candido Feliciano da Ponte Neto, the director here of Caritas, said not one group has contacted the refugees.
"Frankly, we don't have anything to offer other than words of solidarity," said Amaury Mendes Pereira, president of the Institute for the Research of Black Cultures. "Our own movement is very precarious."

HEADLINE: Detroit's Papers Under Fire At Trial of Officers in Beating

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 9

 BODY:
The court and the news media were at odds again this week in the trial of three white former police officers accused of beating an unemployed black steelworker to death on Nov. 5.
Judge George W. Crockett 3d, who has made no secret of his mistrust of the local newspapers, threatened to hold a photographer and editor in contempt of court after their newspaper published a photograph of a prosecution witness standing outside the courthouse. 
 Cameras have been permitted in the courtroom throughout the trial, but when one witness asked that he not be photographed, Judge Crockett granted the request. The judge's order did not specify time or place.
Richard Lee, a photographer with The Detroit Free Press, took a picture of the witness outside the courthouse after he finished testifying, and the newspaper published the photo on Wednesday. The witness, Byron Gibbs, had reported to two of the defendants that his car, which was similar to the victim's car, was missing.
The prosecution sought a contempt ruling against Mr. Lee, saying he had violated the judge's order. The court cited both Mr. Lee and the newspaper's city editor, Carole Leigh Hutton.
Lawyers for The Free Press said Mr. Lee had not disobeyed the order because he had taken no photographs of the witness inside the courthouse. Barring photographs in public places would violate First Amendment press freedoms, they said.
Ms. Hutton, they added, should be dropped from the citation because she had no role in deciding to publish the photo.
With Mr. Lee and Ms. Hutton in the courtroom on Friday, the judge demanded that a newspaper lawyer, Michael Gruskin, identify the editor responsible for publishing the photo. Mr. Gruskin, after consulting with the editor and the photographer, said he was unable to name the person who made the final decision.
"How does one get a paper that has something in it if nobody's responsible for what gets in there?" the judge asked. "Does it grow like Topsy?"
At yesterday's court hearing, which was originally to have been on the contempt charges, Judge Crockett granted the newspaper's request to transfer the case to another judge. The contempt citation is now scheduled to be heard by Judge Dalton A. Roberson on Sept. 22. Judge Roberson agreed to drop Ms. Hutton from the case on the condition that The Free Press identify the responsible editor.
Earlier in the trial, Judge Crockett found an intern with The Detroit News in contempt for telephoning a juror at home. He sentenced the 23-year-old intern to five days in jail and ordered him to spend part of that time in the courtroom, dressed in prison garb. The sentence was stayed by the Michigan Court of Appeals until a review is done.
 
Years of Mistrust
 During the earlier contempt proceedings, Judge Crockett voiced his desire to hold editors accountable for the intern's actions. He also said he had mistrusted The Detroit News since age 9 because of the newspaper's coverage of his father, former Representative George Crockett Jr. In 1952, The News printed, then retracted, a headline implying that the elder Crockett belonged to the Communist Party.
The trial in the fatal beating of Malice Green, which began last month, has attracted considerable attention, in part because of its echoes of the Rodney G. King beating case in Los Angeles last year.
The three officers were dismissed after Mr. Green's death. Two, Walter Budzyn and Larry Nevers, now face second-degree murder charges, while the third, Robert Lessnau, is charged with assault.
Earlier this week, a sergeant in the Police Department's homicide division testified that police officers had altered evidence at the scene of the beating and failed to provide complete details about the case to investigators.
Mr. Green was beaten inside and outside his car as the officers questioned him outside a house in which crack cocaine was used.
Sgt. Kenneth Day testified Thursday that he had become angry with the officer who had arrived to take charge while Mr. Green was being beaten. He said the officer, Sgt. Freddie Douglas, failed to tell him that blood had been wiped from the officers' flashlights and from the inside of Mr. Green's car, and that Mr. Green's car had been moved.
A charge of involuntary manslaughter against Sergeant Douglas was dismissed, but he still faces a lesser charge of willful neglect of duty. He was also dismissed from the police force, and awaits a separate trial.

HEADLINE: UConn Plans Tuition Rise And Layoffs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., July 10

 BODY:
Tuition at the University of Connecticut will rise 10 percent in 1994-95 and some part-time faculty members will lose their jobs this fall, the school's trustees have decided.
This is the sixth consecutive year that the university has called for a double-digit tuition increase. Over five years, tuition has doubled and the university has trimmed about one-fifth of its faculty and staff. 
 At a meeting at the university's Avery Point campus on Friday, trustees said they hoped for an end to the university's financial crisis and set a goal of not increasing tuition more than the cost-of-living index.
The trustees adopted a $281 million operating budget for 1993-94, almost 2 percent higher than last year's budget. The state will pay $136 million of the new operating budget, up about 10 percent from last year's figure but less than what the state spent five years earlier.
In addition to the tuition increase, the school increased room and board 6.7 percent for undergraduates.
Counting room, board, tuition and university fees, an in-state undergraduate on the Storrs campus will pay $9,784 to attend the university in 1994-95, up from $9,168 this fall.
Despite the increase, the university expects to make more budget cuts, including laying off some part-time faculty members who would have taught about 150 class sections during the 1993-94 school year.
A slumping state economy and rising inflation have been a painful combination for the university.
"It's impacting us every time we turn around," said Peter Isidro-Cloudas, a graduate student who is to join the board of trustees later this year. "Students feel they're paying more and more and getting less and less."
Michael Taylor, a student trustee from Hartford, said the board should do all it can to limit future tuition increases.
"We can't just assume students can continue to pay a 10 percent increase and another 10 percent increase," Mr. Taylor said. "Eventually the money is not going to be there."

HEADLINE: Beyond Budget Demagoguery

 BODY:
Anti-tax rhetoric poses a threat to common sense when Congressional conferees meet this week to begin the arduous task of reconciling the House and Senate budget bills.
Each bill would trim about $500 billion from projected deficits over the next five years primarily by cutting defense spending and raising taxes on families with taxable income over $100,000. But the House would tax and spend about $30 billion more than the Senate. 
 No matter how the conferees try to slice this difference, they risk losing Congressional approval because each budget bill passed by a razor-thin margin. Worse yet, a demagogic anti-tax campaign waged by the Republican National Committee is poisoning the atmosphere for compromise.
To hear Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, tell it, tax hikes wound the economy but spending cuts heal. Never mind that some economists say spending cuts hurt the economy more in the short run than do tax hikes. Or that in the long run, no one could measure the difference.
The Republicans, to measure the worth of a budget plan, have nevertheless seized upon the ratio of spending cuts to tax hikes. Their implication is that, if spending cuts don't at least equal tax hikes, the economy will suffer. Yet the ratio is arbitrarily measured -- much of what the G.O.P. calls spending cuts are really tax hikes. Even so, the scare tactics are taking their toll -- warping policy because the conferees are afraid to face voters in the face of Mr. Dole's attacks.
There are honorable ways to close the gap between liberal Democrats in the House, who are demanding higher taxes to pay for programs targeted at the poor and urban ghettos, and conservatives in the Senate, who want lower taxes and less spending. If the conferees artfully set an energy tax about halfway between the Senate and House bills, they can accommodate the liberals without running roughshod over the conservatives.
The House passed a $70 billion B.T.U. energy tax. But Senate Democrats from oil-producing states rejected that option in favor of a far smaller $20 billion tax on transportation fuels, primarily gasoline. To make up for the $50 billion in lost revenue, the Senate took money out of Medicare, urban enterprise zones, subsidies for low-paid workers, food stamps and other programs targeted at the poor. These are programs that the Black Caucus and other liberals in the House say must be included or else they will reject the budget plan.
One way out of the morass is to start with the Senate gas tax and raise another $20 billion through a small sales tax on electricity and home heating oil sold to consumers. That tax combination would be less painful than the B.T.U. tax because it would not fall on employers and would hit Americans across the country by about the same amount.
About $16 billion of the extra money so raised could reinstate the House's programs for the poor: tax credits for low-paid workers, food stamps, child immunizations and foster care. These programs are needed if Congress is to deliver on President Clinton's noble pledge to make work pay -- by making sure families with at least one full-time worker no longer live in poverty.
Another $4 billion could reinstate Mr. Clinton's proposal to create a small number of urban enterprise zones -- blighted areas where businesses would qualify for subsidies if they created jobs for residents. States have experimented with enterprise zones without notable success. But Mr. Clinton proposes to create what amounts to a small demonstration to see whether Federal zones could work better; the experiment is worth trying.
Not worth trying are the extra tax breaks for small businesses and real estate investors passed by the House. They amount to little more than a $10 billion giveaway.
These changes would skew the ratio of spending cuts to tax hikes toward the latter. But the true measure of a budget is not whether it meets a meaningless ratio; it is whether it provides for economic growth while caring for the poor. That goal is within the conferees' grasp.

HEADLINE: A Stealthy, Evasive Confession

 BODY:
When the White House was getting ready to fire all seven employees of its travel office, why was notice sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton and not her husband the President? And why, even after the public had learned how Clinton friends engineered the travel office flushout, did the staff feed President Clinton the discredited line that the firings were simply economy measures?
These are among many questions that remain unanswered after the White House release of what it styles as a "management review" of the travel office fiasco that unraveled in May. Thomas McLarty, the chief of staff, hoping to contain the scandal, calls his report "complete and thorough." 
 But his accounting is replete with the "mistakes were made" format of White House dodges of the past. The mistakes, the report insists, were simply bad judgment and inexperience, nothing venal. The report's confessions were delivered almost by stealth on July 2, presumably in hopes that anyone interested in its contents would be safely at the beach. In any event, more than mistakes were made: Misstatements were made and wrongs were committed.
The report commendably concludes that the travel office employees were cashiered without "sensitivity and decency," that assigning a Clinton cousin to replace them "fed the appearance of favoritism" in dishing out a White House perk, and that it was "not a good practice" to give Clinton friend Harry Thomason roaming privileges in the White House and not cut off his interventions for his business associates. But surely more than appearances were involved here. Mr. Clinton's friends and relatives abused their White House access to gain advantages for themselves or for their cronies.
The White House also acquits itself of anything much worse than bad appearances in the abuse of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The staff summoned an F.B.I. official to bolster insinuations that the travel office, instead of being reshuffled for friends, was under investigation for possible criminality. That maneuver, along with suggestions that the Internal Revenue Service might be called in, didn't just look bad. It was bad.
The White House management study says the First Lady inquired about the travel office and was sent a copy of a memo about the impending firings. No one seems to have asked the nature of her interest. The study also says that Bernard Nussbaum, the White House counsel, and two members of his legal staff attended that key meeting with the F.B.I. official. No one asked why Mr. Nussbaum, the in-house ethical watchdog, didn't intervene to stop the obvious pressure on the bureau to make the travel office look crooked as well as inefficient.
The management study concludes that it was wrong to tell reporters that the F.B.I. was probing for criminality but doesn't repent the rest of the White House tale: that the probe of the travel office began as a routine part of Vice President Al Gore's efficiency survey. President Clinton's staff kept giving him that line to sell to the public long after the public had rejected it.
Attorney General Janet Reno may not find criminal abuse of office when she reads this management review. But the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, however partisan his impulses, is on the right track to call for a Congressional look at this catalogue of mistakes and deception.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Globe-Trotting Clinton Faces Trip's Side Effects

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, Korea, July 10

 BODY:
If you are the President of the United States, traveling the world has its benefits. There are big planes to fly in, large crowds to cheer and police-escorted motorcades that whisk you through dizzying rush-hour traffic.
But there are side effects that even a President cannot avoid. For Mr. Clinton and the White House officials armed with briefing books and draft communiques, the chief enemy has been jet lag. Tokyo and Seoul are seven time zones away from San Francisco. 
 With Mr. Clinton, who has confessed that he makes his worst mistakes when he is overtired, the first few days of his trip to Asia were a fatigue test. But by Friday, when his advisers in Tokyo were still walking into walls after a week of virtually round-the-clock trade negotiations, the President declared he had conquered his weariness.
He spoke too soon. Today, after taping his weekly radio address in the wee hours and staying up even later, past 2 A.M., to work on a trade agreement with Japan, Mr. Clinton's eyes were puffy and his voice betrayed his exhaustion.
A portion of the radio address broadcast in error tonight in the traveling White House press room showed a punchy Mr. Clinton telling part of an incomprehensible joke into the open microphone, apparently about someone losing a job at a Bridgestone tire plant in Arkansas. Laughing, he was heard saying "It was funny as hell."
 
A Few Social Gaffes
 It is little wonder that the President was feeling silly when you consider his schedule today.
Mr. Clinton shuttled from a breakfast and news conference with President Boris N. Yeltsin to an announcement with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. By midafternoon he was in South Korea, where he met with President Kim Young Sam and appeared before reporters for the third time today.
By this evening, he and his wife, Hillary, were toasting their hosts at a state dinner at Blue House, the presidential residence.
A faux pas at the dinner might have been attributable to tiredness. Mr. Clinton referred to the First Lady of South Korea as "Mrs. Kim," The Associated Press reported, instead of using her own name, Sohn Myong Suk, or Mrs. Sohn, as is the custom here.
And, trying to correct some translating awkwardness earlier in the day, the President asked his translator to stand between him and President Kim, The A.P. added, a bit of logistics that the Koreans took as a slight, however unintentional, of their leader.
Aside from the protocol blunders, more evident to the Koreans than to the Americans, the dinner for 90 people appeared otherwise successful.
"All of you would agree that this room is full of warmth and friendship," President Kim told his guests.
Mr. and Mrs. Clinton are planning to meet their daughter, Chelsea, on Monday in Hawaii for a short family vacation. But even then, the two do not plan to rest immediately. Unable to resist the chance to shake another few hands, Mr. Clinton has scheduled a rally in Honolulu for Sunday afternoon.
 
Mrs. Clinton to Break Silence
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been the curiously quiet spouse during much of the Asia trip, is apparently going to break her silence almost as soon as she returns to American soil, at a health-care forum Tuesday in Hawaii.
Mrs. Clinton has been the model of a 1960's retro wife this week as she and her husband and mother have traveled in Asia. She is popular everywhere she goes, whether traveling by rail to a Buddhist temple or sitting and nodding as her husband delivers a speech.
As she has traveled, however, reporters have been explicitly warned to ask her no questions. When a few hardy souls tried, they received scarcely an acknowledgement.
No White House official will say why Mrs. Clinton has kept her profile so low, but they were chagrined earlier this week when Mr. Clinton's reaction to a question about her upstaged a weighty speech the President had just delivered.
And when the President was asked point blank whether his wife was being kept under wraps as he worked to establish his reputation on the world stage, he insisted that "she did what she wanted to do."
Could be. But while Mr. Clinton met with President Kim at Blue House today, Mrs. Clinton met with Mrs. Sohn, the President's wife. Local television showed her repeatedly smiling, waving and, at one point, walking several steps behind her husband.
And when she finally spoke, it was to say, "I'm having a wonderful time. I'm so pleased to be here with Mrs. Kim in this beautiful house."
 
Gergen's High Profile
 For a man who has claimed to be interested in keeping his head down, David R. Gergen, the Presidential counselor who was recruited with great spectacle to help get the White House on track, was certainly on track for overexposure.
Mr. Gergen was responsible for a dizzying amount of political spin this week. To hear him tell it, Mr. Clinton was responsible for every victory at the economic summit conference in Tokyo and was aware of no setbacks.
Day after day, he assembled groups of Administration officials to tell the hundreds of reporters working in a hotel ballroom in Tokyo how wonderfully the President was doing.
And minutes after the White House announced a successful conclusion to the trade talks with Japan, Mr. Gergen pulled reporters aside to tell them a story about how the Japanese negotiators had been so divided that they had resorted to fisticuffs in a hotel lobby.
Mr. Gergen's constant televised presence and gravelly voice shoved the usual spokesmen -- the press secretary Dee Dee Myers and the communications director Mark Gearan -- into the shadows.
On the theory that a good offense is the best defense, Mr. Gergen often leapt into his spin control at times when no one had any questions they particularly wanted answered.
As the President was preparing to hold a news conference that was broadcast live on some morning television news shows, Mr. Gergen scrambled to the lectern to "clear the decks." That is, he wanted to ferret out questions he hoped the President would not have to answer on the air. Unfortunately for him, the line of questioning turned to whether Mr. Clinton had made a decision on lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military. Mr. Gergen quickly cut off questioning and introduced another official to talk about aid to Russia instead.
But it is hard to take issue with a strategy that works. Mr. Clinton's visits to Tokyo and Seoul were generally well received both in Asia and in the newspaper and television reports of his visit that reached voters back home.
"Thank you," Mr. Gergen said at the end of one late-night briefing that dragged on much longer than was warranted by the information it contained. "I'll be back sooner than you'll probably appreciate."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL'S KING OF THE ROAD;
Jack Lazorko Doesn't Pitch Here Anymore

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCKWALL, Tex.

 BODY:
Maybe you've never heard of Jack Lazorko, the 37-year-old right-handed pitcher who is as compact as a tugboat and is called "Il Bulldog" in Italy, "El Bulldog" in Latin America and "Zork" in the States.
Maybe you've never seen him play, his dark brows over intense hazel eyes, armed with an assortment of pitches from forkballs to knuckle curves to sliders to fastballs that dip and fastballs that rise -- none of which will blow anyone away, as he describes it, but all of which are invariably around the plate and always carry a purpose. 
 While he is hardly a household name, fans in hundreds of the most unlikely towns around the world plus a legion of people in baseball -- from players to executives -- knows him, or of him. After all, he played for or with or against many of those in baseball. Maybe most of them.
"Sometimes," he said, "it feels like all of them."
Few baseball careers have been anything like Jack Lazorko's, who was born in Hoboken, N.J., and grew up in River Edge to the north, and who has called so many places home since then that, he says, he has single-handedly kept map makers in business.
Maybe you haven't followed his career for the past 16 years, as he played for nine major league organizations and 17 of their teams, and maybe a dozen more teams in the Caribbean and Mexico and South America and Europe. This year alone, he has worn the uniform of the Yankees (in spring training) and of the Norfolk Tides, the Mets' Class AAA team. When a call was made recently to the Tides' executive office, it was asked whether Jack Lazorko was there.
"Not anymore," came the reply. Gone after seven games.
It is, in a nutshell, the story of Jack Thomas Lazorko's baseball life.
"I've been released by more teams in more leagues in more countries and in more languages than anyone in the history of baseball," Lazorko said one day last week. "And I'm the only man to have been released by both the Mets and the Yankees in the same year -- within four months!" He shakes his head and smiles wryly. "Unbelievable."
Unbelievable because, as he said recently at his home here, "I always seem to be the 11th man on a 10-man pitching staff."
He is currently unemployed. Again. But that could change tomorrow. Or the next day. He is ready. He says he has learned to pack in 10 minutes, and that's for a six-month trip, if necessary. He asks two questions of his new team: "What color spikes do you wear?" And "what color sleeves?" He has in his closet piles of various colored baseball shoes and piles of sweatshirts. In his attic above the garage are several dozen suitcases, hanging bags and equipment bags. One day last May his wife and children drove into the garage, and the 7-year-old, Mitch, noticing that the foldable stairs to the attic had been pulled down, said, "Oh, Daddy's got a job."
"But this year might be the turning point, when I start to think of something else, a normal job, maybe like coaching," said Lazorko. "It's come to that."
Lazorko has played at all levels of amateur and professional baseball, from rookie league to the major leagues. He has played in the United States and Canada and Mexico and Latin America and Europe, for teams ranging from the El Paso Diablos to the Tulsa Drillers to the Phoenix Fire Birds to the Wichita Aeros to the Asheville Tourists to the Sun City Rays (in the Senior League) and on to, among others, the Calgary Cannons, Edmonton Trappers, Los Mochis (Mexico) Caneros, Santurce (P.R.) Crabbers, Valencia (Venezuela) Magallenes and Parma (Italy) Angels. Just recently he joined a team called the Hollywood Legends, which played and won a weeklong European tournament in Belgium.
Maybe you weren't aware of Jack Lazorko's brief pitching stints in the major leagues in parts of five years in the 1980's with Milwaukee, Seattle, Detroit and California (twice) as a spot starter, middle reliever and infrequent closer -- and that it took him three years to notch his first victory in the big leagues (he has five victories against eight losses, two saves and a 4.22 earned run average in 69 games.) The last time he appeared in the major leagues was in 1988, with the Angels.
Maybe you didn't see him pitching with his customary aggressiveness in the dead heat of Managua, Nicaragua, where he and his teammates were protected from antsy local fans by soldiers bearing machine guns, or hurling in the midnight sun in Skelleftea, Sweden, just a three-hour bus ride from the North Pole.
And maybe you haven't seen him throwing in recent days at a screen with a roped-off strike zone in his small backyard here, in this bedroom community just northeast of Dallas, hoping for one more chance at the big leagues, or Japan, or somewhere.
"Every year we say, 'This year, this year won't be crazy like the last one,' " said Brenda, his wife of 15 years. "And every year turns out to be crazy, like the last one, only more so."
"Every year we start out with a plan," Lazorko said. "We have Plan A, Plan B. . . . This year we're on Plan Double Z, and the summer has only just started."
"A lot of people think ball players have it made," said Brenda. "They don't realize that only a relative handful do. And they don't realize the stress involved. Jack has played for 16 one-year contracts. Every time he pitches, his livelihood is on the line. It's got to a point when I'm at a game where I hate to hear the organ play. I know Jack's coming into the game and my stomach starts to churn."
Brenda is a petite blonde with an even disposition, which she has needed, and with the inner strength of a tiger, something that has also been required.
 
2 Christmas Trees And One Suitcase
 "Oh, the times we've had," she said. "Like twice we've bought Christmas trees in places, once in Puerto Rico, once in the Dominican, and we've been sent somewhere else, and we had to sell the trees. Then there was the time we were on a road trip in Hawaii with the Edmonton team and Jack got the call to the big leagues for the first time, to go immediately to play for the Brewers in Baltimore. Well, we had one suitcase, and Jack took it. I had to buy another suitcase to get home with the kids."
Brenda Nanney and Jack Lazorko met when they were in college together at Mississippi State in 1978. He graduated that year with a degree in business administration. The next year Brenda, who got a degree in fashion merchandising, went to visit Jack in Sarasota, Fla., where he was playing in his second professional season.
"As soon as I got there, he was sold to Asheville," she said, speaking of his move from the Houston Astros organization to that of the Texas Rangers. "Right then I should have known."
In the first five or six years of their marriage, they moved 50 or 60 times. "Then we just started to lose count," she said. "It seems that every time I unpacked everything, we were traded or sold. It was like a bad omen. Even when we were in one place for a while -- like we were in Tulsa for a full year -- I still kept all my cosmetics in the bag."
This spring training Lazorko snared a tryout with the Yankees, after many appeals, including some to his former teammate at Mississippi State, Yankee Manager Buck Showalter. "Jack," said Showalter, "is a survivor."
Reggie Jackson came by the clubhouse and noticed the name taped to the locker. "This can't be the same Lazorko who pitched for Seattle years ago," he said. "Yeah, Reggie, that's me," said Lazorko, from behind Jackson. Lazorko was released by the Yankees in March.
 
'Hit the Road, Jack,' Again and Again
 In April, he sent letters and visited teams and called managers and general managers and player personnel directors nationwide and in foreign lands looking for a job. His phone bill for the month was $249. At the end of May he caught on with the Mets and was sent to pitch for the Norfolk Tides. After two games, he was released.
"I got belted a little in the first game, where I gave up two runs in two-thirds of an inning," he said, "but I was a little rusty, not having pitched in a game in two months. But Clint Hurdle, the manager, threw me in the next day and I gave up just one hit. The next thing I know, it's hit the road, Jack."
He is always so close, he feels. So close to reaching his dream of having a fulfilling career as a major league pitcher. This, he says, is more important even than the big bucks he would receive. He sees players he played with in the minor leagues, pitchers like Tom Henke and Ron Darling and Tom Candiotti, among others, making millions of dollars.
The most he ever made was $125,000, when he pitched for Edmonton on a major league contract. In contrast, in his early years in the minors, his first contract was for $500 a month in A ball, around $1,500 in AA ball, but as much as $15,000 a month in Class AAA. But in his lean years, "to make ends meet," he said, he had to pitch winter ball and, on the side, sell radio advertising, storm windows and meat from the back of a truck.
In recent years, though, he has earned a regular, if generally modest, living (especially when you factor the expenses for his peripatetic existence) for Brenda and their three children, 11-year-old Jake, 7-year-old Mitch and 3-year-old Nicky -- all of whom travel with him.
 
An M.V.P. in Italy
 The Lazorkos lived in Italy last season, renting a fourth-floor walk-up in Parma, where he made $90,000 and was named the most valuable player in the Italian League as well as in the championships, which Parma won. He pitched and won the last two games on the same day.
"Traveling the way we have, the kids have got an education you wouldn't believe," said Brenda.
Back in Texas, where Brenda was raised and where, Lazorko said, one can conveniently catch nonstop flights to almost anywhere in the world, the Lazorkos live in a nicely appointed two-story brick house on a street appropriately named "Meandering Way."
Lazorko has been careful with the money he has earned, and has been able to buy the house as well as keep up a college fund for his children. "And we've managed to save some -- not a lot," said Lazorko. "But I'm going to have to find a job soon. These kids drink a lot of milk."
 
Pitching His Talents
 So Lazorko was on the telephone trying to sell himself and his pitching arm to a rather reluctant clientele.
"Oh, he's not in?" said Lazorko, in the kitchen, the American League Red Book and the National League Green Book, loaded with team phone numbers, on the table before him. "Well, could you tell him Jack Lazorko called? Would he mind calling me back? He'll know what it's about it. Thank you."
Lazorko shrugs, checks another number.
"We want to go with younger guys," he hears from some people he calls. Or: "We're full right now." Or: "We don't have any spots open." Or: "I'll take your number and I'll call if somebody goes down."
That's exactly why the Mets called in May. "To be brutally honest, we just needed an arm," said Gerry Hunsicker, the Mets' director of player personnel. "Some guys went down with injury, we had a few other things happen, and Jack had been calling me, so I told him, 'O.K., but it might not be for very long.'
"Jack's a good guy to have on a ball club. He gives you everything he's got. I knew him when he was in college. I coached against him, when I was at Florida International University. That was 20 years ago. I remember him as a kid with a strong arm. A pretty good-looking pitcher with above average fastball and definitely major league potential.
"But the realities now are that we got kids we're developing. Kids with a future ahead."
Said Buck Showalter: "At this stage for Jack, he needs pinpoint location where he can throw the breaking ball for strikes at will, and he just has to be a cut above the others. I like Jack, and I've always loved his attitude. But I felt his stuff came up just a little short."
Lazorko said: "If I get lit up whenever I go out there, that's one thing. Then I know it would be time to hang 'em up. But that doesn't happen. I keep guys in the ball park, I keep runners on base, and I'm one of the best fielding pitchers in the game."
Brenda does not discourage her husband in his pursuit. And the kids, apparently, have not suffered. Jack tutored them in Italy, and Jake spent his ninth birthday climbing the Matterhorn with his folks and his 10th birthday climbing one of the pyramids in Egypt, until a security guard told him it wasn't allowed.
"Everyone has his level of frustration," said Lazorko. "Some guys who play 15 years in the big leagues are frustrated that they haven't made the Hall of Fame. Some guys who played 10 years never got in a World Series. We had a great college team and eight guys were drafted by big league teams, but only one of us ever made the Show. How do you think those other guys felt? And me? I still love the challenge of setting up the batters, and getting them out."
But something else gnaws at him. "I just want a little more, just to prove that I was a real, contributing big-league player, and not a fringe guy."
 
Between Jobs, Still Pursuing the Dream
 It is nighttime, and warm. The black Texas sky is sugared with stars. Crickets are in harmony. Jack Lazorko has switched on the garage lights and they throw a gentle glow on his backyard.
Diagonally, the yard, from the corner of where the red-brick garage meets the house, to the now-shadowed gray picket fence and the roses that line it, is just a little more than 60 feet 6 inches, the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate.
At the far end is the screen, a backstop, and just below the roped strike zone is a large netted bag that catches most of the balls that he throws. "What's great about this is that I can keep my arm in shape, and don't need a catcher," said Lazorko.
He is wearing a dark-blue Yankee T-shirt and gray Yankee shorts and rubber-soled cleats. He is standing on the concrete walk in the corner, where he has placed a pitching slab. Behind him is his living room, and through a picture window his wife can be seen sitting in a leather chair watching television. A leather bag of some 125 baseballs lies on the patio table near him.
He begins to throw, slowly at first, stretching his stocky body. Then he begins to throw harder, testing his assortment of pitches, almost but not quite skinning his knuckles on the bricks of the garage wall.
This is his routine when he is, as he says, "between jobs." He pitches to batters in his imagination, batters he is familiar with, like most of the lineup of, say, the Oakland A's, whom he had been watching earlier on television. And he throws in what he calls "situations." "Otherwise," he said, "you're just throwing and not thinking."
He's pitching now to Rickey Henderson with a man on, and going inside with a fastball and low and away with his slider. Next, Mark McGwire is up. Lazorko throws a curve. "Uh, oh," he said, "I hung that one. Home run." And he grunts. He is sweating now, plucking up one ball, deciding what to pitch, and letting go. This is work. This is pleasure. This is Jack Lazorko's life.
"If I were called up, I could pitch tomorrow," he said, breathing deeply after throwing a high hard one. "Tomorrow."
He took another ball from his bag, and looked down to get the sign, with, maybe, Ruben Sierra at bat in his mind's eye.
"I just need the opportunity, is all," he said. He wound up and threw. The ball thumped against the shadowed screen -- for a strike.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Athletics and Twins Playing Their Way Into a Strange Situation

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The two teams that between them have won the American League West championship the past six seasons reach the All-Star Game break occupying the last two spots in the division standing. Their location, however, does not exclude them from the race that will ensue after the break.
That development, bizarre though it may be for the Oakland Athletics and the Minnesota Twins, can be viewed from different perspectives. For the Athletics, for example, their status as a possible contender creates a dilemma of economic proportion. 
 As the general manager of another American League club put it, if the Athletics were as far out of the race as a sixth-place team should be, they could begin lowering their $36 million payroll by trading some of the high-priced players they are prepared to play without. Rickey Henderson, for example. But they can't very well concede at this stage.
 
'Worst-Case Situation'
 "They have a payroll the market can't sustain," the general manager said. "If they were out of the race, making some moves would be more understandable. But now they're handcuffed. And they're not drawing. They're in a worst-case situation. It's like being in hell. They don't have an opportunity to do what's in their best interest."
Sandy Alderson, the Athletics' general manager, declined to look at his position from that perspective.
"That's the negative side of a more positive situation," he said. "I certainly am not sitting here wishing we were out of it so I could trade some players. We're happy to be back in the race. But we still have lots of room for improvement."
Economics aside, Alderson put his team's and the Twins' status in perspective. Thanks to the inability of any of the other A.L. West members, particularly the Chicago White Sox, to pull away, the sixth and seventh-place teams remains close enough to challenge for the championship, but they have to play better than they have until now if they are to be serious contenders.
The Athletics, entering yesterday's games, were six games under .500, the Twins 11 under. Only two teams in the division, the White Sox and the Kansas City Royals, were over .500.
 
'Hard to Understand'
 "Through no fault of our own, we find ourselves still in the middle of the race," Andy MacPhail, the Twins' general manager, said, viewing his team's position realistically. "It's hard to understand. Two years ago, nobody was under .500 in the division. The nature of the game is more volatile than it has ever been, and our division is proof of that. Injuries or guys having off-years can make a major change."
In the Twins' case, the pitching staff is one of the major reasons they have fallen. Among the top three staffs in earned run average each of the past two seasons, the Twins have the league's only team e.r.a. over 5.00. The top two starters, Kevin Tapani and Scott Erickson, are the biggest culprits, each with an e.r.a. well over 5.00 and with a combined 8-20 record, compared with their collective 65-40 the past two seasons.
"To get back in the race requires only that our players play up to their accustomed level of peformance," MacPhail said. "It's not like we need a rookie to come up in the second half and win 14 games."
 
'Looking for Improvement'
 Alderson, too, called for improved performances from his veteran players.
"We're looking for improvement from within," the Athletics' executive said. "I think we can be better. We're going to see how well we perform through the month of July. Our starting pitching hasn't been consistently good. I think we can get more out of Bob Welch and Ron Darling. Our bullpen is rounding into shape. Some of our position players have been performing better."
A major factor in the Athletics' chances of recovering from a poor start will be the condition of Mark McGwire, who has played only 25 games and continues a nearly two-month stay on the disabled list with a tear in his left heel.
"It can take a few weeks to a few months to heal," Alderson said. "The cast is off. We're hoping he'll be ready by the end of the month, but that's speculative."
Neither general manager will trade his young players for veteran help for the second half.
"We could have traded Brent Gates and Craig Paquette," Alderson said of the Athletics' two rookie infielders. "We have similar players in the minors we could've traded, but we're not prepared to do that."
MacPhail, whose payroll is three-fourths of Alderson's, said: "There will be no shortage of opportunities and temptations to pick up high-salaried guys facing free agency this year or next at the cost of a couple of prospects. But what are you trying to accomplish?
"What really matters is winning the division. Whether you finish third or sixth really doesn't matter in the final analysis. To expend resources to upgrade your team from 70 wins to 80 makes no sense. You would be doing it only to take heat off you. It wouldn't make sense from the standpoint of money and young players."
 
Slashing Upward
 When St. Louis sliced Philadelphia's lead to five games Thursday night, it marked the Phillies' smallest margin over the second-place team in the National League East since May 22, a span of nearly seven weeks. The Cardinals slashed six and a half games off their deficit in 24 days.
On May 30, the Baltimore Orioles were in sixth place in the A.L. East, 10 1/2 games from first. A 26-11 record between then and yesterday catapulted the Orioles only two and a half games from the top spot.
With the exception of one day, the Mets have been 10 or more games behind the expansion Florida Marlins since June 17. The Marlins have maintained that kind of lead even though they went into last night's game with Atlanta with a seven-game losing streak. But now check out the other expansion team, the thought-to-be hapless Colorado Rockies. Their fourth consecutive victory Friday night boosted their record to six games better than the Mets' mark.
 
The Mets' Missing Three
 The Mets arrive at the All-Star break having failed to win three games in a row this season. The last team to display such ineptitude was the 1985 Pittsburgh Pirates, who won two in a row seven times before the break but couldn't win a third straight. The Mets have won two straight only four times.
The Pirates reached the break that season with a 29-56 record, in last place, 23 games from first. They finished 57-104, in last, 43 1/2 games behind. They did manage to win three in a row once, with two weeks left in the season, the third victory coming in 11 innings at the expense of the Mets, who were in a sprint for the division championship with St. Louis. The Pirates won two games of the three-game series, knocking the Mets from one game back to three, the Cardinals' eventual winning margin.
The Mets' futility is even worse than other teams that had the worst starts of recent seasons. Last year Kansas City lost 16 of its first 17 games but wound up winning three or more games in a row three times before the break. In 1988, Baltimore lost its first 21 games but managed to win three straight once, and Atlanta recorded a pair of three-game winning streaks after losing its first 10.
 
Home-Run Tales
 The Boston Red Sox, entering the weekend, had hit 25 home runs in their last 18 games. It took them 56 games to hit their previous 25 home runs (they had only 30 over all in their first 66 games). The Red Sox record in the 56 games was 23-33; it was 13-5 in the 18 games.
Brett Butler and Jose Offerman, 1-2 in the Los Angeles lineup, also are 1-2 in the race to have the most at-bats without a home run. Butler took his perfect record of 339 at-bats into yesterday's game with the Mets, while Offerman stood at 315. Two members of the top 10 dropped out of the race last week. Felix Fermin of Cleveland hit his first home run last Monday night on his 252d time at bat. The following night, Chuck Knoblauch of Minnesota succeeded on his 292d at-bat, the most attempts anyone has had this season before hitting a home run.
 
Henderson Feats
 Rickey Henderson is a special player, the best leadoff man in baseball history, so it should come as no surprise that he has created one of the most unusual statistics in history. Of his 211 career home runs, Henderson has hit 61, or a shade under 30 percent, leading off the first inning.
Adding a remarkable touch to an already remarkable record, Henderson led off the first inning of both games of a doubleheader against Cleveland last week with home runs. He hit the first against Paul Abbott, the second against Mark Clark.
Knowing Henderson's penchant for first-inning home runs, Abbott was asked, how does he approach the confrontation?
"I don't really prepare to pitch to him any different than I would to anybody," Abbott said before returning to the minor leagues. "I try to keep the ball down, throws strikes and not get behind, like with any good hitter."
What happened on No. 60?
"I got to a full count," the 25-year-old right-hander related. "I was ahead of him 0-2, then I threw three balls. Leading off the game, you don't want to walk him. I grooved a fastball, and he cranked it."
Having seen Henderson's act up close, what did Clark do wrong in the second game?
"I don't think he did anything wrong," Abbott said. "It was a good pitch. Rickey Henderson was just hot. He threw a good pitch, and Rickey cranked it."
And what would Abbott do differently the next time he meets Henderson in the first?
"I'd probably try not to get to 3-2 on him," Abbott said. "You have to remember: He is Rickey Henderson."

HEADLINE: For Business Lobbyists in Albany, Little to Cheer About

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 9

 BODY:
The anger in the terse, two-sentence news release was palpable.
"To the Governor and the Senate, thank you for your efforts to improve New York's dismal economy," it read. "To the Assembly, thanks for nothing." 
 The statement, issued Thursday, by the Business Council of New York State, a lobbying group, seemed to sum up the attitudes of the business community about the losses it sustained in the waning hours of the 1993 legislative session, which sputtered out Thursday morning after a full night of lawmaking.
Several bills supported by business groups that had been proposed earlier in the session never made it out of the Legislature. Indeed, virtually the only sector of the business community that had something good to say about the closing days of the session was the real-estate industry, which lobbied successfully for a measure limiting rent stabilization and then helped kill bills that would have raised wages at private construction sites and regulate workers who remove lead paint.
Over all, business lobbyists were bemoaning Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's failure to win approval of bills he proposed that would have held down employers' costs for workers' compensation insurance and would have curbed product liability lawsuits.
In addition, the Assembly and Senate could not reach agreement on other legislation that business groups had supported, including bills to permit privately owned businesses and partnerships to organize as limited liability companies and to restrict lawsuits filed by stockholders.
 
'A Big Goose Egg'
 "It was a big goose egg for the business community," said Mark P. Alesse, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group for small companies. "It's shocking in light of the condition of the economy."
Governor Cuomo had proposed a measure that would allow large employers to contract with health maintenance organizations, among other providers of managed care, to treat their employees' work-related injuries, rather than allowing employees to chose their own providers. Employers favored the proposal as a way to cut costs, particularly because the New York Compensation Insurance Rating Board has asked state regulators for an 18.7 percent increase in the workers' compensation premiums paid by businesses. The State Insurance Department is expected to rule on the rate request next week.
But unions, in particular the A.F.L.-C.I.O., opposed the bill, saying it went too far too fast and was not in the best interests of injured workers. The measure passed the Republican-led Senate, which traditionally supports the business community, but it was not acted on in the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
Another proposal by the Governor would have placed some curbs on product liability lawsuits. Manufacturers have contended that the lack of constraints on such suits is driving up costs, particularly on liability insurance. But the plan was opposed by trial lawyers, among others. Neither house brought the bill to a vote.
 
Special Companies Sought
 The Senate and Assembly were also unable to agree on two other measures that business groups have pushed, without success, in recent years. The first would have created limited liability companies, hybrid entities in which partnerships and family businesses are treated like corporations, with the insulation of the assets of individuals who make up the company or partnership. Such special companies are permitted in dozens of other states, prompting the fear that businesses barred from forming them will move elsewhere.
As an incentive to lure businesses from other states, the Senate bill would have exempted such companies from some taxes. But the Assembly bill would not have exempted the companies from all the taxes the Senate proposed, because, sponsors argued, the state stood to lose significant tax revenue if corporations transformed themselves into the new limited liability companies.
The second measure that the Senate and Assembly were unable to agree on was a measure that could have curtailed shareholder derivative actions, in which investors sue a company's individual directors because they are displeased with the company's handling of an issue. The business community has argued that such suits are often meritless and extremely costly.
 
Real-Estate Gains
 Thanks in part to strong lobbying, the housing and construction industries fared better than the business community as a whole. Apartment building owners in New York City and surrounding counties, for example, won what they considered a moral victory when rent limitations were removed from the wealthiest tenants in the most expensive apartments.
Landlords clashed with the environmental lobby on a measure that would have established training standards for workers who remove lead paint from buildings.
Real-estate lobbyists contended that such a program, which would have included licensing and certification of workers, would have driven up costs, unnecessarily burdening smaller owners. Environmentalists countered that the measure, by setting guidelines for safe lead removal, would protect the health of children.
The bill was passed by the Assembly but was not voted on in the Senate. A second bill, which would have imposed strict constraints on the removal of lead paint from bridges and other large municipal structures, also died in the Senate.
In other action, the construction industry had strongly opposed a measure that would have required contractors to pay "prevailing" wages -- union rates -- on private projects awarded public funds, such as loans from industrial development agencies. The bill passed the Senate but was not voted on in the Assembly.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 15, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the reaction of business lobbyists to the 1993 legislative session in Albany referred imprecisely to the position of people in the construction industry on a bill that would have required contractors to pay union rates on private projects awarded public money. While construction companies generally oppose the measure, construction unions generally support it.

HEADLINE: Boards Protect Shareholders, Right?

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
LEONARD TOW was in many ways an ideal choice for the board of the Citizens Utilities Company, a consistently profitable business based here. An impressive career in the cable-television business made him one of the world's wealthiest businessmen. He knows important people. He thinks big. To his fans, no one better understands the jumble of changes transforming the communications business.
But once he joined the board in 1989, Mr. Tow quickly began to act less like a mere director and more like a man who wouldn't mind running the company. Soon he was. The way he reached the top and what he has done since then are a good study for the current debate about whether boards of directors are always up to their sole task: to protect shareholders. 
 After Mr. Tow joined the board, holdover directors were offered a variety of opportunities to increase their compensation, and directors who left the board were replaced by longtime associates of Mr. Tow. In the process, his critics say, Mr. Tow effectively gained control of the company without paying public shareholders a penny and without triggering the scrutiny of government regulators who typically examine changes of control at utilities.
Soon the board elected Mr. Tow as chairman, and he found it easy to win board approval for a pay package worth millions of dollars more than that of any other utility executive in the nation. He also found little resistance when he proposed deals that tended to shift costs to Citizens, a cash-rich company in which he has a negligible stake, and shift fees to Century Communications, a cash-poor company in which he owns a big stake.
In addition to Mr. Tow, Citizens' 11-person board now includes Mr. Tow's wife, Claire, and four directors who have financial ties to the company above and beyond the fees directors customarily receive for serving as the shareholders' watchdog. The smorgasbord includes bargain-priced stock options, and fees for legal, consulting and advisory work.
At least one arrangement, involving a 77-year-old director whom Mr. Tow's predecessor had tried to remove, was not disclosed to Citizens' shareholders. In that instance, Mr. Tow let the director stay put, placed him on several important committees that lifted his pay, and granted penny-a-share options that produced a quick $123,000 paper profit. Unbeknownst to Citizens' shareholders, he also appointed the director to the board of Executive Re, an insurance concern in which Citizens was a founding investor. That pays $12,000 a year in cash plus $12,000 in stock whose value could soar if the company, as expected, goes public.
Should the Rules Be Changed?
Many companies have directors who serve the business in ways other than their board seat. But Citizens stands out for the number of such instances, raising questions about whether the board is sufficiently conflict-free to step up when tough calls must be made.
Directors are the linchpins of the corporate governance system. But current standards -- a threadbare patchwork of state laws and listing requirements by the various stock exchanges -- allow companies to nominate directors who have financial arrangements, business dealings or personal relationships with the managers they are supposed to monitor.
Paying board members substantial sums beyond their directors' fees "is what the average person would call theft, but what passes for accepted practice in the modern corporate board room in far too many situations," said Gregg A. Jarrell, a former chief economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission who teaches at the Simon School of business in Rochester.
If the Citizens directors "are embarrassed, they have reason to be," said Joseph A. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. commissioner who teaches at Stanford law school. "To be polite, this board will not be a case studyof how a modern corporation should be governed."
Asked in interviews about the many ways he and his directors are paid, Mr. Tow bristled and said, "We're all grossly underpaid for all the guff we get for it." Of his board, he said, "It's beholden to nobody."
Mr. Tow admitted that neglecting to mention in the annual proxy statement that he had put forward the director for the Executive Re board was a "fault -- we'll correct it."
Some people shrug about Citizens' situation, arguing that coziness in the nation's boardrooms is endemic and hard to prevent.
But others, like the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington group of pension funds, say that outside directors should have no links to the companies they govern other than their board seats. "What that means is the person has never worked at the company, is not related to someone who has worked at that company, and does not provide services to that company like a lawyer or vendor might," said Anne S. Hansen, deputy director of the council. Her organization's tests for outside directors would disqualify at least four of the 10 people who serve with Mr. Tow on Citizens' board and all but one of the nine members of Century's board.
Citizens Utilities shareholders have filed three separate suits against Citizens' directors in recent weeks over the manner in which Mr. Tow gained control of the company, which they view as clandestine; over Mr. Tow's pay, which they consider excessive, and over disclosure documents they think are incomplete.
The California Public Employees Retirement System, which owns 381,000 Citizens shares and is considering joining one of the suits, recently sent the company's directors a scorching letter, comparing them to "pigs at the trough" for having allowed Mr. Tow such free rein.
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, plans hearings this fall on the adequacy of the modern board, and the panel is interested in Citizens.
Some longtime Citizens shareholders are particularly disturbed. "This may be the American way of doing business," said Thomas King, whose family has owned shares since the 1940's, "but this hasn't been the history of this company."
 
The Citizens Story
 For much of its 57-year history, Citizens Utilities was Richard L. Rosenthal. A Depression-era boy wonder who attended New York University on scholarship, he waged and won a 1946 proxy fight for what was then a shaky company in the electric, telephone, gas and water business. It was the start of a 43-year reign. Through acquisitions, Mr. Rosenthal transformed the business from the "mighty midget" that Forbes magazine called it in 1955 into a hefty company with about $340 million in revenues and the highest of debt ratings when he left. Investors who stuck with him until his retirement in 1989 enjoyed a 17 percent compounded annual return, and many became millionaires.
Today, Citizens Utilities, with 1992 earnings of $115 million on revenues of $589 million, provides electric, gas, telecommunications, water and wastewater services to more than 800,000 customers in 13 states, most west of the Rockies or in the Midwest.
 
The Leonard Tow Story
 Leonard Tow, now 65 years old, entered the scene in 1989. The son of Russian immigrants whose last name is derived from the Hebrew word for "good," he grew up in Brooklyn. He earned his doctoral degree in economic geography in 1960 from Columbia University, traveled to southern Africa to research the region's potential for economic development, and flirted with academia until he decided that universities had "too many people fighting over tiny anthills."
His quest for a more rewarding career led him to a job at the Teleprompter Corporation, a cable company, and he rose to the No. 3 job there. The company ran into trouble when his former boss, Irving Kahn, was convicted in 1971 of bribing city officials of Johnstown, Pa., to win a franchise. Mr. Tow left to start his own cable venture in 1973.
Century, the company he started, became a way for Mr. Tow to take television, as he put it, to the "television deprived." The company went public in 1986 at $3 a share, adjusting for splits, and three years later Mr. Tow's stake hit $315 million and higher, landing him on Forbes's list of the world's 400 richest people. (Now that Washington is reregulating the cable business, Century's shares are trading at $7.50, well below their 1989 peak of $13, and Mr. Tow's stake is worth $280 million or so.)
Mr. Tow's entree to Citizens Utilities came through Drexel Burnham Lambert, the now-defunct investment firm, which was marketing a 2 percent stake that belonged to Mr. Rosenthal and two board members.
The asking price was high. But this was no ordinary opportunity: this was the single biggest chunk of stock in the company. One Rosenthal confidant who asked not to be identified said that Mr. Rosenthal hinted that the buyer could expect to assume his place on the board and replace enough departing members so that 2 percent would yield control. (Mr. Rosenthal declined to comment for this article.)
While Mr. Tow sought representation on the Citizens board, he denies that he was promised or expected control. He remembers thinking that here was a chance for a tried-and-true cable veteran to learn more about the telephone business and spot opportunities where the two companies could collaborate. And who better to rouse Citizens, which had not made a major acquisition in years, than a proven dealmaker?
For his investment, Mr. Tow received two board seats; a month later, his candidates for two new openings were accepted. He also gained considerable power when he took a seat on the executive committee, which oversees the company between board meetings.
When Mr. Rosenthal commanded $48 million from Century for his group's shares of Citizens, 27 percent above the market price, shareholders were miffed at having been left out.
Citizens' board didn't take well to Mr. Tow either, at least at first. A former Citizens officer who asked not to be identified said that John L. Schroeder, one of three directors whom Mr. Tow inherited from the existing board, fought Mr. Tow's first attempt to be named chief executive in 1989 -- one year before his actual appointment. Mr. Schroeder, a veteran money manager, did not return calls for this article. But the former officer said Mr. Schroeder feared that handing over the reins to Mr. Tow and Century could constitute a change in control and subject the business to burdensome regulations.
The board also sided with Hampton D. Graham, the chief financial officer in early 1990, when Mr. Tow proposed teaming Citizens and Century to bid on some cellular-telephone properties. The board members agreed with Mr. Graham that the proposal was unfair to Citizens, and the terms were significantly altered when a similar deal was introduced a year later.
 
Changes at the Board
 With Mr. Rosenthal gone in 1989, his longtime No. 2, Ishier Jacobson, acted as chairman of Citizens. But once he had negotiated a $5.3 million severance package with Mr. Tow's support, Mr. Jacobson announced his retirement, effective July 1990, from the executive ranks and from what was at that time an eight-man board. Suddenly, with only seven directors left, Mr. Tow was in the catbird seat. He had introduced three of the other six directors to the company, and at least two of the holdovers were warming to him. That month he was named Citizens' chief executive and chairman.
Among the holdovers was Norman I. Botwinik, the 77-year-old director who avoided being pushed off the board and was granted, among other things, the profitable options. Another was Andrew N. Heine, a lawyer, received $51,705 for advising Citizens on its 1989 acquisition of Louisiana General, a gas company, and options in a cellular-phone subsidiary that yielded the same $123,000 paper profit that Mr. Botwinik received. (Mr. Heine and Mr. Botwinik were granted the options for serving on a board committee.)
Mr. Schroeder remains the only board holdover who has no apparent attachments to the company beyond his directorial duties.
The board newcomers whom Mr. Tow had a hand in bringing aboard in 1989 included Robert D. Siff, a commercial banker who is also on Century's board and who received $261,400 in consulting fees from Citizens in 1990 and $258,800 in 1991. Another was Aaron I. Fleischman, who has done an undisclosed amount of legal work for Citizens and Century.
Last year, Citizens expanded its board to 10 members. And in May it was expanded again. Mr. Tow's wife joined, a decision Mr. Tow said he was not behind. "They wanted a woman," he said.
Eric Roth, a lawyer for Citizens' directors (except the Tows), said his clients would have no comment because of the pending litigation. But one new director, Stanley Harfenist, commented anyway: "There's no one on the board who's going to roll over for Leonard Tow," he said, describing his colleagues as wealthy people. "They don't roll over for anybody."
Mr. Tow chased off some executives who challenged him. One who left in October 1991 was Mr. Graham, the chief financial officer whose outspokenness had given him trouble the previous year. Mr. Graham declined comment. Mr. Tow chose to act as his own chief financial officer rather than hire a new one.
 
The Pay Package
 Citizens' newly constituted board approved for Mr. Tow an employment contract that entitled him to $800,000 a year in base salary with automatic cost-of-living increases, a $50,000 expense allowance, a $3 million life insurance policy and an annual pension equal to two-thirds of his best 12 months' compensation. On top of the guaranteed payments, the Citizens board last year approved for Mr. Tow a $330,000 cash bonus, $7 million of restricted stock and $10.4 million of options above and beyond the guaranteed sums. Recently it has also changed the company's former policy to allow him to collect $33,500 to serve on his own board.
One outside compensation expert, Graef Crystal, valued Mr. Tow's 1992 pay package at $21 million last year, eight times the compensation of the next-highest utility executive in his survey and higher than that of all 17 of Mr. Tow's counterparts combined.
Mr. Tow also succeeded in winning board approval for deals that tended to shift fees to Century and costs to Citizens. In two joint ventures between the companies, one involving cellular-phone properties and the other cable-television systems, Century is assured of management fees.
In another instance, Citizens used $12 million of its own cash to buy Century shares from a company close to Mr. Tow; in its public filings, Citizens has never identified the seller: Sentry Insurance, his partner when he founded Century.
"It is an incestuous relationship," said Merle Thorpe Jr., a Washington lawyer and longtime Citizens investor who is suing the company, upon learning the seller's identity. "It is a transaction I would not let any client engage in without making disclosure."
Mr. Tow disputes that the transactions are anything but proper, citing as an example three fairness opinions Century and Citizens got from investment bankers when they merged their cellular-telephone properties. "Every inter-relationship between these companies is handled the same way," he said. "We've been exceedingly careful to not cross lines and stay away from situations that might cause us headaches."
Mr. Tow was also asked about other instances where Citizens and Century appeared less than upfront with shareholders about relevant facts -- for example, that Century expects to be paid management fees in the cable-television venture with Citizens. He said there was no need to report the fees until a contract was signed.
The two companies' affairs are so tangled at this point that some employees of Citizens are not quite sure when Mr. Tow, his wife and other shared personnel are working for one company or the other. And they are still buzzing about the proud day last year when Citizens Utilities began trading on the New York Stock Exchange: more Century people than Citizens people turned out on the floor of the Big Board for the event.
To be sure, Citizens shareholders have fared well during Mr. Tow's three years at the top. Citizens' stock has climbed 20.2 percent compounded annually in those years, versus 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500. Looking aggressively for acquisitions, Citizens has bought two gas companies and has pursued deals that tilt the company toward the fast-growing telecommunications business, including a tentative agreement to buy many of GTE's rural telephone properties for $1.1 billion.
But Mr. Jarrell of the Simon School, for one, is not impressed. "The most egregious cases of self-dealing and boards of directors asleep at the switch almost uniformly come at companies that are performing well," he said, "because those are the conditions where boards of directors will justify what otherwise would be considered shady practices."
What most worries Citizens' shareholders, rating agencies and employees these days is a fear that Mr. Tow really wants Citizens to buy his other company, Century, at a premium price -- something Mr. Tow vigorously denies. Of course, Citizens' board would have something to say about that. Then again. . . .
 
Mr. Tow's Other Dealings
 IF the board of Citizens Utilities had wanted a hint of what to expect from letting Leonard Tow come aboard, its members simply had to look at Century Communications, the company he founded 20 years ago and continues to run. There, he helped himself to millions of dollars of interest-free loans; put his wife, Claire, and son Andrew on the board, and bought from and sold to Century millions of dollars worth of properties.
December 1986 was a busy month for such deals. Mr. and Mrs. Tow sold to Century for $18 million a cable television system that they had acquired three years earlier for $3.7 million. (Mr. Tow says he could have gotten $25 million.) That month, Century also paid the Tows $7.7 million to buy back two radio stations it had been forced to divest two years earlier. The couple had bought the stations with a $3 million promissary note. (Mr. Tow says he "bent over backwards" to reach a fair price.)
Now, Mrs. Tow is selling Century a recently acquired license to operate a Kentucky radio station for what the proxy says is her cost: $450,000. According to her husband, the Government favors women and minorities in the granting of licenses, and never would have given Century the license.
Nearly always, when one of these "related party" transactions has to be disclosed, the company explains that "a majority of the company's disinterested and independent directors" approved it. But it's difficult to figure out exactly who the independent directors are at Century.
For starters, there are Leonard, Claire and Andrew Tow, all of whom work for the company. (Claire heads human resources; Andrew, 33, runs the cable company.)
Then there is David Z. Rosensweig, Mr. Tow's personal attorney, who negotiated his employment agreements at Citizens and Century, even as his law firm has grossed nearly $5 million in fees since 1986 as Century's general counsel. Now, he is one-half of Century's compensation committee.
There is Robert D. Siff, a banker who helped Mr. Tow when he was at Teleprompter and whose Citibank connections helped put Century on the map. Mr. Tow brought him to the Citizens board in 1989 to represent Century's 2 percent stake. Mr. Siff soon had a consulting deal with Citizens that put more than $500,000 in his pocket in two years.
Next come Peter J. Solomon, an investment banker who was to be paid a $25,000 advisory fee, according to the 1991 proxy, and William M. Kraus, who is described in Century's filings simply as a publisher with experience in state government. In fact, he is the former executive of Sentry Insurance who persuaded his company to bankroll Century in 1973. And though it is not disclosed in recent proxies, Mr. Kraus is also paid by Century to handle investor relations.
Mr. Tow said in an interview that he was not sure to whom the passages on "disinterested and independent directors" referred, except for Mr. Solomon. He went on to say that all his board members were independent, later allowing that he, his wife and son might not be.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on July 11 with an article about whether boards of diqrectors protect the interests of shareholders misstated the date of payments by the Citizens Utilities Company of $520,200 in consulting fees to a director, Robert D. Siff. The fees were paid in 1990 and 1991, not last year.

HEADLINE: Your Own Account;
Learning the Lessons of a Layoff

SERIES: First of two articles on losing a job.

BYLINE: By Mary Rowland
CONSULTANTS are beginning to worry that many people thrown out of work by a decade of corporate change will never find jobs again, a class of people who are "terminally unemployable."
If you have been out of work for months -- or even years -- and you are waiting for economic recovery to put things right again, you are almost certain to be disappointed. The recession only masked changes in the economy that have eliminated forever whole categories of jobs.

 BODY:
 Even when the economy picks up steam, many companies that reduced their work forces will continue to "downsize" to become more competitive. "There is a whole group of people who cannot expect to insert themselves back into Corporate America, because there is no place for them," said Sharon Coleman, a psychotherapist and management consultant in New York.
Perhaps you were told that it was not your fault when you were laid off, that the layoffs were unrelated to your job performance. That was not necessarily a favor if it kept you from making the changes you must make to become employable again.
"Some years ago, a lot of downsizing was done based on seniority," said John J. Parkington, director of organization research and development in the San Francisco office of the Wyatt Company, a benefits consultant. "That's pretty rare now. Now they try to ferret out people who are less productive."
As American companies change to become more competitive in a global economy, those who do not understand the new structure -- or fit in -- are let go. "A layoff is related to a person's job performance," Ms. Coleman said. "The person who is cut is not as good a fit for the job."
If you are one of them, you must make some changes of your own, to your expectations and your skills. Losing a job is often just a piece in the larger puzzle of a life askew, said Nancy Hutchens, a human resources consultant in Ossining, N.Y., who works with large corporations to help identify departing employees who need special help.
An employee who is going through a divorce, a crisis with an aging parent, a shift in personal values or some other type of transition may not focus on work. And he or she may not notice how the work place is changing and what must be done to change with it. A layoff should be "a very strong message that the way you are doing things isn't working," Ms. Hutchens said.
Looking desperately for another job just to put bread on the table is not a long-term solution. Without an understanding of what went wrong -- and what it takes to survive in the new environment -- you may well fail again.
A survey by Battalia Winston International, a New York executive recruiter, provides some evidence of this. Battalia Winston receives 700 to 1,000 resumes a month. In May, the company decided to analyze the job histories of those who were looking for work and found most candidates had bounced from job to job for several years.
"One of the frightening statistics we found was that an enormous percentage of people had spent a long time at a company, perhaps 10 years or more, and then they'd had five jobs in a row lasting no more than a year or so," said Dale Winston, the company president. In fact, 55 percent of the job candidates fell into that category, Ms. Winston said.
This indicates that these people do not understand how the workplace has changed. They are laid off from one job, race out to find another and get laid off again. "I've seen people go right back to the same thing and fail again," said Ms. Coleman, the psychotherapist. "They will resist breaking out of that box and thinking in new ways."
If your industry is changing, you must be realistic about your chances of finding a position similar to the one you lost. "Too many people won't give up until they see their industry die," said Ms. Hutchens, the consultant. "People in publishing are a perfect example. They will not take a step to retrain themselves to do something different until they are told they don't have a job anymore."
Many of those who held high-paying positions have unrealistic expectations about what to expect in a job. "I run across a lot of folks who just have not taken a hard look in the mirror," said Craig E. Schneier, a management consultant in Princeton, N.J. "It's painful to see them barking up a tree that they have no chance of climbing."
Most companies are not looking for someone to manage people. They are looking for someone to make a contribution. "The key word today is individual contributor," Ms. Winston said. "No one today is paid to simply manage the activity of others. Companies cannot afford to do that."
Delineations between jobs are no longer clear. Titles are not important. Companies are looking for people who pitch in and do whatever is necessary. "You can't see work in terms of turf, but in terms of the job that needs to be done," Ms. Hutchens said. Many of those who are unsuccessful in today's workplace have not learned to work in that type of environment. "They don't deal with ambiguity well," Ms. Hutchens said. "Rather than seeing it as an opportunity they see it as a threat. They like things to be very clear. That is suicidal these days."
When you join a new company, observe carefully how things work. "You must go in and develop relationships that will enable you to become a part of that organization," Ms. Winston said. "You really have to figure out what drives that organization and its culture." For that reason, she often recommends that people make lateral moves.
 
'Retooling' Yourself for a New Job
 NO one is truly unemployable if they are willing to change their behavior, gain new skills and "retool" themselves for a new work environment.
"Anyone can be employed at something," said Jane King, a financial planner in Wellesley, Mass. "But many families have to come to grips with the fact that they will not have an income of $150,000 any more."
If you are still employed but see the writing on the wall, use your company's employee assistance program.
"Most of them provide both career counseling and personal counseling," said John J. Parkington, a consultant at the Wyatt Company in San Francisco.
There is much to be gained by taking control of the situation. "People can come out the other end of this process much better prepared to deal with life," said William P. Brittain, an industrial psychologist in New York. "The reason is that they have learned something about having control over career decisions. Once you've been through this, you'll never be scared of being fired again because you will know exactly what to do."

HEADLINE: Warehouse Club, County's First, to Open

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
AS the economy softens, interest heightens in warehouse purchasing clubs, which sell household goods and food products at wholesale prices to members. This Friday, Pace, the first membership warehouse in Westchester, is scheduled to open for business in Elmsford.
"We already have 3,000 business members and 1,000 household members signed up," said Greg Mowery, the director of the Pace warehouse, which is at 333 Saw Mill River Road, Route 9A. 
 The yearly membership fee for those joining the warehouse club before the opening is $25, he said, while those joining after the opening will pay $30 a year.
 
The Attraction: Price
 Business members, who make up 60 percent of the membership, are likely to be the owners of small retail stores, doctors, dentists and entrepreneurs, Mr. Mowery said. He said they would be able to buy merchandise for business resale and personal needs at the special hours of 9 A.M. to 11 A.M. daily.
"A local merchant, such as a mom-and-pop deli, is a typical business member," he said. "The attraction is price. Our wholesale price makes it easy on their pocketbooks because they are able to buy smaller quantities of products for resale than are available from other sources. An example: a dozen pounds of shortening can be had at the same wholesale price that they'd pay for a carload of the stuff elsewhere."
Individual householders who are club members can buy even smaller quantities, he said, like a package of two heads of lettuce or a package of three U.S. Choice steaks.
What else is available? Everything from fresh foods to fax machines, with brand-name items in over 250 product categories, Douglas Hock, a Pace spokesman, said.
"We have extremely low markups because our profits are derived almost entirely from membership fees, not markups on merchandise," he said. "We work on a markup of 8 to 9 percent compared with 25 percent markup for discounters and 40 percent for retailers."
 
An Untapped Market
 The cost of doing business in Westchester, together with the lack of available sites to build a warehouse, slowed the growth of warehouse clubs in the county, Mr. Hock said. "But now," he said, "with the recession and the economy in the doldrums, we feel the environment is right. Westchester, with its population density, is a huge untapped market. The demographics are good. We expect to generate $45 million in sales."
Pace, with headquarters in Englewood, Colo., operates 125 warehouses in 29 states and Puerto Rico. The company, which was founded in 1983, was acquired by Kmart Corporation in 1989 and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary.
Studies of the Westchester market began several years ago when Pace was approached by Martin S. Berger, president of the Robert Martin Company, a major developer in Elmsford.
"We had what we thought was a prime location for a warehouse club building, which was 13 acres of land on Route 9A in Elmsford," Mr. Berger said. The site was the old Elmsford drive-in theater, which had been vacant for 14 years and "was a real eyesore," he said.
 
One Union Objects
 "Pace, which is a regionally diverse warehouse club with stores as spread out as Alaska and Puerto Rico, was looking at new markets and we thought the demand for warehouse clubs was strong here so it would be a good fit," Mr. Berger said. Negotiations began between Robert Martin, Pace representatives and the Town of Greenburgh.
"The only hostility came from a union in Queens that represents supermarket employees," Mr. Berger recalled. "They sent people to attend every hearing. But almost everyone else -- Town of Greenburgh officials, construction unions, people in the neighborhood -- were in favor of the project."
Building the 110,000-square-foot warehouse building, which is the size of two large supermarkets, created more than 150 construction jobs, he said. "And that was at a time when construction in the county was absolutely flat."
The development will bring other substantial benefits to the area, Mr. Berger said, including revenues of approximately $250,000 a year in taxes.
"And 150 Westchesterites will find new jobs at Pace," he said. "People will have the opportunity to buy what they need at lower prices and what's more, improvement of the property, which has been an eyesore for years, will upgrade the 9A corridor and generate additional activity for local businesses."
When asked about the new competition local supermarkets will face, Mr. Berger said he did not think a warehouse club would put supermarkets out of business.
"Unlike the supermarkets, warehouse clubs stock only 50 percent of food products," he said. "People don't go to a warehouse club for a quart of milk. They go to stock up on such things as paper goods."
The economic downturn has spurred the growth of warehouse clubs nationally, Mr. Hock said.
"Our operation is based on the premise that today especially, more people are looking for the best bang for the buck, plus the convenience of one-stop shopping," he said. "We're the fourth-largest warehouse club company in the industry and our size gives us the ability to offer consumers about 4,000 items in 250 different product categories of merchandise under one roof.
"We sell bakery goods, but we also sell electronic equipment and automotive supplies. And we keep our overhead low and we don't do any mass media advertising, so we pass the savings on to members."
Pace, he said, is able to buy name-brand products in large quantities directly from manufacturers. In addition, the company carries some products under its own label.
The merchandise in the warehouse stores is geared to the business needs and way of life of the communities they serve, Mr. Mowery said. "What's popular in Alaska would bomb in Puerto Rico. Each warehouse carries a line of local products, which include ethnic and gourmet preferences."
 
$3 Million in Phone Business
 Other services are available to members, including optical departments, mail-order pharmacies, a film- developing-process service, and discounted long-distance telephone service from M.C.I.
"Pace members did $3 million of business with M.C.I. in the first quarter of the year," Mr. Mowery said.
Paul J. Feiner, Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh, said that the Pace warehouse will not only generate revenue for the Town of Greenburgh but will also give consumers an alternative shopping choice.
"There was some supermarket opposition but none of the supermarkets mounted a major campaign against the warehouse," Mr. Feiner said. "In tough times, warehouses offer a way to help people save money, and that's a good thing."

HEADLINE: Will the Zebra Mussels Invade L.I.?

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
A SMALL European freshwater mollusk, the zebra mussel, has invaded the lakes, rivers and streams of North America. Originally seen as a problem confined to the Great Lakes, the zebra mussels, so named for their dark brown stripes on a light tannish shell, have been found in the Hudson River, 25 miles from the Long Island Sound.
The mussels have not been sighted in Long Island waters and pose less of a threat to the region, because the Island is surrounded by saltwater. But marine experts are concerned about species of zebra mussels found in 1990 that tolerate saltwater and may be able to thrive in Long Island waters. 
 A 30-minute documentary produced by WLIW-TV and the New York Sea Grant Institute, "Zebra Mussels," to be broadcast on Channel 21 on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. and Saturday at 5:30 P.M., investigates the tiny pest and its potential problems for business, industry and government.
Their prolific reproduction makes them a major economic and environmental danger, said the writer and co-producer of the documentary, Avery Klauber of South Setauket. Each female can produce up to one million eggs, he said.
Mr. Klauber said he had been following the problem since the mussels were found in the Great Lakes in 1988. "There were indications that they were migrating south and that this would eventually become a problem for us in the New York area," he said. "But we had no idea how long it would take for them to move. They've moved faster than was expected, and this means that power systems will have to take cleanup and control measures, and the costs will indirectly have a ripple effect on every citizen."
Mr. Klauber said zebra mussels worried many people because they can attach themselves to anything hard with water flowing through it and clog intakes of power stations and water systems, river locks and boat engines. The mussels can disrupt industry, alter ecosystems and restrict recreational water, he said, adding that many freshwater beaches had become littered with stretches of dead and rotting mussels, which have sharp shells and a horrible odor.
"If left untouched, they can cost the country billions of dollars over the next decade," Mr. Klauber said.
A curator at the New York Aquarium, Dennis Thoney, said although zebra mussels had spread quickly through New York State, their threat was not as great on Long Island because they cannot travel too far in saltwater. Unless they are delivered on the Island by people, Mr. Thoney said, they have no way of going to Long Island.
 
Adaptability to Saltwater
 But the director, co-author and co-producer of the documentary, William Shine of East Northport, said new species of zebra mussels had been found that can survive in brackish water and may be able to survive and proliferate in saltwater.
In 1990 the mussels were spotted in the Hudson, and species were found that were able to tolerate brackish water and different temperatures. If those other species can adapt to saltwater, Mr. Shine said, then the Island will be in danger.
Zebra mussels, native to the Caspian Sea, were noticed in the United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit. Experts say they believe that the mussels arrived when ships traveling Europe through the St. Lawrence Seaway and dumped their ballast water. The mussels attached themselves to the hulls of commercial and recreational boats, navigational buoys, docks, ladders, plastic bottles and intake pipes.
Large numbers of the mussels spread from recreational boats used in one body of water and taken to another. They have also hitchhiked on aquatic plants, the feathers of migrating birds and ducks and animals' fur.
Knowing where the mussels have spread is vital to monitor where they are going, Mr. Klauber said. New York City, with the largest water system in the world, has a $16 million plan to avert a catastrophe.
The controls -- scraping the mussels, spraying them with high-pressure water, chemicals or heat -- are costly. In 1990 the Federal Government allocated $37 million to combat zebra mussels, but no state has a long-range plan, which is necessary to obtain matching funds from the Federal Government.
 
With $40,000 From N.O.A.A.
 The documentary was financed by a $40,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The film was shot in the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River and other waterways in seven states. The documentary focuses on Monroe, Mich., whose 40,000 residents lost their water supply for two days, because of an infestation of zebra mussels.
Most people, Mr. Shine said, have never heard of zebra mussels and do not realize the potential problems. The biggest concern for the New York region, he added, is to keep the mussels out of upstate reservoirs.
"So much about zebra mussels is still a mystery," he said. "But it's no mystery that the financial burden of the cleanup will fall on everyone nationwide. We need to coordinate our efforts with advanced planning and monitoring, because the zebra mussels are heading our way."

HEADLINE: Shades of Lincoln-Douglas: Spano vs. Brodsky

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: OSSINING

 BODY:
INVOKING the spirit of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, which took place in parks in Illinois during the summer of 1858, the Westchester chapter of the League of Women Voters last week sponsored an Independence Day dialogue between two Democratic primary candidates for County Executive.
Before the holiday concert and traditional July Fourth fireworks at Louis Engel Waterfront Park here, County Clerk Andrew J. Spano and State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who represents the 86th District, sparred on issues involving the environment, housing and property reassessment -- at times, generating their own fireworks display. 
 Mr. Spano, County Clerk since 1980, was chosen in May by the party organization to challenge County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, a four-term Republican seeking re-election. Mr. Brodsky, a former member of the County Board of Legislators and six-term State Assemblyman, was the Democrats' choice four years ago to run against the incumbent, but he lost in a relatively close race, 52 percent to 48 percent, to Mr. O'Rourke.
Mr. Spano -- who also sought the party's nomination in 1989 to challenge Mr. O'Rourke but stepped aside then to allow Mr. Brodsky to run -- vowed to come back to fight another day if the Assemblyman was unsuccessful.
 
Allegations Against O'Rourke
 Going into the debate, there were some hard feelings on the part of Mr. Spano and party leaders, who believe that Mr. Brodsky should not be dividing Democrats at a time when a united front is important to their effort to unseat Mr. O'Rourke.
The incumbent has been troubled by allegations in recent months that he sought jobs and favors for friends and family members. The matter is still being investigated by the District Attorney's office.
In 1989, when Mr. Brodsky ran against Mr. O'Rourke, the alleged misdeeds focused on Playland, the county-run amusement park in Rye, where concessionaires claimed that they were obliged to contribute to the county Republican Party to win contracts and where some county employees were given Republican Party administrative tasks to perform during their work hours. The Playland issue faded when its former director, E. Richard Keeler, a Republican appointee was convicted only of minor charges.
Because Mr. Brodsky announced in May that he was aiming this year, too, to take down Mr. O'Rourke -- saying there was never a formal agreement that he would not run again for the county executive position -- the two Democrats are to face each other on Sept. 14.
Last week, as the sun made its way around to the west and temperatures hovered above the 90-degree mark in the waterfront park, Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Spano debated the issues, attracting a crowd of more than 300 holiday revelers, who took an hour out to listen to the candidates' impassioned dialogue over the noise of passing trains and boats.
"It may not be known to all of you, but from where we stand today, Abraham Lincoln twice passed, once on his way to Washington to become President, and four years and two months later as a martyred President to be buried in Springfield, Ill.," the 47-year-old Mr. Brodsky, a Harvard Law School graduate, told the crowd.
 
'Important for the Future'
 The issues that Abraham Lincoln, 49 and a former Congressman running for the Senate, and Stephen A. Douglas, 45 and a two-term Senator, debated 135 years ago eventually led to the Civil War, with the Democratic incumbent winning the 1858 Senate race and Lincoln becoming the 16th President three years later.
"The issues we face today are, thank goodness, not as elevated, not as passion stricken, but they may be at least as important for the future of our county and our people," said Mr. Brodsky, who lives in Greenburgh.
For his part, Mr. Spano, who lives in Yorktown Heights, called upon more recent history for his opening comments, drawing an analogy between big business and the county government. "Five years ago, I.B.M. had to make a decision, and the decision it made gave it its destiny into the future," the former social studies and history teacher said. Later, in an interview, he explained that he meant that I.B.M. had lost its competitive edge by resting on its laurels and not looking ahead.
Westchester is in much the same position as I.B.M. was five years ago, said Mr. Spano, a 57-year-old graduate of Fordham University who was named Clerk of the Year last month by the New York State Association of County Clerks. "We are heading into a whole new society, a society that will be dealing with a world economy, a concern for the environment, a whole information revolution based on new technologies," he said. "And it will require the foresight of the next county executive to see that future and guide this county into the 21st century."
In the first of three questions that the League of Women Voters had prepared for the primary candidates, the moderator, Nancy Basset, a director of the Westchester League of Women Voters and the State League, asked, "Without destroying home rule, what role should the county play in developing regional plans to protect the watersheds and air quality?"
Mr. Brodsky, seizing the moment to refer to questions about Mr. O'Rourke's integrity in office, said, "The government has become a sewer of corruption and patronage, and the county's ability to speak credibly to issues of environment, tax policy, housing and the rest have become fundamentally eroded."
 
Environmental Issues
 Referring also to his role as chairman of the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, Mr. Brodsky said that the county should treat open space as parkland, stop county employees from selling the right to dump toxic water into county sewers and "look to this great river again as a resource that unites the county."
Mr. Spano spoke about the problems of polychlorinated biphenyls in the Hudson River and excessive nitrogen in Long Island Sound and said that if he became county executive he would establish a Department of the Environment to address those issues.
When the County Clerk suggested that the State Environmental Review Act be restructured because it has "stopped development" and did not, in fact, benefit the environment, the Assemblyman lashed back.
"That law has been the single most effective protection for environmental concerns in this state," said Mr. Brodsky, who called his opponent's comment "a profoundly dangerous idea."
The second question of the debate was: "What role should the county play in meeting the need for affordable housing in Westchester? How should the burden of meeting the need be allocated to each municipality?"
Mr. Spano called for an "eclectic and comprehensive housing policy" and suggested using existing space in shopping centers, storefronts, abandoned buildings and other commercial sites to develop housing for the elderly, the homeless and civil service workers, among others.
Again, calling for a government that is not "patronage ridden, corruption ridden," Mr. Brodsky said the county must build a consensus with local leaders in order to locate more affordable housing in communities throughout Westchester.
 
Housing Plans
 But the two tangled over the issue of who would have the final say if the county and local governments disagreed on housing plans. Mr. Brodsky said he would work in a "collegial and cooperative manner" with local government officials. And while Mr. Spano said he, too, believed in building a consensus -- "I'm very good at it. It's one of the reasons for my success in my present office," he said -- the County Clerk added that if a consensus was not reached, he was willing to make tough decisions.
"Would you make them over the objections of local governments?" Mr. Brodsky asked.
Mr. Spano answered, "If it was in the best interest of the people of Westchester County, yes."
Mr. Brodsky called his opponent's position on the matter "a blueprint for disaster."
The final question -- "Where do you stand on the question of tax reassessment?" -- provoked yet more disagreement during the debate, again about the balance of power between county and local government.
Mr. Brodsky, linking Mr. Spano with the current administration in White Plains, said, "The message is clear: the Spano-O'Rourke philosophy of a county government coming in and telling you what to do, coming in and telling you you've got to reassess, coming in and telling you you've got to build housing without a process of consultation -- my goodness, it's anti-democratic."
In response, Mr. Spano, said, "All I'm telling you is that this is a major problem that is not going to be solved very easily."
Mr. Spano got the last word in his closing remarks, criticizing Mr. Brodsky for saying he backed no increase in taxes, but supporting measures in Albany that would in fact raise taxes. "My grandfather used to say, 'Guarda le mani, non ascoltare la bocca' or 'Watch the hands, don't listen to the mouth,' " he said.
The two candidates did agree on the answer to one question raised by a member of the audience about the future of the Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant in Buchanan, which has been temporarily shut down by the New York Power Authority, which owns it, because of management and operational problems.
 
Encouraging Business
 Both men said the plant should eventually be phased out. Mr. Spano, though, took the opportunity to chastise Mr. Brodsky, who was chairman of the Assembly's Subcommittee on Air Quality and Nuclear Issues, for allowing the problems to develop.
After each candidate was asked how he would encourage business for Westchester, Mr. Brodsky suggested restructuring the state capital gains tax to help owners of commercial buildings (a process the Legislature began a month ago), retraining white-collar workers and holding down taxes.
Mr. Spano, who has written an economic development plan for the county, encouraged audience members to ask his office for copies of the plan.
The League of Women Voters is planning more debates between candidates for county posts but has yet to announce the schedule.
 
The Debate On Cable TV
 A videotape of the July Fourth debate in Ossining between County Clerk Andrew J. Spano and State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky will be broadcast on various cable television channels over the next several weeks.

HEADLINE: Viewpoints;
Health Reform Runs Antitrust Risk

BYLINE: By LEONARD ORLAND; Leonard Orland is a professor of law at the University of Connecticut in Hartford.

 BODY:
UNWANTED side effects are the bane of medicine, and they may bedevil the Clinton health reform effort, too. As policy makers cure health care's inaccessibility and high cost, they may unwittingly create new ailments in the area of antitrust.
These risks are real. While the specifics of the "managed competition" reforms are unknown, the Administration has embraced general principles that may dangerously increase the economic concentration of the health-care industry. There will be fewer, and bigger, buyers of health care, sellers of health care, and insurers: 

Item. The reforms will organize individuals and all but the largest employers into hug purchasing cooperatives that, in theory, will force insurers to compete hard for business.
The notion sounds good -- although the performance of such volume buyers as the United States Government and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield hasn't exactly proven the proposition. But what about the vastness of these cooperatives, which sometimes will cover a whole state and include millions of people? These single buyers -- monopsonies -- can be as economically dangerous as the more familiar monopolies, or single sellers.
 
Item. Only big sellers can meet the needs of big buyers. For this reason, under reform most of the multibillion-dollar health insurance market will go to the biggest insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life, Prudential and Travelers.
Known as the "Gang of Five," these huge companies have formed an alliance to promote managed competition. Why? The companies' annual reports explain.
Managed competition is "one of our most attractive [profit] opportunities," says the Travelers report. Cigna's report sees prospects for "improved revenue growth and better margins" in light of the "new Administration's health care policy." These and the other big insurers are optimistic because they know that in the world of reform many smaller insurers, unable to service the big buyers, will fail. This will leave the large insurers with a powerful oligopoly.

THE reforms will concentrate health-care power in many other ways. To become more efficient and more able to handle large buyers of insurance, for instance, doctors and hospitals will form provider networks. In turn, many of these networks will link up with the large insurers, thus forming even larger entities. (Indeed, Cigna is already assembling a network in the New York area.) Finally, for administrative services, many purchasing cooperatives and big corporate insurance buyers will turn to the big insurers -- and create still-larger groups.
In short, under reform big and few will replace small and many.
The Administration is not unaware of this dangerous convergence of power. In mid-June, it recommended that health insurers be stripped of antitrust immunity, something they have enjoyed since passage of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. Also, the Administration thus far has rebuffed doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies who have requested similar immunities.
But policy makers must be even more sensitive to the antitrust dangers of health reform. First, they must realize that economic concentration is dangerous even if antitrust immunities are not granted. Such concentration is inherently dangerous because, "like all power, it is laden with the possibility of abuse," in the words of Irving Kaufman, the eminent Federal judge.
Second, as they focus on cutting health costs and raising accessibility to health care, policy makers must closely examine their proposals' antitrust effects. Are there equally effective reforms that avoid dangerous concentrations of power? Are there safeguards that can put in place? How, in detail, will this brave new world of health care be regulated? Who will oversee the regulators?
For example, the purchasing cooperatives may well receive some form of antitrust immunity because, as single sellers in a defined area, they can hardly function without immunity. If so, policy makers must be aware that the giant insurers are likely to become the cooperatives' administrators. As such, the insurers may benefit from this immunity even if their own has been stripped away.
If health reformers are vigilant, perhaps they can steer clear of the dangers that so justifiably worried Senator John Sherman when he drafted the nation's basic antitrust law more than 100 years ago. Health reform should not be a cure that creates another disease.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Flood Leaves 250,000 Without Water to Drink

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 11

 BODY:
After several days of hope that this city might escape the fate of so many others in the Mississippi River watershed this sodden summer, the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers overflowed today, ruining the fresh-water supply of 250,000 people, cutting off the electricity to thousands of homes and businesses and forcing hundreds of people to flee before dawn.
The rivers merge near the center of Des Moines, and early this morning they flooded the plant that supplies water to the city and several suburbs. The disruption of the drinking water supply could last up to a month, officials said this evening. And as some residents scrambled to obtain emergency water brought in by truck, long lines formed elsewhere when residents flocked to stores to buy bottled water. 
 The flooding closed downtown bridges that link the east and west sides of the city and prompted city leaders to urge downtown workers not to go to their jobs on Monday.
 
The Rising Toll
 Des Moines is the latest crisis site in a siege of Midwestern floods along the Mississippi and its tributaries that has forced more than 30,000 people from their homes and caused 22 deaths since late last month. Damage to crops and property is estimated at more than $2 billion in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
Vice President Al Gore said today that he would visit the flooded areas of Missouri on Monday.
The ultimate scope of the destruction depends on the weather, and forecasters said today that there were signs that the stubborn system causing unrelenting rain in the Upper Midwest, along with the leaden heat on the East Coast, was about to break up.
 
Drying Out Is in Sight
 Daniel Graf, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said that there was a chance for heavy rain in the next two days but that after Wednesday the probability of rain would decrease and a drying-out period would begin.
Estimates of the economic toll from the flooding will not be possible for some time.
"It's difficult to give an exact damage estimate until the water starts going down, when you'll see you'll have sewer lines, water treatment plants, streets, roads, bridges, people's homes, businesses -- all have damages," James Lee Witt, the new director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
 
Price Effects Unknown
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said he had visited flooded farms and added, "It's the worst disaster, agricultural disaster, that I've seen in quite a while."
But Mr. Espy, who appeared today on the ABC News program "This Week," said it was too soon to know whether the flood would have a substantial effect on food prices.
In Des Moines the concern was not food, but water. Mayor John Dorrian said that while water for sprinkler systems and fire hydrants would probably be available in a week, the drinking water supply could probably not be restored for a month.
The Des Moines Water Works is adjacent to the Raccoon River, from which it draws the city's water supply. While the plant is surrounded by a system of levees to protect it from the river's periodic floods, this one was too high.
Mayor Dorrian said that a second night of heavy rain pushed the river over the sandbag dikes and earthen barriers about 3:30 A.M. today, submerging not only the plant's pumps and generators in eight to nine feet of water, but also contaminating the complex filtration and purification system.
The pumps that supply water to Des Moines were turned off so the taps in the city did not flow. In the suburbs, which receive water from Des Moines but have their own pumping systems, faucets would run but residents were warned not to drink the water.
Arrangements are being made for trucking in millions of gallons of drinking water from nearby towns and grocery warehouses and distributing it at dozens of locations around the city.
But many people did not wait for the emergency supplies. At one grocery store, 200 to 300 people were in a line that snaked through the parking lot at 7 A.M.
The Mayor said water would be strictly rationed to about two gallons a person. "The water is for drinking only," he said. "It's not for bathing or anything else. But we're still in pretty good shape. It's not a panic situation."
 
Evacuations in a Suburb
 The day before, the area's residents got a preview of how unpredictable the rivers can be. In West Des Moines on Saturday, the Raccoon River broke a sandbag dike and flooded the historic Valley Junction business district of the 37,000-resident suburb.
The police and National Guard, sometimes using boats, evacuated 3,500 people. Today, much of the district, with its antique shops and art shops, was under five feet of water.
The Des Moines River, which is much bigger than the Raccoon, runs through the heart of the state's largest city, and when it rose to inundate a power substation early today, it threw much of the central part of the city into darkness. Traffic lights stopped signaling and elevators went dead.
The Des Moines Register, the state's largest newspaper, could not run its computers or presses and was forced to move its operations to makeshift offices in a suburb. With the help of two other Iowa newspapers, The Register struggled to publish an eight-page special edition for distribution on Monday. It faxed articles to a paper in Indianola to be laid out and then had the pages flown to Iowa City to be printed.
Evelyn Fincher, a spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers, said the Des Moines River was not the major source of the city's problems. Flood-control dams and reservoirs, although severely taxed, were working as designed, she said.
The problem, she said, was with the Raccoon River, which merges with the Des Moines at the edge of downtown. That river has no control systems and the two nights of rain overfilled it earlier than officials had expected. If there had been time to plan, the officials could have reduced the flow of the Des Moines River from the Saylorville Dam upstream to help take more water from the Raccoon, but "we did not anticipate it cresting right now," Ms. Fincher said.
 
Volunteers at the Library
 Carolyn Greufe, who works in the fine arts department of the Des Moines Public Library, said several inches of water had seeped into the basement of the old building, which sits just a few feet from the Des Moines River levee. She said 50 volunteers had moved 10,000 to 20,000 books upstairs between 3 A.M. and 6 A.M. today.
"It was so dark, you couldn't even see people's faces," she said. "We formed a human chain and moved the books upstairs. There were flashlights and candles to guide us, that's it."
One volunteer she did recognize was a homeless man, one of the many people who have been fighting the rivers here all weekend. There were lawyers and doctors. There was a retired Air Force pilot and students. There was a homemaker who lives on high ground but said she "wanted to help out because people helped me so much when my first husband died of cancer."
Mayor Dorrian termed the flooding a shock. "No one could have planned for this," he said. "We had the levee system in place and we thought it was more than adequate, but it was not."
 
Crest Delayed at St. Louis
 As levees collapsed along the Mississippi River, giving the water a wider space in which to spread, officials with the Army Corps of Engineers in St. Louis moved the projected date of the river's crest to Saturday from Wednesday. The river, at 42.8 feet today, is expected to crest at 45 feet.
Floods chased people from two more towns along the Mississippi over the weekend. In Winfield, Mo., just north of St. Louis, and in Grafton, Ill., a rush of sandbagging failed to hold back the water, and the homes of more than 1,000 people were flooded.
In St. Louis, some raw sewage was allowed to flow into the river to prevent water from backing into homes. "This is nothing unusual," said Gary Dyhouse, a spokesman for the Army Corps in St. Louis. "No one should drink from the river water."
He said the city had released sewage into the river during heavy floods "several times in the last 20 years." He said the sewage had been diluted by the heavy volume of water, and he noted that all river water was treated before getting into the drinking supplies of communities downstream.
Water from the creeks and rivers that overflowed in Kansas City on Saturday night receded today, the Fire Department reported, leaving the streets largely free of water. The authorities found the body of a man, thought to be a transient, along Southwest Boulevard, and he is believed to have drowned.
The business and manufacturing plants along Southwest Boulevard were under as much as six feet of water on Saturday, and rescuers had to help people trapped in buildings along the boulevard escape.
The Blue and Kaw Rivers, and Brush and Turkey Creeks, tributaries of the Missouri River, were responsible for Saturday's flooding. Kansas City is under no immediate threat from the Missouri River itself, said Phillip Wall, chief dispatcher for the Kansas City Fire Department. A levee system protects the city to a river height of 45 feet, and the river crested at 40 feet Saturday. It would take another week of heavy rainfall for Kansas City to be seriously threatened, Mr. Wall said.

HEADLINE: Mexicans Fear for Corn, Imperiled by Free Trade

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN MATEO TEPOPULA, Mexico

 BODY:
Before they plant even one kernel of corn, the Perez Rueda brothers always follow the timeless Mexican custom of using the first 12 days of the year to predict the weather of the coming 12 months. It rained here last Jan. 5 so they planted in May, the fifth month, and their corn is almost three feet high.
Joel and Benjamin Perez Rueda firmly believe that abiding by the old tradition has brought them success, the proof being that in 13 years they have moved up from two mule teams to three tractors, including one they bought just last year because it was such an "ano maicero" -- a good corn year. 
 But they are worried about next year. They know the custom won't help them handle the big changes that will come if the United States Congress approves the North American Free Trade Agreement and Mexico is flooded with cheap corn from the north.
"Look at what happens when other products are allowed in and the local market gets wiped out," said Benjamin Perez Rueda, 36, jumping off his new Ford tractor on a misty morning in the Chalco Valley, about 25 miles east of Mexico City. "The truth is, the treaty is not going to help us at all."
 
Farmers in Trouble
 Even with a 15-year shelter that protects Mexican corn longer than any other products covered by the trade agreement, people here are worried. While many Mexicans would benefit from the new jobs that are expected to be created, corn farmers like the Perez Ruedas would be hard pressed to survive the fierce new competition. Peasant farmers could be hurt even more, and thousands could be left with few choices but to abandon their land and head either to Mexico's already crippled cities or to the United States.
The trade agreement still faces a tough fight in Congress. And a Federal judge in Washington recently increased the uncertainty by ordering the United States Government to assess the environmental impact of the agreement, a process that could take several months. But most people here believe it is inevitable, just as inevitable as the cultural changes that are already under way as Mexico tries to modernize.
As people become more well-to-do, they generally consume less corn, the food of the poor. Bread replaces tortillas, steak replaces tamales, Ford tractors replace mule teams. Mexico City now has Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centers and Denny's restaurants, but whether such changes represent improvements in the quality of life or a long slide toward cultural obscurity is unclear.
"Corn still connects the Mexicans of today with Mexicans from before the conquest, but when you don't get a good tortilla in a restaurant, it's a very good indication of a deterioration of the quality of life," said Homero Aridjis, a Mexico City poet and environmentalist who is constantly tested by the sweet, long-ago memory of his grandmother's handmade tortillas. "It's just like when the French do not find a good baguette in their restaurants. It shows something serious has happened."
 
The Indian Heritage
Corn and Mexico Evolve Together
 At last the rains have come, and the dark volcanic fields of the Chalco Valley are erupting with an ancient variety of cream-colored corn.
But here and there in the jagged rows tended by Leopoldo Neria Rodriguez and his black and white mules Aguacate and Paloma sprouts an even older type of corn called teosinte, a reminder of the Aztec people who lived in these misty hills half a millennium ago.
In some Indian tribes the word for meals refers only to corn. But corn represents far more than food. Since Indian wanderers first decided to save gnarled kernels of a tiny ear of corn 7,000 years ago and plant them the next season, Mexico and corn -- here it is called maiz -- have evolved together.
Corn cannot grow without man and man cannot survive without corn -- from the earliest times, Mexicans have interpreted this as a lesson for a life of self-sacrifice. Growing corn is a national obsession, even though this is a nation cruelly unsuited for agriculture. More than half of Mexico is arid, and more than half of all land is too steep for cultivation. Yet corn is grown in all 31 states by nearly three million farmers, mostly peasants working small, inefficient fields without irrigation and at the mercy of the rains. With their families, they represent nearly a quarter of all Mexicans.
Because corn comes from the land, land too is an important part of Mexican life, and was a big factor in the violent 1910 revolution. Rambling haciendas were seized from their Spanish owners and the land was redistributed to peasants, who used it to grow corn.
But no green revolution ever followed because corn grows most productively on large flat fields, the kind found in Iowa, not Oaxaca. Average yields in Mexico are one-third those in the United States. Many Mexican farmers either cannot afford or stubbornly resist improvements like tractors, fertilizer or improved hybrids.
Even though cultural changes are reducing the middle class's reliance on corn, Mexico's young population keeps growing by 2 percent a year, increasing the demand for corn and turning self-sufficiency into a matter of national security. A complex system of subsidies has evolved, accompanied by inefficiency and corruption. At a cost of almost $2 billion a year, the Government buys all the corn that Mexicans produce, at nearly $200 a metric ton, almost twice the world price. Then it has to subsidize tortillas, to bring the price back down.
Even so, Mexico often must import corn from the United States to satisfy demand. The corn is dyed green or pink at the border so it cannot be sold back to the Government at a profit.
The price of local corn has gone so high, while other subsidies have shrunk or disappeared, that many farmers who once grew other crops have switched to corn. The production of rice, cotton and sorghum in Mexico has dropped, while corn production, and corn subsidies, have soared. Even without a treaty such a system is unsustainable, and Mexican officials have studied alternatives, including direct payments to farmers who grow corn and other crops, and subsidies based on income.
Whichever is chosen, many who live by corn face an uncertain future. Big farmers can simply switch to some other crop. Peasants who grow only the corn they eat can continue as they always have. But those in the middle, like the Perez Ruedas, stand to be squeezed out by the new competition and the loss of subsidies. According to the World Bank, in the first five years of the treaty, from 145,000 to 300,000 farmers could abandon their land and head for the cities.
When they leave, they will take with them an unwritten encyclopedia of knowledge about hundreds of varieties of corn that have been cultivated for generations until they became ideally suited to their own weather and soil conditions. Scientists are concerned that the genetic stock that is lost may never be recovered.
To Americans used to supermarket yellow corn, the variety of corn grown here -- from stubby cobs like pine cones to those with red, white and speckled black kernels -- is staggering. Mauricio R. Bellon, a scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has studied this biological diversity, worries that important gene strains could be lost under the coming economic and cultural changes.
The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Texcoco, near here, has already set up the world's largest corn seed bank with nearly 13,000 samples. But its directors fear they might not be able to keep up with the rate of abandonment if the economy is transformed.
 
The Staff of Life
For Mexico's Poor, Corn Is Everything
 In one swift, easy motion, Graciano Palma Mancilla splits open the soil with his coa, a three-foot-long digging stick. Except for its wide steel blade, made from a discarded tractor part, the coa is a replica of the planting tool used by his Aztec ancestors.
"We planted 15 days ago," he said, "but it was just too dry. Look." He jabbed his coa into the ground near a spindly seedling. Then he dipped his left hand into a plaid pouch on his waist and took out a small handful of dried corn kernels, which he flipped into the hole.
For roughly $10 a day, Mr. Palma Mancilla will repeat the same motions up and down long rows on the San Juan farm in Temamatla, also in the Chalco Valley. He has his own field of corn to tend, but it is too small and he is too poor not to have to work for someone else. That, he says, is life in Mexico.
For him, there isn't much more to life than corn. He lives with his wife and three children, and the corn they grow provides them with food every day: corn porridge in the morning, tortillas and beans for lunch, a stew with tortillas at night.
"Without corn," he said, "what are we going to eat?"
For the poor, the answer is little else. Per capita consumption of corn in Mexico exceeds 260 pounds a year, which is roughly 3,600 tortillas, or 10 tortillas a day. Almost none of Mexico's harvest goes to feed animals. Here they say an ear of corn fed to a pig is a meal taken from a peasant.
Besides tortillas, corn is turned into soups and tamales -- ground corn steamed in a corn husk. Pushcarts sell corn on the cob, rolled in a crumbly white cheese, and cups of corn kernels doused in atomic chile. At midday, practically every construction crew makes a small fire on which to cook tortillas. A rare fungus that grows on some corn husks is saved and turned into a delicacy called huitlacoche.
But even without free trade, many Mexicans have already changed the way they feel about the crop. In a modern supermarket, pasty tortillas in plastic bags are displayed across the aisle from pasty white bread in plastic bags. In wealthier states near the United States border, people prefer more expensive tortillas made of wheat.
It could be just that the northerners eat more beef, and wheat tortillas taste better with beef than do those made of corn. But to many traditional Mexicans in the center and south of the country, that preference aligns the northerners more with wheat-eating Europeans than with the corn-eating Indians of their past.
 
The Mighty Tortilla
Corn Loses Its Hold On Many Mexicans
 Walls once yellow are stained a greasy gray. A conveyor belt runs ceaselessly and the gas-fired flames of the oven, exhausted into the garage-sized room, give the Marta Elena Tortilleria in the mountain village of Tenango del Aire all the charm of a bus terminal.
Mario Sanchez, 18, figures that on an average day he makes and sells about 12,000 tortillas at the Marta Elena, one of about 24,000 small tortilla-making shops in Mexico. On a special day like the recent celebration of Tenango del Aire's patron saint, John the Baptist, he could go through 35,000 tortillas, especially if they are blue ones made from black corn.
The corn he uses comes from the Chalco Valley, from the fields of Mr. Neria Rodriguez and the Perez Rueda brothers and the farm where Mr. Palma Mancilla works. The shop on Tenango del Aire's main street thus completes an ancient cycle of planting, harvesting and tortilla-making that Cortes found in 1519 when he landed on the coast of Mexico.
Outside the open counter, hoping to rush home before the rains started again, Emma Chong bought a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tortillas, about 35 of them at a cost of one peso -- 33 cents. Mrs. Chong said she, her husband and their 6-year-old son, Carlos Antonio, would not finish them for a week; they much prefer bread.
Her mother, Concepcion Varela, also bought a kilo, but she and her husband will finish them in two days. She said that in her 66 years she had never gone a day without eating corn, and if for some reason a day should come when she couldn't find a tortilla, she supposed she would eat bread, but she wouldn't like it.
"You see how my children like bread now," she said, clearly concerned with the way her family and Mexico were changing right before her eyes, how their roots seemed no longer to run so deep, and how corn for many no longer was so important. All so different. "But I'll tell you," she said, defiantly, proudly, "for me and for my husband, the tortilla still is everything."

HEADLINE: Free Trade Pact Is Still a Mystery To Many in U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Only four months before Congress is expected to vote on the sweeping package of economic changes known as the North American Free Trade Agreement, a New York Times/CBS News poll finds that nearly half of Americans say they have not heard anything about the agreement.
Although President Clinton has often spoken of the consumer benefits of global trade, as he did in Tokyo last week, the White House seems to be letting other parties set the agenda for the national debate on the North American pact. In recent months, Mexican officials and business executives have criss-crossed the United States promoting the agreement, which would create a single free trade zone encompassing Canada, Mexico and the United States. Meanwhile, Ross Perot and some American labor groups and environmentalists have been opposing it with increasing vehemence.
 
A Stalled Campaign
 Administration officials say they cannot begin a sales campaign until side agreements about environmental and labor issues are completed and until Congress ends work on the budget. But the poll charts the problems ahead in selling Congress on the pact, which within the next 15 years would eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers among the three nations. 
 If adopted, the agreement would eventually create a single market of 370 million people, producing and consuming $6 trillion a year in goods and services. Supporters say the pact would create high-technology jobs in the United States, allow a more prosperous Mexico to spend more money on environmental protection and insure political stability in the region.
But detractors contend that the trade agreement would cause the wholesale flight of American factories and jobs to Mexico, increasing pollution in a country known for lax enforcement of environmental laws.
Both sides agree that the pact would cost the United States billions of dollars in forgone tariff revenues, in the cost of retraining workers who lose their jobs to imports and in payments for the environmental cleanup of the United States-Mexican border.
With only about a quarter of Americans in favor of the pact and about a quarter against it, according to the poll, the fate of the trade agreement will depend on whether the Administration can make a compelling case in the coming weeks.
The nationwide poll by The New York Times and CBS News was conducted by telephone with 1,363 adults from June 21 to 24, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll found that only 51 percent said they had read or heard something "about the recent proposal to create something called a 'North American free trade zone' composed of Canada, the United States and Mexico." Another 44 percent said they had not read or heard anything, while an additional 5 percent said they were not sure whether they had or not.
 
An Advantage Seen
 Some Administration officials view the poll results as an opportunity and see the public's ignorance of the agreement as an advantage. "Given the intense activity of the opposition, and that we haven't made a full-court press, that indicates that people are open to the arguments for Nafta," said a senior trade official who asked not to be identified.
Some Democrats agree. The lack of understanding "is definitely to Clinton's advantage, because he still has an opportunity to frame the issue for people," Geoffrey D. Garin, a Democratic pollster, said. "The danger is that this ultimately gets framed as a treaty that ships jobs to Mexico."
President Clinton promised in early January to appoint an inter-agency coordinator, whose job it would be to sell the trade pact to Congress and the American people. The search for such a person is now in the final days, people involved in the process said.
Polltakers and members of Congress on both sides of the issue say that the biggest challenge for whomever the President appoints will lie in convincing the American people that the agreement would create jobs in the United States. The poll found that people who have heard of the agreement tend to think, by a margin of nearly three to two, that the pact would result in fewer jobs.
Representative Sherrod Brown, a freshman Democrat from Ohio who is leading opposition among House freshmen to the pact, said he recently visited a concrete factory in his district and found workers there "scared to death" of the agreement. Mr. Brown and several other members of Congress expressed surprise at the poll's results, saying that it contrasted with their mail, which was lopsidedly against the agreement.
"Mail that I'm getting, and everyone else is getting, shows Nafta is going down like the Pizza Hut blimp," Mr. Brown said.
Labor unions and some consumer, religious and environmental groups have been organizing letter-writing campaigns against the free-trade pact. During a paid half-hour commercial on network television a month ago, Ross Perot, the former Presidential candidate, urged Americans to send postcards to Congress condemning the pact.
 
Lobbying Congress, Not Public
 President Clinton has mentioned the agreement at several news conferences and in a handful of speeches. But since the campaign he has not delivered a speech spelling out in detail why he favors the pact. Instead, the Administration has pursued a campaign of lobbying members of Congress and holding small news conferences for print reporters in an effort to influence opinion makers rather than the general public.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the Administration's low-visibility advocacy of the pact is unavoidable since three supplemental agreements are still being negotiated. The latest round of talks ended Saturday near Mexico City. The agreements are intended to protect worker rights and the environment and limit sudden surges in imports as the main agreement lowers tariffs across North America.
Mr. Kantor and other Administration officials have also said that they intend to win majorities in both houses of Congress to put the trade pact into effect as planned on Jan. 1.
Some Democratic politicians suggest that the agreement is a political albatross that will cost the Administration precious political capital that might better be spent on issues closer to President Clinton's heart.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said he doubted that a majority of senators supported the pact. "Our party has become a protectionist party," he said.
 
Excuse for Delay
 A Federal judge's ruling that the Administration must conduct a time-consuming environmental impact statement on the pact may prove to be a lucky break for President Clinton, by giving him an excuse to postpone action, Mr. Moynihan added.
Administration officials are instead appealing the decision by United States District Judge Charles R. Richey. They have concluded that delay would run the risk of making the agreement more of an issue in the 1994 Congressional elections, while killing the pact would contradict the President's emphasis on making America compete in the global economy instead of retreat from it.
The poll shows that opponents and advocates of the agreement were evenly split, with 22 percent of the respondents in favor and 23 percent opposed, a difference considered statistically insignificant. Another 6 percent said they had no opionion on the pact. Only respondents who had heard of the plan were asked for their opinions of the pact.
As their chief reasons for opposing the agreement, respondents familiar with the pact most frequently cited: loss of American jobs (17 percent); cheap labor in Mexico (8 percent) and the pact's perceived unfairness to the United States (6 percent).
As their main arguments for favoring the agreement, respondents most frequently cited: the help it would give to all three countries (11 percent); a stimulus to the United States economy (10 percent) and the principle of free trade (7 percent).
The view in Washington has been that the Administration would at some point have to appeal to the American people, as well as lobby Congress. When told the poll results, some politicians and pollsters suggested that public apathy might let the Administration pursue a more narrow campaign restricted to Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: New Accents for Old Ritual: Vacationing in the Catskills

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SWAN LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
The generations who came here to escape New York City's sultry streets called the Catskills "the Mountains," as if no other mountains existed or mattered. More often than not, their comments were flavored with Yiddish.
The crisp air and cool shade of the area are still ambrosia to vacationers. But now many of the voices are Korean and Russian, people flocking to places like Swan Lake because the landscapes remind them of summer places in the mountains near Seoul or in the Urals. The Yiddish that is spoken comes from the Hasidim who have replaced more secular Jews as the mainstay of the area's bungalow colonies. 
 As the Catskills grow more diverse, the region is showing signs of stemming the economic slide that over the years forced many of its resorts to close.
In the region's glory days, the 1940's, 50's, and early 60's, Jewish, Italian and Irish city dwellers would flock north for an inexpensive retreat from the summer heat. The area was close, about two and a half hours from Manhattan, and relatively inexpensive and it welcomed immigrant ethnic groups. The vacationers kept returning, as faithful as the Capistrano swallows. But their sons and daughters are more likely to seek out the Berkshires than the Borscht Belt.
 
Returning, Like Salmon
 Although a handful of big-name resort hotels, like the Concord and Kutsher's, still hold their attraction, many smaller hotels and bungalow colonies have closed. Others have been converted into New Age religious retreats, drug-rehabilitation centers and Orthodox yeshivas.
And at others, the bungalows have been converted into condominiums or co-ops and sold to former New Yorkers who raised their children on Catskills summers before they retired. Now these vacationers, known as the Floridians, have returned to share memories and the natural air-conditioning with summertime companions of old.
"It's like salmon," said Willie Weinberg, 79, who winters in Florida and spends summers in nearby Monticello. "They grow up in the river and then they're going to the sea and after five years they're coming back. That's how it happened to me."
But probably the most startling presence is the Koreans, whose arrival was trumpeted in mid-April when Soung Kiy Min, a businessman, purchased Grossinger's. Once the elegant dowager of a legion of Catskills resorts, Grossinger's went bankrupt and closed in 1986. Its once-majestic lawns grew chaotic with weeds.
Mr. Min hopes to use Grossinger's golf course as the nucleus on which to resurrect the hotel, starting with a 42-room building and indoor pool that he plans to open in September.
People of Korean background have bought at least three other hotels here in surrounding Sullivan County. For owners like Hak Men Kim, whose family bought the dilapidated Golden Swan, a motel boasting one of the lake's best vistas, the experience has been a struggle.
 
Vacation at a Fast Pace
 The Kims have found to their chagrin that most Koreans have yet to adopt the American habit of two- and three-week-vacations.
Instead the Korean-Americans, who constitute 10 percent of the Kims's guests, come up for two or three days to plunder this lake's fabled bass and barbecue their catch on the small beach, then return to their fruit stores or coin-operated laundries. Even the weekends they take are not restful.
"There's not enough time to enjoy here so they don't sleep," said Hak Men Kim. "All night they fish and they eat."
Mr. Kim and his wife, Young, left Korea 13 years ago, labored in the South's tobacco farms and mills, then bought a Bronx fish store. They fell in love with the Catskills on a skiing trip in 1985.
"My country is the same as here," said Mr. Kim. "It's mountains. It's up and down. Big trees. Lake. It's beautiful."
Working virtually round the clock, Mr. Kim has spruced up the 28 rooms and cleared the beaches of debris while Mrs. Kim has run a small restaurant and their twin daughters, Karan and Kayeon, 17, have straightened rooms. The daughters attend high school in nearby Liberty with only a handful of other Korean students.
 
Praise God, Have Some Fun
 Besides the hotels, there is also a Korean-American bungalow colony -- the Catskills word for clusters of white cottages with a handball court and a pool that is always advertised as Olympic-sized even when its no bigger than a hot tub.
Ye Shik Choi, a Presbyterian elder in Flushing, Queens, has turned a nine-bungalow colony into a combination guest house and religious retreat called Bethel Mission Village. He fills bungalows with families or groups of teen-agers from congregations in New York City.
Along with enjoying the pool, his guests study the Bible and pray in the chapel, once the colony's "casino."
During the 1950's and 1960's, "casino" was a somewhat inflated Riviera-flavored name for a game room with battered sofas and a tiny stage that was the social center of each colony. The women played mah-jongg, the men played pinochle and smoked cigars, and their teen-age sons and daughters went through their first awkward romantic gropings.
This week, three young men with guitars and drums were using the former casino to rehearse a rock 'n' roll spiritual. Outside, Korean-American boys and girls played volleyball.
"We came here to pray, praise God and have a little fun," said Brian Son, 14, a student at Brooklyn's Midwood High School.
Although Russian-Americans have yet to buy any of the resort hotels, they have established a strong presence. Paula Yeager, a local real-estate agent, said some Russian community groups from New York City rent entire bungalow colonies for the summer and parcel them out to their members.
With their Slavic accents, working-class origins and Old World habits, the Russian-Americans remind year-round residents of the Jewish war refugees who filled many bungalows in the 1950's and 1960's. But, though most of the new Russian visitors are Jewish, few speak Yiddish or were raised with Jewish traditions.
 
Reminders of Home
 Like the Koreans, many Russians are attracted by the area's resemblance to their homeland.
On the day Leah Borodova, 71, of Brooklyn, arrived at Willow Acres colony here, she made a syrupy juice out of green apples she had picked. She is also eager to hunt for ripe mushrooms in the woods behind the colony, then dry them for winter storage, just as she did in the Urals.
"The air, the weather, the quietness," she said. "I think I'm there at home."
Mrs. Borodova came here for two weeks with two grandchildren, Anna Beylin, 9, and her cousin Alex Beylin, 15, and Alex's mother, all for $400, about the cost of two days in Martha's Vineyard. Anna's parents, computer programmers, were expected for the weekend, squeezing their own cots into the two-room bungalow in the manner of bungalow dwellers of the past.
Once there were more than 400 bungalow colonies, said Al Bard, a longtime owner. Now the Yellow Pages list 175, but residents are skeptical that that many are in operation.
Many of the rest of the colonies have sold off individual bungalows as co-ops or condominiums for about $15,000 each, with Jewish retirees often the purchasers.
Willie Weinberg, a retired food shop owner, helped turn Silbert's Resort Community near Monticello Raceway into co-ops. When he was younger, Mr. Weinberg and his wife, Lola, would take their son, Marty, and daughter, Marilyn, out of Queens to now-defunct colonies like Zager's in Swan Lake. In the mid-1980's, after years of trying other vacation spots, they returned.
One-third of the resort's 57 bungalows are owned by Holocaust survivors who try to rekindle some of the atmosphere of their younger days when Catskills camaraderie had to substitute for the families they lost in Europe. They could breathe air reminiscent of their Polish towns, learn American dances and card games and give their children a respite from the clamorous streets.
"When we came to the mountains, we found our friends," Mr. Weinberg remembered. "Between survivors, it's one, two, three. You go to the casino Saturday night and the next day you're friends."
"And a week later you're enemies," added Mrs. Weinberg.
 
Fathers Arrive on Weekends
 Mrs. Yeager, the real-estate agent, estimates that 75 percent of the remaining bungalow colonies are held by Hasidic groups. Decades ago, when the Weinbergs began coming to the region, the Hasidim were a small presence. But now, with their large families and distinctive garb, they now give the Catskills the look of the European shtetls.
The women at one colony with the business-like name of Nel Education Center cluster in lawn chairs encircled by baby carriages and small children. They replace their customary wigs with cooler turbans and play board games like Othello or dip in a pool enclosed with a high fence to safeguard their modesty.
The men drive up on weekends or brief vacations and spend much of their days inside, in a study hall. "Studying is one thing you never take a vacation from," said David Weiss, a Satmar Hasid from Brooklyn's Williamsburg who learned enough plumbing to manage the colony.
Mr. Weiss, who charges $1,200 for the summer, is not impressed with the arrival of the Korean- and Russian-Americans, predicting that they, too, will one day become upwardly mobile and forsake the Catskills.
"They won't last," he said. "The Hasidim have no choice. You can't take 10 children and go off to Europe."

HEADLINE: Clinton Ends Asia Trip at Korea's Demilitarized Zone

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANMUNJOM, Korea, July 11

 BODY:
Seeking to underscore the economic and security concerns that now define the relationship between the United States and its Pacific allies, President Clinton ended a six-day trip to Asia today by visiting one of the most menacing vestiges of the cold war -- the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
Mr. Clinton's visit to Japan and South Korea, which revolved around last week's meeting of the leaders of the seven richest industrialized democracies, was part economics primer and part military maneuver for a President who won election by emphasizing his country's domestic needs.
Mr. Clinton used the occasion to address some of the 36,000 American troops stationed in South Korea in a speech intended to build the President's stature by demonstrating through words and pictures that he can be an able Commander in Chief even though he never served in uniform.
 
Tough Talk and a Saxophone
 He courted the soldiers with tough talk about American security and patriotism, and then performed an impromptu riff on a saxophone borrowed from a member of the Army band. He drew his biggest cheer when he mentioned his decision last month to order a missile attack on Iraq in retaliation for what the White House said was a plot to assassinate President Bush. 
 President Clinton's two-day visit to South Korea was devoted almost entirely to demonstrating to Seoul and Tokyo that Washington was committed to stopping North Korea from building nuclear weapons.
"When you examine the nature of the American security commitment to Korea, to Japan, to this region, it is pointless for them to try to develop nuclear weapons," Mr. Clinton said today. "Because if they ever use them, it would be the end of their country."
In several speeches during his trip, Mr. Clinton has talked about the creation of a new Pacific community that will link American economic and security interests. The Administration has offered no specifics on this proposal, but it seems to be aimed, at least in part, at building a bridge of good intentions between Asia and North America and the European Community.
 
Tough Stance on Nuclear Treaty
 At the demilitarized zone, Mr. Clinton stared across the border into North Korea and pledged to "stay strong" on his insistence that North Korea not go through with its threat to withdraw from the the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.
"Some day this will all be one country again," he said.
"I hope someday they'll just be able to walk on over here, in peace," he said of the North Korean soldiers.
Later, at Camp Casey, an Army base near the demilitarized zone, Mr. Clinton was cheered by thousands of soldiers of the Second Infantry Division when he praised them for serving "on the frontier of freedom." His remarks were delivered in a hangar decorated with hundreds of yards of camouflage netting, flags and two signs reading: "The Warrior Division welcomes the Commander in Chief."
The only soldiers allowed to talk to reporters were selected by base commanders in an apparent effort at public relations control that was missing when Mr. Clinton toured the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Norfolk, Va., last year. Then, he was openly criticized by a number of military people who were unhappy about his opposition to the Vietnam War and his pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.
 
G.I.'s Advised to Behave
 The soldiers who gathered for Mr. Clinton's visit today were advised on how to behave in advance. "Anytime during this speech, it's all right to drown out this microphone," Sgt. Maj. Robert Hall announced before the President arrived. "It's O.K. to raise the roof on this building."
It is the monsoon season here, and Mr. Clinton's trip to the border was hampered by torrential rain that forced him to travel to Panmunjom by motorcade instead of by helicopter.
The rain, however, did not diminish the theatricality of the President's visit. Passing rice paddies and saluting guards, Mr. Clinton stepped onto the short concrete bridge that is blocked off at North Korea's end by a six-foot cinderblock wall as North Korean sentries stood on the other side.
"I looked at them and they were looking at us," Mr. Clinton said afterward. The North Koreans, he added, "have been rather calm in response to my trip here, and that is rather encouraging."
 
'Bridge of No Return'
 Mr. Clinton walked to the middle of the "Bridge of No Return." As he stopped about 30 yards from the North Korean border, Army officials said he became the only American President to come so close to the enemy territory, where North Korean sentries watched his every move.
President Reagan visited the demilitarized zone in 1983 and President Bush came last year. Today, Mr. Clinton combined Mr. Reagan's talent for the compelling backdrop and Mr. Bush's taste in music. Dozens of soldiers dressed in camouflage sat in camera range behind Mr. Clinton during his speech. And beforehand, a soldier sang the Bush campaign standard, "I'm Proud to Be an American."
North Korea alarmed many countries in March when it announced that it would withdraw from the treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons. North Korea has since "suspended" its withdrawal, and is to continue talks with the United States. But Japan has indicated that it could not yet support the indefinite extension of the treaty, which expires in 1995.
American officials have said on Mr. Clinton's trip that the United States is prepared to lead its allies -- and perhaps China -- into imposing economic sanctions on North Korea. But Mr. Clinton also talked with South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, about the pace of the negotiations with the North. South Korea has a robust trade relationship with China, established only last August, that could be influenced by the nuclear weapons issue, illustrating the related nature of the concerns Mr. Clinton must address in coordinating his policies on Asia.

Clintons Rest in Hawaii
 HONOLULU, July 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- After leaving South Korea, President Clinton arrived here today for a brief vacation that began with a visit to the U.S.S. Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor. Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were greeted when they landed here by their daughter, Chelsea, who presented her parents with leis as they stepped off Air Force One. The Clintons are expected to remain here until early Wednesday.

HEADLINE: 2 Who Split on Clinton Budget Find Neither Won

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, July 10

 BODY:
When Representative Bill Orton broke with his party and voted against President Clinton's budget package, he became an instant hero in the canyons and deserts of his rural district in eastern Utah. But his hopes of winning a choice committee assignment on Capitol Hill plummeted.
When Representative Karen Shepherd of Salt Lake City cast aside her doubts and voted with the President, she faced a barrage of angry constituent phone calls and letters. While she may well have committed political suicide, she became the darling of the House leadership by providing a critical vote for the budget bill, which passed with only a six-vote margin. 
 Like dozens of other Congressional Democrats, Mr. Orton and Ms. Shepherd must once again walk a political high wire. As they consider how to vote for whatever deficit-reduction package emerges from the House-Senate conference in coming weeks, Democratic lawmakers from conservative states like Utah face a difficult choice.
They can embarrass their President, sink an effort to cut $500 billion in deficit spending over the next five years and face retribution from White House and Congressional leaders. Or they can endanger their own political survival by voting for $250 billion in tax increases.
 
Doubts and Fears
 "Members feel isolated," Ms. Shepherd said. "You have this sense when we go back to the districts of going to get beat up."
In a separate interview, Mr. Orton said, "All I want is to be on the Ways and Means Committee, and the leaders have made it clear that I can only be on Ways and Means if I vote with them. But if I vote with them, I won't be in Washington, because my constituents will throw me out of office."
Over the weeklong Fourth of July recess, the two junior Utah lawmakers took to the stump and met with constituent groups, hoping to muffle the political tremors that will come no matter how they vote on the final deficit package.
At some stops, Ms. Shepherd, 53, distanced herself from Mr. Clinton and promised that she would endorse the final version of the economic package only if it included caps on spending for automatic benefits and a deficit-reduction trust fund. Borrowing pages from Ross Perot's book, she displayed charts and trumpeted her "800" telephone number as she called for term limits and more spending cuts.
 
Learning From Perot
 "Never let it be said I didn't learn from Ross Perot," she said at a Harvard Club luncheon here. At another point she joked, "I thought I'd have to wear a sack over my head because President Clinton seemed to be heading for the 'Guinness Book of World Records' for the number of gaffes over the number of weeks."
If Ms. Shepherd sounds like something less than a true-blue Democrat, it is because of the political realities in her strongly Republican Second Congressional District. A former English teacher and magazine publisher, she eked out a victory last year in a district that had not voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate since 1964, largely because she faced a weak opponent whose strident style offended the sensibilities of this Mormon area.
Ms. Shepherd's campaign was highlighted by a television commercial in which she pledged to vote against any tax increase until the nation's health-care system was overhauled.
Since her election, Ms. Shepherd has emerged as a star of the 114-member freshman class in the House. Her fellow Democratic backbenchers elected her as a leader of their effort to revamp House rules, and the House leadership has selected her to help marshal votes for the President's health-care plan when it is introduced.
 
Winning a Reputation
 By leading an effort to slash spending in the legislative branch, as well as the benefits for former Presidents and House Speakers, Ms. Shepherd has acquired a reputation as a deficit hawk in Washington. But in this district, her votes for abortion rights and the Clinton economic package draped her in the politically untenable cloak of liberalism.
National Republicans have already begun working for her defeat in 1994 by financing radio commercials castigating her for her votes.
At a town hall meeting on Thursday night in Riverton, a staunchly Republican suburb of Salt Lake City, Ms. Shepherd could barely put two sentences together before she was interrupted by angry constituents.
"You promised in the campaign you wouldn't raise taxes," said Michael Zufelt, a 34-year-old tire salesman. "You broke your promise."
Ms. Shepherd responded a hint of contriteness: "Yes, I did. Now I have the opportunity to explain."
 
'You're Wasting Your Time'
 But before she could flip through her flow charts, she was interrupted by Russ Sorenson, the 41-year-old owner of a construction supply company. "If you are here to sell the President's plan, you're wasting your time," he said.
Mr. Orton represents an even more conservative district, the Third, but his string of votes opposing abortion rights and Mr. Clinton's packages to stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit may have inoculated him from political harm.
He has received hundreds of congratulatory telephone calls and letters in recent weeks, and at meetings he has received nothing but approving nods when he explains that he cannot vote for energy taxes that he says are unfair to Westerners who must drive long distances.
The former tax lawyer is among three conservative Democrats who are trying to galvanize the 38 House Democrats who voted against the President's economic package into a bloc that would support the package if Democratic leaders drop all energy taxes, make more spending cuts and attach a modified line-item veto to the bill.
 
Courted by Republicans
 Mr. Orton faces an entirely different political equation than Ms. Shepherd. Since he was elected over a stumbling Republican opponent in 1990, he has retained strong approval ratings, and he has been invited by the Republican Party to switch his allegiance.
Mr. Orton, 44, insists that the Democratic Party needs conservative voices, and he is considering a 1994 challenge to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican. But to run for the Senate he needs to attract contributions, a difficult task because most state and national Democratic groups view him with suspicion.
His slim hopes appear to be based on satisfying Democrats by voting for final passage of the President's package, while protecting his base. He said he could do that as long as the final package excluded the energy taxes and included enough new spending cuts.
Mr. Orton practiced his tightrope act on Friday night at a town hall meeting in Orem, where he said the economic package was being unfairly attacked as simply a tax increase.
The Congressman strongly objected when Lowell H. Christensen, a 70-year-old retired real estate agent, complained that the Democratic Party was deceiving the people by "using words like investment and contribution" to sell the deficit-reduction bill.
"Remember," Mr. Orton responded, "Ronald Reagan coined the term revenue enhancement because he didn't like to use the word 'taxes.' "

HEADLINE: Unions Hammer Out Offer To Try to Revive The Post

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
The labor unions at The New York Post last night put together a package of the financial concessions demanded by Rupert Murdoch when he shut the newspaper on Friday, but it was not clear whether The Post would be able to move away from the edge of extinction.
In a new round of talks prompted by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the unions said they had reached Mr. Murdoch's goal of saving $6.2 million of The Post's annual losses of some $12 million to $15 million. Mr. Murdoch threatened to close the newspaper if the savings were not agreed to, and then carried through on his threat Friday afternoon, while the unions were $1.2 million short of the goal. 
 Early this morning, in what seemed to be a tangible step toward reviving the newspaper, representatives of the drivers union said they had reached an agreement with negotiators for Mr. Murdoch that included savings of $2.2 million.
About 2 A.M., Frank Sparacino, the president of the drivers union, said the agreement was being drawn up but declined to give details, saying only that the union had given up some overtime.
Mr. Sparacino had been optimistic yesterday afternoon. "If there is any agreement, even just verbally, with the 6.2, they will definitely open the paper," he said then.
 
Separate Standoff With Guild
 But as the talks wore on last night, Mr. Murdoch's representatives said they were not sure that the union package added up to the concessions Mr. Murdoch demanded. And a separate standoff with the New York Newspaper Guild, which represents some 290 news, advertising and circulation employees, appeared unresolved. If the 9 production unions besides the drivers reached an agreement and the guild did not, yet another crisis could threaten the newspaper.
Both sides credited Governor Cuomo for pushing them to try again to reach an accord. With midnight calls from the Executive Mansion in Albany to Mr. Murdoch's executives over the weekend and 6 A.M. calls to union leaders yesterday, the Governor orchestrated a complex series of meetings through the afternoon and into the night.
Governor Cuomo said a pact at The Post would require the unions to give Mr. Murdoch the savings he requested while recognizing that Mr. Murdoch would continue to shoulder heavy losses to keep the newspaper functioning.
"I think if it happens," Governor Cuomo said in a telephone interview, "what it will be is a kind of model demonstration of shared sacrifice of a kind, frankly, that is needed in many different places in this country in the middle of this post-recession period."
The leaders of the newspaper's 11 unions met at noon yesterday at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. There they worked on the package to try to satisfy Mr. Murdoch. Although Mr. Murdoch's goal of a $6.2 million savings was a clear one, the union's proposals about how to satisfy it were subject to interpretation.
 
Complex Issues
 The complex issues involved changes in such things as work rules governing the number of employees required for various production tasks and rules for computing overtime payments. At 4 P.M. yesterday, Mr. Murdoch's representatives began meeting with the leaders of the unions separately to discuss whether the union proposals met the target set by Mr. Murdoch.
The talks continued into this morning. Howard J. Rubenstein, Mr. Murdoch's spokesman, said that management representatives had believed earlier in the day that that they had achieved the savings Mr. Murdoch demanded. "We thought there would be a paper tomorrow," he said.
But he said that Mr. Murdoch's representatives were unsure as they began to meet with the union leaders individually that the packages the leaders were offering came to the total savings Mr. Murdoch required.
At one point yesterday evening, Mr. Murdoch's representatives told leaders of the newspaper's pressmen's union that the pressmen's package of proposed savings was inadequate and asked them to return with a better offer. When they returned, the second offer was rejected, prompting high-level talks among union leaders and with Governor Cuomo.
Although it has been common in the past for New York newspapers to insist on "me too" agreements after the unions give one city newspaper concessions, the unusual situation at The Post made it unclear whether that pattern would apply now.
Much of the effort yesterday involved the newspaper's 10 production unions, because Mr. Murdoch's financial demands were aimed at them. But underlying all the maneuvering was a growing uncertainty about the other union, the New York Newspaper Guild.
Mr. Murdoch has demanded that that union grant him broad powers to dismiss employees for a four-month period and to use nonunion subcontractors. He also said he would not honor existing severance obligations. Mr. Murdoch has said those demands are not negotiable.
 
Strike Authorized
 In June, the guild authorized its leaders to call a strike, and guild leaders have said they have assurances from the other unions that they would honor guild picket lines.
Last night, Barry F. Lipton, the guild's citywide president, said there had been no progress on the issues affecting the guild. Despite the narrowing of the financial differences between Mr. Murdoch and the other unions, Mr. Lipton warned that those unions could be drawn into yet another crisis.
"They have indicated they are supporting us," Mr. Lipton said. "As you know, we have a strike vote here which we'd use if we absolutely had to."
It was not clear whether the guild would precipitate a crisis at The Post immediately if it did not reach some settlement.
The guild has appeared divided over whether to fight its own battle with Mr. Murdoch immediately if the other unions reach accords on the financial dispute. Mr. Murdoch would eventually be positioned to try to impose his conditions on the guild. But he would not be able to do so now because he is not formally the newspaper's owner.
If Mr. Murdoch were to reach agreements with the other unions, he could then negotiate with the newspaper's creditors on a purchase plan that would have to be approved by the judge who is overseeing the newspaper's bankruptcy proceeding.
When a purchase was finally completed, perhaps several months from now, Mr. Murdoch could seek to force a confrontation with the guild, which is often described as dependent on newspaper production unions to enforce a strike.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Dams and Levees: Restraint on Nature or Talisman for Flood-Prone Areas?

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The calamitous flooding in the Midwest has rekindled the old debate over whether the United States Corps of Engineers can fool Mother Nature.
Has the $25 billion spent by the Corps through the better part of this century to build 500 dams and 10,000 miles of levees nationwide been a huge pork-barrel boondoggle that fooled only the taxpayers? 
 Given that the current flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers may turn out to be the worst in memory, would the nation have been better off with a less costly approach, like tougher building and insurance regulations in flood-prone areas?
There are no easy answers to these questions about a system of dams and levees whose construction is sometimes likened to the building of China's Great Wall and Egypt's Pyramids. Nobody is suggesting that the system be abandoned because it is periodically overwhelmed. Nor is anybody suggesting a ban on settlement in flood-prone places, especially since many have been occupied as far back as colonial days, when rivers were the primary means of transportation.
 
Some Second Thoughts
 Still, in spite of all the construction, flooding continues to be the most destructive and costly type of natural disaster in the country, according to the United States Geological Survey, and in the last 10 years or so some experts have begun to have second thoughts about dams and levees.
Part of the hesitancy reflects concern over the Federal budget deficit. It is also partly in response to arguments by environmentalists that the projects inevitably fail to control floods as they are intended to, yet still deface or destroy natural areas.
As a result, Congress now gives the Corps of Engineers more money to maintain old dams and levees than to construct new ones. Last year, Congress took the added step of cutting the agency's budget for its staff by almost 10 percent.
Congress now also requires that communities pay a quarter of the cost of new flood control structures, a major inhibiting factor.
 
Controlling Settlement
 Closer to the flood-prone areas themselves, there is a slow but steady growth in the use of building and insurance regulations to control settlement. And questions are being raised about whether property owners who receive Government disaster aid once should be given a grant after a second flood if they fail to take protective action in the interim.
Even before the current flooding, Congress had begun to look at strengthening ways to prevent flood damage. Representative Doug Bereuter, Republican of Nebraska, suggested that Federal incentives be developed to encourage development away from flood-prone areas and encourage property owners already in such areas to buy flood insurance.
President Clinton apparently favors the new direction in flood control policy. In an early budget proposal he called for barge operators on major rivers to share more of the cost of maintaining channels, which are frequently as important to flood control as to navigation.
One notable measure of the evolving view of flood control is that in the current crisis there have been only one or two calls for new dams and levees. More typical of the new thinking was a comment by John Elmore, the chief of operations and readiness for the Corps of Engineers, when he was asked the other day at a Washington news conference if his agency would respond to the flooding with a burst of new building.
"I would caution against a precept that says that we're going to line the banks of all of our streams with levees," he said, "because that's not going to happen and it shouldn't happen."
 
New Centers of Attention
 Until a few years ago, members of Congress and officials of the Corps tended to talk more about the engineering marvels of flood control than the economic and environmental aspects.
But that was when the budget deficit was smaller and environmentalists were less vocal.
"There's been a genuine change for the better in flood control policy," said David Conrad, a water resources specialist for the National Wildlife Federation, which is concerned with the effect of dams and levees on wildlife habitats. "The pace of construction has slowed significantly. But the fight is not over. The pressure to start building again somewhere, some place, never stops. A lot of people still think they can fool Mother Nature. They don't acknowledge that a dam can destroy a habitat or that a levee can end up causing flood damage if it constricts a river to the point that it just bursts free."
The Corps of Engineers argues that no water control system can be perfect. "As long as we have rains, we're going to have some floods," said Jimmy F. Bates, the agency's chief of policy and planning.
Still, Corps officials say the $25 billion spent so far on flood control represents a solid investment. They say their control system has prevented at least $250 billion in flood damage over the years, which works out to a 10 to 1 return on investment.
 
Calculations Challenged
 Opponents of dams and levees question that calculation. "It's nothing but rank speculation because who can say what a river that hadn't been tampered with might have done or might not have done," countered Brent Blackwelder of Friends of the Earth, an environmental group.
Last year when a Federal task force took a detailed look at the nation's flood control efforts, it found that while the efforts had worked in many places, there had been no reduction in the average number of flood deaths each year and flood damage had cost the average American more than twice as much a year going into the 1990's as in the years before World War II, even when adjusted for inflation.
"Overall vulnerability," the report concluded, "has either increased or stayed the same, probably because of the large amount of vulnerable development already in place, numerous exceptions to the state and local policies that would reduce that development, and the fact that population growth, movement and urbanization sometimes take place so quickly or in such unexpected ways that adequate planning and regulation simply cannot be established soon enough to prevent unwise use of flood plain areas."


GRAPHIC: Levees are dams made out of earth and sand, built parallel to a river bank to prevent flooding.
Diagram: "Holding Back the River"
 As early as 2000 B.C., the Egyptians built levees along the banks of the Nile. The levee system for the Mississippi, begun in New Orleans in 1718, is the most extensive in the world, consisting of almost 3,600 miles of main-river and auxiliary levees.
 The higher the levee, the greater the flood protection, at least in theory. But some engineers protest that high levees enclose a river to such a great degree that its water level rises high above the level of the bank.
 This has been the case on the Mississippi, where the extensive levee system has raised the overall level of the river, forcing higher and higher levees to be built. Some embankments now reach 50 feet or more.
 Currently, the system is failing as floodwaters spill over or break through the levees, inundating the farms and communities they were designed to protect. (Sources: Encyclopedia Americana, Army Corps of Engineers)

HEADLINE: Already Shaky Area Losing Key Pillar: Mrs. Paul's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 11

 BODY:
Crescentville looks like a neighborhood from the 1950's, except for all the "For Sale" signs. This blue-collar section of northeast Philadelphia is filled with rows of tidy, two-story brick homes with metal awnings and an occasional ceramic squirrel. Children spin Hula-Hoops on the street and run through the misty rainbows of lawn sprinklers.
But the troubles of the 1990's have arrived within the ill-defined boundaries of Crescentville, where the residential neighborhood bumps against a ghostly industrial area with empty warehouses, closed manufacturing plants and a boarded-up supermarket. 
 Of all the corporate closings, the one with the most emotional punch is coming at the end of this month, when Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, the frozen-seafood company that has been a Philadelphia institution for decades, will shut its doors and take 504 jobs to Omaha.
"It feels bad," said Thomas Matthew, a 49-year-old city employee who lives in Crescentville, noting that many of his neighbors had spent their entire working lives at Mrs. Paul's and felt betrayed.
 
One Blow After Another
 In recent years, the recession and corporate consolidations have cost several thousand Crescentville residents their jobs at the Pathmark supermarket, Sealtest Foods dairy-processing plant, the 3M Company plant, Sears, Roebuck & Company and Exide Battery. And the neighborhood got a bad scare earlier this year when the Pentagon recommended that a naval supply depot at the northern edge of the community be shut down. But the Federal base-closing commission recently gave the station and its 4,500 workers a reprieve.
Philadelphia has seen its once-strong manufacturing base shrink as the city's economy has become more dependent on service industries, including health services. In 1950, 1 in 3 workers held manufacturing jobs; now that ratio is 1 in 10 and dropping.
The closings in Crescentville have rocked the neighborhood, shuttered some nearby shops and encouraged urban blight, which is creeping inexorably closer to Philadelphia's outlying neighborhoods from the inner city. Even city services are declining, said the Rev. Peter D. Burke, pastor of St. Ambrose Roman Catholic Church.
"Trash collectors don't always come," he said, "and people who are moving in aren't voters, so they don't call their council people and complain." Each month, he said, about 25 families of Irish and German heritage leave his parish and are replaced by Asian and Hispanic families, who, he added, are less likely to complain about the decline in services.
 
Confronting the Unexpected
 He said widespread unemployment and an increase in the number of minimum-wage jobs had cast a "whole depression" over the people of Crescentville.
Residents say they never thought that Mrs. Paul's would close, especially since the plant was refurbished just last fall after a fire.
The frozen-seafood business grew from a concession in a local bar into a national brand name, and, in the process, the company and its founder, Edward J. Piszek, became Philadelphia institutions.
Mr. Piszek, who sold the business to the Campbell Soup Company in 1980, said in an interview last week that he started out in 1946 with $350 and a recipe for deviled crab cakes. He soon discovered that fried fish kept its taste after freezing, so, by 1980, he had expanded into a national company that in one year sold more than $100 million worth of frozen fried fish sticks and fillets.
"I called it Mrs. Paul's Kitchens because we tried to prepare the fish like a fussy old lady," Mr. Piszek said. "We referred to the business as 'the Old Lady.' "
 
Polish Philanthropy
 Over the years, Mr. Piszek became a local legend for spreading his fish profits around the world, especially in Poland, his ancestral home. Among other things, he sent Poland a $1 million fleet of vehicles with chest X-ray machines in the 1940's; a dozen years ago, he sent 10 million pounds of codfish cakes to a flood-stricken area of Poland. He also endowed two foundations with a total of $7 million to encourage the teaching of English worldwide "so more people can communicate with each other for world peace and prosperity," he said.
But Mr. Piszek said he had lost $100 million in a bad investment in 1980 and had sold Mrs. Paul's to Campbell's.
Sales for what Mrs. Paul's advertising calls its "crispy, crunchy, breaded" fish products peaked in 1985, then declined 5 percent to 10 percent each year as diet-conscious consumers began eating less fried food, said Elizabeth Hanlin, a spokeswoman for Campbell's.
In February the company announced that it would close the Philadelphia plant and move its operations to Omaha as part of a consolidation program that would cost the company $300 million. The company does not need to be close to a seaport because it deals with frozen fish.
Mr. Piszek resisted the opportunity to criticize Campbell Soup. "I want to be a decent human being, therefore, I don't want to be an angry old man," he said.
Workers say that Campbell Soup pays a good wage, $8 to $14 an hour, and -- until it announced the closing of Mrs. Paul's -- was a good employer.
 
Fear of the Future
 Anxiety, tinged with anger, was palpable among employees as they streamed from the one-story factory after a recent afternoon shift change.
An employee who has worked for Mrs. Paul's for 28 years but who asked that his name be withheld, said: "When we heard about the closing, everybody was talking about taking a $1-an-hour cut in pay, but it turned out to be a done deal. There was no chance to change the minds of the big corporate millionaires."
The closing is worrying John and Nancy McGlynn, who work at the plant and live a few blocks away. They work different shifts so they do not have to hire a baby sitter for their three small children.
"I've worked there 13 years, since I got out of high school," said Mr. McGlynn, who is 31 and operates a packaging machine. "We live from check to check, and the couple thousand in severance pay won't last long. I don't know how we will pay the mortgage with minimum-wage jobs."

The plant, which also employs his wife, Nancy, left, is set to close this month. The McGlynns have three children, Paul, left, and the twins, John Jr. and Jillian.

HEADLINE: Protecting A Fragile Recovery

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Discouraged by recent weak economic reports, Administration officials are nervous that President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan could slow the economy further. But they see no need for an emergency stimulus package because they are confident that growth will pick up in the second half of this year.
Reluctant to start a new battle over economic stimulus after losing one in April -- and not convinced that stimulus is needed now -- the Administration appears resigned to tinkering around the edges of the budget package to insure that any near-damage it causes to the economy will be minimal. 
 Administration officials said they would urge House and Senate negotiators, when hammering out a compromise budget plan, to pay attention to how leaving in or lopping out certain provisions, like investment incentives, would affect growth.
"I would hope that in the process of reconciliation some thought would be given to the signals the economy is giving out," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.
Ms. Tyson said the Administration would soon lower its growth forecast for this year to about 2.5 percent, down from the 3.1 percent prediction it made in January. But she predicted that the economy would grow at a rate of more than 2.5 percent in the second half of this year, a forecast consistent with those of many private-sector economists. That would be considerably more than the sluggish 1.5 percent growth rate that many economists estimate for the first half.
She said that once President Clinton's budget package wins Congressional approval, growth should accelerate because most of the uncertainties nagging at business would disappear.
Many corporate executives say -- and Republicans are quick to echo them -- that the uncertainties surrounding President Clinton's budget package and the forthcoming health plan are undermining business confidence and causing companies to hold off on hiring and new investments.
To help protect the fragile economy, some Administration officials want to urge Congressional conferees to delay the increase in personal income taxes to July 1, the date the Senate has approved, from last Jan. 1, the date the House approved. The theory is that this delay would make consumers feel richer and thus more willing to buy new homes and cars. But some officials argue against such a delay, saying it will deprive the Government of revenues and probably do nothing to lift the economy.
The Administration is also considering whether to stretch out the phase-in period for proposed energy taxes.
Administration officials admit to feeling gun-shy about proposing a new stimulus plan after Senate Republicans defeated the President's $19 billion jobs plan last April. Nonetheless, the President is eager not to be viewed the way many Americans viewed President George Bush: as someone who sat on his hands while the economy floundered.
Administration officials point to Mr. Clinton's strenuous efforts at the Tokyo summit meeting to get Europe and Japan to stimulate their economies and help American exports. Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, growth in those economies is not expected to pick up until next year.
The Administration's view is that President Clinton, by proposing his jobs plan and his $500 billion deficit-reduction package, has demonstrated that he is far more aggressive than his predecessor in seeking to nurse the economy back to health. But some liberal Democrats say that after he campaigned to turn the economy around, the President is not being aggressive enough -- and should not have given up his fight for a stimulus package so soon.
Of course, if the economy stumbles for several more months and Mr. Clinton does not take vigorous action to set things right, he might start hearing complaints that he is being as feckless on the economy as Mr. Bush was often perceived to be.
Historically, deficit-reduction plans bite into economic growth by increasing taxes and cutting Government spending. But this time around, Administration officials are optimistic that Mr. Clinton's package will result in faster growth by pushing down interest rates.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has often said that the drop in long-term interest rates of a full percentage point since last November will give the economy a stimulus equivalent to that of $100 billion in extra Government spending.
Ms. Tyson said most of the benefits of lower rates had still not percolated through the economy. Some of the Administration's economic models show that only 30 percent of the benefits of falling interest rates are felt in the first year, with the remaining 70 percent felt in the subsequent years.
The Republicans are not as sanguine about the effects of the President's budget package, asserting that its $250 billion in tax increases will pull the economy back toward recession. They see the tax increases as ammunition they can use in the 1994 Congressional elections.
Appearing today on CNN's "Newsmaker Sunday," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich acknowledged that taking $500 billion out of the economy through tax increases and spending cuts could hurt the fragile recovery.
 
 
'Legitimate Question
 "If we're taking that much out of the economy in terms of trying to reduce the budget deficit, at the same time we're trying to come out of the gravitational pull of the recession, are we taking out too much too soon?" he asked. "That is a legitimate question."
Ms. Tyson also acknowledged that deficit-reduction plans often slow growth, but she said the drop in interest rates would more than offset this. She said such "fiscal drag" would not become substantial for several years, if at all.
One White House official said it would be inappropriate to float a stimulus proposal now because the Administration is focusing on getting the budget package passed and does not want to see itself -- or Congress -- sidetracked by controversial new economic issues.
In the view of one senior official, the Administration might consider some special stimulus measures if there are several more months of disappointing economic news.
The consensus among Administration officials is that a few weeks of bad economic reports -- coming after huge jumps in employment in April and May -- are not enough to send them scrambling to put together a new stimulus package.
"There's been a tendency to overreact to the June employment figures," when the number of jobs rose by just 13,000, one Administration official said. "We need a clearer picture of what's going on. Once we get the budget package behind us and get some more reliable statistics, then we'll have a better sense of where we are."
Many officials say the economy's recent stumbles demonstrate that the Republicans were misguided to kill President Clinton's $19 billion jobs plan. For their part, Republicans respond that the stimulus package was larded with pork-barrel projects and that the recent economic softness has been caused by Mr. Clinton's proposed tax increases and the uncertainties surrounding his budget package.
With the economy stumbling along, one thing many Administration officials do not want is for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Alicia Munnell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy, said she was confident that inflation would remain in control this year and that as a result, a rate increase would not be needed.

UNIONS AT POST READY CONCESSIONS
The labor unions at The New York Post have put together a package of the financial concessions demanded by Rupert Murdoch when he shut the newspaper on Friday, but it was not clear whether The Post would be able to move away from the edge of extinction. In the new round of talks, which were prompted by Governor Cuomo, the unions said they had reached Mr. Murdoch's goal of saving $6.2 million of The Post's annual losses of about $12 million to $15 million. The unions were $1.2 million short of the target when Mr. Murdoch closed the paper. But Mr. Murdoch's representatives said they were not convinced that the union package added up to the concessions Mr. Murdoch demanded. And a separate standoff with the New York Newspaper Guild, which represents about 290 news, advertising and circulation employees, appeared unresolved. B3.
 
NEW SEX ASSAULT AT CITY POOL
A group of teen-age boys surrounded a 16-year-old girl in an upper Manhattan swimming pool, tore off her bathing suit and fondled her, the police said. Three men were arrested after the incident at Highbridge Park pool in Washington Heights, which the police said was the fifth such attack reported in a New York City pool in less than a week. B3.
 

ELDERLY MAN KILLED IN PURSE-SNATCHING
A 72-year-old man was run over in a parking lot in Bayside, Queens, as he tried to stop a driver from stealing his wife's purse, the police said. The couple was heading toward a Waldbaum's Supermarket in Bayside to buy some groceries when a man pulled up beside them and grabbed the bag. When the husband resisted, the driver reversed, knocking the couple down, and then drove forward, striking the husband, the police said. He died shortly afterward. B3.
 
WHEN PRIVATE SECTOR SERVES BEST
Privatizing government by using contractors is relatively common in New York City, with about $1 in every $10 of the expense budget already going to private companies and organizations under contracts to provide services. But for the most part, it's still bureaucracy-as-usual at City Hall. So for advocates of "city-competitive contracts," the fight is on. Metro Matters, B3.

But what they share above all else is the knowledge that the skills they are learning in the seven-month, $6,000 course are in hot demand. Indeed, at a time when employment in many blue- and white-collar fields continues to sputter, there are persistent calls for cosmetologists. Currently, some 40,000 jobs across the nation are estimated to be unfilled. Strictly Business, B6.
 
REGION
 
NEW VOICES IN THE CATSKILLS
The crisp air and cool shade of the Catskills are still ambrosia to vacationers, but in the former Borscht Belt, many of the voices are now Korean and Russian, people flocking to places like Swan Lake because the landscapes remind them of the mountains near Seoul or in the Urals. The Yiddish is spoken by Hasidim who have replaced more secular Jews as the mainstay of the area's bungalow colonies. As the Catskills grow more diverse, the region is showing signs of stemming the economic slide that over the years forced many of its resorts to close. A1.
 
NEW LINE OF COMICS HAS HIP-HOP HEROES
From his cramped office in Edison, N.J., Roland Laird has created a line of comic books that feature young black men who sport flattop haircuts and frequent dance clubs and face real-life problems like police harassment and street violence. Mr. Laird, 32, is the owner of Posro Komics, the only black-owned comic-book company in New Jersey and one of about 20 nationwide. B5.
 
TENTATIVE DEAL IN GARBAGE STRIKE
Union officials and representatives of 39 trash haulers in New Jersey reached a tentative agreement that may lead to the end of an 11-day walkout that has disrupted garbage collection in 14 counties. The tentative contract calls for a 5 percent wage increase over each of three years, and the continuation of employer health-care contributions at their current level, said John Tesauro, executive director of the state Board of Mediation.

HEADLINE: Even as Heat Eases Slightly, Its Toll Rises

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Like an oven turned down from broil to bake, the New York region cooled oh-so-slightly yesterday from the oppressive, triple-digit heat wave that has left the area simmering, the first sign of a more bearable week to come.
But with temperatures remaining in the mid-90's, the drop from last week's 100-plus temperatures was too little, too late. New York City emergency workers recorded the city's second heat-related death, and businesses tallied up another devastatingly slow day in a week that has seen few customers venture onto sizzling sidewalks. 
 The city's emergency medical workers were still working in overdrive, with more than 2,200 calls logged by mid-afternoon, said Robert Leonard, an Emergency Medical Service spokesman.
 
Elderly Woman Dies
 Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's Medical Examiner, reported yesterday that a 96-year-old woman had died on Friday from the heat. The woman, whose name was not released, died early Friday evening at Coler Memorial Hospital of hypothermia and exposure to heat, Ms. Borakove said.
A hospital spokeswoman said the elderly woman, a longterm patient at the hospital, died in the garden, where she was sitting in her wheelchair. It was not clear whether she was attended at the time. "We're still investigating," said Phyllis Daniels, the spokeswoman for the hospital, which is run by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation.
The death of a 37-year-old Brooklyn man on Friday was also attributed to the heat, as was the death on Thursday of a 40-year-old man in Brooklawn, N.J.
Despite yesterday's high of 97 degrees, after three straight days of 100 degrees or more, weather forecasters expect the heat wave to subside over the next several days as a cool front moves into the area.
 
Effect on Businesses
 Such news is likely to cheer many business owners whose sales have withered in the searing heat. Throughout the region sidewalk cafes were deserted and laundromats were distinctly unpopular. And despite air-conditioning, some retail giants like Macy's saw a drop in traffic.
Georgia Young, Macy's weekend manager, said that while the store was busy there were fewer customers yesterday than on a typical summer weekend. And slow traffic at Macy's, the anchor store in Herald Square, put a crimp in business nearby.
The Florsheim shoe shop, across Broadway from Macy's, was nearly empty most of the day.
"We have seen a $3,000 drop in business since Tuesday," said Morris Foli, a salesmen who was sitting on a bank of seats that customers usually occupy.
 
Air-Conditioner Gave Out
 Lisa Grande, the manager of International Haircutters on West 66th Street in Manhattan, said the salon had lost about $1,000 in business since the air-conditioning system gave out on Wednesday.
"It was about 110 degrees in here from Wednesday until Saturday afternoon," she said. "Almost no one came in."
The few customers who did arrive were mostly men who just wanted hair cuts. Almost everyone passed on the blow-dryer.
Sunny skies and warm temperatures usually draw crowds to the South Street Seaport. But some businesses there said the weekend's warmth was too much of a good thing.
At the Liberty Cafe, a restaurant on the south side of Pier 17, business was off by 50 percent. Nelson Tejada, the manager, said the number of meals served dropped from 300 to about 150 a day. And he said a drop in temperatures to the 90's would not bring customers back.
"We need a breeze," he said, "and a drop to the mid-80's."
In the stifling heat, customers were passing on the free miniature golf on the roof of Casey O'Toole's Tavern in Fairfield, N.J. The manager and part-owner, Walter Kaminski, said business at the bar had been steady but people were not eating as much.
"Fifteen to 20 percent more beer is being sold," said Mr. Kaminski, noting that even hard-liquor drinkers were choosing beer.
 
The Bottom Line
 It was too early to determine yesterday how extensive the losses to businesses would be, and Wallace L. Ford 2d, New York City's Commissioner of Business Services, said his office had not received reports of serious problems caused by the heat.
"Typically," he said, "there is a connection between weather and business. Some small businesses are particularly vulnerable to weather conditions. So far we have heard of no unusual problems. But if next Sunday we are still looking at temperatures in the high 90's, or going past the 100-degree mark, we may start hearing about some serious problems from people trying to cope with the impact on their businesses."
But for some store owners, the impact is already real enough. Michael Rezay, the manager of the First Look, a women's clothing store on Seventh Avenue one block north of Macy's, said customers do not want want to try on clothes in the heat.
"We have not had a strong day since the July 4th weekend," he said.
 
Ice Skating, Anyone?
 Still, what was a curse for some was a blessing for others.
Movie theaters and appliance stores, for example, saw a predictable upturn in sales as people slipped into the cool, dark cinemas or into stores to buy fans and air-conditioners. On Saturday, Sky Rink, the indoor ice-skating rink on West 33d Street, saw its business triple as skaters sought refreshment on the ice.
John Sheridan, one of the managers, said the most frequently asked question there yesterday was: "Can I borrow a sweater or sweatshirt from the lost-and-found?"
At the Manufacturers Surplus Outlet Furniture Store in Fairfield, N.J., wicker and rattan furniture was selling well this week, said Chris DeLisa, 19, whose father owns the store.
But the store's supply of fans had sold out. "If we had them now we'd be millionaires," said Mr. DeLisa.
 
Relief in Sight
 Some businesses, like Tavern on the Green, the popular restaurant in Central Park, seem immune to forces of nature. Thomas Monetti, managing director of the restaurant, said business was up for the week despite the closing of the garden on Friday and Saturday. But in order to keep customers cool the restaurant had to increase its air-conditioning by 35 percent.
Mr. Monetti might be able to cut back the air-conditioners in the next couple of days, however. "The worst is over," said Daniel Graf, a meteorologist with the Weather Communications Group, consultants based at Penn State who monitor weather patterns throughout the country.
A front from the Midwest is expected to move in late today, bringing the temperatures slightly down, to the mid-80's by tomorrow. A second front, pushing down from Canada and the Great Lakes, should move into the region by Thursday, forcing the thermometers as low as 80 degrees.
Mr. Graf said that the intense heat in the region had been caused by a high-pressure zone that has stalled about 20,000 feet over the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states. To the west, a trough of low-pressure at about the same level has caused extreme flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri River valleys. The normal flow of the jet-stream, which carries weather systems from west to east, had been blocked until recently by a large high pressure area that had stalled near Greenland.
Any relief this week will be more than welcome, said Michele McClary, a 32-year-old secretary, who was at the South Street Seaport enjoying the East River breeze with her fiance Andre Joyner. She said the couple, both from Jersey City, had spent the last week lying naked under a fan. "This weekend we came here to get a breeze," she said. "And we want to be near the water more next weekend, if it cools off."

HEADLINE: A Trade Agreement Born of Political Necessity;
A New Approach To Old Problems

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 11

 BODY:
The trade agreement announced by the United States and Japan on Saturday is supposed to set a new course for economic relations between the world's two largest economies.
The so-called framework is aimed at reducing Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States and the rest of the world as well as soothing trade tensions between the American and Japanese Governments. 
 But the framework, a vaguely worded document developed through hasty but arduous negotiations last week, only sets the stage for more negotiations -- and probably, more arguments. Almost as soon as the new agreement was announced, Japan and the United States were differing over interpretation.
Following are basic questions about the agreement and the answers, based on a reading of the document and the assessment of trade officials:
Q. What is the framework?
A. The framework is a statement of directions and principles for negotiations over more specific negotiations to open Japan's markets for particular products or alter its economy.
It also sets up a mechanism for continued consultations over the next two years or more, including twice-a-year meetings between the President and the Prime Minister.
In addition, the framework contains a commitment by Japan to take steps to bring about a "highly significant" reduction in its current-account surplus "over the medium term" and for the United States to reduce its budget deficit.
Q. What are the principles governing future negotiations?
A. Trade agreements negotiated under the framework are to include "objective criteria" to measure progress in improving market access. The indicators will be determined through negotiation for each specific treaty, but they could include things like the share of Japan's market held by foreign products or the number of foreigners on standards-setting committees.
Q. How is the framework different from previous American approaches to trade with Japan?
A. In the past, the United States has pursued two separate approaches. One has been to push for opening markets in specific sectors, like semiconductors or glass. The other has been to push for structural changes in Japan's economy, like eliminating cartels, that could lead to increased sales of many different kinds of foreign products. The framework combines these approaches.
Another big difference, American officials say, is that the specific agreements negotiated under the rules of the framework will be more "results oriented" than past agreements because progress will be measured.
"What you have is something that goes far, far further toward explicitness and clarity and deadlines and schedules than anything you have ever seen before," said W. Bowman Cutter, chief American negotiator and deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council.
While that may be true in general, there have been specific agreements in the past, like the semiconductor trade accord, that were more explicit in terms of targets or deadlines than the new framework.
Q. What areas will be subject to negotiation?
A. The framework talks will cover five categories. One category will be talks aimed at increasing Japanese Government procurement of foreign products, particularly computers, satellites, medical technology and telecommunications. United States Government procurement practices will also be discussed.
Another is changing regulations that impede market access, like in financial services. A third, called "other major sectors," will aim at increasing sales in Japan of foreign autos and auto parts. A fourth, economic harmonization, will address issues that make it difficult for foreign concerns to buy land or companies in Japan. The fifth is implementation of existing trade accords.
Q. What is the timetable?
A. The United States and Japan are to forge specific agreements covering Government procurement, the insurance market, automobiles and other high-priority areas in six months. Other trade agreements are expected to be finished in a year. After two years, both Governments will decide whether to extend consultations in the framework beyond the fall of 1995.
Q. Does the framework set targets for Japan?
A. The framework does not mention targets, though it does not rule them out. The objective criteria are meant to provide an agreed-upon way for both sides to measure progress. But, according to Japan's interpretation at least, the agreements negotiated under the framework will not contain goals on how much progress should be made. The United States might try to include such language in the specific agreements.
Q. Won't that lead to arguments?
A. There is a danger of this. While the two nations have agreed on a way to measure progress, they seem likely to argue over whether the progress has been sufficient.
Q. What will happen if the United States is not satisfied with Japan's progress in a particular area?
A. The agreement says both nations will exercise "utmost efforts" to resolve disputes through negotiations or through multilateral forums like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the United States has not given up the right to impose sanctions on Japan under Section 301 of American trade law. In a side letter to the agreement that has not been made public, Japan says it reserves the right to drop out of any negotiations if faced with a threat of sanctions, according to Japanese officials.
Q. Will this agreement work to increase sales of American products in Japan or to reduce Japan's trade surplus with America?
A. There is reason for optimism and pessimism. There have been a series of trade treaties over the years. Many work to some extent in increasing Japan's imports of particular products. Agreements with targets, like the semiconductor agreement and the private-sector auto parts agreement, have increased sales of American products in Japan. It is not clear how well agreements will work that contain measures of results but not targets.
Despite the success of some individual trade agreements, however, Japan's trade surplus over all has not gone down. Similarly, pledges by the United States to reduce its budget deficit have not been fulfilled.
Q. How will the agreement affect other countries?
A. The agreement stipulates that the benefits of Japan's market-opening measures will accrue to all nations, not only the United States.
But this has not calmed European complaints that Japanese procurement under United States-Japan trade agreements favor American products. That is partly because it is the United States that is putting the pressure on Japan. In addition, in the new framework, the sectors chosen as targets for market opening, like supercomputers and telecommunications, are ones in which the United States is particularly strong.
There are other concerns, as well. To the extent this bilateral approach catches on, it could undermine efforts to forge worldwide agreements, like the GATT talks. And some rapidly developing nations in East Asia have expressed fears that the United States might try to negotiate similar agreements with them.

HEADLINE: Recalling July '36, When Streets and Dentures Melted

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The biggest difference between the current heat wave and the one that held New York City in its grip 57 years ago is air-conditioning.
When the temperature in Central Park hit 106 degrees on July 9, 1936 -- an all-time record -- methods of staying cool were short on technology, and sometimes long on moxie. In one case, the heat got so bad for 20 unemployed men and women that they staged a protest at the Home Relief Bureau to demand ice. 
 Before air-conditioning, it was not unusual for businesses to shut down in a heat wave, for workers to faint on the job and for people to sleep on their roofs. And no other heat wave in the United States was ever hotter or deadlier than the one in July 1936.
"That still stands as the great heat wave of the whole nation," said Paul Knight, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. "People were dying because they were losing their common sense."
Nationwide, 997 people died in the 10-day heat wave, 76 in the New York area. Twenty-one of the deaths in New York were drownings, as children and adults who could not swim jumped into the water anyway seeking relief. Other city residents tried to stick to their normal routines, and collapsed on their roofs, in their apartments, even on commuter trains. A 29-year-old janitor died next to the hot-water boiler in his building.
 
She Remembers It Well
 "People had to get out of the streets, but the subway was smothering, withering," said Pearl Levy, now 95 years old, who lived in the Bronx at the time. Mrs. Levy said she remembers the heat wave's devastating effect on the city, even if she can't remember the exact year.
"I remember distinctly that when I walked out on the street, it was like the street was full of hot steam," she said. "The heat came up from the sidewalk and it would envelop your whole body and face."
The 1936 heat wave began in early July over the northwestern plains and lingered over the Middle West, making a severe drought in many states even worse. By the time the front reached New York on July 8, much of the country was blanketed by hot, sweltering air.
New York was by no means the state hardest hit by the 1936 heat wave. It was the only time temperatures of 120 degrees were recorded outside the desert Southwest, in places like Arkansas, Kansas and North and South Dakota. Fifteen states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, set records for high temperatures that have yet to be broken. Canada also suffered under the heat, with Ontario alone reporting more than 500 deaths.
But the blazing sun took a special revenge on the pavement of New York. People who remember it say the heat was overwhelming. But not being accustomed to air-conditioning then, they were also more prepared to sweat it out than people are now.
Nonetheless, anyone who could leave New York did. The roads out of the city were packed with refugees from the baking pavement.
Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, who was spending the summer in his country home, tried to accommodate the sweltering masses left in the city. After about a dozen people were arrested for sleeping on public beaches, he ordered them released and said there would be no more arrests for the duration of the heat wave. The Parks Department kept the city's pools open until midnight.
Many stories of that heat wave and its effects resemble the ones being told by New Yorkers this week. City dwellers crowded the local beaches and parks. Firefighters traveled through their neighborhoods shutting fire hydrants. Officials warned of water shortages and asked people not to use their sprinklers.
But some of the tales are from another era. Women lost their shoe heels in asphalt, and tar melted under the sun. Police officers in Brooklyn tried to revive a horse that collapsed in an intersection. Three Harlem River drawbridges swelled by the heat could not close properly after opening for a tugboat.
And The New York Times entertained its readers with the following report: "In Syracuse, on one of the main streets, a housewife fried an egg on the pavement; at Perry, N.Y., an absent-minded man who left his false teeth on the window sill returned within an hour to find them melted away."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Magazines;
The Lessons of Recession Help Magazines Lure New Readers and Advertisers

BYLINE: By Deirdre Carmody

 BODY:
As anxiety about the second half of 1993 replaces the optimism that swept the magazine industry earlier this year, publishers are fundamentally altering the way they woo advertisers and readers.
The recession taught magazines that advertisers were fair-weather friends, quick to pull out when things got tough. It was a bitter lesson for the publishers, who depended on advertising for most of their revenue, and led many of them to court readers as fervently as advertisers. 
 Five years ago, for instance, 60 percent of the revenues from Time Inc.'s magazines came from advertising and the rest from circulation. Today it is an even split.
But reading habits have changed so drastically in recent years that magazines have had to find new ways to lure readers. Increasingly, they have turned to so-called niche publications, narrowly targeted to readers with special interests.
Some have originated as one-shot issues in response to news events, like People magazine's special issue on Audrey Hepburn, which was published almost immediately after the actress died on Jan. 20. Others, like "Find the Real You," first published last year by YM, a magazine for teen-agers, have proved so successful that they are repeated annually.
Some have come about simply because an opportunity was so tantalizing that publishers abandoned normal publication procedures. The University of Alabama's victory over the University of Miami in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 was one.
Sports Illustrated wrote about the game but did not feature the story on the cover. When local distributors in Alabama said they could sell out the issue if the Sugar Bowl was on the cover, the magazine reprinted 200,000 copies with a new cover and shipped them to Alabama within 24 hours where they sold out immediately. Sports Illustrated then produced a 96-page commemorative issue that highlighted Alabama's entire season.
"If you know anything about Alabama football fans, you know that Alabama football is only slightly more important than God," said Roger Jackson, the publicity director for the magazine. "Within 24 hours, 550,000 copies sold out."
Ladies' Home Journal plans to produce seven or eight special publications in the next 12 months. Four will be part of a so-called Leading Lady series, which will focus on a celebrity and have advertising from a single sponsor. The first, which will appear on July 27 on newsstands, will be devoted to Katharine Hepburn and will be sponsored by Cover Girl Cosmetics.
Like most special magazines, it is a relatively inexpensive venture, relying on pages of pictures that have already appeared and an interview with Myrna Blyth, the editor-in-chief of Ladies' Home Journal. Four hundred thousand copies will be printed.
"The magazine industry is changing," said Michael T. Carr, the president and chief executive of Weider Publications Inc., which is based in Woodland Hills, Calif., and publishes Muscle & Fitness and Shape. "Leisure time is at a premium. The four-day week was a myth of the 50's. Mass media was in vogue in the 60's, but now everything is special interest."
Shape magazine was started in 1981 in response to demand from women who had found that fitness was a good way to combat stress. Shape's circulation has grown to more than 800,000 and it is now spawning spinoff magazines.
On May 27 Weider published 250,000 copies of Shape's Guide to a Fit Pregnancy. Mr. Carr said the magazine sold out in 6 of the 10 major United States markets. He said he planned to put out 500,000 copies of a second issue next spring. He is also planning another Shape special for readers over 35 who are looking for a different exercise regimen than the magazine's core younger readers.
Then there are the spinoffs of the spinoffs. Next week Shape will introduce its "Do It Right" videos, which will be available in supermarkets, large retail stores and video stores. A line of Shape clothing, which was started last year, has generated $10 million in sales, Mr. Carr said.
"All that did not exist 18 months ago, and I have just begun," he said. "The bottom line is anywhere our readers consume information, we will supply it -- interactive software, videos, magazines, specials and clothing."
The time appears ripe for imaginative new ways of acquiring revenue, as magazine advertising continues to be erratic. After a strong first quarter this year, advertising pages dipped in April. Pages were up slightly for May and down again for June.
While some magazines are doing well, publishers say ad spending for the second half of the year may be lower than predicted. Marketers are trimming ads, renegotiating deals and delaying commitments. Fourth-quarter spending is uncertain.
"In the last quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993, I could sense an uptick of consumer confidence, volume and ad spending," said Jack Kliger, the publisher of Glamour. "But the Clinton Presidency has sort of settled into its rough waters and the economy has resultingly slowed down. When things get tight, advertisers and marketers resort to promotional short-term fixes like spot TV and couponing, and ad budgets get rearranged."
Francis Pandolfi, the publisher of Times Mirror Magazines, said he thought magazines would have to change the way they did business to compete. For instance, he said, Times Mirror publishes outdoor magazines and stages events for advertisers like ski races that other magazine companies are unable to match.
"We have hundreds of assets, and we have to present them more effectively than we ever have before," he said. "You have to go back and offer more than a page of space. If I present a package that is one-fifth advertising, the advertiser may say to me, 'I can get a better deal at Hearst.' "
He added: "Today, what you have is a lot of added value -- if you buy my page, I'll give tickets for the ball game or a page of space in my trade magazines -- and generally that's given away. We have to change from added value to a genuine marketing- value approach. And then, we have to charge for it."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Possible OPEC Price War Threatens Oil Company Prospects.

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
JUST as things were looking up for the oil industry, talk of a huge surplus has raised the specter of falling prices for crude -- and a grim turn in the fortunes of the big oil companies.
The leaders have sprung back to life this year after low demand for their products had depressed earnings and forced huge write-offs. The 22 largest American oil companies showed profits of $4.1 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to a loss of about $900 million in the 1992 quarter. 
 But last month's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries left a sword of Damocles hanging over the industry. It became clear that Kuwait was not willing to abide by its production quota, setting up fears of price wars that could pull a barrel of oil below the current $18. Some OPEC nations are already exceeding quotas.
Further promoting the uncertainty were comments by the United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, that the United States would not object to Iraq's beginning to export oil if it met certain conditions.
The price of crude has continued to drop, mostly because of the possibility of Iraq's putting about 400,000 barrels a day on the export market if its talks with the United Nations to ease sanctions succeed.
Michael Mayer, an oil analyst for Wertheim Schroder, predicts that the Iraqi production could cause the price to drop by another $1 to $2 a barrel. A decline of that size could significantly erode profits of the big oil companies, whose stock prices as a group have fallen faster in the last six weeks than has the overall market.
Mr. Mayer estimated that the shares of the 15 largest companies could lose about 10 percent of their value, though not much more than that. "Over the years, as the market has watched the price of oil go up and down, it has built in the expectation that OPEC will react," he said.
The three major companies most vulnerable to the fall in crude prices are British Petroleum, ARCO and Amerada Hess. That is because their stock prices are high and they are heavily weighted toward producing crude oil.
Over all, the industry is better prepared now for price instability. It has been phasing out old refineries, reducing capacity in the last year by 600,000 barrels a day out of total capacity of about 15 million. It has cut jobs, spun off marginal subsidiaries and tightened spending on exploration.
But Michael Young, an oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, does not believe this is enough to protect the industry.
In the past, he said, the oil companies could cushion such a fall by getting higher prices for refined products like gasoline, jet fuel and heating oil. Margins on those products benefit from the low prices of crude oil.
But such a strategy can work only if demand for those products is high, which is not the current case. While motorists are shaking off the effects of the recession and driving more, the price of gasoline has remained low in the face of rising demand.
"Demand is growing," Mr. Mayer said, "but it is growing slowly."
One encouraging prospect remains. The OPEC producers are expected to pull back if they see that cheating on quotas is leading to big price drops.
Since 1986, when the price of oil fell to $10 a barrel, from $27 a barrel the previous year, Mr. Mayer said, OPEC has taken corrective measures when prices reached $15 to $16. Emergency meetings were called and production cutbacks were able to stem the huge drops of the past.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Alternatives to Treasuries Grow

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
With interest rates on Treasury securities at the lowest levels in 20 years or more, investors who rely on bonds are continuing to seek higher yields. For individuals, the primary alternatives are municipal bonds, on which the interest payments are exempt from Federal income tax and the state and local income taxes of the issuing state.
For middle-income taxpayers paying a 31 percent Federal income tax, yields on high-quality tax-exempt bonds are well above those on Treasury and investment-grade corporate issues of similar maturity. 
 On Friday, yields on Treasury issues ranged from 3.96 percent for two-year notes to 4.99 percent for a five-year issue, 5.73 percent for a 10- year bond and 6.64 percent for 30-year bonds. Assuming a Federal income tax burden of 31 percent, the yield comes to only 2.73 percent for two-year notes, 3.44 percent for five years, 3.95 percent for 10 years and 4.58 percent for the 30-year bond.
 
 
Shorter Maturity Favored
 In comparison, tax-exempt bonds rated triple A carry yields of about 3.40 percent for two years, 4.25 percent for five years, 4.9 percent for 10 years and 5.65 percent for 30 years. This means that a five-year tax-exempt issue that is rated triple A yields more than a 10-year Treasury issue, after taxes. The shorter maturity on the tax-exempt issue is preferable to many investors, because if interest rates rise, the price of the five-year issue will fall only two-thirds as much as that of the 10-year issue.
But even with the yield advantage of top-quality municipals, compared with Treasury securities, the desire for still higher yields is leading many investors to seek lower-rated municipal issues. Medium-grade municipal bonds rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service carry yields ranging from about 4.75 percent for bonds due in five years to 5.45 percent for 10-year issues and 6 percent for 20-year maturities, according to Municipal Market Data in Boston.
Douglas Casey, a managing director at the Gates Capital Corporation, notes that the combination of strong demand for Baa issues and the heavy supply of triple-A issues has caused the yield spread between those categories to decline from about six-tenths of a percentage point last year to approximately four-tenths of a point.
The extra yield for buying the lower-quality issues may not be worth it, he said, since prices of those issues tend to weaken more when interest rates rise and investors are not so avidly seeking higher yields. Gates Capital is a New York firm that specializes in advising investment managers on bonds.
 
 
Pre-Refunded Issues
 Among triple-A-rated bonds, a category that has never before been in such ample supply, Mr. Casey recommends pre-refunded issues to investors who seek the same safety as with Treasury issues, but want a higher yield. Pre-refunded bonds are those that local governments have refunded with a new bond issue. The old bonds, however, cannot be retired because they have been protected from retirement for a specified period: usually 10 years from the date of issuance. Until the retirement date comes, the bonds are backed by a pool of Treasury securities, guaranteeing interest and principal payments.
The supply of triple-A-rated bonds is at a record level because about 40 percent of new municipal bonds issued this year have been sold with insurance, according to the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, the largest such insurer. According to David H. Elliott, the corporation's chairman, insurance is up from 30 percent of the market in 1991 and 16 percent in 1986, because "it is very popular with the individual investors who dominate that market and who want high quality."
Another alternative for institutional investors seeking higher yields has been mortgage-backed securities. These are sold with an indicated range of likely maturities and yields, with the exact level depending on how rapidly mortgages are repaid.
The uncertainties are enough to deter many institutional buyers, which is one reason why the securities offer yields that exceed those of Treasury securities by six-tenths of a percentage point to more than two percentage points, depending on the issue.
 
New Risks in Mortgage Market
 The uncertainty of maturity is not new to the mortgage market. But with interest rates so low, the risks of the mortgage market are changing, noted Andrew Kowalczyk, a vice president at Descap Securities in New York.
"Now there is a growing concern that investors are vulnerable to unexpected extension of maturities on the securities they own," Mr. Kowalczyk said. If interest rates rise, and the rate at which homeowners are refinancing their mortgages slows, securities sold with an expected life of only a few years may endure for 10 years or more, he noted.
Although securities dealers promote planned amortization class mortgage securities -- or PAC's -- as a solution to the uncertain maturity and cash flow of mortgage issues, there are still risks.
One recent PAC issue of securities backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, was recently sold on the assumption that the rate of prepayments on the backing mortgages would range from 135 percent PSA to 247 percent PSA. PSA is a standard measure of prepayments, with a 100 percent rate corresponding to an average life of mortgages of about 15 years, which was standard in the mid-1980's, when the rating system was developed.
Should the rate of prepayment on the 7.5 percent mortgages backing this PAC issue slow to 100 PSA -- "not an unreasonable assumption at all," said Philip H. Engel, vice president at Descap -- the average life of the issue would rise to 15.25 years from the initial estimate of 3.4 years.
 
Pools of Old Mortgages
 Curiously, while mortgages with rates as low as 8.5 to 9.5 percent are being repaid at record rates -- repayments in June rose to an annual rate of more than 52 percent on some pools of 8.5 percent mortgages -- there are pass-through securities backed by pools of old mortgages of 13 to 15 percent, which are being repaid at much slower rates. The remaining mortgages may exist because the homeowners are unaware that lower rates are available, cannot afford the closing costs on a new loan, or cannot qualify for one.
Mr. Kowalczyk noted that a 14 3/4 percent issue of Fannie Mae was now worth about 119, to yield 6.93 percent if prepayments were fast enough to produce a three-year average life or 8.44 percent if prepayments are slower and produce a four-year average life. In either case, the return is far higher than Treasury securities.
Mr. Kowalczyk warned that buying a single issue of high coupon pass-throughs would be risky, because the prepayment of a few mortgages in a much shrunken pool of securities could drastically reduce the security's yield. But for large buyers, like banks or mutual funds, a portfolio consisting of the tiny remaining pieces from several dozen different pools is diversified enough that prepayments of a few mortgages in a single pool will not be a serious blow.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton, Emerging Asia Hand

 BODY:
Maybe President Clinton should travel abroad more often. He has left the country only twice in his first six months in office, but both trips -- April's Vancouver summit meeting with Boris Yeltsin and the just completed journey to Tokyo and Seoul -- have burnished Mr. Clinton's Presidential image and advanced American interests in important parts of the world.
The Asia-Pacific region, which includes the Americas, now accounts for 60 percent of world output, and 40 percent of U.S. trade is trans-Pacific. Yet changing political and security forces in the region pose a challenge to American policy. The cold war is over, the old political order has crumbled in countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and China stands poised between a bright future of market-oriented growth and the serious risk of political convulsions when Deng Xiaoping passes on. 
 On both immediate and longer-term problems, Mr. Clinton showed a sure hand.
Take, for example, Japan's critical July 18 election, in which Washington's longtime favorite, the Liberal Democratic Party, faces its first real defeat since it was formed in 1955. While treating his Liberal Democratic host, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, with respect, Mr. Clinton also met with two of Mr. Miyazawa's challengers.
In his public remarks, he declined to endorse any particular party, but spoke in favor of "change," particularly the kind of change that would take more account of Japanese consumers, and, of course, of American exporters who want to compete for their yen. That neatly reflects America's real interest: a more competitive politics that responds better to the needs of ordinary Japanese, not just those of big business and rice farmers. In Korea, the immediate problem is North Korea's rejection of international nuclear inspections. Both the Clinton Administration and the South Korean Government of President Kim Young Sam favor a carrot-and-stick approach, putting diplomacy first so long as North Korea remains within international agreements.
But both leaders face pressure from more hawkish elements. By visiting Seoul, by traveling to the bristling North-South frontier at Panmunjom and by reaffirming America's commitment to maintain troops in South Korea, Mr. Clinton reassures nervous South Koreans and buys time for continued diplomacy.
More broadly, Mr. Clinton endorsed new Asian moves toward regional collective security, an approach previous American Administrations opposed. Traditional cold war alliances like those with Tokyo, Seoul and Manila should be maintained. But Moscow is no longer the main threat. American guarantees would have little relevance in a hypothetical conflict between, say, Japan and Korea. Broad regional pacts, similar to NATO, can provide added insurance against local conflicts.
On economic issues, new region-wide organizations also need to be strengthened. Mr. Clinton gave a strong endorsement to the 15-member forum on Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. The United States holds the forum's rotating chairmanship this year and will host its annual meeting, scheduled for Seattle in November. Mr. Clinton will attend and invites other heads of state to join him.
For a President not known for interest in foreign policy, Mr. Clinton is off to a promising start in Asia.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Mr. Clinton Abroad

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
The G-7 meeting in Tokyo, however lasting its achievements, was a political triumph for Bill Clinton. A President who has so often stumbled in the White House was sure-footed in a tricky foreign environment.
Aside from the big surprise -- agreement on a framework to correct the trade imbalance with Japan -- Mr. Clinton was impressive in gestures outside the G-7 forum. When he met President Suharto of Indonesia, for example, he raised human rights abuses in East Timor, which Indonesia occupies. The situation there cries out for attention, but few American Presidents have been ready to deal with it. 
 The personal success of the Tokyo trip is a fair peg for an early assessment of Mr. Clinton in foreign affairs. Foreign issues have inevitably pressed on him, despite his efforts to stick to his domestic last.
To start with the credits, one Clinton action was an outstanding example of Presidential courage and wisdom. That was his decision, announced over the Fourth of July weekend, to extend the current moratorium on U.S. nuclear tests for at least 15 months -- and longer if no other countries test.
It was a difficult decision, made against the urgings of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the advice of the Secretaries of State and Defense. Why Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who knows about these things, should have supported the feeble arguments of the laboratories is a mystery. But he did, and it took backbone for the President to say no.
With negotiating skill and luck, Mr. Clinton's decision could mean the permanent end of nuclear tests. The President called for early negotiations on a comprehensive test ban -- which would help greatly to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons.
After a hesitant start, President Clinton grasped the issue of aid to Boris Yeltsin's Russia and led the effort that ended in Tokyo with an agreed aid package. The Administration handled the perennial problem of most-favored-nation trade status for China with skill, extending M.F.N. but with a serious demand for human rights improvements by next year.
The most spectacular Clinton act abroad, the missile attack on Baghdad, can hardly be rated a success by either hawks or doves. Lopping two floors off an intelligence headquarters will not make Saddam Hussein tremble. And the claimed legal basis for unilateral action was dubious.
The Baghdad raid had the air of something urged by David Gergen to boost Mr. Clinton's domestic poll ratings. It did that, but in the rest of the world the reaction was mostly negative -- and not only from the left. In South Africa, where I was, the newspaper Business Day spoke contemptuously of "Rambo Clinton."
The great foreign-policy failure of Mr. Clinton's first six months is not in doubt. After much huffing and puffing about the need for stronger measures to stop Serbian aggression in Bosnia, Mr. Clinton did nothing that mattered. To this day the horror continues. In Sarajevo water and electricity supplies have failed. The World Health Organization warns of "catastrophe" on a scale unseen in Europe since World War II.
The non-policy in Bosnia is more than a human disaster. It signals Mr. Clinton's unwillingness or inability to do what George Bush funked: supply the vision of a security system for Europe and the Atlantic after the cold war.
To use the word vision is to identify a major reason for its felt lack in President Clinton's foreign policy. His Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, is a superb lawyer. He did the country great service in his dogged negotiations to end the Iran hostage crisis in 1980. But he has no larger sense of strategy, no strength as a policy maker.
Mr. Christopher did himself mortal damage when he said all sides in Bosnia were guilty of human rights violations, thus ignoring the role of Serbian leaders as inciters of genocide. But the problem Mr. Christopher presents to the President is broader. The Times of London put it last month:
"Mr. Christopher may have qualities, but dynamism, creativity, vision and leadership are not among them. If the Clinton Mark II Presidency, launched at home, is to take shape abroad, the search must start for a secretary of state worthy of the name."

HEADLINE: PULSE: The Port of New York and New Jersey

 BODY:
Dredging was completed last week at the Newark/Port Elizabeth Marine Terminal, which handles more than 90 percent of general cargo at the Port of New York and New Jersey. The removal of 465,000 cubic yards of silt and sludge reopens the terminal's 62 berths to the largest container ships, some of which had been diverted to other ports because of inadequate depths in these berths. Even so, general cargo tonnage was up 6.3 percent last year over 1991. Bulk cargoes, which are handled at other terminals, fell 18.3 percent. Through May 1993, traffic is down 1.4 million long tons from the previous year.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 13, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A Pulse chart yesterday in The Metro Section about the Port of New York and New Jersey mislabeled one component in the breakdown of the port's regional economic impact. The category that generates $2.1 billion in annual business through the port is trade-related services, not travel-related services.

HEADLINE: Kantor Insists on Sanctions

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, denied today that the Clinton Administration had backed away from plans to require sanctions to enforce side deals to the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
"That is an inaccurate report," he said at a news briefing when asked about press accounts saying that officials had withdrawn their call for sanctions during negotiations last week in Mexico. "We have not changed our position at all. We want real teeth, real enforcement." 
 Later, before an audience of steelworkers opposed to the accord, Mr. Kantor reiterated this view. "We will not -- I repeat, we will not send Nafta to the Congress, unless we have effective side agreements," he said.
United States negotiators were quoted last week as saying that commissions on labor, the environment and import surges would not have the authority to impose sanctions, fines or penalties.
The United States has maintained that those commissions should have enforcement powers, a stance that has been resisted by Mexico and Canada.
Today, Mr. Kantor also repeated statements by the negotiators that important progress had been made at last week's talks.
Members of Congress -- notably Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Environment Committee and of an international trade subcommittee -- have said they would vote for the broad accord only if it were sent to Congress with strong side agreements, particularly an agreement on the environment. They argue that enforcement will be impossible if it is left in the hands of each nation.
Critics express particular concern about the prospects of increased pollution along the Mexican border, where many American companies have moved to take advantage of low-paid labor and more are expected to relocate if the accord is approved.
The Canadian Parliament has approved the North American accord, and its passage in Mexico is considered assured.
Negotiators have said that they expect to work out a common text for an environmental side agreement when they meet again next week in Ottawa.

HEADLINE: In Baghdad, Panic and Defiance Over Standoff

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 12

 BODY:
A mixture of panic, anger and defiance gripped this city today as Iraqis woke to find themselves back in an all-too-familiar world in which President Saddam Hussein is quarreling with the United Nations and their country faces the threat of another American-led air attack.
Only three weeks ago spirits here were lifted after the Government unexpectedly announced that it was reopening the talks it had broken off with the United Nations last year on partly lifting the embargo on Iraq's oil sales so it could buy more essential goods. 
 But hopes that the rigors of daily life might ease after three years of economic blockade have faded under the impact of two more recent crises pitting President Hussein against President Clinton, who came to office saying he wanted to "depersonalize" Washington's quarrel with the Iraqi leader.
First came the June 27 cruise missile strike on an intelligence base here in retaliation for what the White House described as Iraq's plot to assassinate George Bush during the former President's visit to Kuwait in April. Iraq said the raid killed six civilians.
Now Iraqis find their Government involved in a new standoff with the United Nations over carrying out the Persian Gulf war cease-fire, which includes monitoring of Iraq's weapons industry. A weapons inspection team left Iraq on July 5 after being denied permission to install cameras at two missile-testing sites, and another inspection team left the country on Sunday when it was refused permission to seal equipment at the sites.
 
Fear of Another Attack
 "I listened to Voice of America this morning," said a worried Iraqi woman working in a reception center for foreign businessmen who gave her name only as Mary. "They are not really going to attack us again, are they?"
Sipping tea in a cafe near Baghdad's souk, a retired civil servant calling himself Abu Husseini said: "It's the uncertainty I don't like. It's like Russian roulette. You don't know where the attack will come. You don't know where you are safe."
Deputy Health Minister Chawky Sabri Morcos, who described himself in an interview today as "a doctor, not a politician," asked angrily, "Haven't they killed enough people already with their embargo without any more attacks?"
His ministry calculates that 285,556 people have died unnecessarily as a result of the trade embargo imposed on Iraq after its defeat in the gulf war. The embargo has shut down what once was the world's second leading oil exporter, leaving it without funds to import medicines it needs.
The Government-controlled press is venting its anger on the United Nations, which Baghdad sees as the tool of an American-led conspiracy to weaken and humiliate Iraq by forcing it to accept terms for lifting the trade blockade that are ever more onerous.
According to this view, sealing the missile-test sites would only have encouraged the United Nations to start shutting down other Iraqi industries, saying they could be used for manufacturing prohibited weapons.
In a sign of the jitters sweeping through this city, the price of food and other goods on the free market rose amid indications that people with the money to do so were hoarding in anticipation of trouble.

HEADLINE: Mexican Official Rebukes U.S. on Chinese Aliens

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 12

 BODY:
With unusual sharpness, a senior official in the Mexican foreign ministry told the United States today that the fate of 659 undocumented Chinese aliens aboard three ships off Mexico is up to the United States, and that Mexico's rejection of a request by the United States for assistance still stands.
"Mexico is not going to accept these people," said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "This is the responsibility of the United States." 
 The official said Mexico had made it clear in a letter to Ambassador John D. Negroponte on Saturday that it "was not in position" to accept the United States' request to allow the three ships to dock in Mexico, where the passengers could be interviewed and then either allowed to enter the United States or returned to China.
The official disputed the accuracy of a statement by the State Department over the weekend that negotiations were continuing on possible solutions. Moreover, he contended that the United States had made an unreasonable request because the Chinese had no desire to go to Mexico and because, he said, United States immigration law so often worked against Mexican citizens trying to enter the United States.
 
Policy Change Suggested
 "Why would we do this as a favor to the United States when our own people are victims of the same policy?" the official asked. He also said the United States seemed to be trying to change an immigration policy that for last 12 years had allowed Chinese citizens to seek asylum in the United States.
The Mexicans denied that further negotiations had taken place. They said officials from both countries had met, but only to share information.
In Washington, however, the State Department said that talks were continuing "with some intensity" but that there was no sign of resolving what is becoming an embarrassing international dilemma.
The dubious conditions on board the ships added to the urgency of the negotiations. The Coast Guard said today that conditions on the three aging commercial vessels crammed with Chinese were "fair" at best. In the last few days the Coast Guard has ferried out hundreds of pounds of rice and military meals, as well as life jackets and an electric generator for a ship whose engine had failed.
But a State Department spokesman gave a harsher assessment. "Conditions on these ships are truly appalling," said the spokesman, Michael McCurry. "That's one more reason that requires us to deal quickly and accurately with the threat that is presented to those on board."
The origin of the ships has not yet been disclosed, but officials in the United States and Mexico said they appeared to be part of international smuggling rings.
Mexican immigration officials backed off earlier reports that four other ships carrying more than 700 Chinese were heading toward the coast. And Coast Guard officials said their air patrols had not sighted them.
Thirteen employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service have boarded the three ships, but officials said today that they were sent mainly as interpreters, not as part of any resolution to the diplomatic standoff between the United States and Mexico.
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the immigration agency in Washington, said the Chinese-speaking interpreters were helping United States Coast Guard personnel who have been caring for the aliens since the ships, which were heading east, were intercepted last week and brought to a point in international waters 64 miles west of Ensenada, Mexico.
While Coast Guard medics have treated several passengers for minor injuries, only one person, a 19-year-old woman, has required hospitalization.
Immigration officials in San Diego said the woman, Zhou Shiuyun, of Fuzhou province in China, was airlifted Sunday afternoon to the University of California at San Diego Medical Center, where she underwent emergency surgery for a tubal pregnancy. She was in good condition today, said Eileen Callahan, a hospital spokeswoman.
Ms. Zhou spoke to The San Diego Union-Tribune on Sunday but has declined further interviews, Ms. Callahan said. "She's under a lot of medication," the spokeswoman added.
 
'I Hate the System'
 Immigration officials said they suspected that she was going to the East Coast because she was carrying a New York-area telephone number.
"It's not just an economic problem," Ms. Zhou said in the Union-Tribune article. "I hate the system in China. There's no justice. I'll be punished severely, too, if the Americans send me back. That will be the end of me."
In the same interview she said it was a smuggler's promises of opening her own business that led her to borrow half of the $20,000 fee to be smuggled to the United States.
Immigration officials said Ms. Zhou was allowed into the United States under a medical parole permit and would be returned to the boat as soon as her condition improved. But an I.N.S. spokesman, Rudy Murillo, predicted that Ms. Zhou would ask for political asylum to buy time in the United States.
"She's talking like she's very well versed, very well coached," he said. "It's hard to reconcile the entire story."

HEADLINE: U.S. Fears a Sharp Rise In Balkan Refugee Flow

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
The partition of Bosnia into three ethnic areas could require the resettlement of 1.5 million to 2 million people, a classified State Department report says.
The brief report, prepared early this month by the intelligence bureau of the State Department and based on a map drawn by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, draws no conclusions about the desirability of carving up the country but assumes that masses of Serbs, Croats and Muslims will move, either through coercion or by choice, State Department officials said. 
 This would require an extraordinary new commitment of outside assistance, senior State Department officials and officials from international relief agencies said.
 
'Waves of People'
 "Partition is not going to solve the humanitarian problems of Bosnia," a senior State Department official said. "We're talking about enormous waves of people. Things could get much worse than they are now if you don't have access to people and enough resources to provide food and shelter."
Another problem, one senior State Department official said, is that partition could disrupt most of the Bosnian families with mixed ethnic backgrounds.
Senior State Department officials and relief agency officials stressed that the Milosevic map, which international mediators are using as a basis for negotiation, is by no means inevitable. On Sunday, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government rejected the partition proposal, which was advanced last month by Mr. Milosevic and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia.
The report coincides with a worsening of the humanitarian crisis in Sarajevo and the five other regions in Bosnia that the United Nations has designated "safe areas." The capital now lacks fresh water and is low on food and fuel, and United Nations relief convoys are stalled at Serbian roadblocks.
 
Doing the Numbers
 At a hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Warren Zimmerman, director of the Bureau for Refugee Programs and the last United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia, called Bosnia "a humanitarian crisis of a scale we have not seen in Europe" since World War II.
The State Department report estimates that with partition, 600,000 Muslims would have to move, half of them from areas of Bosnia that would no longer be controlled by the Government, the other half expelled from Croatia.
Between 275,000 and 300,000 Croats would have to move, most displaced from towns like Vitez and Travnik that would be Muslim controlled area, the report estimates. Half a million Serbs would be expected to move, about 350,000 from Serbia back home to newly Serb-controlled territory, the rest from places that would come under Muslim or Croatian control.
There are now 3.8 million people displaced by the war, compared with 2.4 million last December. As partition becomes more likely, European countries are making it more difficult for people from the remnants of Yugoslavia to settle in their countries.
 
Who Gets What
 Under the Milosevic map, the Serbs would receive 60 percent of Bosnia, the Muslims 35 percent and the Croats 15 percent. But the Croats are demanding more territory, and some State Department officials are convinced that if they prevail, it will be at the expense of the Muslims.
"If you use the Milosevic map. the Muslims get a raw deal," said Frederick C. Cuny, an American relief consultant who returned from Bosnia last weekend. "Even though the Croats get a small area, they get far more than the Bosnians in terms of industrial and hydroelectrical potential. The Serbs, of course, benefit the most and, in effect, the Bosnians would become economically dependent on Serbia."
The Muslims would get 20 percent of the arable land, 19 percent of forest reserves and 30 percent of Bosnia's overall export potential, Mr. Cuny said. Although the Muslims would receive 53 percent of the coal reserves, the coal is of low quality; since they would not get any steel mills, the coal would be of little use.
 
Threat by the U.N.
 Bill Frelick, a senior analyst for the United States Committee for Refugees, said there would be three consequences of partition: "genocidal-type killing," whose scale would depend on the response of the outside world; a mass exodus, which would depend on the willingness of the West to accept refugees, and the creation of a combination "Indian reservation/Palestinian refugee camp in which people with no political power, held in closed areas, become an international welfare case."
Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has become increasingly frustrated by her agency's inability to deliver aid to Bosnia and is threatening to pull out.
In unusually blunt remarks on Friday, she condemned the use of relief aid as a weapon of war and accused donor countries of failing to provide enough aid.
Nicholas Morris, Mrs. Ogata's new representative in Bosnia, is said to be eager for a complete withdrawal of the agency from the country.
Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International, a private aid agency, said: "At a time when maximum pressure is being put on the Bosnians, we are finding that donors are not engaged and almost deliberately turning away and the United Nations seems to be giving up. One can surmise that this is part of an indirect pressure campaign to force the Bosnians to accept partition."

HEADLINE: English Retirement Resort Is a Model for Europe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEXHILL-ON-SEA, England

 BODY:
Down at the police station, where the usual crime wave involves con artists preying on the elderly, constables have begun a program to install door chains free of charge.
At the whitewashed De La Warr Pavilion, on the seafront, promoters are hoping to lure sellout audiences of retirees with a summer program of big-band revivals and light musicals like "The Dancing Years," one of London's most popular prewar shows. 
 Government officials are also busy encouraging elderly people to apply for grants of as much as $1,500 each to reinsulate their houses before cold weather sets in again.
 
Proving Ground for Changes
 This well-manicured seaside resort in East Sussex is a retirement mecca where pensioners make up more than 42 percent of the population of 39,000. It is also a kind of proving ground for solutions to the social and governmental challenges that much of Europe faces as its population grows older.
As in the United States and Japan, declining birth rates and rising life expectancy have forged a powerful demographic reality across Western Europe. By the year 2020 more than one in every four people in the 12 countries of the European Community will be over 60, compared with fewer than one in five now. More critically, over 12 percent of the population is forecast to be older than 75, double the current percentage.
From recreation programs to health care, officials in Bexhill, about 30 miles east of Brighton, and in the administrative county of East Sussex, are already looking for ways to stretch limited public resources.
Down at the Charter Center, for example, the county and a consortium of volunteer groups and private contractors have pooled resources to offer a kind of senior citizens' drop-in center, aimed at helping sustain elderly people as long as possible in their own homes rather than force them into nursing homes or residential housing.
 
'Such Nice Company'
 One regular client, Ivy Wheeler, comes by bus four times a week for lunch, visits that provide her access to medical care and other services and social contact but still allow her to stay on in her own apartment.
"There's always such nice company, and a good home-cooked meal, too," said Mrs. Wheeler, a jovial woman who describes herself to visitors as "one of the local Bexhill ruins."
The degree of increase in the aged population across Europe is not expected to be anywhere as sharp as it will be in the United States and Japan, which have relatively young populations. By 2040, the over-65 segment of the population in the United States is expected to grow by about 75 percent, and in Japan by 149 percent.
Still, the rate is steep enough to insure that Europe's overall population remains older than that of any other continent. This led the European Community to designate 1993 as the European Year of Older People and to initiate seminars, conferences and studies examining everything from age discrimination to more efficient management of long-term health care.
In Europe's capitals, the looming burden of sustaining pension and health-care programs for the growing number of elderly is already forcing choices on governments that had until recently prided themselves on their social welfare programs.
Like the United States, which made changes in its Social Security system in 1983 by increasing taxes and curbing benefits, Germany, Italy, France and Britain have enacted or are considering similar changes of their own, including plans to raise the age at which retirees will qualify for pensions.
Many people would have to work longer to qualify for benefits, not only so the Government could limit the flow from social security budgets, but also to increase contributions to pension funds. The ratio of working people to retired people -- between those whose contributions sustain the pension funds and those who draw on them -- is projected to decline sharply.
In 1980, for example, there were 4.3 people of working age in Britain for every person over 65. By 2040, that ratio is expected to decline to 3 to 1.
Britain is studying a proposal that would raise the retirement age for women from 60 to 65, the same as it is for men, and thereby save the social security budget an estimated $6 billion in annual payments.
At the same time, nearly every European country is looking at ways to shift a larger share of the burden for care and service to the private sector and voluntary charities.
"It is a painful adjustment for Europe, where the idea was always for governments to take care of people, to actively intervene on their behalf," said Mervyn Kohler of Help the Aged, a private British charity that works with the elderly. "And it is especially hard on the generation now in their 50's and 60's, who are being told by politicians that, whoops, you aren't going to get all you thought you were."
 
Paying for Nursing Care
 In Germany, which has already agreed to lift the age for pension eligibility for men and women to 65 by 2012, the Government is close to adopting a plan for Government health insurance to cover nursing care for the elderly by increasing monthly contributions from workers and employers by 1.7 percent.
But to increase the employers' contribution, workers would be required to forfeit the first two days of pay for sick leave, which in turn would be contributed to the health fund. The proposal has stirred wide opposition.
In France, which reduced the eligibility age for pensions 13 years ago, the new conservative Government recently introduced legislation to increase taxpayer contributions to its social security fund by 1.3 percent and impose new taxes on some beverages.
The Government stopped short of changing the retirement age from 60, but it increased the period that an employee must work to qualify for a full pension from 37.5 years to 40 years. It also diluted the income on which the pension is calculated, from an employee's 10 highest-earning years to his or her 25 highest-earning years.
In Italy, where the working population is projected to shrink 15 percent by 2040 while the number of elderly grows by 35 percent, the Government intends to raise the retirement age for men and women to 65, increase contributions and, as in France, use a longer span of earnings to calculate pension entitlements.
 
Politically Volatile Issue
 All the initiatives are politically volatile. Some older people assert that they are being cheated out of benefits, because they must now work longer before they can begin drawing their pensions.
But many advocates for the elderly say there is no reason older people cannot work longer. On the whole, older people are healthier and more fit, and much more culturally and socially adept, than earlier generations.
"I think the picture of the little old frail lady living in a nursing home on the coast is a vanishing image," said Mr. Kohler of Help the Aged. "Generations that will be coming into retirement 20 years from now will have completely different life experiences, and expectations, than their parents or grandparents."
At the same time, deferring retirement may mean that older people will be competing with younger people for jobs. In a recent letter to The Times of London, a writer complained that such a measure would "increase unemployment among younger people, since jobs that would have become available through retirement would continue to be filled."
Another way that governments are looking to reduce expenditures is by shifting some responsibility for care to local administrations and asking them to take a stronger role in managing the providing of services.
 
'Community Care' Preferred
 The strategy reflects a philosophical commitment across the Continent to what is broadly described as community care, or trying whenever possible to keep people in their own homes rather than in institutions.
Ken Saunders, a team manager for the Sussex County Social Services Department, said his department had already begun shopping for services from private companies and help from charities because the money allocated to the county by the national Government had remained nearly static over the last decade while its elderly population continued to grow.
Organized by the county, the resource center that Mrs. Wheeler and some 80 other elderly people visit daily in Bexhill represents an amalgam of private and public sector cooperation.
The podiatrist and hairdresser are provided by a local charity, and the people who deliver meals to the center are volunteers, although the county pays the cook and buys the food. Mr. Saunders and the center's manager, Linda Phillips, are working more closely with private concerns that offer everything from transportation to home care.
For her part, Mrs. Wheeler says she wants to avoid a nursing home.
"I don't want to leave my apartment," she said. "That's what's so nice about coming here. Every day I go back home."

U.S. Bond Yields Hit 16-Year Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond inched down to another 16-year low yesterday as traders and investors awaited reports today and tomorrow on inflation in June.
The data on inflation, which many analysts expect will show that prices were restrained or even declined, could help continue a summer rally that has shown how quickly the mood can change in the bond market. 
 The move to new lows in 30-year bond yields, which got going in the last week of June, came after a market selloff in May that was prompted by fears of rising inflation and the threat of tightening interest rates by the Federal Reserve. In the May selloff, the 30-year bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, jumped to 7.04 percent on May 21.
 
 
Secondary Trading
 In secondary trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 rose 6/32 point as the yield fell to 6.62 percent, the lowest since the Treasury began to issue 30-year bonds regularly in May 1977. The yield on Friday was 6.63 percent.
The prices of Treasury notes were unchanged or slightly higher in light trading. At the weekly auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills, the average discount rates were slightly higher.
The Producer Price Index for finished goods, which will be released today, is expected to show a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent, according to analysts' consensus figures gathered by Bloomberg Business News. Salomon Brothers is predicting a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent. The index was unchanged in May.
The consensus on the Consumer Price Index, which will be released tomorrow, is for an increase of just one-tenth of 1 percent. Salomon Brothers is expecting it to be unchanged. The index rose one-tenth of a percent in May.
A one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index would put the annualized rate of inflation for the first half of the year at just over 3 percent, which would bring it back closer to the 2.9 percent increase for all of 1992.
If these predictions prove to be right, they will also help ease some of the concerns about inflation raised by the recent sharp rise in commodity prices and the upward spurt in the price of gold. In trading yesterday, the price of gold for August delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York was up $2.60, to $394.90 an ounce. The Commodity Research Bureau index of commodities prices was down 0.83, to 215.18.
Another positive for the bond market is the recent rally of the dollar, which closed yesterday at 1.7290 marks and 109.45 yen. In the last three weeks, the value of the dollar has jumped 3 percent against the German mark.
The dollar rally is likely to continue attracting foreign investors into dollar-denominated investments in the United States in an effort to profit on the rising value of the currency. And a lot of the securities that are bought will be bonds.
There are still some road blocks ahead, however. One is the uncertainty over the negotiations on the deficit-reduction package in Washington. Another is the pace of economic growth.
On deficit reduction, the House and Senate still have to work out the differences between their two proposals, and that could lead to delays that could worry investors.
On the economy, much of the bond rally has come on recent reports that economic growth did not pick up much in the second quarter after a very sluggish pace in the first three months of the year, when the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of only seven-tenths of 1 percent. This sluggishness was emphasized a week ago, with a report that nonfarm payroll jobs rose a meager 13,000 in June.
But it is possible that the economy will begin to show some signs of a pickup soon. Salomon Brothers is predicting a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in retail sales in June, after an increase of just one-tenth of 1 percent in May. While still moderate, such a June pickup would be a signal that consumers are still buying. The retail sales data will be released tomorrow along with the Consumer Price Index report.
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that while the inflation news is likely to be positive, it is essential that investors and traders think it can continue.
That judgment will depend on the pace at which the economy is growing. If it is moderate -- in the 3 percent annual range -- then the good inflation news can help long-term interest rates fall even further, Mr. Lipsky said. If the economy is much stronger, then fears about future inflation pressures will revive, and that could stop the decline in long-term rates.

HEADLINE: San Diego Sees Too Much of Success In Building Hotels to House the Poor

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
Over the last six years, this city has proved unusually adept at building inexpensive housing for the poor.
Too adept, it now seems, for its own taste. 
 A few years ago, city planners were winning national awards for replenishing San Diego's stock of single-room-occupancy hotels, the inexpensive quarters for the down and out that have been vanishing in many other cities amid lawsuits and angry civic clashes.
 
Turning Policy Around
 As advocates for the poor in other cities fought simply to preserve such hotels from demolition, San Diego coaxed private developers into building dozens of new ones.
But after aggressively promoting their policies around the country, San Diego officials have now made it virtually impossible to build any more of the hotels downtown.
The shift, which began quietly more than a year ago through changes to the zoning and building codes, came after some downtown businesses and residents complained that the hotels attracted too many undesirable people.
"There was a feeling the downtown already has more than its share," said Myles Pomeroy of the San Diego Planning Department. The critics, he said, feared that a further concentration of inexpensive hotels would scare off middle-class housing and destroy the drive for a varied downtown.
The changes close, for now at least, a celebrated chapter of urban development, one that mixed profit motives with social goals and added a dollop of architectural innovation. What began as some tinkering with the city's building codes inspired tens of millions of dollars of new investment, two academic case studies and a handful of national awards for architecture and government.
 
City 'Deserves High Marks'
 Although advocates for the poor have expressed regret over the recent change, they say the city has gone farther than most to promote low-income housing.
"All in all, I think San Diego deserves high marks for what they did," said Andy Raubeson, who heads a not-for-profit development organization in Los Angeles that specializes in single-room occupancy hotels, or S.R.O.'s. "It was urban pioneering to make the changes, which gave them what they wanted -- a substantial increase in the housing stock."
Alan Altshuler, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, praised San Diego's talent for getting private enterprise to address a public problem. "It's really quite a remarkable accomplishment," he said of the building boom.
Mr. Altshuler said the San Diego experience showed that local codes could be changed to make housing less expensive without compromising safety. The direct relevance of the San Diego example to other cities varies, of course, with local circumstances. High land prices in New York, for example, would make it extremely difficult for the city to make S.R.O.'s profitable for downtown developers just by adjusting building codes.
Single-room-occupancy hotels sprang up in the early part of the century to house transient workers. But over time, many turned into slum housing for alcoholics, drifters and the mentally ill. Beginning in the 1960's, urban renewal destroyed as many as one million such rooms across the country, as developers put prime downtown sites to more expensive uses.
But many of the displaced people had nowhere else to go, and cities began looking for ways to preserve the hotels.
In 1985, San Diego put a moratorium on hotel destruction, after redevelopment had cost the city a quarter of its 4,600 S.R.O. units. But the hotel owners protested that this illegally deprived them of their rights, and some simply closed their properties.
Chris Mortenson, a local developer, stepped forward with an unconventional idea: He would build a new S.R.O., one of the nation's first in 50 years.
To proceed, however, Mr. Mortenson had to find ways around zoning and building codes that he said discriminated against S.R.O.'s and needlessly added to their cost. "We wouldn't do it if it wasn't profitable," he said.
He won permission, for instance, to install thinner fire doors in exchange for putting sprinklers in the ceiling. He was also allowed to install toilets that were closer to kitchen sinks than the code normally allowed.
Mr. Mortenson's building is called the Baltic Inn, named for the cheapest property on a Monopoly board. The rooms are simple and small, with a bed, a toilet and a sink. Showers are off the hall. Residents can cook with microwave ovens in their rooms, and they use common lounge and laundry areas.
 
Helped by 27 Code Changes

When the Baltic opened to immediate success, other developers wanted to follow. To encourage them, the City Council in 1987 adopted a package of 27 changes to the zoning and building codes. The changes were designed to accommodate S.R.O.'s as a unique form of housing, somewhere between an apartment and a hotel. By waiving expensive requirements to provide parking, for instance, the code recognized that most S.R.O. residents do not have cars.
A building boom followed, adding about 2,700 S.R.O. units to the city, few of them publicly subsidized.
Among the intriguing byproducts of the experiment was the work of the Baltic Inn's designer, Rob Wellington Quigley, an architect with a prominent reputation but little experience in low-income housing.
Mr. Mortenson said, "We wanted to do it with a name architect, so everybody wouldn't say we're building a ghetto."
Intrigued by the challenge of giving inexpensive buildings what he calls "emotional content," Mr. Quigley took on the work at a greatly reduced fee. Although economy required the Baltic to take on a boxlike shape, for instance, Mr. Quigley arranged a striking V-shaped color contrast on its exterior to destroy the monotony.
 
Enlivened by Alternating Colors
 Mr. Quigley designed three subsequent S.R.O.'s, expanding on his base of knowledge as he went. Efficiency requires the buildings to have long, monotonous corridors, but Mr. Quigley learned to alternate colors on the plastic baseboards: navy blue, then turquoise, then maroon.
His work has earned Mr. Quigley a fistful of architectural awards, and in 1988 the city won a $100,000 award from the Ford Foundation for offering, through the code changes, an example of government innovation. Planning officials used the prize money to proselytize among other cities, and the Kennedy School produced two case studies of the city's experience.
Most of the San Diego hotels cater more to the working class than to those living on welfare or disability checks. Only about 500 of the 2,700 new units rent for less than $280 a month, with most renting in the $400 range and some costing as much as $525 a month. The Baltic, where rooms rent for under $300 a month, mixes healthy young workers with the aging alumni of homeless shelters. Richard Ulmer was living in a shelter in Tucson, Ariz., but moved to San Diego after learning of its plentiful S.R.O. hotels.
"I read the want ads, and I kind of gathered what the S.R.O. situation was," he said.
At the age of 59, Mr. Ulmer, a recovering alcoholic, suffers from bone cancer and multiple sclerosis, requiring him to use crutches and making walking painful. He gets by on a $683 monthly disability check and says that without the Baltic he would "probably be on the streets."
Mr. Pomeroy, the city planner, said the hotels had not caused a surge of crime or disorder. "I certainly wouldn't say San Diego regrets having done it," he said, calling the latest changes in codes a brake, not a backtrack.
The recent changes began in 1991, when the city adopted a parking plan that requires new S.R.O.'s to provide one parking space for every five rooms, driving up the hotels' cost. And a redevelopment plan adopted by the City Council last year designates several blocks for residential use but classifies S.R.O.'s as commercial.
Mr. Raubeson, the housing advocate, calls the changes an example of the not-in-my-backyard attitude that hampers low-income housing everywhere. "It's just the feeling that there's too many poor people," he said, "which is sad."

Rob Wellington Quigley, an architect, earned awards for his designs of S.R.O.'s, beginning with the Baltic Inn. (Photographs by Jim Wilson/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Reich Assails Price Increases

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich criticized some American companies today for raising prices rather than using now-advantageous foreign-exchange rates to increase their share of markets against foreign competitors.
In remarks at a Congressional seminar, Mr. Reich accused some business leaders of short-term thinking, using as an example their response to exchange rates that are making imported goods more expensive and United States goods more attractive. 
 "Look at what has happened now that the dollar is low, that is relative to the yen and some other currencies," he said.
"American manufacturers could use this opportunity to increase market share," he said, adding that instead they are raising prices.
Mr. Reich declined to specify which industries he alluded to, and did not respond to a question whether he meant the auto companies.
"There have been some discussions" between Cabinet members and industry leaders about the situation, he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Recovery Spreads But the Gains Vary by Region

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
For two years, the fitful economic recovery has been a fact in only half the country. In the heartland -- the Midwest, Southeast, Texas and the surrounding states -- sales and jobs started to come back after a quarter or two of relatively mild recession. In coastal regions like the Pacific Southwest, the Middle Atlantic States and New England, the worst layoffs and losses since the Great Depression continued for quarter after quarter.
But now, recent signs of weakness notwithstanding, the recovery that began in the nation's center seems to be fanning out to the rest of the country. Exports to Latin America and tourists from Europe are helping to revive Florida and the rest of the Southeast. Stronger car sales have given a lift to parts of the Midwest, although recent floods could cause a temporary setback. In Texas and other South Central states, service businesses and high-technology manufacturing are expanding. A few Western states have been growing so fast that businesses are running out of people to hire.
 
Higher Employment

 In deeply depressed California and the rest of the Pacific Southwest, sales and income tax collections have stopped shrinking and business people say the economy may have touched bottom. The northern New England states are growing again, and there are signs of life even in Connecticut, which is still reeling from military cutbacks. And New Jersey has started to regain some of the jobs it lost. 
 The extent of the spreading recovery is mirrored in a variety of broad economic statistics. Employment -- though still shrinking in a few states -- is higher this year in all but one region, the South Central states, than it was in the first half of last year. Help-wanted advertising, a sensitive indicator of changes in the job market, has turned up in seven of the nine regions in the last three months, though it is still far below its pre-recession peak.
And while factory employment, historically a source of good jobs, has dropped to its lowest point since the mid-1960's, in most regions industrial production has recovered to pre-recession levels. This means more profits and wages for manufacturers and workers.
Income has also recovered in most areas of the country, although many people have been left behind, either with no jobs or lower-paying jobs. New England is the only region where total real personal income (excluding the effects of inflation) has not yet climbed to a record high, though it is only marginally below its previous peak.
"The recovery is finally spreading," said Sara Johnson, who heads a team of regional economists at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a forecasting firm.
In another sign that the recovery is reaching across the country, revenues from state income and sales taxes have grown. Every region reported higher revenues in the first quarter, compared with a year ago, according to the Center for the Study of States in Albany. John Liscio, the editor of a financial newsletter, also notes that the majority of large states have been reaching or exceeding their revenue targets in recent months, even though many have recently raised those targets.
Business people in most parts of the country also say they detect signs of growth, though it is often slow growth. In some of the most depressed states and regions, like the Southwest, executives say they see indications that the slide has stopped.
To be sure, it is difficult to measure with precision how well various regions are doing. The statistical evidence is mixed and sometimes contradictory. State tallies of business payrolls, for example, have shown virtually no growth in recent months, even though the Department of Labor's nationwide employment survey shows that business has added half a million new jobs in each of the last two quarters.
 
 
A National Pattern
 As a rule, regional data are less trustworthy than national indicators, which are based on bigger samples. But taken together, the economic statistics and business reports suggest a pattern of recovery that is clearly becoming more national in scope.
Even as the recovery spreads, economists are remarking on how long the process has taken. In the past, most regions sank into recession at about the same time, and started to come out again within a quarter or two of one another.
"This was the most regionally concentrated recession in postwar history," said Brian Cromwell, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "That disparate performance during recession turned into unbalanced recovery."
Economists say that growth is likely to remain extremely uneven, with some regions growing two or three times as fast as others. The slow, on-again, off-again pace of the recovery itself is likely to make those disparities feel larger as well.
"All recoveries are uneven," said Lawrence Katz, chief economist at the Department of Labor. "Boom or recession, there are some areas that grow faster than others. The mountain states are going to grow faster than New England or the Midwest."
 
 
Effects of Military Cuts
 Indeed, the recovery's increasingly national scope does not mean that it will necessarily shift into high gear. It is apt to take several more years for the regions hit hardest, particularly New England, the Middle Atlantic and the Pacific Southwest, to recoup the jobs lost in recent years. And Ms. Johnson of DRI/McGraw-Hill says she still expects some states, including California and Connecticut, to lose more jobs as Washington continues to pare the military payroll.
"Job growth is going to be a lot slower in the 1990's than the 1980's," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States in Albany. "If overall growth is below average, that means some states are actually stagnating or even shrinking."
The broadening of the economic expansion reflects two developments. In the areas of the country where the recession turned out to be relatively short and shallow, the number of jobs started to grow at a faster clip in the first half of the year. Utah, Idaho and other mountain states, where help-wanted ads have jumped nearly 11 percent since February, have been attracting migrants from other states, as well as new businesses -- from credit card operations to software companies.
Texas, Louisiana and President Clinton's own Arkansas, where payroll jobs are 2 to 6 percent above levels a year ago, are reaping the rewards of expanding trade with Latin America and rebounding housing markets. The oil patch went through hard times in the late 1980's -- ahead of the rest of the country -- after oil prices, real estate and much of the Texas banking system collapsed.
 
 
Growth for Southeast
 In the Southeast, a swelling population, a revival of home building and the growth of new high-tech and service companies are contributing to some of the fastest job growth in the country -- well over 2 percent a year in populous states like Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Economists expect job growth to stay strong despite pockets of weakness likely to be caused by military cutbacks. And a surge in tourism and solid gains in exports to Latin America, says Erdal Donmez, an economist for the City of Miami, are keeping Florida's economy going.
Job growth in the Midwest, which has been swept by torrential rains and floods, is being tempered by the recent weakness in manufacturing and a continuing effort to raise productivity on the factory floor. But thanks to higher car and truck production, Michigan has been a leader in payroll job growth in the last six months or so, though its unemployment rate ticked up a bit -- to 7.3 percent -- in June. The next few months may look better, however, since American auto makers are to turn out 2.5 million cars and trucks this summer, 17 percent more than last summer.
Other industrial states are also showing gains. The latest Labor Department employment report on large industrial states showed that unemployment fell in June in Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
"We had a good year last year, but our business has been on a definite upsweep since last August," said Tim Dressing, president of Dressing Chevrolet, Buick and Pontiac in Jacksonville, Ill., a town whose farming and food processing industries have not been threatened by the widespread flooding in other parts of the state. In Jacksonville, light manufacturers are investing heavily in new plants and equipment, and construction is on the rebound.
 
Good Signs for Weak Regions
 In contrast, the economy is still depressed in some other areas, but there are signs that these regions may be touching bottom.
Job losses have started to taper off in New York State and the rest of the mid-Atlantic region, as well as in New England and the Southwest. Some states in these regions have already seen the beginnings of spotty job growth and an upturn in job ads. And some industries -- especially retailing, health and services -- are adding to payrolls.
The weakest regions are getting help from the rest of the country, which is buying more of their goods and services. For example, northern New England is getting a lift from tourism. Upstate New York, where factories produce everything from headlights to auto air-conditioners, is benefiting from stronger nationwide car and truck sales.
Many state and local governments -- California's not included -- are in better shape than they were in 1990 and 1991. As a result, they are spending more, which is stimulating their economies. Even as Federal payrolls are shrinking, states and localities have added more than 100,000 jobs in the last five months.
In New England and the Middle Atlantic States, home building is reviving as a glut of unsold houses and empty apartments has started to ease after a four- or five-year hiatus in building.
 
A Low Point for California?
 Even in California, where more military cuts loom and business executives are willing to venture only that the economy may be flattening out after its steep fall, the unemployment rate has drifted down to 9.1 percent from 10 percent and the number of Californians with jobs is up 1.6 percent from a year ago. In addition, said Brad Williams, executive director of the California Commission of State Finance, tax collections -- an indirect measure of employment -- have leveled off in recent quarters after falling sharply for two years.
"It feels as if the last three months are the low point," said Steve Compodonico, comptroller of the Collins Electrical Company, a large electrical contractor in Stockton, Calif.
That is not to say that improvement will be continuous everywhere. The Pacific Northwest, for example, which has had the nation's fastest-growing job market for five years, is being threatened with tens of thousands of layoffs at Boeing and further cuts in its troubled lumber industry. And in a few states, including Nebraska, the unemployment rate has tumbled so far that labor shortages are actually threatening to choke off what growth there has been.
Despite the shortcomings in some of the state-by-state job figures, which are often sharply revised, there are reasons to think that the picture of stabilizing job markets in most of the country is reasonably accurate, since the numbers are supported by data on tax revenues and other indicators.
If anything, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner for the New York region, the count of payroll jobs in, say, the New York metropolitan area makes the job market look weaker than it is. That is because it does not capture all of the new small businesses that people are starting, something that tends to happen when the economy is switching from recession to recovery. It takes Government data collectors a while to find the start-ups and include them in regular surveys.

HEADLINE: Police List Items From Search Of Home of Suspect in Killings

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 12

 BODY:
Nassau County prosecutors today released a chilling inventory of items they said had been found in searches of Joel Rifkin's bedroom, garage and pickup trucks. The list included books about serial murders and tying knots and 75 pieces of women's jewelry.
The six-page list was released on the same day that prosecutors gave a grand jury evidence in the death of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, whose body was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck when two state police troopers arrested him on June 28. 
 Though the police say Mr. Rifkin, 34, an unemployed gardener, has confessed to killing 17 women, and credit cards taken from his bedroom last week linked him to an 18th death, the Nassau County grand jury will consider only Ms. Bresciani's death because she was the only victim found in Nassau County.
The grand jury is expected to indict Mr. Rifkin tomorrow, with arraignment likely later this week, said Ed Grilli, a spokesman for prosecutor's office.
 
Pink Sock and a Hair Curler
 Listed today among the things found in Mr. Rifkin's room was "The Green River Killings," a book about what remains the nation's lengthiest string of unsolved murders, in which the bodies of 49 prostitutes were dumped along the Green River south of Seattle in the 1980's. Most of Mr. Rifkin's victims have been identified as prostitutes.
Other books were "Ropes and Knots" and Shere Hite's "Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress." The 1987 book, a controversial report on marital infidelity, concluded that 70 percent of women married for more than five years were having affairs.
And there was more: heavy and thin ropes, a bag of unidentified "boney matter," 17 rolls of film, videotapes and legal pads crammed with personal writings. A blue metal safe held 48 pieces of women's jewelry, and the police found another cache of 27 baubles. They found women's clothes: a pair of gray stretch tights with one pink sock still attached, a black sweater with white balls, a pair of black suede pants, a blue Lycra skirt, shoes and a hair curler.
The first search of Mr. Rifkin's house, garage and one truck in East Meadow was done the same night the troopers stopped him for driving without license plates.
While investigators had earlier mentioned several items taken from Mr. Rifkin's home -- including a blood-soaked orange wheelbarrow and women's underclothes -- today's list was the first thorough accounting of the items seized in that first search. The inventory did not include items taken in a far more extensive search of the home and surrounding grounds that the police conducted with specially trained dogs last Thursday.
The sheer array of women's belongings raised questions about how Mr. Rifkin collected such a pile of personal effects -- much of it left in plain sight in his cluttered room -- without arousing the suspicion of his sister, Jan, 31, or his mother, Jeanne, 71, with whom he lived.
 
Some of Story Doubtful
 Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, Robert Sale, has challenged the propriety of the June 28 search and last week asked the Nassau County District Attorney to investigate the way it was conducted. While Mr. Sale would not disclose the results of the inquiry, Mr. Grilli said the prosecutor had found "nothing to corroborate Mr. Sale's allegations."
Of the 18 killings, the police have so far identified 10 women by name, either through Mr. Rifkin's confession or through evidence found at his home and in his pickup trucks.
Another four bodies recovered by the police in the region are believed linked to Mr. Rifkin, though the remains have not been identified by name. The bodies of four more women the police believe Mr. Rifkin strangled have yet to be found.

HEADLINE: Dow Inches Up 3.32 in Seesaw Trading

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Billions of dollars sloshed to and fro in the stock market yesterday, as prices fluctuated with the news, the weather or somebody's mood. But at the end of the day, analysts said, it all signified very little.
"It's a ho-hum market," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities in Chicago. 
 After a roller-coaster ride, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed the day up 3.32 at 3,524.38. Other indexes were similarly up slightly. Traders passed 202 million shares back and forth on the New York Stock Exchange, down from 234 million Friday.
Some analysts said investors were hanging back, waiting for the release of the June inflation figures today and tomorrow, but Mr. Chalasani dismissed that view, saying the market was simply stalled.
"I don't think the market is marking time," he said. "Today's market is telling us the rally that started last week can't be carried to any appreciable heights." The Dow gained 37.09 last week.
 
Transportation Stocks Change
 The only sizable change yesterday came among transporation stocks. Weighed down by aviation and railroad issues, the Dow transportation average sank 13.44 points, to 1,495.72. Delta Air Lines lost a point to close at 46 7/8. USAir also dropped one point, to 13 3/4.
Federal Express helped lower the transportation average, falling 1 1/8 points, to 45 7/8, probably because the company plans to release its second-quarter earnings today, said James Winchester, a senior equities analyst at Lazard Freres.
"People may be a little nervous about holding it going into the earnings report," he said.
Mr. Winchester said that like other transportation stocks, Federal Express was suffering because of pessimism about the economy in the second half of the year. A weak economy "obviously has an impact on such premium product services as the overnight and express services," he said.
Other leading market indicators edged up yesterday, drowsily. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.85, to 448.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.86, to 707.67, and the American Stock Exchange composite rose 3.73, to 438.10.
Reversing a week's worth of uniform gains among the Big Three auto makers, Ford Motor was one of yesterday's big decliners, shedding 2 points to finish at 50 1/8. Jack V. Kirnan, a Salamon Brothers auto analyst, lowered his opinion of the company yesterday from "buy" to "hold."
Mr. Kirnan said that he was alarmed to discover that a high proportion of Ford car and truck sales were for commercial and rental fleets and for leasing, which are less profitable than straight retail sales. That sales strategy, rather than weakness in the European market, is behind the company's low profitability, he said.
"Our call on Ford today really reflects what we now feel is a rather serious deterioration in the company's product mix in North America," he said.
General Motors and Chrysler both slipped 5/8, to 46 7/8.
Among the blue chips, I.B.M. had a particularly strong day. After the company reported that it was shipping a new microprocessor to compete with Intel chips that control computer disk drives, its stock rose 1 1/2 points, to 48 1/8. That gain alone accounted for 3.32 points of the Dow's increase -- equal to the total rise on the day.

HEADLINE: Northeast Incomes Remain Relatively High

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
New England and the Middle Atlantic States, which boomed in the 1980's only to crash hard, have seen their troubles drag on for two years after growth revived in America's great middle. But even as the pain continues, economists offer one bit of solace: the two regions are still more prosperous than most other parts of the country.
The Northeast was hit with the worst job losses in the nation. Together with California, it accounted for two-thirds of the jobs lost in the recession, and neither the Northeast nor California has yet reached its pre-recession employment levels. 
 But income figures tell another story. "The rich stayed rich," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at Shawmut Bank in Hartford. "After the havoc wreaked by the worst recession since the Great Depression, the Northeast is still affluent."
Just how affluent may come as a surprise. During the 1980's, Massachusetts vaulted into third place in per capita income, up from 13th. Even after 10 percent of the jobs in New England disappeared, Massachusetts still ranks third. Total purchasing power in the state -- as measured by the personal income of all residents -- is still 45 percent higher than in 1979. And despite the real estate bloodbath, houses are selling for two and a half times what they fetched at the start of the 1980's.
New York, which lagged far behind neighboring Connecticut at the end of the 1970's, moved closer in the 1980's, advancing from ninth in per capita income among the 50 states to fourth now. New Jersey, which had been fifth, is right behind Connecticut, the top-ranked state, today.
Connecticut displaced Alaska in the 1980's as the state with the highest average per capita income, but it has been one of the states most bruised by the recession. Still, it has hung on to its top status despite deep military cutbacks, white-collar layoffs and corporate defections. Per capita income was just a hair below $27,000 a year in 1992, roughly $9,000 ahead of, say, Ohio or Texas -- two states that weathered the recession quite well.
The Northeast's real losers in the recession, of course, are the factory workers, bank officers and engineers who ended up on the unemployment line. "The people who are still working are still making good money," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "And their pay increases have kept pace with other regions."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Rate Cut Prospects in France And Germany Raise Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the German mark and French franc yesterday amid mounting speculation that German and French interest rates would soon be cut.
Meanwhile, gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery gained $2.60 an ounce, to $394.90. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $393.90 an ounce, up $2.35. 
 The dollar's allure grew as speculation intensified during the weekend that France must soon cut interest rates to stop its economic recession from turning into a depression.
 
Interventions Overwhelmed
Heavy dumping of the French franc depressed the currency to around 3.41 per mark, well below its central parity level in the European Monetary System's Exchange Rate Mechanism. This prompted several rounds of coordinated French franc purchases by the Bank of France and Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, but the waves of selling were overwhelming.
The failed interventions fueled talk that the Bundesbank, in a show of solidarity, would cut German rates soon to make French franc-based investments relatively more attractive.
This was reinforced by the French Economy Minister, Edmond Alphandery, who said maintaining the current mark-franc parity was an "absolute imperative" for France. Moreover, the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said further cuts in German interest rates were both possible and desirable.
"Speculation is rife the Bundesbank will bail out the French by cutting rates before its summer recess," said Howard Archer, research manager at NatWest Bank in London.
The dollar was quoted at 1.7300 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.7210 marks late Friday. It was also quoted at 5.9065 French francs, up from 5.8540 francs on Friday.
 
Dollar Falls Against Yen
Still, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen, sliding to 109.45 yen in late New York trading, from 109.96 yen Friday. Dealers took profits made over the weekend on an American-Japanese trade framework reached at the Group of Seven summit meeting in Tokyo. The framework reduces chances that the United States will talk up the yen in the near future to cut Japan's huge trade surplus, dealers said.
The British pound settled at $1.4769 in New York, down from $1.4810 Friday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.4780, from $1.4822 Friday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
A Commercial By Nike Raises Concerns About Hispanic Stereotypes.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
SOMETIME during Major League Baseball's All Star Game tonight in Baltimore, television screens around the country will be filled for 30 seconds with visions of bright-eyed boys in tattered clothes, playing baseball in La Tierra de Mediocampistas (the Land of Shortstops), a.k.a. the Dominican Republic.
The dusty setting was chosen by Nike, the athletic apparel company, but not so much to sell shoes or equipment, Scott Bedbury, Nike's director of advertising, said. Rather, Nike wanted a vehicle to reflect the pure joy of the game that would strip away the crass commercialism of the major leagues -- even if it meant spotlighting players who could scarcely afford a Nike T-shirt, let alone $60 baseball cleats. 
 Still, the hardscrabble setting contributes to the mood of the commercial and so does the voice-over. It's entirely in Spanish, making the spot perhaps the first Spanish-language commercial ever broadcast in prime time over a major network in the United States. Subtitles in English appear at the bottom of the screen.
"It's a powerful message of hope for kids that through baseball they can dream," Mr. Bedbury said from his office in Beaverton, Ore. "It shows that people of any age, any culture can participate, and it is particularly moving in that in the Dominican Republic, which has so little, baseball provides so much for them."
From that environment, more than 70 Dominicans have made it onto major league rosters, including a stream of well-known shortstops, like Tony Fernandez of the Toronto Blue Jays and Rafael Belliard of the Atlanta Braves.
Yet however well meaning Nike's intentions -- a bouquet to the vast audience of Spanish-speaking baseball fans -- not all of them appreciate the effort. Some, in fact, might find it downright condescending and, worse, a possible means of perpetuating stereotypes about Spanish-speaking citizens of the United States.
Tony Bonilla, chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference in Corpus Christi, Tex., a group dedicated to enhancing Hispanic participation in mainstream American society, commended Nike for at least acknowledging "the huge economic potential impact" of the Hispanic community by directing a commercial to its members.
But he expressed deep concerns that a Spanish-language commercial viewed by an audience that could reach 20 million people might deepen cultural divides, further isolating the Hispanic population from English-speaking people or those with another first language.
"A large percentage of the Hispanic population might find it insulting," said Mr. Bonilla, who had not seen the Nike ad. "The commercial perpetuates and promotes the idea that Hispanics don't want to assimilate, that they're isolated, clinging to the Spanish language without caring to learn English. That's just not so. A majority of the Spanish-speaking population does speak English. Hispanics are proud of their culture and they do encourage multilingualism. They recognize it as an advantage."
Mr. Bonilla criticized corporate America for its limited use in commercials of Hispanic Americans, who by some accounts will be the largest minority in the United States by the end of the decade. Beyond the work of Ricardo Montalban, an actor once prominent in Chrysler advertisements, and Lee Trevino, the golfer, as Toyota salesman, Mr. Bonilla could cite no other well-known Hispanic American as a corporate spokesman.
Nike has "some relationship" with about half the current 700 major league baseball players, Hispanic players among them, Mr. Bedbury said. But none hawks Nike products in the high-profile manner of Bo Jackson or Deion Sanders, black players who will be seen in other Nike commercials during the All Star Game.
Mr. Bedbury said that when Nike and Wieden & Kennedy, its Portland, Ore., agency, conceived the Dominican baseball commercial, concerns were raised that the theme would celebrate only a minor aspect of the Hispanic culture. But they decided that what they found during several days of shooting reflected enough positive aspects of the culture to compensate for any missing elements.
"We captured what is honestly there," Mr. Bedbury said, "hope, joy, inspiration, baseball and the sense of community that baseball provides. In this ad, we're not trying to sell shoes."

HEADLINE: Tariff Deal Called the Bigger Success

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
President Clinton's agreement with the Japanese on a process for trade talks was a political victory, but it will not mean as much for American businesses and workers as the global tariff reduction deal struck a few days earlier, business executives, economists, legislators and officials said today.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, described the agreement reached in Tokyo on Saturday as a rule book for negotiations in coming months on specific industries, not a trade agreement. 
 "The game hasn't started," he said at a news conference. "You write the rules, then you take the playing field."
Japan agreed to reduce its trade surplus "significantly" over the next few years, but did not yield to American demands for a specific numerical target. The two nations also agreed to organize their trade talks into five broad categories, and to use unspecified qualitative or quantitative criteria for measuring success.
 
Applause From Congressman
 Congressional Democrats expressed enthusiasm today about the deal with Tokyo. "Politically, the Japan agreement is probably the most important, given the fact that most of the attention has been on Japan," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, who wants to lower American trade barriers.
But there was acknowledgment that the tariff-reduction agreement reached last Wednesday by Japan, Canada, the United States and the European Community was more important. The agreement reinvigorated the long-stalled Uruguay Round talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
"The real breakthrough was the Uruguay Round," said Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics here. "That's why I would give Clinton a B-plus or an A-minus" for his summit performance.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a trade official in the Carter and Reagan Administrations, said the deal with Japan was more important for how it was accomplished than for any immediate commercial effects. "These negotiations were being handled by office directors," he said, "and now it's at the head-of-state level."
Harold A. Poling, the Ford Motor Company's chairman and chief executive, said in a speech today in Cleveland that while he was pleased that the tariff-reduction deal had been achieved, he thought that specific targets should be set for reducing the Japanese trade surplus.
Among big beneficiaries of last week's tariff agreement may be chemical companies. K. James O'Conner Jr., associate director of international trade for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said that the deal, if approved by other GATT nations, would mean higher profits for American producers. Chemical companies tend to locate their factories all over the world, depending on where it is cheapest to make a product.
"The chemical industry is already a multinational industry that ships back and forth to itself," Mr. O'Conner said. "The more freedom it has to do that, the more efficient we can be."
 
U.S. Approach Discussed
 Mr. Kantor noted that tariff reductions would be further negotiated, in the hope of expanding and broadening them, this fall in Geneva. In theory, a broader GATT agreement cannot take effect until the organization's 114 nations agree on other issues before them, including limits on unilateral trade sanctions and new rules for trade in services like banking and insurance.
Mr. Kantor said that the Clinton Administration was offering fewer concessions on textiles and apparel than the Bush Administration did. It wants to avoid tariff cuts on goods mainly made in China and Taiwan, which are low-cost producers. The Administration also wants strict rules to prevent large textile and apparel producers from evading quotas on their shipments, he said.
Mr. Clinton has been reluctant to antagonize members of Congress from textile-producing states or textile makers, something Mr. Kantor attributed in part to the industry's employment of many women and minorities.

On the Many Splendors Of Long-Lasting Love

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Five love stories are told in "For Better or for Worse," tonight's cheerfully melancholy offering in the "P.O.V." documentary series. David Collier brings to the screen couples who are more like his grandparents, who have been married for 67 years, than his parents, who were divorced when he was 5. He chose wisely, and his work serves both his subjects and his viewers well.
Three of the couples, all of whom have been together for more than half a century, are white and heterosexual, one is black and one is homosexual. Yet these 10 people are very much alike in their feelings for the person who is never referred to as the significant other. (Yes, kids, there is love after 30, and after 80, too.) 
 As the camera catches hints of their economic and social class (upper to lower middle), their milieus (urban and suburban) and their quirks, they talk about their lives.
How they have managed to stay together all these years: The glue of one union seems to be incessant arguing, particularly over the relationship of chicken legs to drumsticks.
High points: The homosexual couple is seen being celebrated in a New York City Gay Pride parade as "the two oldest gay men in America." And low ones: The black couple recalls the early deaths of two sons.
Sex: One wife, evoking attitudes of another era, says that women don't "get as much out of it" as men, but that she was pleased to be pleasing her husband all these years. Another seems to have been something of a sexual adventurer who deduced, correctly, that her virginal suitor needed some help in that line. Hearing aged men and women admit they have never slept with anyone other than their spouses may strike one as quaint, particularly on television, where promiscuity is a commandment, but whatever they may have lost in sexual variety seems trivial compared to what they have built and sustained.
And the prospect of separation: One partner, who has Alzheimer's, has already been institutionalized. And the others have the end in mind. One man speaks for all when he says, "If she should go first, I won't be long about it."
Despite the shadow of the inevitable, this is far from a gloomy hour. These people don't go in much for self-pity. Old photographs show the couples in earlier years (how demure she looks, how fit he looks, how romantic they look together). When they are seen strolling, it is often hand in hand. Their answers to Mr. Collier's off-camera questions are like duets.
"We're hanging in there with good humor," one says, and the hour, which has a lot of tunes in it, ends on a perfect note with Billie Holiday's delivery of "Our Love Is Here to Stay."

Nouveau Riche Guys

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
My Baltimore sisters who don't know beans about baseball came by the other night and right away started fuming about the players being scandalously overpaid. Their ire had been fomented, if I may lapse into crossword-puzzle talk, by the imminent All-Star Game to be played today in their town.
Like everybody else who hates to see a ballplayer have a big payday, they started in on the shame of a society that pays a schoolteacher only $15 a week, or whatever the current shameful figure is, yet pays millions to Cal Ripken Jr. 
 They specifically cited Mr. Ripken, who plays for their hometown team, the Orioles, as an example of nearly utter worthlessness. Whether this was because he is having a terrible year with the bat seems doubtful, since their interest in R.B.I. statistics is nil.
Most likely it was simply because Mr. Ripken is as prominent a piece of the Baltimore landscape as the Bromo-Seltzer tower or the statue of George Washington in Mount Vernon Place, both of which Mr. Ripken has closely resembled this season when batting with runners on base.
I hate talking baseball with people who know absolutely nothing about it, even when they are my sisters and I love them. I also hate talking baseball with people who know practically everything about it because they make me feel so ignorant.
For instance, I have been itching to ask this question of Thomas Boswell, baseball wizard of The Washington Post whose eye is always on the Orioles: Is there a law that says you can't walk Frank Thomas when he comes to bat with two men on base?
Mr. Thomas, who plays for the Chicago White Sox, comes to bat against the Orioles every few days with two men on base and usually hits a three-run homer. Being pathetically unlearned about baseball, however, I hesitate to ask baseball-wise Mr. Boswell why the opposing team doesn't simply walk Mr. Thomas in this situation.
Is it because they yearn to be three runs behind? Is it bad sportsmanship to deny Mr. Thomas his regular three-run homer by walking him? I'm so certain that this question shows I am completely stupid about baseball that you will never catch me asking it of a master.
I'm not so shy, however, about asking why so many people abuse baseball players for earning princely salaries. You rarely hear anybody say it's shameful that America throws millions at Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, David Letterman, Madonna or Robert Redford while treating teachers like dirt.
Corporate lawyers and investment bankers aren't constantly abused because they happen to be egregiously overpaid, or at least considerably better paid than the schoolteacher my sisters fret about.
For years top corporate bosses have regularly been receiving huge pay boosts while running their businesses into the ground. Since the whole economy finally hit the rocks public hostility, to be sure, has been rising against them, but the overpaid, incompetent C.E.O. still doesn't provoke the kind of bile reserved for baseball players, many of whom are actually quite competent.
Part of it is probably that baseball is blue-collar work widely thought of as entertainment for blue-collar guys. Its long association with beer tells the story. Millionaires are the wine classes. Real guys drink beer.
There may be some mean-spirited streak of envy in Americans which makes them hate seeing a blue-collar worker being paid on the champagne scale along with show-biz stars, lawyers, bankers and corporate bosses. As evidence that the ballplayer doesn't deserve champagne living, note the TV scenes in the winner's locker room at season's end when baseball players use champagne bottles as water pistols.
In any case, you never hear anybody -- except maybe schoolteachers -- say it's disgraceful that movie, TV, rock, legal, banking and corporate stars are paid so much better than schoolteachers.
This concern for schoolteachers, though doubtless sincere with my sisters, is probably just gassy discharge from the population at large. Americans' readiness to let the public school system go right on decaying if money is the price of stopping it is illustrated in election after election.
Ignore the humbug, Mr. Ripken. Get your money every Friday.

HEADLINE: Electric Boat Laying Off 800; 1993 Total May Reach 2,000

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
The Electric Boat Company said yesterday that it was laying off 800 people at its submarine yard in Groton, Conn., and other plants at the end of the month and that layoffs and jobs lost to attrition this year might reach 2,000, not the 1,500 that had been expected.
A company spokesman, Neil D. Ruenzel, said that Electric Boat's workload was declining faster than had been projected as submarines are completed and the company's backlog of orders from the Navy shrinks. The company said last fall that it would cut 1,500 jobs in 1993. The 800 layoff notices to be distributed among salaried and union employees between July 26 and Aug. 9 are part of that reduction. 
 "We're rapidly working off our backlog, which currently consists of three Los Angeles-class attack submarines, four Tridents and two Seawolfs," Mr. Ruenzel said. "We just this month delivered a Trident and a Los Angeles-class submarine, and bear in mind that there have been no new contracts awarded since May of 1991."
The company said it did not know how many jobs would be lost at the Groton yard, which employs nearly 13,000 of Electric Boat's 19,000 employees. A second yard in nearby Quonset Point, R.I., employs 4,000.
Mr. Ruenzel said that the company's original projection of employment at the end of 1993 was 17,500, as more submarines were completed but that the number now could drop as low as 17,000.
If no new contracts are received, Electric Boat has said, its employment at all plants will fall to 7,500 by 1996.
 
Base Is a Factor
 The U.S.S. Nebraska, the 14th of 18 Trident submarines being built, joined the Navy on Saturday at a commissioning ceremony at the Navy's submarine base across the Thames River from Groton in New London. The 18,750-ton submarine was built by Electric Boat over the last six years.
Just last week the Groton area received some good news when it learned that the New London base would not be closed as part of the nationwide cutback in military installations.
But William D. Moore, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut, said that even with the Navy base staying open, economic projections for the region forecast the loss of 21,000 more jobs in New London County by the end of the decade because of military cutbacks.
"It's an unfortunate byproduct of the so-called peace dividend, and when you're in the nation's most heavily defense-dependent region, you feel it," Mr. Moore said. "It's a fact of life in this region that as the contracts go away, so do the jobs."

HEADLINE: Ocean Pioneer Mines Energy That Is Cool, Clean and Free

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

DATELINE: KEAHOLE POINT, Hawaii

 BODY:
DR. JOHN P. CRAVEN has made a living by taming a part of the planet that few people think much about and almost no one visits: the bottom of the deep blue sea.
As head of the Navy's Deep Submergence Systems Project in the 1960's, he pioneered new technologies to plumb the ocean's depths, developing the world's most advanced vehicles for deep-ocean search, rescue and salvage. He also developed an abiding faith in what he saw as the sea's untapped economic potential. 
 In the 1970's he came to this promontory of ancient lava on the big island of Hawaii with the dream of bringing the deep ocean onto dry land, pumping cold water from the Pacific's depths to study the development of new industries and life support systems for the human race. From that vision has flowed discoveries great and small.
"Oh, wow!" Dr. Craven, now 68 years old, said recently as he showed a visitor a lush garden here watered in a novel method using seawater. "Holy smoke! Look at the size of that zucchini."
The 870-acre laboratory and commercial park that developed around his original idea has become the world leader in developing the remarkable potential of cold seawater for such disparate things as growing strawberries, air-conditioning buildings, raising lobsters and making electricity.
Pipes that are 12, 18 and 40 inches in diameter run through the breakwater here and plunge far beneath the waves to haul up deep water as cool as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, about the same as a refrigerator. Other pipes collect warm surface water, typically a tepid 80 degrees. The temperature difference between the two is crucial to much of the magic that goes on here.
Once on land the ocean water flows through a four-story melange of concrete and machinery that cranks out 210 kilowatts of electricity in the newest and largest generator of its kind in the world. In other parts of the laboratory cold water goes though heat exchangers to air-condition a handful of buildings, and in the near future will circulate through the nearby Keahole airport to cool it as well.
Perhaps most impressively, the cool water flows down the road in buried pipelines to nourish a host of small companies that have sprung up over the years to exploit the nutrient-rich seawater for aquaculture. The concerns are raising lobsters, a type of flounder highly prized by the Japanese for sashimi, such sea vegetables as ogo, nori and ele ele, and a kind of microalgae rich in protein known as spirulina, which is sold as a dietary supplement in health food stores.
Most recently, the cool water has been run through a welter of pipes that sustain a large vegetable garden here. The pipes cause water vapor in the humid air to condense and drip onto the soil and root systems, producing an Eden-like profusion of crops that turn out to be exceptionally large and sweet.
"All the other things that came along turn out to be more important than the electricity," said Dr. Craven while munching a carrot from his seawater garden. "You bring up that cold water and you've got it made."
He recently founded the Common Heritage Corporation, based in Honolulu, to commercialize the cold-water techniques, including the emerging ones for agriculture. So far his small research team has tested them on 79 kinds of fruits and vegetables.
"We're doing something so off the wall that most people laugh," said Kevin Sue Rohan, a tan, athletic woman in her 30's who oversees the experimental garden, often with three small children in tow. "But we're doing it successfully."
Dr. Craven sees the mix of cold water electrical production, air-conditioning, aquaculture and agriculture as a boon to the developing world, much of which lies in the equatorial band of the planet where strong sunlight generates big temperature differences between the ocean's upper and lower reaches.
"Deep ocean water is a resource that can, today, provide environmentally sustainable economic self-sufficiency and independence for tropical island and coastal nations around the world," he wrote last year in The Marine Technology Society Journal.
Dr. Thomas H. Daniel, the laboratory's chief scientist, called Dr. Craven a gifted visionary.
"He saw before many other people that the ocean is a very large potential resource," Dr. Daniel said. "We can get 10 terawatts of electricity out of the oceans continuously, which is about man's usage right now."
Dr. Craven was born in Brooklyn in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge and joined the Navy during World War II, serving in Hawaii and earning two battle stars before being sent to Cornell University for advanced education. After the war, under the G.I. Bill, he studied at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Iowa, where he met his wife of 42 years, Dorothy, and received a doctorate in mechanics and hydraulics.
 
Important Navy Projects
 In 1951 he began working for the Navy as a civilian, studying how to improve ships and submarines. He was promoted quickly after correctly predicting and helping solve a structural problem with the Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus.
After serving as chief scientist to the Navy's special project's office, where he helped develop the Polaris missile, Dr. Craven in 1963 became head of the Navy's Deep Submergence Systems Project. There he pioneered advanced vehicles for deep-ocean search, rescue and salvage. He and his team played important roles in major political crises. In 1966 he helped find an American hydrogen bomb that had been lost off the coast of Spain and in 1968 helped locate the twisted wreckage of a nuclear-powered attack submarine, the Scorpion, in waters nearly two miles deep.
The fleet of underwater vehicles that he helped develop included the Navy's NR-1, a deep-diving nuclear submarine with crab-like claws for picking up objects; the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle, a cylindrical craft that could save up to 24 people at a time from a sunken submarine; and the bathyscaph Trieste, a deep diving vessel that his team improved to increase its operational range. It investigated the sunken Scorpion.
Dr. Craven was lured to Hawaii in 1970 by the state's governor, becoming dean of marine programs at the University of Hawaii and the state's marine affairs coordinator.
 
Impetus From Oil Embargo
 A major challenge arose in 1973 when the Arab oil embargo sent petroleum prices spiraling and touched off a frenzied search for energy alternatives. The price shock hit especially hard in Hawaii, which depends heavily on imported oil.
In 1974 Dr. Craven founded the Keahole site, known as the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii. It was a state research center for the study of unconventional ways to produce power, especially ones that tapped the site's abundant supply of sunlight and cold water. In 1979 the lab undertook its first major test when a converted tanker off Keahole Point extended a two-foot pipe down some 2,700 feet. Its novel machinery was a big success, generating 50 kilowatts of gross power. Subtracting the electricity used to run the water-lifting pumps, the rig produced 15 kilowatts of surplus power.
"It seemed like perpetual motion," Dr. Craven recalled. "We had no fuel but it kept running. Watching it work was an incredible experience."
Fifteen kilowatts is no great crackle of electricity by commercial standards, being just enough to power a single modern household. But the experiment demonstrated for the first time anywhere the net production of electrical power from OTEC (pronounced OH-tek), or ocean thermal energy conversion.
This approach, whose working principle was first envisioned in the 19th century, uses the world's largest collector of solar energy, the ocean, to heat a fluid that rotates a turbine and generates electricity.
It works in one of two ways. Warm surface water in an evacuated chamber boils and generates vapor that rushes through a turbine as the vapor is cooled by frigid seawater and condenses back into liquid, a method known as an open system. Or the warm surface water vaporizes a working fluid such as ammonia that drives the turbine. Cooled ammonia is recycled in what is known as a closed system. In both cases, a temperature gap of about 35 degrees or more makes possible the production of net power.
Dr. Craven's ship used a closed-cycle system, which was more compact. But as his lab laid a series of pipelines from the shore into the sea in the 1980's, tests of open-cycle systems were also conducted. As a byproduct these produce a flood of desalinated water fit for agriculture or human consumption, since salt is left behind as ocean water turns to steam.
Today, the world's newest OTEC system is the $12 million, 43-foot-tall cylindrical power tower here, which is producing 210 kilowatts of electricity and about 50 kilowatts of surplus power. This open-cycle system came to life in January, and engineers here are now working to increase its running time slowly from eight hours at a stretch to continuous production. The aim is to gather solid operational data for two years.
The project is financed by the State of Hawaii, the Federal Government, and a not-for-profit consortium in Honolulu that has been supported by the Japanese Government.
With new kinds of turbines, an open-cycle system might scale up to plants no bigger than about 10 megawatts since efficiency is limited by the low-pressure steam. A closed-cycle system could in theory be as large as 100 megawatts (and would require a cold water pipe 60 feet in diameter or an equivalent collection of smaller ones). By contrast, a large nuclear reactor can produce 1,100 megawatts of power. An OTEC plant, though small by world standards, is attractive because its fuel is free and clean.
Another attraction is the spinoff industries, which are found with no other renewable source of energy.
 
'Watch the Stuff Grow'
 Dr. Craven and his crew in the 1980's began experimenting with aquaculture, finding that nori, the seaweed used to wrap sushi rolls, would increase its mass at a rate of 55 percent a day.
"You could literally watch the stuff grow," he said. "We were astounded."
The cold seawater is rich in inorganic nutrients like nitrates, phosphates and silicates, is almost devoid of pathogens since it comes from so far below the life zone found near the ocean's surface, and is very clean since it has been out of contact with the surface for centuries. Today, the mixing of warm and cold waters at the Keahole site allows temperatures to be tailored for the manipulation of growth and reproductive cycles.
Private companies line the main road here. The Cyanotech Corp. has 600-foot raceways filled with microalgae from which it extracts fluorescent pigments for medical research and diagnosis. It also grows microalgae that serve as food supplements.
Kona Cold Lobsters Ltd. raises lobsters, 25,000 of them at the present time. "There's no lobsters out there," said Phil Wilson, a company vice president, gesturing toward the nearby Pacific, "only in here."
The half-acre plant is both a holding tank for lobsters flown in from Maine for distribution here and the Pacific rim, and a maternity ward where experiments are under way in hybridization and growing tiny eggs into giant crustaceans.
Company buildings, like those of the lab, are air-conditioned by the cold water. Indeed, air-conditioning turns out to be one of the most economically attractive uses of cold water. It is easy to achieve technically and pays for itself rapidly.
Dr. Craven says a tenant researcher at the lab devised the technique in the mid-1980's, piping cold water through an automobile radiator and having a fan distribute cool air.
Clare Hachmuth, executive director of the Keahole site, said the lab now saves $1,300 a month on electricity by using cold water to cool its two major buildings. Now being planned, she said, is the first off-site cooling application, in which an 18-inch pipeline is to run to the nearby airport.
Dr. Craven, who no longer holds a post with the lab but instead acts as an elder statesman, says that what he prides himself on most in the course of a long oceanic career is learning how to innovate despite the frequent appearance of social obstacles.
"You can't to it if you stick to a big plan developed by the Harvard Business School," he says. "You've got to be a Brooklyn boy. You've got to sneak up on the thing."

HEADLINE: Is 42d St. Development in Hands of 'Professional Crackpots'?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Walking down the 42d Street entrance to the IRT subway, I glanced at a movie marquee reading, "A lot of professionals are crackpots," which you describe in a July 7 news article on the art that has replaced kung fu movies in Times Square because of the actions of the 42d Street Development Project. I had just left my office at Broadway and 43d Street after spending a hostile day on the phone with representatives of the Governor's office, the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the development project. 
 I am a lawyer who has been retained by the owner of a delicatessen on 43d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in a last-gasp effort temporarily to save his store. For two years the delicatessen owner has fended off eviction attempts by the 42d Street Development Project. On July 1 an appellate court refused to prolong the delicatessen's existence. Impressing upon the 42d Street Development Project and the Urban Development Corporation the hardship for the 15 employees being fired and the advantage of retaining a 24-hour store on the now-tawdry 43d Street represented the last hope of saving the delicatessen until the "redevelopment" would begin.
The 42d Street Development Project responded to my inquiries with irritation and umbrage over the deli owner's two-year fight. After court battles and finally success, the imperious development project did not care about a man's desperate fight to save his business, about the unnecessarily unemployed or another boarded-up store on 43d Street. The Urban Development Corporation explained that it is independent of the development project, which has the ultimate decision-making powers.
I do not understand the public art exhibition in Times Square: the "Everybody" installation or the sign in a window that reads "No More Firs," nor do I understand the need for a pair of bright yellow mannequins clad in clothes made from different brands of condoms. I do understand the need for a reasonably priced, 24-hour deli on 43d Street, the need to minimize the boarding up of stores and to maintain employment -- at least until "redevelopment" begins.
The 42d Street Development Project leadership has lost the ability to proceed responsibly. The state may have created a megalomaniacal corporation unable to combine artistic insight with conscientiousness, pragmatism and sensitive direction. The leadership's inexcusable conduct does not engender enthusiasm for the future of Times Square. Perhaps it is not the "professional crackpots," but the impervious and overly zealous bureaucrats with their self-perceived mandate of esthetic superiority who should be debased on movie marquees.

HONEYWELL PLANS DISMISSAL OF 250 WORKERS

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Honeywell Inc. is planning to dismiss 250 workers from its Industrial Automation and Control division and will decide on them by Sept. 1. A company spokesman, Dan Sussman, said yesterday that the dismissals would probably affect the division's engineering, marketing and manufacturing sites in Phoenix, Fort Washington, Pa., and York, Pa. The dismissals are to occur by December. Profits are declining for the Phoenix-based division of the Minneapolis company because of a weak global economy, Mr. Sussman said. The division employs 4,500 people nationwide.

HEADLINE: BIG RISE IN BIRTHS OUTSIDE WEDLOCK

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Highlighting the changes sweeping the American family, the Census Bureau today reported sharp increases in the number of women who become mothers without marrying, an increase that was particularly steep among educated and professional women.
Nearly a quarter of the nation's unmarried women now become mothers, the bureau reported, an increase of almost 60 percent in the past decade. 
 The Census study controverted stereotypes that have tied out-of-wedlock births predominantly to women who are poor, uneducated or members of minority groups, although women in those categories still remain much more likely to become single mothers.
 
Some Numbers Triple
 The numbers painted a picture of surprisingly sharp change in the past decade alone. Among white women and women who attended college, the percentage who became mothers without marrying more than doubled. For women with professional or managerial jobs, it nearly tripled.
The numbers also grew for black women, Hispanic women and women with less education, but much more slowly.
The findings come at a time of vituperative debate over the causes and consequences of changing family structure, recalling the political food fight that erupted last year when Dan Quayle, the former vice president, attacked Murphy Brown, the sitcom character, for having an out-of-wedlock birth.
Mr. Quayle said children tend to suffer in single-parent families and accused Hollywood of using the fictional Ms. Brown, an affluent television anchor, to glamorize them. A number of liberals and feminists attacked Mr. Quayle, saying he exaggerated the problems of fatherless families and backed an agenda hostile to women and minorities.
 
Issue of Images
 The bulk of social-science research has indicated that children in single-parent families do tend to have more educational, financial, and emotional problems than those raised by two parents. But social scientists are at odds over the extent of the differences and the reasons for them.
Many studies have illustrated the erosion of the traditional American family, brought about by increases in both divorce and out-of-wedlock birth. The census study did not deal with divorced or separated mothers. But it went farther than others in examining the race, education, age and occupations of mothers who were never married.
"It says, in one respect at least, the Murphy Brown image was right -- out-of-wedlock childbearing is not limited to poor women or racial minorities," said Sara McLanahan, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University.
The study, by Amara Bachu, a census analyst, is called "Fertility of American Women: June 1992." It examined women between the ages of 18 and 44 who had never married. By 1992, 24 percent of them had become mothers, up from 15 percent a decade earlier.
For women who had attended at least a year of college, the rate rose to 11.3 percent, from 5.5 percent in 1982. For white women, the rate rose to 15 percent, from 7 percent. For women with professional or managerial jobs, it rose to 8.3 percent, from 3.1 percent.
 
Public Policy Impact
 Black and Hispanic women remain more likely than white women to have children without marrying. For black women, the rate rose to 56 percent, from 49 percent a decade earlier. For Hispanic women, it rose to 33 percent, from 23 percent.
Public policy has in many ways failed to keep pace with the transformation of the American family. The Government's system of collecting child support from absent fathers remains antiquated. Child care for working women is often scarce or expensive.
And record numbers of single women now rely on welfare, although the value of cash benefits has fallen sharply in the past two decades. In promising to reshape the welfare system, the Clinton Administration is searching for ways to bolster the financial status of single parents, without encouraging dependency.
Mr. Clinton has promised, for instance, to increase child support collections and to increase the tax credits available to low earners, many of whom are single mothers. David T. Ellwood, one of Mr. Clinton's top welfare aides, has often criticized the current system for "expecting one parent to do the work of two."
 
Searching for Explanations
 The Census Bureau's findings were contained in a single chart that was part of a larger study on unrelated topics. The report did not discuss the data's causes or implications, which have been a matter of heated debate among social scientists.
The rapid increase in single-parent families is occurring throughout the industrialized democracies, with the exception of Japan.
Some analysts have put forward economic explanations, stressing that women have fewer financial reasons for marrying than they did decades ago. That is because the gap between the earnings of men and women has narrowed, with women earning relatively more than they used to and men earning relatively less.
Other analysts have stressed social and cultural explanations, arguing that a feminist revolution has left many women with a new sense of independence. Witnessing the high divorce rates around them, they say, many women no longer trust the institution of marriage. And the taboos that discourage out-of-wedlock birth have waned.
 
Some Partners Present
 Ms. McLanahan noted that many women, while unmarried, are living with a partner when they give birth. "For them, they may say this is just like marriage," she said.
Children who grow up in single-parent families are much more likely than others to live in poverty. Last year the Census Bureau reported that 47 percent of the families headed by single mothers lived in poverty, as against 8.3 percent of the families headed by two parents.
Researchers have also found that children in single-parent families are more likely to have low grades, to drop out of high school, or to have their own children out of wedlock.
But social scientists disagree over cause and effect. Some stress that living in single-parent families can bring emotional and financial problems; others stress that emotional problems and financial problems can cause people to live in single-parent families.
Those who are less alarmed by the rise of single-parent families argue that, in some cases, marriage can make things worse. That might be the case, for instance, if a woman is living with an abusive man.
The subject of family structure has remained a sharply divisive one since at least 1965, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then a Labor Department official, issued a study on the black family.
It noted with alarm that a quarter of black children were being born out-of-wedlock, a figure which has now risen to approximately two-thirds. Approximately a quarter of all American children are now born out of wedlock.
Mr. Moynihan, now Democratic Senator from New York, was accused of "blaming the victim" -- chastising families for their own poverty and oppression.
Similar accusations, fair and otherwise, have been hurled at countless academics and politicians who have since criticized the rise of unmarried motherhood.
"It's seen as stepping on the toes of those who are trying to support women's independence," said Ms. McLanahan, who was once divorced and noted that she had been a single parent for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Unless Situation Improves, U.N. Should Quit Bosnia, Mediator Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 13

 BODY:
The United Nations mediator for the Balkans said today that he might have no choice but to recommend the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina unless the situation improved.
Such statements have been made before, and the possibility surfaced again this month as peace talks stalled. But the mediator, Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, also repeated earlier denials that the threat of a withdrawal of United Nations personnel was being used as a way of pushing the Bosnian Muslims into agreeing to a peace plan proposed by the Serbian and Croatian sides. 
 "I don't know where the rumors come from, but I know that they are wrong," Mr. Stoltenberg told a news conference after briefing the Security Council.
 
'I Would Work Just as Hard'
 "Let's say that they decide not to negotiate," he said, referring to the predominantly Muslim leadership of the Bosnian Government. "I would work just as hard to get funds for relief and to get forces for safe areas. They know this."
In a report submitted to the Security Council today, Mr. Stoltenberg said the peacekeeping forces had suffered 548 casualties, including 51 deaths, in the Balkan conflict. He said there were not enough funds for food, fuel and medical supplies even for the rest of the summer, much less the coming winter season. Relief convoys carrying food, medicine and fuel are being blocked by all three sides, he said, and the fighting has spread into central Bosnia with the resumption of hostilities between Muslims and Croats.
"I hope that it will change," Mr. Stoltenberg said, "but if it continues, the combination of the deteriorating security situation and the lack of resources may lead to a situation where we will have to pull out. At least I will have to recommend it."
Mr. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian Foreign Minister, replaced Cyrus R. Vance of the United States as the United Nations mediator two months ago. He offered some hope that the three sides, which may meet in Geneva next week, all at least want to try for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.
"I may be wrong," Mr. Stoltenberg said, "but I believe that all the parties now want to try to get a satisfactory solution. They more and more understand that as the war goes on, they will all lose."
 
Plight of Serbia and Croatia
 Citing the deteriorating economies of neighboring Serbia and Croatia and "the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Mr. Stoltenberg said, "I see no reason why they should not at least try to see what is possible."
In denying that there was any intention to exert pressure on the Bosnian Government to accept the partition plan, Mr. Stoltenberg was repeating similar statements made last week by the European Community's mediator in the conflict, Lord Owen of Britain.
 Mr. Stoltenberg's grim description of conditions was seen here as part of a pattern that has repeated itself several times in the past, in which the mediators warn that conditions in the former Yugoslavia are reaching the point of collapse, and then the United Nations member countries commit themselves to a modest increase in the level of United Nations support.
"My prediction is that there's a certain wake-up-call quality to these briefings, and new steps will be taken to carry us forward for another short period of time," one diplomat here said. "But it's grim."
 
More Troops Said to Be Needed
 At the moment, the most urgent need seems to be raising additional troops to be used in the so-called "safe areas" for Muslims in Bosnia designated by the Security Council this year. Mr. Stoltenberg said that only about 1,100 of the needed 7,500 troops had been provided so far, though he said he was optimistic that the rest would be raised soon.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reviews How to Restore Utilities in Sarajevo

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
President Clinton's top national security aides failed today to agree on how to break the Serbian blockade of basic services to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which is in its fifth week without electrical service, tap water and natural gas.
Some senior Administration officials said today's meeting, which was attended by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, among others, was never intended to decide on specific recommendations for Mr. Clinton. 
 But other officials insisted that President Clinton was deeply disturbed by dramatic television footage from Sarajevo, as well as a report Friday from State Department officials in the field who have urged Washington to take immediate action.
 
Six Options
 During his visit to Tokyo last week, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Christopher to develop a strategy for helping Sarajevo, officials said. The result was an informal paper prepared by the State Department European bureau that laid out six options, from continuing the current policy of diplomatic complaints and economic pressure to mounting a Somalia-style military operation that could involve air strikes and even some United States ground troops.
In between were intermediate steps to help the United Nations peacekeeping force to fulfill its mandate of using all "necessary means" to deliver food, fuel, medicine and other supplies.
The options involving the use of military force were described in the paper as short-term operations with objectives that were not military ones, as mandated in current United Nations resolutions, the officials said. The paper made no recommendations for Mr. Christopher, nor did it offer an estimate of how many troops would be needed to fulfill the most ambitious option, the officials added.
President Clinton has repeatedly said he would not send ground troops to Bosnia, even as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force, while the war is raging.
 
Some Private Advice
 Senior State Department, Pentagon and White House officials are examining proposals prepared by Frederick C. Cuny, an independent aid expert working in Sarajevo, on how to break the Serbian blockade.
Mr. Cuny, who has advised the United States in similar situations in northern Iraq and Somalia, has drawn up two plans: one to ease the city's privations without the use of military force, and one that involves limited military force under existing Security Council resolutions.
The first plan calls for the immediate airlift or airdrop of water-purification equipment. Mr. Cuny said the Soros Foundation, a private philanthropy in New York, had offered to buy simple purification systems for every family in Sarajevo if the Air Force would deliver them.
The United States has decided to airlift 500,000 water purification tablets into Sarajevo, State Department officials said. But they added that since the Serbs have recently blocked most aid that has arrived at the airport, it is likely that the tablets will end up in storage sites.
 
Airport Is the Key
 Mr. Cuny's more ambitious plan calls for absolute United Nations control over Sarajevo airport and the removal of all checkpoints on the two-mile road into Sarajevo. Both steps are authorized under current Security Council resolutions, and would require the United States to offer air protection for the peacekeeping troops, Mr. Cuny said.
Another suggestion is for the United States and its allies to order the Serbs to withdraw their tanks and artillery from the vicinity of Sarajevo, as mandated by the Security Council, so a United Nations peacekeeping force can be positioned between the Serbian nationalist forces and the city. If the Serbs did not meet a deadline, their positions would be attacked by allied warplanes.
Mr. Cuny is convinced the Administration is now determined to ease the crisis. "I think we've finally turned the corner," he said. "The Administration has finally realized that it has to do more to get forceful access to Sarajevo and get the aid in."
But Mr. Cuny's optimistic view is not shared by all relief officials.
"The very fact the Administration is still dithering while the fuel needed to pump water lies at the airport only two miles from the city is incredible," said Lionel Rosenblatt, president of Refugees International, a private aid agency. "This is not a Berlin-blockade-scale problem. It's very easily remedied by either sending the convoys in through one checkpoint with a determined United Nations escort or, if they're scared, to deliver it into the city by air."
 
Chart/Map: "Balkan Update"
 The UNITED STATES deployed 12 A-10 ground attack planes to Aviano Air Base in northern ITALY yesterday in case the craft are needed to protect safe areas the United Nations has designated in BOSNIA. The planes, designed to destroy tanks and artillery positions, will join F-16 fighter planes that have been based in Italy and used on patrol.
 In ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN, six Muslim nations and the Palestine Liberation Otganization offered to send 18,000 soldiers to protect Muslims in the United Nations zones.
Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces launched a full-scale assault outside the disputed city of MOSTAR, United Nations officials said. Peacekeepers based in SARAJEVO said that Croatian militiamen have detained hundreds of Muslim men, women and children evicted from their homes in a new round of "ethnic cleansing."
In GENEVA, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said she would visit Sarajevo on Wednesday to assess deteriorating conditions in the capital.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Florida Growers Reach Pact on Everglades

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 13

 BODY:
In an action aimed at ending the biggest environmental debate in Florida history after five years of litigation, the Federal and state governments today announced an agreement with agricultural interests on a $465 million plan to help clean up the endangered Everglades.
Under the accord, made public this morning by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt at a news conference in Washington, sugar companies and other large farming concerns would pay as much as $322 million over the next 20 years to restore the quantity and quality of water flowing into Everglades National Park. The Federal Government and state and regional agencies would bear the remaining costs. 
 With state officials and sugar company executives at his side, Mr. Babbitt said the agreement opened the way to "the largest restoration project in the history of the national park system." But he cautioned that today's accord was merely "a tentative settlement" that "does not by any means finish the task" of saving an ecological system that in recent years has shown alarming signs of decay, from sharp declines in wildlife populations to rising levels of pollution.
 
Plan to Buy Land
 A cornerstone of the plan is the purchase of 40,000 acres of farmland to be converted into six artificial marshes, which would cleanse runoff water of the chief pollutant, phosphorus. An ingredient in fertilizers for sugar cane and vegetables, phosphorus also stimulates the growth of plants like cattails that choke out the native species eaten by fish and wildlife. The agreement also calls for increasing the amount of fresh water flowing into the Everglades by 25 percent, a measure intended to restore plant and animals species that are vanishing because of declining water tables.
Extending south from Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Keys, the Everglades contain some of the most fertile farmland in the United States. Less than half of the land falls within the 1.4 million-acre Everglades National Park, established to protect the ecological system in 1947. The system has come under increasing stress because it provides drinking water to the more than four million people who now live in the narrow coastal strip between Key West and Palm Beach.
Today's agreement, the final details of which are to be negotiated during the next 90 days, calls for growers to reduce the amount of phosphorus flowing into the Everglades as runoff by 25 percent within two years and gradually thereafter through 2013.
If growers, which include United States Sugar, the state's largest, adhere to the timetable to be established in the agreement, they would be liable for $322 million of the clean-up costs. But if they reduce the phosphorus contamination at a faster pace, the clean-up costs could be cut by as much as $90 million.
 
Criticism Continues
 Don Carson, executive vice president of Flo-Sun, another sugar company that signed the accord, said the agreement, though financially painful to the industry, was "a breakthrough" that "would preserve jobs and economic activity" at the same time it guarantees the integrity of the Everglades. He expressed confidence that the industry would meet all goals ahead of time.
"The bottom line is that sugar is just biting the bullet," Mr. Carson said. "We know that we have got to deliver water to the system that is as good as if we weren't there at all."
But Dexter Lehtinen, the former United States Attorney whose 1988 lawsuit against the State of Florida and the South Florida Water Management District prompted the years of litigation, called the agreement "disappointing" and "vague." He said the Federal Government had "essentially immunized big sugar from having to reach the final water restoration goal" that he had been seeking through his suit.

HEADLINE: Voices of Japan: Anger at the Old Politicians and Skepticism About the New

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 13

 BODY:
From the presidents of Japan's largest corporations to small shopkeepers, everyone in Japan seems to be wary over the recent political turmoil.
Elections for Parliament on Sunday could end nearly four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party and set Japan on the road to a two-party system, or to a period of unstable rule by coalitions. Japan's industrial prowess and its relations with the United States could be affected. 
 People from different walks of life, ranging from a farmer to a literature professor, were asked in interviews what they thought would happen in Japanese politics, what changes they would like to see and how they thought the outcome of the elections would affect their lives.
Many common themes run through their comments: a revulsion against corrupt politicians, a skepticism that real change will occur and a sense that the public is still powerless.
Despite the disgust with the Liberal Democrats, however, there is also a measure of comfort with the party that presided over Japan's post-war economic miracle.
Here are excerpts from their remarks.
 
Yoko Tomiyama
Chairwoman, Consumers Union of Japan; 60, of Tokyo
 From my point of view, the entire political movement seems to be lacking any debate over policies. The only debate is over whether or not they will pursue political reform, and even there it's not clear what kind of political reform they are talking about. There aren't any policy debates on what everyday life should be, on peace, on the environment.
This is a chance for us consumers and voters to generate our own policies and politics. We should not just follow the people in power. Among activists, it seems like the changes are giving us more energy. But among the general public, we don't see much rise in interest in changing politics toward the consumer cause.
Most people basically are hoping for political reform, but they seem at a loss as to how to show it through their own actions. Some people are apathetic. Some people think that even if you do something, nothing will change.
 
Yoichi Aonuma
Rice farmer, 37, of Furukawa
 The current situation is a discharge of the pus that has accumulated gradually through one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party. The party itself became so gigantic and hard to understand by outsiders. It started to lie to people.
As for the Renaissance Party, now in the center of the hurricane, I'm skeptical. Mr. Ozawa [Ichiro Ozawa, the party's strategist] was the person who was in the center of the money politics. Even though they keep saying, "We are reformers, we are reformers," I think their main purpose is to take over political power.
I think the L.D.P. can change because there are politicians inside the L.D.P. who are thinking of reform. In a way it has already changed. Their character was that the big bosses ruled the party. Now that situation has changed.
I'm not worried that the rice market will be opened. The second-largest party, the Japan Socialist Party, has a policy to raise the self-sufficiency ratio of food. The parties that have been most helpful in taking on our requests have been the Socialists and the Communists. The L.D.P. raised its support of farmers' causes only when they wanted our votes.
 
Minoru Makihara
President, Mitsubishi Corporation; 63, of Tokyo

The political turmoil now is probably inescapable in the process of realizing political reform, which I think is essential for the future of Japan. I hope the result will be a system where the electorate is given clear alternatives. On the other hand, if the political scene remains confused, it will affect the confidence of the customers and market, and will not be good for companies like ourselves.
In times when political leadership is weak, the bureaucrats may make up for this lack of leadership. However, in this process they may entrench themselves in their own domains, which will not be good.
For example, in negotiations with the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance may have differing priorities. In such cases, what we need is a clear political vision.
Several of the new opposition leaders are quite responsible people. They are advocating decentralization and deregulation, and I respect what they are trying to do.
 
Keiji Odashima
Owner of eyeglasses store; 46, of Kamaishi

The news media in Tokyo criticize the entire Liberal Democratic Party with a single broad stroke. But for us, it's not that simple.
I'm running a small business and it depends heavily on shoppers. The renovation of the shopping area was heavily supported by the Liberal Democratic Party. The L.D.P. in the prefectural assembly gave us the budget to put in a large new parking lot and to pay for tile to cover the sidewalk.
Still, I cannot forgive them for what they did in these corruption cases. The L.D.P. was really arrogant with power. The pus has poured out. As for the Hata group's members [the Renaissance Party], who claim they are reformers, when you think about what they did in the past, they were swimming in the mainstream of the money politics. People like me cannot simply accept their explanations.
I was watching a morning talk show on TV the other day. All the party members were talking only about themselves. I was disappointed with all the incumbents. They are far from the ordinary people in their feelings. It may be almost impossible to change.
 
Hiro Kawamoto
Research manager, electronics company; 55, of Nara

I was not interested in politics until now. To be honest with you, I didn't vote often, but when I would, I voted to make the balance better. I think this is a great opportunity for Japan to move to a two-party system like the United States, with each party checking the other. I thought it was a great system when I was in the States.
You have the Democrats and the Republicans, but from the outside the difference between them is small. In order to make that system operate, the policies of the two parties should not be that different. We businessmen do not want the policies to change drastically every few years. That's really crazy.
As for the scandals, you get sick of them. You don't want to talk about it. The Liberal Democratic Party has been guiding Japan for the last 40 years. They did a lot of crummy things, but I guess they were 60 to 70 percent right in guiding industrial development.
 
Kojin Karatani
Professor of literature, Hosei University; 51, of Tokyo

What's going on in Japan is not unique to Japan. The situation in Italy is similar, for example. All this is caused by the collapse of the cold war. The former regime was justified by anti-Communism and everything was passed under the pretext of anti-Communism. But now Communism does not exist as an effective force.
At present what's happening is a collapse from within the Liberal Democratic Party. It's not people's anger that caused it. But still, this situation might make people think that the system is changeable. Until now, they have been too used to the system.
There will be more and more small parties. They will all be shuffled again. What the new combination will be like is unpredictable. It depends on human elements.
 
Takashi Hashimoto
Student, international relations, Sophia University; 23, of Tokyo

When the L.D.P. split, I expected something drastic might happen. But now I'm rather disappointed and I wonder if anything will change. I was most disappointed by the Japan Socialist Party. This is the time people's expectations of the party as an alternative are high. But they never offered policies of their own, so I didn't vote for them in the municipal elections.
The biggest problem is the close ties between the politicians and businessmen. At the same time, that is the source of Japan's success. So I guess it's difficult for Japan to abandon that quickly and evolve into a free market system. I'm not from a farm household so I feel some kind of compromise is necessary on trade.
The best thing we can expect is to have two firm, stable parties that can offer us a choice of policies.

For all the spectacular devastation of the Mississippi flood of 1993, the impact on the huge American economy is likely to be very small, many experts say.
While the flood has threatened to interrupt shipments of food, chemicals, cars and other products, nearly every obstacle has so far been overcome or bypassed -- avoiding the damage that might have resulted from grain shortages or interrupted shipments from Midwestern factories. 
 When the floods washed away a railroad bridge across the Mississippi at East Hardin, Mo., cutting the Santa Fe's main line from Chicago to Southern California, trains were rerouted along another railroad's tracks to cross the river below St. Louis. When the water covered the tracks used by the Monsanto Chemical Company to ship herbicides from its plant in Muscatine, Iowa, the herbicide went by truck for two days, while new ties and track were laid on top of the old ones, bringing the rail line back above water.
And while 3,000 barges are stuck on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, the grain in them is mostly for export and not immediately needed, said Keith Collins, director of economic analysis at the Agriculture Department. Elevators in New Orleans, at the mouth of the Mississippi, currently hold enough grain to satisfy export orders, so the stuck barges are for the moment serving as warehouses for millions of tons of grain.
 
All Disruptions Local
 "There are all kinds of little disruptions and stress to the nation's economic system, and certainly Des Moines has a huge problem," said Robert Schnorbus, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "But nothing is shutting down in America beyond the actual flood area."
Federal officials are estimating damages at $2 billion to $3 billion, mostly in lost crops. That is far below the $18 billion in devastation from Hurricane Andrew last year.
There are many examples of a national economy largely untouched by record flooding that has brought hardship to the upper Mississippi Valley.
Five leading railroads, for example, have miles of track under water. "It could cost us $300,000 a mile to repair damaged track," said Frank Wilner, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads. But by rerouting traffic over each other's track, the railroads have managed to maintain shipments, with 24-hour delays at most, Mr. Wilner said.
Similarly, the Olympic Marine Company, which operates 64 barges on the Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois and Ohio Rivers, mostly taking grain to New Orleans, found itself with 11 barges stuck on the Illinois, reducing the company's revenue from barge fees.
 
Thousands of Barges Stuck
 "I would estimate that one-third of the 9,000 barges carrying dry cargo on the rivers are stuck, unable to move on the flooded rivers," said Donald G. Leeker, Olympic's president. "What that means is that barge rates are higher and we are restricted to the Ohio. Nevertheless, the demand for barge equipment is meeting the supply of barges, and you can see this equilibrium in the falling grain prices this week."
As the flooding grew worse, prices of corn and soybeans, the principal grains in the northern Midwest, rose sharply, in anticipation of shortages, not only from transportation disruptions but also from widespread crop destruction. The Agriculture Department quieted some of this concern on Monday by issuing a new harvest estimate, one that lowered the harvests by a relatively mild 7.6 percent for corn and 3.5 percent for soybeans.
Some grain traders had predicted greater losses and a slight rise in the nation's inflation rate from shortages of corn and soybean used mainly as cattle feed and to make vegetable oils and sweeteners. But the Agriculture Department insisted that grain in storage from last year's record harvests would be more than enough to make up the shortfall -- although individual farmers with fields under water might lose a year's income.
 
'Too Small to Notice'
 "The effect of the crop loss on the consumer price index will be too small to notice," Mr. Collins said. He estimated that the loss might be close to $2 billion, part of it covered by Federal insurance. An additional $1 billion or so might be lost in damage to property other than crops, the Federal Emergency Management Agency says. But this is a very initial estimate of the impact on the states most affected by the floods: Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and South Dakota.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said her office would wait a few more days to get a better sense of the damage before trying, through computer simulations, to determine the flood's economic impact. But most economists, comparing the flood with Hurricane Andrew, see a vast difference. While thousands of homes and commercial buildings had to be rebuilt after Andrew, the main flood loss is likely to be crops.
"They are going to be replanted anyway next year," said Lawrence J. Meyer, a St. Louis economics consultant. After Andrew, rebuilding the homes and buildings created thousands of jobs and contributed, economists say, to the surge in the nation's economic activity in the fourth quarter last year.

HEADLINE: A Look at the North American Pact's Added Costs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration and Congress grapple with the political problems of the North American Free Trade Agreement this summer, one issue keeps coming up: the potential cost of the pact to the Federal budget.
Estimates range up to $40 billion in lost tariff revenue, benefits for American workers who are unemployed as a result of new competition from Mexican factories, and bridges and highways to carry additional traffic. 
 Congressional pay-as-you-go budget rules require that such revenue be made up. This has produced an increasingly desperate search in Washington for ways other than Federal taxes to raise money. The Administration and Congress are looking for as much of this money as possible from state, local and private sources.
 
One of Several Estimates
 In the Administration's first public discussion of some of the costs of the agreement, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said today that $15 billion to $20 billion would be needed over the next decade for roads, bridges, sewage-treatment centers, improved housing, electric-power plants and environmental cleanup projects along the Mexican border.
But he also said that the Administration expected business to provide most of that money, spurred by potential earnings from tolls and fees from the sewage and power facilities.
On Thursday and Friday, Mr. Brown said, Clinton Cabinet members will try to drum up commercial interest at a meeting in San Antonio with Mexican Cabinet ministers and with about 400 investment bankers, engineers and state officials.
The Secretary said that private companies had ignored the potential in border investments for many years and are now recognizing it because of the proposed North American pact.
Others, though, questioned some of Mr. Brown's assumptions, including the idea that industry would step forward to provide services often supplied by the Government.
"If they're going to try to do this on the cheap, my vote counts and everyone else's vote counts show they come up short," said Charles Kamasaki a vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group that supports the trade pact.
After several months of work, the Congressional Budget Office this week released a detailed analysis of the accord's prospective costs. It estimated a loss of $2 billion to $3 billion in tariff revenue over five years.
The pact would also result in extra spending on worker retraining, on agricultural programs and on transportation and environmental programs on the border, the budget office said. It provided few specific figures.
 
Inter-American Bank's Offer
 Another source of help is the Inter-American Development Bank, an institution like the World Bank, which seeks to help poor Western Hemisphere nations. It has quietly offered to create a $10 billion fund for project loans. The Federal Government would be required to contribute only $250 million of this, and the rest would be raised through bond issues, an international financial official with a detailed knowledge of the plan said.
Representative Esteban Torres, Democrat of California, said today that he plans to introduce legislation this week to create a North American Development Bank. The bank would be set up with $1 billion in Federal money and would issue $5 billion in bonds to pay for transportation, environmental and community-development projects anywhere in North America, not just in border states.
Creation of that bank is the idea of Raul A. Hinojosa-Ojeda, an assistant professor of planning at the University of California at Los Angeles. Mr. Hinojosa-Ojeda has strong political ties in Washington and Mexico City, and this, combined with his connections with national Hispanic groups, have gained attention for his idea in the Administration and Congress.
Mr. Kamasaki said his group supported the new bank partly because its proposed charter would provide for extensive consultation with local businesses and residents.
 
Diluting Opposition
 By making loans across the nation to communities struggling to cope with international competition, the bank could also lessen opposition to the trade agreement from members of Congress who feel that border states will be the main beneficiaries.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is organizing House support for the trade pact, said Congressional interest in the new bank was growing. But he said that a small tax on trade across the border might also be necessary.
Corporations bitterly oppose such a tax, arguing that it would undo part of the benefit of tariff reductions. Mr. Matsui said that a tax could be set as low as one-quarter of 1 percent.
Current United States tariffs on Mexican-produced goods average 4 percent, although a few items, like table glassware, face tariffs up to 30 percent.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Free Trade: The Costs . . ."
 
LOWER TARIFF REVENUES: Estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $2 billion to $3 billion over five years.
 
RETRAINING OF WORKERS WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS: Predicted by the Clinton Administration to exceed the $1.68 billion over five years that had been estimated by the Bush Administration.
 
EXTRA BORDER BRIDGES, HIGHWAYS AND SEWAGE TREATMENT: Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said today that it would cost $15 billion to $20 billion over the next decade.
 
EXTRA CUSTOMS INSPECTORS: Some in Congress want more staff members to prevent drug trafficking and other smuggling.
 
EXTRA SPENDING ON AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS: Price supports and export-finance programs would rise slightly, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 
". . . and the Potential Revenue Sources"
 
INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND WATER COMMISSION: This Mexican-American commision - whose limited authority along the border includes controlling the salinity of the Rio Grande, approving new bridges and maintaining boundary buoys - could issue bonds to pay for bridges.
 
NORTH AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK: A new institution, backed by taxpayer money from Canada, Mexico and the United States, would issue bonds to pay for projects anywhere in North America.
 
INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK: An existing lending institutions jointly controlled by Western Hemisphere governments. The bank's management has offered to create a $10 billion fund. Only $250 million in Federal money would be needed, and the rest could be borrowed using the bank's AAA credit rating.
 
FLAT TAX ON CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES: Critics of the proposal by Senator Max S. Baucus and the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, say that it would merely replace tariffs with taxes.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Nominee Would Scrutinize Advisers

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Arthur Levitt Jr., President Clinton's nominee for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said today that he wanted to hire 170 inspectors to strengthen oversight of the increasing number of investment advisers.
Mr. Levitt said the number of such advisers had risen to 18,000 from about 5,000 five years ago. 
 "We are now inspecting these investment managers once every 30 years. That is no inspection," he told the Senate Banking Committee during confirmation hearings.
 
Better Way to Meet Expenses?
 Mr. Levitt also proposed that the S.E.C. keep all the money it raised from filing fees to pay for its operations. The agency currently hands over extra fee income to the Treasury.
He said self-financing would be a more effective way for the commission to regulate the financial-services industry. "An S.E.C. which is understaffed," he said, "is one that can seriously impair our capital markets, which would do more to damage our economic situation than anything else I can think of."
Mr. Levitt, a former brokerage executive, the former chairman of the American Stock Exchange and the son of Arthur Levitt, New York State Comptroller from 1955 to 1979, won bipartisan support today and is expected to be quickly confirmed.
He promised the senators to look closely at a proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to require companies to deduct the value of stock options from their earnings. Several senators expressed concern that the proposal would harm emerging companies that rely on stock options to increase the compensation of their executives.
Mr. Levitt acknowledged that he was apprehensive about trying to solve accounting problems by legislation.
 
Sidestepping a Turf Battle
 Pressed for his views on merging the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with the S.E.C., a controversial matter on which opinion tends to divide between more conservative Easterners and free market-oriented Chicago traders, Mr. Levitt tried to finesse the question. He said that talk of an agency merger "has been like merging Israel and Syria."
A priority as S.E.C. chairman, he added, would be regular planning sessions with the Commodity Futures Commission, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Comptroller of the Currency on how the agencies might coordinate market regulation and respond to a financial crisis.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Mortgage Risk Great in 3 States

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut do not fare well in a new analysis of mortgage default rates. The three states are projected to have among the highest default rates over the next five years.
The analysis, done by Fitch Investors Service Inc., the credit rating firm, divides the country into 43 regions and uses a set of economic indicators -- unemployment rates, personal income growth, housing starts, existing home sales, industry diversification and population growth -- to project future default rates. 
 The projections provide Fitch and its customers with a yardstick to measure the risks associated with mortgage-backed securities that have credit ratings at the bottom of the investment-grade category (triple B and single A) and those below investment grade (single B and double B).
 
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities
 "Investors must be concerned with the regional makeup of mortgage-backed securities, especially when moving down the scale" of credit ratings, said James D. Nadler, a managing director at Fitch.
In the rankings, which will be updated each quarter, New Jersey and New York State are divided into several regions.
New Jersey, excluding Essex, Bergen and Passaic counties, has the highest projected default rate, 1.70 percent, of all residential mortgages outstanding. Connecticut is second at 1.46 percent, followed by Essex, Bergen and Passaic at 1.43 percent and metropolitan New York at 1.30 percent.
New York State, excluding several regions, is sixth with a rate of 1.24 percent, followed by Albany with a rate of 1.09 percent; Nassau and Suffolk counties are ninth with a rate of 1.02 percent. New York City is 10th with a rate of 0.99 percent.
 
 
National Average: 0.74%
 The rates are higher than the projected national average of 0.74 percent.
The region with the lowest default rate is Washington State, at 0.23 percent.
But Gregory G. Raab, an analyst at Fitch, said he expected that Washington's rate would rise sharply as the current economic conditions in the model were revised over the next several quarters.
He said the data in the projections were through the end of 1992, so they did not reflect more recent layoffs at the Boeing Company, which is based in Seattle. "There is not enough negative data in Washington yet," he said.
 
Treasury Market
 It appeared that investors and traders had done all their buying ahead of yesterday's release of the Producer Price Index for June. Prices fell by three-tenths of 1 percent, meeting analysts' expectations.
This meant there was little reaction to the report yesterday. The price of the 30-year bond edged up 4/32 , which dropped the yield from 6.62 percent on Monday to 6.61 percent, yet another low for the 16 years since the Treasury began to issue 30-year bonds regularly. But prices of Treasury notes fell slightly, while the discount rates on Treasury bills rose.
Many investors sat on the sidelines yesterday, waiting for the Government to release today its reports on consumer prices and retail sales for June, analysts said.
And there were signs that investors, in the corporate market at least, were still not very willing to make long-term investments despite the good news on inflation. Instead, money still seems to be flowing into shorter-term issues.
 For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority sold $150 million in two-year notes yesterday at a yield that matched the yield on current two-year Treasury notes.
William F. Malec, the chief financial officer of the authority, said that this was the first time a T.V.A. issue had a yield as low as a Treasury security since the authority re-entered the public debt market in 1989.
Although the T.V.A. is considered by investors to be a quasi-governmental agency, there has been a spread between the yield on its bonds and Treasury securities, which are believed to be the better credit.
Mr. Malec said that the low yield of 3.995 percent was a reflection "of our strength." But he also acknowledged that it showed there were many investors with cash who still do not want to risk it in longer-term securities.
The T.V.A. issue, which was a competitive bid, was won by the First Boston Corporation.

HEADLINE: With Congress Back in Town, Supporters of Budget Bill Gear Up

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
With Congress back from a 10-day recess and most Administration officials home from the economic summit in Tokyo, the Government's top policy makers began planning today for the final burst of energy that they hope will lead to enactment of the President's budget.
At the White House, officials said a special office they call "the boiler room" was being set up under the direction of Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman to coordinate the lobbying and public relations tactics for the deficit-reduction legislation. 
 In the Senate, George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said he would set aside lunchtime Thursdays for the rest of the summer for special strategy sessions on the budget measure that is now before a conference committee.
In the House, Democratic leaders began counting votes and twisting the arms of potential defectors on the final vote and called a caucus meeting Wednesday of all Democratic representatives to drum up support for the budget.
 
Presidency to Be Tested
 The legislation would set the Government's tax and spending policy for the next five years. The prospects, officials agree, are touch and go, and Bill Clinton's ultimate success or failure as President may be in the balance.
A defeat, said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who will be the chief Senate conferee on tax matters, would cause the Clinton Presidency to "close down."
A House-Senate conference committee is scheduled to begin work Thursday to resolve the differences between budget measures passed by the House in May and the Senate in June. The conference is expected to take at least two weeks, with a final vote likely the first week in August.
The two bills were approved by the narrowest of margins -- 219 to 213 in the House and 50 to 49 in the Senate with Vice President Al Gore voting to break a tie. No Republican voted for the measure.
The bills are similar in most important respects. They would lower the deficit by a total of about $500 billion over the next five years, mainly by raising the taxes of wealthy individuals and corporations, by reducing military spending and by limiting the growth in spending for Medicare.
 
Tough Talks on Energy Tax
 But delicate negotiations will be needed to resolve the differences over energy taxes and spending on social programs. With no Republican support whatsoever, a shift of three Democrats in the House or one in the Senate would be enough to kill the whole budget and, in the view of many politicians, render President Clinton politically ineffective for the rest of his term.
"The future of the Democratic Party and the future of the Congress as an institution are at stake," said Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a chief deputy Democratic whip, who is working almost full time on the budget.
So how did he think it would turn out? Mr. Richardson was asked.
"It will pass, but it will be a huge battle, one that we are already working on," he replied.
And how were they working on it?
"By working on members and by praying," he said.
Mr. Richardson, whose special responsibility in the Democratic leadership is keeping tabs on lawmakers from the Western states, said that about 50 Democratic Representatives cannot be relied on to vote in favor of the budget. With all Republicans voting "no," the measure will fail in the House if more than about 40 Democrats vote against it.
The most important difference between the Senate and the House bills involves energy taxes. The House approved a broad tax on most forms of fuels that would generate $72 billion in new revenue over five years. The Senate bill would merely increase the Federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel by 4.3 cents a gallon, raising only $23 billion over five years.
An Administration official said one compromise under consideration would be to add to the Senate's gasoline and diesel tax a new tax on utility bills and home heating oil.
 
Levy on Middle Class
 But the energy tax is essentially the only new levy in either bill that would affect families of modest means, and a coalition of liberal and conservative Democratic representatives would like to scrap it altogether and make up the lost revenue somewhere else, perhaps with a bigger increase in the corporate income tax rate. Both bills would lift the corporate rate to 35 percent of profits from 34 percent.
A leader in this coalition, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, said the energy tax had become "a political nuisance getting in the way of Clinton's message."
It allowed Republicans, he said, to argue that Mr. Clinton was raising the taxes of the middle class, thus jeopardizing the entire program. On the other hand, Mr. Obey said, taxing rich people and corporations "has always been a unifying force in the Democratic Party."
But the White House and Congressional leaders believe that to raise the taxes on the wealthy and on corporations even higher would be bad economic policy.
Taxpayers with incomes of more than $200,000 would have their taxes raised by 18.6 percent under the Senate bill and 17.2 percent under the House bill. Those with incomes below $20,000, or even $30,000 in some instances, would get a tax cut, and few taxpayers with incomes below $200,000 would have their taxes raised by more than about 2 percent.
 
Misperceptions in Districts
 Lawmakers who spent the Fourth of July recess at home said many of their middle-income constituents were under the misperception that they would be hit by much higher taxes.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, accused Republicans of misrepresentation and said the President and Democrats in Congress needed to work harder to set the record straight.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana made a similar point. "This program has to be better sold, better explained," he said,
Some lawmakers said the solution might be to drop the energy tax and simply lower the sights for deficit reduction below $500 billion over five years.
"Nobody back home is saying, guys, it's got to be $500 billion, not $400 billion," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana. But few others agreed with Mr. Breaux, and at least for now, the $500 billion figure seemed to be a magic one.
"I don't believe in starting to erode the target," Mr. Foley said.
After a session this afternoon with some wavering Democratic representatives, Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's budget director, said it was important to keep the $500 billion target.
"Once you start moving away from that," Mr. Panetta said, "you're in danger of getting on a slippery slope."

HEADLINE: Renovations Set for Area Near Yankee Stadium

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
New York City is planning to renovate the Bronx Terminal Market, a hulking collection of warehouses and stores just south of Yankee Stadium, officials said yesterday.
City officials said the plan, which is to be announced at City Hall today, was an effort to reverse the blight in the neighborhood around the ballpark. But it could also provide additional parking space for the stadium, according to one City Hall official. 
 The announcement comes as both the Mayor and the Governor are mounting campaigns to save the Yankees for the city. The Yankees lease on the stadium expires in 2002 and in recent weeks, the team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d, has again discussed the possibility of abandoning the city, citing falling attendance and concerns over safety and parking in the area.
Mayor David N. Dinkins has pledged to do all he can to prevent the team from leaving the Bronx. At the same time, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been floating a plan to build a new stadium atop a rail yard on Manhattan's West Side. The Governor and Mr. Steinbrenner met in recent weeks to discuss the idea. The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, insisted that the plan for the market was not directly linked to the city's efforts to keep the Yankees in the Bronx. But he added that it would address Mr. Steinbrenner's concerns about improving the public perception of the South Bronx streets that surround the stadium.
"I presume the Yankees will not be unhappy we're finally dealing with the blight right next door," he said.
The announcement is planned for midday at City Hall, where Mr. Dinkins will join Mr. Ferrer.
"I applaud the Mayor in his boldness in asserting leadership and preserving the economic viability of the market and the Bronx," Mr. Ferrer said.
In order to renovate the market, the city would terminate the lease of the private company that runs the market.
 
Dispute With Leaseholder
 Through the Economic Development Corporation, the city has leased the market to the Arol Development Corporation through the year 2052 and has been entangled in litigation in recent years concerning repairs and rent. Structural problems with a viaduct that runs through the market led to its closing for safety reasons, as has been the case with a large warehouse on the edge of the property.
Borough officals said the area, with its dim and littered streets, has become a magnet for prostitutes and drug dealers, and that a procession of tenants have left for other locations.
"If we do not intervene now it will continue to decline and will eventually be a ghost town," Mr. Ferrer said. He said the plan called for the city's taking responsibility for the property, making improvements on some buildings and demolishing others, with the aim of establishing a co-operative market among the merchants. The market houses some two dozen merchants, mostly food wholesalers that supply bodegas and small supermarkets.
Officials at Arol Development said yesterday afternoon they were unaware of the city's decision, adding that they have tried without success to work with city officals on resolving the problems.
 
Part of Development Plan
 "They can't decide on our future without bringing us into the picture," said Gabriel Buntzman, a vice president of Arol Developoment.
He insisted that his company has met the lease conditions, which in his interpretation placed responsibility for repairs with the city. He said the city was responsible for driving some merchants from the market by closing off some of the ramps that lead to and from the market.
Mr. Ferrer said he has been calling for major changes at the market for the past six years, and criticized Arol Development for "milking" the site while allowing it to deteriorate.
He noted the plans for the market are in keeping with the proposals for the Bronx Center, an ambitious development scheme aimed at revitalizing a 300-block area of the South Bronx with new governmental, housing and commercial construction.
Those plans have touched on the topic of additional parking for the Yankees, including the possibility of a 3,000 car garage on the Harlem River. He insisted that the market plans were not explicitly part of any plan for providing parking.
"This is an announcement aimed at improving the market and the economic viability of the market," he said. "Anything that causes the market to rebound should improve the atmosphere around the Yankees."
 
'Why the Rush Now?'
 Several people familiar with planning for the area said that while nothing explicit has been mentioned about providing parking for the ballclub at the site of the market, it would be a logical choice, considering that the problems surrounding the market are long-standing.
"I would imagine they're tying it in," one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "This has been going on forever, so why the rush now?"
Ellen Baer, chief of staff to First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, who has been coordinating the city's efforts to improve attendance at Yankee Stadium, said that during a meeting of city officals last week to discuss possible parking sites, the market and a city park across the street from the stadium were mentioned among other sites. She added that the discussions were in the early stages.
Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner, said he had not heard about any specific parking proposal. He said Mr. Steinbrenner was pleased that the city was making an effort to come up with the 1,000 additional parking spaces that are part of its agreement with the the ball team.
"However, he wants to see exactly what the proposal is before he says anything further," Mr. Rubenstein added. "Adequate parking was supposed to be forthcoming for quite a long time and wasn't. He has some cautious optimism about the city fulfilling its longstanding obligation."

HEADLINE: First Charges Are Brought In Inquiries Into Deaths

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 13

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who the police say has confessed to killing 17 women, was indicted today on charges of murdering a 22-year-old Manhattan woman whose body was found here on June 28 in the back of his pickup truck.
In the first formal accusation to arise from investigations in several jurisdictions, a Nassau County grand jury indicted the 34-year-old East Meadow man on two counts of second-degree murder in the death of Tiffany Bresciani. Mr. Rifkin was also indicted on a charge of reckless endangerment for leading state troopers on a high-speed chase before crashing his pickup on a Mineola street, officials said. 
 Nassau County prosecutors said the two murder counts for one victim were intended to deal with different theories of Miss Bresciani's death. One count charges Mr. Rifkin with intentional murder, while the other charges that the crime was committed with "depraved indifference to human life." The trial jury will be asked to consider both.
Mr. Rifkin, who is being held without bail in the Nassau County Jail, faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on either charge, said Denis E. Dillon, the Nassau County District Attorney.
 
Plea of Not Guilty Planned
 Robert Sale, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, said his client would plead not guilty to the charges at his arraignment on Thursday. He added that he had no plans to seek bail for Mr. Rifkin, because it would be "an exercise in futility."
Officials in some other jurisdictions where bodies have been linked to Mr. Rifkin said today that they would probably wait to see how the Nassau County case progressed before presenting their cases to grand juries.
The discovery of Miss Bresciani's body led to Mr. Rifkin's arrest and his confession to 16 other killings, the police say. Based on information developed since then, the authorities now believe that Mr. Rifkin killed 18 women in the New York City region over the last three years.
The police have so far identified 10 women, either through Mr. Rifkin's confession or through evidence found at his home or in his pickup truck. The bodies of four others have not been identified, and a further four bodies have yet to be found.
Besides Miss Bresciani, bodies linked to Mr. Rifkin have been discovered in New York City, and in Suffolk, Westchester, Orange and Putnam Counties.
 
Dogs Used in Search
 Today, for at least the second time, the state police used dogs to search an area of West Nyack in Rockland County, where the police say Mr. Rifkin told them he had dumped a body. No body was found, said Capt. Arthur Hawker of the State Police Troop F in Middletown.
The authorities say they believe that Mr. Rifkin picked up Miss Bresciani on a Manhattan street sometime around June 24 and was on his way to dispose of her body four days later when troopers attempted to stop him for driving without a license plate. An autopsy showed that Miss Bresciani died of asphyxia, Nassau County officials said.
In announcing the indictments at a news conference here, Mr. Dillon declined to discuss any of the specifics of the case. He said, however, that Nassau County's investigation probably progressed faster than those in other places because Miss Bresciani's body was the first to be linked to Mr. Rifkin.
In New York City, officials said their cases were still in the investigatory stage. "We intend to prosecute those cases in which we have jurisdiction," said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.
Kevin L. Wright, the District Attorney in Putnam County, where the body of Ana Lopez was found, said that there was no need to rush the investigation in his county because "Rifkin isn't going anywhere."
"I believe we're going to await the results of the admissibility of the statements in Nassau, the admissibility of the physical evidence in Nassau, and to see what kind of defense he puts on," Mr. Wright said. "Then we'll basically have a clear picture of everything that he's got to present in the case."

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 8.94, for First Loss in 5 Sessions

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Despite the support of low inflation figures, the stock market slipped yesterday for the first time in five sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.94 points to close at 3,515.44.
The Government reported that the Producer Price Index for June fell by three-tenths of 1 percent. But leading market indicators were mixed, as investors continued their anxious vigil for some clear sign of where to put their money. As they wait, they are becoming more finicky about equities, said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer of John Hancock Mutual Funds. 
 "Rather than a stock market, it's a market of stocks, where individual stocks which have good earnings are performing very well," he said. "It's a continued rotational market on a stock-by-stock basis."
In such a market, weak performers are swiftly punished. Yesterday, Procter & Gamble helped lead the decliners among blue chips, after the company announced that it would cut prices by as much as 15 percent on some cleaning and laundry products. Shares of P.& G. fell 1 1/2, to 51 1/2.
Sometimes, jumpy investors jump too fast. That was the case with Martin Marietta yesterday, analysts said. On no discernible news, its shares dropped 2 1/4, to 79 3/4.
"What I heard was speculation in the marketplace that they weren't going to have a good second quarter," said Peter L. Aseritis, aerospace and military electronics analyst at First Boston.
Mr. Aseritis said such fears were misplaced, since, as he wrote in a recent report, the earnings pattern at the company is shifting. The second quarter will be weaker, he said, but later quarters will be stronger, producing the expected level of overall earnings.
Mr. Aseritis said that "I just sort of chuckled" on hearing that the share price was slipping. He added, "I said, 'Is the market that inefficient?' "
Among other leading market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks sank 0.89, to 448.09. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.80, to 708.47, and the American Stock Exchange composite index picked up 1.01, to 439.11. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 237 million shares, up from 202 million on Monday.
Some oil stocks slipped yesterday, evidently over continued concern about the low price of crude. Chevron closed down 1/2 at 84 1/2; Mobil lost 3/4 to close at 70 7/8.
"In early June, it became apparent that the demand wasn't there to soak up as much as OPEC was producing," said P. Timothy Lohmann, an energy analyst for Duff & Phelps in Chicago. "It's affected all the oil stocks. They're all off their highs."
Possibly also in reponse to low oil prices, airline stocks rebounded a bit yesterday, driving the Dow transportation average up 8.82 points, to 1,504.54. UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, climbed 3 3/8, to 126 1/4. AMR, the parent of American, gained 1/2, to 61 1/2, while USAir rose 7/8, to 14 5/8.
"They've come down a lot during a period when oil prices are coming down," said Kevin C. Murphy, the airline analyst for Morgan Stanley. "This may be some sort of last-minute catch-up to the news about oil."
After a fattening-up that lasted several weeks, bank stocks fell victim to some profit taking yesterday. J. P. Morgan led the losers, dropping 1 3/8, to 71 3/8. That makes this the fifth quarter in a row in which investors sold off bank stocks after earnings were reported, said James Schmidt, portfolio manager of the John Hancock Freedom Regional Bank Fund.

HEADLINE: June Drop In Producer Price Index

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Held down by persistent weakness in economic growth, prices received by American producers fell by three-tenths of 1 percent in June, the biggest monthly decline in more than two years, the Labor Department reported today.
This was the second consecutive reading of the Producer Price Index to provide reassurance that large increases early in the year were an aberration and not the early stages of revived inflation, analysts said. The index was unchanged in May after a six-tenths of 1 percent rise in April. It had risen at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the first four months of the year. 
 Analysts expect similar good news in the report on the Consumer Price Index for June, which will be issued Wednesday.
Producer prices last month were well behaved at the intermediate and crude stages of production as well on the finished-goods level, indicating little price pressure either in the manufacturing pipeline or on goods ready for the final user.
 
 
Rate Increase Is Unlikely
 With such compelling evidence, the Federal Reserve was seen as likely to abandon any thought of raising interest rates to combat inflation in the foreseeable future despite Midwest flooding that is expected to push food prices higher.
"Concerns about accelerating inflation in the early part of the year were misplaced," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist for HSBC Holdings in New York, parent of Marine Midland Bank. "Business conditions are soft -- and getting softer."
A rise in rates would be a blow to the Clinton Administration, which lost a Congressional battle to pass an economic stimulus program and is counting on low rates to spur the economy. And higher rates could weaken Congressional support for the President's $500 billion deficit-reduction program on the ground that higher rates combined with the program's higher taxes could send the country back into recession.
The June price decline for finished goods was the first time since November that prices fell and was the biggest decline since March 1991, the month that marked the official end of the recession.
The costs of food and energy both fell, but even with these erratic categories excluded, prices edged down one-tenth of 1 percent. Tobacco was a significant contributor as the industry's much publicized price war finally began to show up in the statistics.
"There's absolutely no reason to be concerned about inflation," said Mark Vitner, an economist for the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. "The only place where you have pricing power at all is in cars," he added. The auto industry is exploiting the yen's rise against the dollar this year to both recapture domestic market share and to raise prices. A higher yen makes Japanese products more expensive in the United States.
Automobile prices jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in June, the second price surge in three months, today's report showed. But pharmaceuticals, fish and residential gas were about the only other items moving significantly higher.
Over the latest 12 months, inflation at the producer level is just 1.4 percent, lower than the 1.6 percent year-to-year reading at the end of 1992. The so-called core rate, without food and energy, has improved comparably, to 1.7 percent from 2 percent.
Food prices dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent in June as fresh fruits and melons tumbled 11.4 percent, more than reversing a May surge, while fresh vegetables plunged a record 37.9 percent.
Energy fell five-tenths of 1 percent, about the same as in May, as lower prices for gasoline, lubricants and home heating oil more than offset another hefty rise, 1.1 percent, for natural gas.
 
 
Tobacco and Drugs
 Elsewhere, the price changes were dominated by tobacco, which dropped 5.9 percent after substantial increases in April and May. But both prescription and over-the-the counter drugs, which had shown little change in May, posted sizable increases of 1.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.
Prices of finished capital equipment rose two-tenths of 1 percent in June for the third consecutive month, today's report also showed.
Among intermediate goods, such as a bolt of cloth or sack of flour, prices climbed a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month after a decline of that amount in May. Prices for energy and durable manufacturing materials, such as mill shapes, turned up while construction materials fell less than in May.
There were big increases for both commercial and industrial electric power, liquefied petroleum gas, copper and brass mill shapes and cold rolled steel sheet.
 
 
Plywood Prices Ease
 On the other hand, plywood eased a bit more following steep drops in April and May while prices turned down for semifinished steel mill products, hot rolled steel bars, silver and cold finished steel bars.
Nondurable manufacturing materials, such as plastic resins, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in June despite declines for basic organic chemicals, paint and processed yarns and threats.
Among crude goods, the overall 1.1 percent decline following two sharp increases was broadly based and reflected declines in crude petroleum, hay, cattle, broilers, fruits, shellfish, corn, fresh and dry vegetables, cotton, cattle hides, copper ores and the softwood logs, bolts and timber category.
However, hogs, leaf tobacco and construction sand and gravel increased, while the rise in iron and steel scrap accelerated to 8.7 percent.
"Inflation determinants still appear benign," economists at Merrill Lynch concluded today, predicting that a bumper wheat crop would help counter the effects of flooded Midwest corn and soybean fields to keep the impact on overall inflation "minimal."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen in Rebound as Traders Rethink the Trade Accord

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday amid speculation that the new trade framework between the United States and Japan was unlikely to weaken the yen.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery slipped 40 cents, to $394.50 an ounce. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put spot gold at $393.50 an ounce, down 50 cents. 
 The dollar also gave up on a recent rally against the German mark and French franc, as doubts grew about a near-term cut in French and German interest rates, prompting widespread profit taking.
A further excuse to sell dollars came from a drop of three-tenths of a percent in United States producer prices in June. This reinforced the view that United States interest rates will stay low, limiting the yields and allure of dollar-based investments.
"The yen has come back in vogue," a bank dealer said. The Japanese currency rebounded as new developments chipped away at a trade framework forged over the weekend that had been hailed as a major breakthrough in slashing Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, sowed doubts when he called the framework "only a first step" toward a full agreement.
"The market is starting to look at this and say, What's different now than before?" said Jack Griffin, vice president at the Fuji Bank. "Are we back where we started? The differences seem to still be there."
The dollar selloff snowballed after Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, predicted the Japanese currency would soon surge to 100 yen to a dollar and would keep rising for years.
The dollar was quoted at 108.13 yen in late New York trading, down from 109.45 on Monday.
The currency also fell against the mark and French franc as fears of an imminent cut in German and French rates faded. In New York, The dollar dropped to 1.7195 marks, from 1.7300 marks late Monday. And it fell to 5.8695 French francs, from 5.9065.
The British pound settled at $1.4960 in New York, up from $1.4769 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Funds Lend Where Others Won't

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
"Come back next year and you'll see a miracle," said Michael Dawkins, muscling a concrete pillar as heavy as the July heat into the gutted row house he is helping to rebuild.
To call them decrepit would flatter the shells that Mr. Dawkins and other construction workers employed by the North Camden Land Trust are overhauling. And to call the neighborhood destitute would understate the enduring poverty on State Street, where the nonprofit organization is halfway through rehabilitating 20 units of affordable housing. 
 In a local economy as hollow as one of North Camden's 300 vacant houses, in a place with few jobs and no banks, the miracle is not just that abandoned buildings are being resurrected, but that somebody wrote a loan to make it possible. The odds against finding a mortgage in these parts would seem to be about as remote as the chances that it would ever be repaid.
But the Delaware Valley Community Reinvestment Fund, which is bankrolling the land trust's work, has grown steadily for eight years without ever having a loan go into default.
The track record of the fund has made it an exemplar for an increasingly vibrant form of financial institution: community development loan funds, which take cheap loans or donations from churches, charities, corporations and individuals, then reinvest the money at below-market rates of return in neighborhoods where conventional credit long since evaporated. Of 41 such funds for which there are industry data, losses to date are running at a very respectable 1 percent of total loans.
Community development loan funds like Delaware Valley would be among the financial institutions eligible to receive Federal support under proposed legislation that the Clinton Administration is expected to submit to Congress on July 15. The new program would provide $60 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and $382 million over five years.
During the election campaign, President Clinton spoke repeatedly of establishing 100 new "community development banks." At first, his objective seemed to be to create new institutions modeled along the lines of the South Shore Bank of Chicago, which makes loans to poor borrowers but operates like a traditional bank in the sense that it takes deposits as well.
But people with experience in financing development in poor neighborhoods have persuaded the Administration to broaden its bill to cover not only banks but also a panoply of alternative lending institutions.
The draft legislation that is now circulating in Washington would make any financial institution eligible for aid, in the form of Federal loans, grants or deposits, as long as its primary purpose is serving distressed communities. Conventional banks will not be eligible for assistance, not even if they have community development subsidiaries.
Martin Trimble, who heads the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, which currently has 42 member funds, said that Mr. Clinton would be able to keep his campaign promise this way.
"He's going to get 100 large-scale community development financial institutions out of this," Mr. Trimble said. "But he is not going to get 100 South Shores, nor should he."
The association contends that it is better to support smaller entities that are already involved in development financing, and let them, if they choose, grow into full-fledged development banks.
Although there is little vocal opposition to the Administration's proposal to foster community development financial institutions, some lawmakers are expected to offer competing approaches. And conventional bankers are arguing that they, too, should be allowed to participate in the program to the extent that they write community development loans.
Supporters say that community development financial institutions will fill a crucial gap in reviving poor neighborhoods.
 
Credit Termed an Essential
 "If credit is systematically denied to a neighborhood, that community will almost certainly suffer economic decline," said one recent report by researchers at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.
Existing laws like the Community Reinvestment Act, requiring banks to lend to the disadvantaged wherever they do business, are necessary but not sufficient to assure adequate credit, the report said.
"It is easier to make a banker out of a community activist than it is to make a community activist out of a banker," said the Bard report, "A Path to Community Development."
The new breed of community development financiers hang few business school diplomas on their walls, but they seem willing to put on pinstripes if that's what it takes to succeed.
"Our motive is not profit, but we are trying to build viable, sustainable financial institutions, and we look at this as a business," said Mr. Trimble of the loan fund association.
 
Past Efforts Foundered
 Some past efforts at neighborhood reconstruction have foundered, said Jeremy Nowak, the Delaware Valley fund's executive director, because the programs were managed by "bleeding heart liberals who were doing God's work, but did not have the ethic of accountability."
He made the comment after visiting one vacant dwelling on State Street where the North Camden Land Trust recently evicted a tenant who had failed to keep up with the monthly payments on the property.
The Delaware Valley fund, which has $12 million in loans outstanding throughout the region, has too much at stake to think of its beneficiaries as victims to be treated gently, Mr. Nowak said.
In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, the fund lent $2.2 million in Camden, $835,000 of it in the North Camden neighborhood -- a Hispanic and black community of about 8,700, amputated from the rest of town by the highway feeding the Ben Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia.
In North Camden, the median household income is $11,000, 42 percent of households are headed by women, unemployment hovers around 25 percent of the labor force, 57 percent of the people live in poverty and 75 percent receive public assistance of some kind.
 
Reliance on Subsidies
 Almost all of the housing the fund finances relies on some form of public subsidy, such as state development grants or Federal housing payments. But the fund's mission is to attract private credit, and it has recently drawn increased support from conventional banks.
Last month, seven New Jersey banks agreed to form a $3.2 million loan pool with which the fund will underwrite more ventures in Camden. The fund will screen loan applications, help train the borrowers in sound business practices and monitor the financial status of the projects that the banks are financing. The banks are Chemical Bank of New Jersey, Corestates New Jersey National Bank, First Fidelity Bank, Meridian Bank, Midlantic National Bank, PNC Bank and United Jersey Bank/South N.A.
Such conventional banks are required by law to lend in disadvantaged communities and this agreement helps them meet the obligation.
The first loan written under the arrangement between the fund and the banks, worth $150,000, will go to the North Camden Land Trust. It will help finance construction of 10 of the three-bedroom homes being renovated on State Street.
The venture would make a conventional banker cringe.
One of the problems that prevents normal lending here is the stubborn refusal of housing values to reflect renovation investments. "We could never count on the fact that the real estate would go up in value," said Mr. Nowak of the Delaware Valley fund.
Nor can a typical family's income be expected to justify a loan. Usually, it costs $50,000 to renovate a dwelling. But with median family income of $11,000, Camden households can afford only about $280 a month in payments. After taxes and maintenance, that will cover a modest mortgage, but the state or a private charity must also make a major contribution.
 
Plain Houses, Complex Finance
 So the houses on State Street, despite the touch of elegance lingering in their characteristic peaked facades, are kept plain and simple, with only the financing tending toward the baroque.
The first renovated homes were sold to local families, with the North Camden Land Trust holding the mortgages and retaining title to the land. Predictably, this caused problems if a homeowner later wanted to sell. The trust also wanted to be sure that the rehabilitated homes were adequately maintained.
So the trust now owns the homes it develops but allows residents to build equity as members of what is, in effect, a co-op. The portion of the payment that is used to retire mortgage principal is credited to the resident's account, to be paid back if the family moves after having lived in the home for at least five years.
Such arrangements are a far cry from the rough early days of North Camden's renewal movement, which grew up in a town scorched by riots in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
The housing struggle began when squatters moved into 13 vacant homes in 1981, winning ownership of them from the city and rehabilitating them. The squatting program eventually took over 140 homes.
In 1990, local activists beat back a state proposal to build a second prison in North Camden. Now, the activists are planning their most ambitious step yet. They are taking to the city government a proposal for a 15-year, $100 million development plan for the neighborhood. The planning project has been sponsored by the Delaware Valley fund, the land trust and the city's Camden Redevelopment Agency.
"People have gotten tired of fighting against things," said Tom Knoche, who helped write the plan. "It's time to fight for things."

OVERHEARD by R. Chester Redhead in an outdoor cafe on upper Madison Avenue. Mother to boy, about 6: "Hurry and finish your soup before it gets dirty."
Overheard by Elizabeth Hunter in the cafe at the recently renovated Jewish Museum. Gray-haired woman, almost certainly a tourist, to gray-haired man: "Ellis Island was nice, but the Statue of Liberty I could have done without." 
 Dear Diary:
Last week I was in Katz's, the delicatessen on the Lower East Side, and as I ordered a couple of sandwiches at the counter, I instinctively took out a dollar bill to tip the counter man.
I had learned this time-honored technique from my father, who started taking me to Katz's when I was a kid. He would order a sandwich and then tap a quarter on the counter, indicating to the gruff-looking fellow on the other side that there was a little something extra in it for him if he piled on a few more slices of corned beef.
Some 30 years and much inflation later, the going rate for a Katz's tip is about a buck or two for two sandwiches. The amount may have changed, but the effect is still the same.
As I found a table and cracked open a bottle of Dr. Brown's cream soda, I thought about this valuable piece of New York City information and the person I had learned it from.
Other kids' dads taught them how to play second base or how to figure out higher mathematics. My dad taught me how to order a decent corned beef sandwich. WARREN SHOULBERG

 A busy corner on Wall Street. Jack Grubel stops to make a phone call. There on top of the phone is a small camera. Expecting a frantic owner to rush by, Mr. Grubel waits for someone in distress. But he waits in vain. His windfall: a 35-millimeter point-and-shoot camera with a German name. Only a few shots remain on the film. What has caught the eyes of what is probably a foreign family visiting New York? A few days later Mr. Grubel has his answer in 27 photos.
Start the odyssey with a Park Avenue street scene and then proceed in this order: surrey near the Plaza; the entrance of the Gainsborough Studios on Central Park South; woman posing by a Jackie Mason poster; the entrance of The New York Times; Empire State Building; outlandishly garbed store mannequins; Central Park jogging path; youngster basking in F.A.O.

Then, apparently, a stop to make a phone call. Then: "Honey, you left it where?"
 
Dear Diary:
The time has come to tell about my latest telephone reservations call.
When I made a dinner reservation at Montrachet, the restaurant in TriBeCa, the young woman who took the call asked if we preferred smoking or nonsmoking. "Oh, definitely nonsmoking," I said. "One of our party has asthma and a second person has breathing problems of her own."
With warm and sincere sympathy, our reservation-taker said: "I know how it is. I have asthma myself. I'll put you in severe Nonsmoking." And so she did. ALICE LIPTON ECKSTEIN

After hearing so many voice-mail instructions in the last few years, I tend to become discouraged at the long lists of instructions that never seem to apply to my situation. But the other day I heard one that confirmed my faith in the people behind the machines.

HEADLINE: Review/Dance;
A Dark Meditation on Death by Martha Clarke

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., July 13

 BODY:
Past and present were united here this week on an unusual program at the American Dance Festival that ranged from a dumbfounding performance by Gary Chryst in a new work by Martha Clarke to major revivals, both rousing and poignant, of 1930's social-protest works by the modern-dance pioneer Helen Tamiris.
Miss Clarke's "Dammerung," created last spring in the Netherlands, received its United States premiere on Sunday night at the festival, and the effect of this 11-minute piece was nothing less than shattering. Mr. Chryst, a former leading dancer in the Joffrey Ballet who is often seen on Broadway (most recently in "Guys and Dolls"), has always been an outstanding, versatile artist. 
 Here he rises to a level of performance that any great actor would envy for its compelling profundity and projection. Yet only a great dancer's sense of phrasing could so dramatically fuse with the economy of movement in Miss Clarke's image of a man in the twilight of his life. His death onstage is so visibly a metaphor for Death in general that the end comes across as particularly brutal. Miss Clarke has outdone herself in this coup de theatre of a piece.
The dimension into which Mr. Chryst took his dance acting was so mesmerizing that he seemed -- with his partner Jeanne Solan -- in a different world from anyone else on the program. No one could match him on the same heightened scale of performance.
And yet the highly mixed bill at the Reynolds Industries Theater on the Duke University campus was far from a disaster. The six works on the program -- including three contemporary solos performed by Carol Parker -- shared a common theatricality. Certain connections were made. Both Miss Clarke and Miss Parker are former members of Pilobolus, and all the program's choreographers, except Tamiris, were associated with the festival. Moreover, social commentary ran through virtually each piece, past and present.
In Miss Clarke's "Dammerung," for instance, a character study becomes a social indictment. The work, performed to songs by Alban Berg, begins with Mr. Chryst wandering uncertainly in a black suit and hat that he takes off before dropping to the floor. After fumbling frantically in his pockets, he goes through a series of abstracted gestures and movements to the accompaniment of the song "Let Anguish Have Its Due." Mr. Chryst looks fearful and cold, but his collapses still have a dynamism. In the last section, some of these same movements will be recapitulated with ebbing energy.
There is a sudden entrance by Miss Solan, an American who has danced in the Netherlands Dance Theater under Jiri Kylian's direction. Dressed in black with a white lace collar, she is possibly an allegorical figure: the beloved or Death.
The action, filled with potential cliches, is nonetheless always so strongly on the edge of emotional pain that the final song, "Sleep," promises relief. Here Miss Clarke delivers her punch line, if that is the word. Mr. Chryst goes rigid (as if shot) and takes off his jacket. The audience sees his back and for the first time, a bloodstain on his shirt.
Robert Israel's cloudy backdrop, darkened by Joop Caboort's lighting, adds to the drama. The powerful resonance of the piece is such that it is open to various interpretations, but its emotional impact is unmistakable. Some saw "Dammerung" as a metaphor for the war in Bosnia; the solitude of an AIDS victim was ever present.
The social wounds that existed in the 1930's were evoked with astonishing fierceness in Dianne McIntyre's performance of "Negro Spirituals." Tamiris (1902-66) choreographed the work between 1927 and 1932. Miss McIntyre, a dancer and choreographer, supervised and researched the reconstruction of Tamiris's 1937 "How Long Brethren?" It was restaged here for students at the festival.
Beautifully reconstructed, the Tamiris pieces used choral movement, weighted power and militant gesture. In their obvious display of an early 1930's modern dance esthetic, they appeared remote from the program's contemporary pieces.
In discussions afterward, Miss McIntrye, who is black, rejected the idea that the solos by Tamiris, a white political radical, were naive. There was a basic truth, she said, in Tamiris's abstracted interpretation of the spirituals. There was also a shining truth to Miss McIntyre's performance. She lunged, she rocked, she plunged her arms down and always kept them in the asymmetrical shape that made the choreographic form so vibrant.
"Negro Spirituals" has been performed over the years. "How Long Brethren?," based on Lawrence Gellert's collection, "Negro Songs of Protest," was recently recalled from memory and photographs by Pauline Tish and two other members of the Tamiris company, Ida Little Arbeit and Sasha Pressman.
The reconstruction, commissioned by the Federal Theater Project of George Mason University in 1991, distills tragedy and hope in large and legible movements that are nonetheless too refined to turn into agitprop. A still shocking section is "Scottsboro," which evokes the famous trial in Alabama of young black men falsely accused of rape. Seven women on boxes or on the floor revolve or twist, implying a hanging.
Aziza, a guest artist, led the choral patterns, which were joyful or mournful. The sight of small choruses -- trudging in partial profile, bodies pressed close -- was dated in the best sense. They don't make dances like this anymore.
The proof came in the familiar contemporary solos performed by Miss Parker. These were Miss Clarke's "Nocturne," Alison Chase's "Moonblind" and Hercilia Lopez's "Amapola," a Venezuelan choreographer's study of a woman yearning for love in a macho society. Glossy and sophisticated, these dances suddenly looked lightweight.

Red, White and Blue, Almost Out of the Blue

BYLINE: By Robin Finn

 BODY:
Surprise, surprise. Only a half-dozen years ago, the male selection of American tennis prodigies offered all the promise of a black hole; this year a half-dozen of these wunderkids reached the Round of 16 at the most intimidating Grand Slam in the world, Wimbledon.
"In 1987, nobody was willing to put a nickel on the prospects of the American men," said Ron Woods, head of the United States Tennis Association's player-development program. "Now we're looking around and shaking our heads trying to explain what happened, why this glut?" 
 Now, no other nation in the world can boast of producing a generation of tennis players this dominant--or this different. With nothing in common except their megamillion endorsement contracts, Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and, in the not-so-distant background, David Wheaton, Todd Martin and MaliVai Washington have established the United States as the nation of record for men's tennis.
And in melting-pot tradition, there is no mass labeling for this occasionally gross national product of autonomous achievers. Sampras serves and volleys with imperial precision. Chang has girded himself with an unflagging mental positivism. Courier has removed the fire from his temper and injected it into his groundstrokes. Agassi is an improviser. Washington, Martin and Wheaton tuned up for tennis at college.
They hail from the Bible belt, from the corn belt and in the case of the Washington D.C.-born Sampras, the 1993 Wimbledon champion, from the Beltway. And Agassi, the only natural celebrity of this celebrated bunch, comes from Las Vegas, a place better known for producing plastic chips than tennis players.
And who wants to take credit for their collective presence?
"If we take credit, everybody gets annoyed," said Woods, "but we did have some effect on that crop of players as they just starting out. And I can't very well say we developed them: They're all too different."
The U.S.T.A. lent a helping hand, in the form of a starter program of free coaching for their fledgling years on the pro circuit, to Sampras, Chang, Courier, Wheaton and Washington, and is just now weaning Martin from his third year of assistance.
Sampras and Chang were, at 16 and 17, the first beneficiaries of the U.S.T.A.'s largesse. With the help of the U.S.T.A. contract coach Jose Higueras, Chang got the Grand Slam jinx lifted for American -born men by standing small at the baseline and capturing the 1989 French Open at 17. A year later, Courier asked for similar help when he turned pro, and he too was allied with Higueras, a pairing that continues.
As for the ongoing invention of Agassi, the U.S.T.A. is quick to issue a disclaimer. Only Nick Bollettieri knows for sure whether he's an act of God, a product of spontaneous combustion, or something else altogether.
"I didn't make Andre, I only helped him," said Bollettieri, who last week resigned as Agassi's head coach after a decade of togetherness turned into a Zen nightmare. "Andre is different, and he'll always be different. But we'll always have Wimbledon."
In varying degrees, so, too, will the rest of the Americans following what was, for several of them, their best and brightest Grand Slam appearance.
"It's our moment in the sun," said Sampras. "I really don't have any other great answer for it."
Their impact was almost comical at Wimbledon: even when the luck of the draw forced them to begin knocking each other off, they refused to go away.
Still reeling from Agassi's command performance as Wimbledon's hairiest White Knight ever in 1992, the once-sober Slam grew positively giddy in 1993. Agassi, this time decked out in a multihued Nike outfit that needed two trips through Wimbledon's sartorial scan committee before being approved, had the place in his sore right palm from start to finish.
Opponents and spectators swooned before him, and it took a level-headed effort from Sampras to subdue him in the quarterfinal round, where four Americans had advanced from the half-dozen United States men who reached the fourth round.
But Wimbledon was ablaze with All-American confrontations: Aaron Krickstein shut down Washington in the second round, and Wheaton disposed of Chang in the third only to fall in the fourth to Martin. Then, while Sampras went a full five sets against Agassi, Courier quelled Martin in straight sets to reach the semifinals.
At this point, Wimbledon faced the specter of an All-American final, but didn't quite take it seriously because of the arrival of two former champions in the semifinal round. Stefan Edberg, so All England Club-proper that he looks as if he'd just peeled himself off the ironing board, was tackling the baseliner in the baseball cap, Courier. And Boris Becker, who claimed to be feeling like the boy who owned Wimbledon in 1985 and 1986, was ready to outmuscle Sampras.
Wimbledon was guaranteed a Yankee champion for the second straight year, a travesty that hadn't happened since Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe ruled the lawns from 1981-84.
Bereft of legitimate complaints about the tennis skills of Sampras, whose classical strokes long ago received Fred Perry's seal of approval, and Courier, whose work ethic is above reproach even from the finicky British cognescenti, the keepers of Wimbledon's traditional flame were reduced to complaining about their language. As if the rest of the world's hopefuls, Britons included, never uttered an expletive in the heat of battle.
But in their final, Sampras and Courier played and behaved like the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the world ought to while at Wimbledon, or anywhere. And when Sampras stretched out in midair with saucer-eyes ablaze in pursuit of a textbook volley, he could almost be forgiven for being ao American. In that moment, he simply looked like the best of a very good bunch.

Is Smaller Better? Educators Now Say Yes for High School

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The big urban high school, a place of opportunity, anonymity and most recently fear, is under siege by a growing army of critics who want to abolish it.
A generation ago, educators endorsed large high schools because they could offer a wide range of subjects and extracurricular activities at a relatively low administrative cost. But now many researchers and educators alike see big urban high schools -- those with 2,000 to 5,000 students -- as Dickensian workhouses breeding violence, dropouts, academic failure and alienation. 
By contrast, students in schools limited to about 400 usually have fewer behavioral problems, better attendance and graduation rates, and sometimes higher grades and test scores. At a time when more children have less support from their families, students in small schools can form close relationships with teachers.
"In the attempts to build the comprehensive, 'we can do everything' high school, we left out something to belong to, to believe in," said William Ayers, a professor of education at the University of Chicago who is helping several Chicago high schools create smaller schools within their walls.
 
A Nationwide Trend
 Educators across the country are moving to replace big high schools with smaller ones. Philadelphia's system is the furthest along; here, the school district aims to convert all 22 remaining big neighborhood high schools into smaller schools-within-a-school. In New York City, more than 30 new small high schools will open this fall, including six that are part of a five-year project to close two neighborhood high schools and replace them with about a dozen small ones that will be located at first in separate buildings. More modest efforts are also under way in Denver and Boulder in Colorado, San Francisco, Chicago, Providence, R.I., and other cities.
Unlike "magnet schools," which can be large and often impose admissions requirements, these new small schools are aimed at the very students who are left behind, struggling, in large neighborhood high schools. Educators argue that small schools allow students, teachers and parents to know each other well, building bonds that are particularly vital during the troubled years of adolescence.
While many believe that smaller high schools would also help suburban students, most of the large-scale projects have been in urban high schools. Researchers have found that the stakes are higher for poor children, who do worse than their better-off peers in large schools.
Advocates of small schools want to do more than reach out to adolescents; they believe that small schools can be both agents and models of school improvement. "I'm arguing you cannot make the kind of radical change in the nature of schooling this country is calling for without small schools," said Deborah Meier, founder and co-director of the Central Park East Secondary School in East Harlem, a small public high school with graduation and achievement rates that far outstrip other non-specialized high schools in the city. "You have to create a very thick culture within the schools that helps teachers, kids and parents to change their habits of work."
But these fledgling schools must battle perceptions that they cost more to run and administrative structures that prevent them from making their own decisions about budgets, hiring, and scheduling. Nor will making schools smaller alone make them better; teachers usually have to be willing to reshape curriculums and testing, work in teams and take on more responsibilities.
And there are start-up costs -- in New York City, for example, at least $15 million over five years, including leasing costs for new buildings that extend into the tens of millions. Long-term costs are so far unknown, and some analysts say savings lost in economies of scale will be balanced by the need for fewer administrators in the small schools.
 
Tactics
New Ideas Bring 'Shining Stars'
 In Joseph Conroy's introductory French class, laughing students clustered around a game they had designed called "Egarge au Centre Commerciale" (Lost at the Mall). Whoever first spent a fixed amount of money at the stores won, and the students had to draw on their French vocabularies to translate which goods they needed to buy.
Upstairs in English class, Carolyn Tripp led a discussion about the relationships between culture and identity in America by having them read a comparison between skinheads and punks.
The students were attentive and excited, their interest caught by the unconventional ways they were learning their lessons. "Here, you not only have to study, you have to think about what you study," said Shannon Stott, an 11th grader. "You can't just memorize it."
These students belong to the Temple Connection, a group of 400 ninth- through 11th graders at Lincoln High School in northeast Philadelphia. The school admits students regardless of their academic or disciplinary records. Many of the students have troubled home lives, and many were not top achievers. But most have thrived since the school opened three years ago. "They are shining stars you thought were dull," said Gregg Staples, who teaches foreign languages.
This school within a school, called a "charter" here, is part of an ambitious citywide program to create small high schools within all 22 of Philadelphia's large neighborhood high schools. So far, 15 of the high schools have been broken up entirely into smaller subschools; others contain at least one smaller school.
The Philadelphia plan, like other movements for small schools around the country, draws on research and the experience of pioneers like Ms. Meier. According to Anthony S. Bryk, a professor of education at the University of Chicago who has reviewed most of the existing research on school size, most studies find that small schools have less absenteeism, lower dropout rates, fewer disciplinary problems and higher teacher satisfaction than big schools.
The studies do not show as clear a link between size and academic performance, but the most recent review of national data shows that the larger the school, the worse students scored on four standardized tests. This study, by Valerie E. Lee of the University of Michigan and Julia Smith of the University of Rochester, examined a 1988 national study of eighth graders and also confirmed previous research suggesting that poor children did the worst in large schools.
 
Old Wisdom Reversed
 These findings reverse the conventional wisdom of the 1950's, when educators argued that big was better. Some still believe that large schools offer children more opportunity and more variety, particularly in advanced subjects. And many districts continue to worry that small schools will be more expensive because they duplicate people and facilities.
Several studies counter by suggesting that large schools breed unnecessary layers of administration, like assistant principals or deans of discipline. And Ms. Meier said small schools could band together to offer advanced courses or better sports teams.
"The average large high school has a small school within it -- the small school of kids who know the faculty, are in all the theaters and clubs, who are the stars of the school, who walk down the halls and say 'Hi' to everyone," she said. "That's what schools need to do for all kids."
 
Results
Signs of Progress After 3 Years
 In Philadelphia, teachers at the Temple Connection say their school works so well because they get to know their students better, demand high intellectual standards, design their own curriculum and tests and have a voice in running the program.
Because their school has 400 students, as against nearly 2,000 in Lincoln High School as a whole, the Temple Connection teachers tend to know more about their students' lives. While this knowledge does not always prevent trouble, it guides teachers trying to devise solutions. Recently, two students were arrested after a fight at school. One was a Temple Connection student who had been in a mental hospital for a month.
"In talking to the administration, they had no idea of her problems," said Zachary Rubin, a social studies teacher and co-director of the Temple Connection. "That's what the charter movement is all about."
 
What Students Say
 Students agree. "If you're under a lot of pressure and stress, they help you through that," said Joy Grimmage, an 11th grader. "They won't put you down or put you on hold."
But students also say they welcome the school's demanding curriculum. The teachers, working with Temple University, have designed courses that weave subjects from different disciplines, such as the impact of science and technology on American life. The school, open to any students who want to enter, requires four years of mathematics, a laboratory science and a foreign language to graduate.
One principle of the Philadelphia small schools movement is to uphold high academic standards for teen-agers who in the past were often written off as indifferent students unlikely to move on to college.
Although the neighborhood around Lincoln High School is predominantly lower middle class rather than desperately poor, many students are battling staggering problems. One group of students who spoke articulately about how much they like the school included an unwed mother whose boyfriend has another pregnant girlfriend in the same school; a boy whose mother moved away one day, leaving him homeless, and a boy who spent the year nursing his dying father.
The Philadelphia schools are struggling with problems endemic to small-school movements around the country.Many are not really separate schools, with the autonomy that that implies.
Teachers at the Temple Connection still do not entirely control their own budget, hiring, scheduling, disciplinary policies or student assignments. They have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to persuade the administrator in charge of scheduling to allow them to teach classes in 90-minute rather than 48-minute blocks so that they can cover subjects in greater depth.
These concerns raise broader questions about the limits of Philadelphia's small-school design. Should the old high school administrative structure, with its principals, assistant principals, deans of discipline and schedulers remain in place supervising a cluster of small schools, or should they be abolished to save money and allow the schools more autonomy?
Constance E. Clayton, Philadelphia's superintendent, said she was committed to small high schools but needed to consult parents, students, teachers and union officials. "These are things we are trying to work through: how can we give them autonomy and accountability at the same time?" she said.
 
Differences
Other Approaches For Other Cities
 These struggles are echoed elsewhere as different cities try different routes. While Providence, Boulder, San Francisco and Chicago are all experimenting with small high schools, the biggest effort outside Philadelphia is in New York City. Rather than create schools within schools, New York is creating more than 30 entirely new, independent, small high schools in its most sweeping expansion of high schools in decades. These schools include several based on themes ranging from music to finance to community organizing and run in partnership with churches, community groups or unions.
Unlike Philadelphia, New York is not moving to make all its big high schools smaller. But one part of the project, run by Ms. Meier and Marcia Brevot, principal of Manhattan Collaborative High School, aims to develop a strategy for improving schools that could be applied to more high schools later.
Under the plan, the city would shut down two high schools and replace them over five years with about a dozen smaller ones. Although the small schools might eventually move back into the old high school building, they will start in separate locations, and no final decision has been made on whether any new construction will be necessary, or affordable. Based on her experience, Ms. Meier believes small high schools need full autonomy and, at the beginning, a different location so that they can create their own distinctive culture. "It's like imagining changing an auto parts factory while it's working," she said.
The new schools will adopt features from Ms. Meier's school, which has high standards for the poor, minority students whom many other schools have largely written off. Central Park East has a core curriculum, including subjects like physics, with students required to prove what they have learned in presentation to graduation committees before they receive a diploma. Every full-time teacher in the school is responsible for getting to know a group of 15 students and their families well. In a city where fewer than 40 percent the students graduate within four years, Central Park East, which opened on Madison Avenue at 106th Street in 1985, graduated 71 percent of its ninth-grade class in four years. More than 90 percent are attending college.
Beginning this fall, Julia Richman High School, on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, will not accept ninth graders. Instead, the ninth graders will enter one of six new smaller high schools around Manhattan. Each year, the small high schools will add a grade, and Julia Richman will phase out a grade, until Julia Richman shuts down entirely and the new small high schools have grades 9 through 12. The high school, on 67th Street between First and Second Avenues, drew its students primarily from East Harlem and had very high dropout rates. Many neighborhood parents avoided it altogether, Ms. Meier said. Next year, another high school yet to be chosen in the Bronx will begin phasing out, to be replaced by another six small schools.
The new high schools will be housed in several other buildings, with directors of their own and teachers who chose to teach in them. Students can choose to attend the school after going to one required information meeting. This fall's class will be roughly split between students who would have gone to Julia Richman anyhow and others who will come from other school districts.
Over time, Ms. Meier wants to redesign the buildings to house elementary through high schools along with a range of social and community services, possibly including social workers, psychological counselors and the like. The new high schools will be limited to 400 students. To pay for leasing buildings for new schools and for the staff training that Ms. Meier considers essential, she and her partners have raised $3 million from several foundations. "If this works, maybe this allows other schools to say we can do this on our own and gives people a picture about what this could be like," she said.
This project, too, has weathered difficulties. Leasing school buildings was a tortuous process, and teachers spent months in junior high schools just trying to find students who would be in Julia Richman's zone. Nor is it clear how enthusiastic a new schools chancellor will be about small high schools. But Ms. Meier believes this project offers her a chance to bring her ideas into the mainstream.
"This is a critical time," she said. "We can see whether this is a strategy for changing existing large high schools."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Guild Once Again Finds Itself Left Out

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
When 10 unions of The New York Post made their deals with Rupert Murdoch on Monday, it was no surprise in the newspaper industry that there was one newspaper union that was left out.
The New York Newspaper Guild, which represents reporters and some editors as well as advertising, clerical and circulation employees, has grown accustomed to that position. It seems always to be the left-out union. 
 Its battle at The Post comes on the heels of a devastating defeat at The Daily News this winter, when more than 170 members found themselves suddenly unemployed at the behest of the new owner, Mortimer B. Zuckerman.
At The Post, the guild's battle provides a snapshot of an unusual labor confrontation with roots in changes under way in big city journalism. And it provides insight into the immovable force of Rupert Murdoch as he solidifies his hold on a newspaper that obviously matters greatly to him, no matter how vast his international empire.
 
'Free Fire' Proposal
 On Monday, the guild won from Mr. Murdoch only the right to continue bargaining with the possible assistance of a state mediator. Mr. Murdoch's representatives said they were willing to talk. But they did not retract what the union calls a "free fire" proposal that would give managers the right to dismiss union members freely, and other demands that union officials have characterized as aimed at destroying the union.
Arthur M. Siskind, general counsel and executive vice president of Mr. Murdoch's International News Corporation, said the company's managers remain steadfast. "The issue really is: Do you have the right to determine who is going to work for you?" Mr. Siskind said. "We feel very strongly about that."
The guild brought trade unionism to people who wore white collars in journalism. It derived its once considerable power from alliances with unions representing people who set type, ran presses and drove trucks. Those alliances are frayed now, as illustrated most graphically by the inaction of the production unions when Mr. Zuckerman began his assault on the guild on the same day he took title to that newspaper.
But underlying the complex union politics are other issues. Newspaper publishers across the country argue that trade unionism in the newsroom has protected unproductive journalists and robbed news room managers of too much power. They say that is a luxury they can no longer afford. Privately, they also say they believe that the guild is so weak that the publishers have the power to do something about it.
In New York, both Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Murdoch have embarked on a determined course to weaken the guild's hold on the newsroom. Mr. Zuckerman has yet to sign a contract with the guild, which is the bargaining agent for many Daily News employees.
 
Warding Off Attacks
 Mr. Siskind said Mr. Murdoch's executives believe that it will be difficult to improve The Post "if we don't have people who can produce for us." He said that if The Post suffered in the quality of its content that might be the responsibility of newsroom employees "because they are not afraid of losing their jobs because of the way seniority works."
The contract between the guild and The New York Times expired in March and negotiations are under way. New York Newsday's editorial employees are represented by a different union.
For the guild, the problem has always been that a union could never sanction attacks on its members. Without job security for its weakest members, any union would wither.
In the Sheraton Hotel on Monday when Mr. Murdoch's executives reached their agreements with the other unions, there was a delicate dance with the guild. The guild, which has won assurances of support from the other newspaper unions, had its maximum leverage while all the unions were out of work together. Once the other unions were back at their stations, the chances of union solidarity in support of the guild, if it was ever substantial, would diminish.
The guild's willingness to work while negotiating gave management the right to claim a clear victory against its unions and to start the paper's presses again with a flourish. In exchange, the guild got to hope.
 
Review of Editorial Staff
 "We are certainly hoping that we, in a way, did them a favor," said Harry Leykis, president of the guild local at The Post, "and that we're going to get a little more humane treatment than The Daily News got."
Management, too, used the crisis to maximum advantage. By maneuvering the other unions back to work and promising only to negotiate with the guild, it worked to isolate the guild once again.
Mr. Murdoch's representatives also opened the possibility that in negotiations, the guild would consent to some form of review of current editorial staff. A negotiated settlement would give both sides the chance to avoid cataclysm and claim victory.
John F. Hudacs, the New York State Commissioner of Labor, who helped bring about the talks at the Sheraton, said he saw some hopeful signs for the guild-Murdoch confontation. He said there was some "common ground upon which they can have some discussions that can enable them to achieve competitiveness and still respect the guild as a labor organization." Mr. Hudacs said he was available to mediate, if invited.
For the moment yesterday, some guild members at The Post said they were so happy to be back they were trying hard not to think about what the other shoe would be like when it finally dropped.
Mr. Leykis said he was hopeful. But he knew there were some who were convinced Mr. Murdoch's people were simply talking about talking as a smokescreen for another onslaught against their union.
"I wasn't born yesterday," Mr. Leykis said, "and I know that's a definite possibility."

HEADLINE: Forget the Tiananmen Fixation

BYLINE: By Kenneth Lieberthal; Kenneth Lieberthal is professor of political science at the University of Michigan and a member of the university's Center for Chinese Studies.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich.

 BODY:
The U.S. should stop punishing China for the massacre of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. China is too important to make this the pivot of our policy.
China -- a nuclear power with intercontinental ballistic missiles and a permanent member's seat on the United Nations Security Council -- has enormous capacity to do mischief on the world stage. 
 Besides, China contains 22 percent of the world's population and has perhaps the world's third largest and most rapidly expanding economy. Unlike Japan and the four "tigers" of East Asia -- South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- China has an entire continent to develop, and this will provide major opportunities for foreign business.
America alone among the industrial countries still imposes sanctions because of the massacre. In May, President Clinton slightly modified our policy. He achieved bipartisan support in the Congress to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status without conditions this year. But he also tied renewal of that status in 1994 to Chinese progress on specific human rights and trade issues. He also suggested that he is seeking additional channels in which to resolve issues such as allegations of proliferation of Chinese missile and nuclear technology.
While Mr. Clinton's incremental steps are welcome, our approach needs a new foundation, not minor tinkering. We should stop viewing everything in terms of rewarding and punishing China and try instead to maximize our overall effectiveness in dealing with Beijing.
The President ought to take the following steps:
Declare that America has a national interest in a China that is reform- minded, stable, modernizing and that plays a constructive international role.
This could shift our relationship from constant niggling to a focus on broad mutual strategic interests. Without this change, our relations will remain deeply troubled and fragile.
Renew regular cabinet-level contacts between both governments.
Our refusal since the crackdown to deal regularly with Beijing at the cabinet level imposes a very high cost on relations. No Clinton Cabinet secretary has visited China in the past two years in any capacity -- but China has changed enormously in that time. Cabinet contacts greatly increase mutual understanding. Besides, almost without exception recent Congressional visitors have found China more vibrant and open than they had expected. But virtually no top Chinese leader has heard the views of his U.S. counterpart argued forcefully and directly, and this does us little good. High level visits also force both bureaucracies to resolve issues, which makes the whole relationship more dynamic.
Renew direct military-to-military contacts.
China's military is extremely important politically, especially in view of the impending succession. Its officers deeply resent our refusal since Tiananmen to deal directly with them. We discuss nonproliferation matters with the Foreign Ministry, but the military appears to delight in demonstrating that the ministry does not speak with authority on such issues. This may be affecting the military's decisions on some weapon and missile sales, especially those controlled by the military itself, from current stocks.
Establish a bilateral human rights commission to discuss broad human rights issues and specific cases of rights violations regularly.
Nothing will quickly change China's grossly inadequate record on civil liberties, as further evidenced by the arrest of Fu Shenqi, an outspoken Shanghai dissident, on June 26. But this commission would keep the issue on the agenda and might make the successors to Beijing's gerontocratic leadership more amenable to considering international standards on human rights. There is evidence that Beijing would agree to formation of such a commission.
Drop restrictions on providing assistance to China in the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership, led by the Agency for International Development.
China's huge size, rapid economic growth and coal-based energy structure will make it a prime source of increased global environmental damage during the decade. We cannot deal realistically with environmental issues in Asia without cooperating with China in this arena.
In short, China can vastly complicate or simplify international efforts to insure peace, to control proliferation of weapons and to deal with environmental change.
Beijing's actions are especially important for East and Southeast Asia. Instability in China would more likely increase the flows of refugees than usher in democracy.
In sum, America must be tough and effective with Beijing in the 1990's. We can do both only by putting the Tiananmen fixation behind us.

HEADLINE: Embargo on Iraq Backfires for Israel

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 14

 BODY:
Presumably, Israel would rank far down on lists of countries eager to ship arms, or anything else for that matter, to Iraq.
And since that is so, officials here say, they do not understand why the United States, French and British navies, in the name of enforcing the embargo against Iraq, have been stopping Israeli ships headed for the southern Israeli port of Eilat and, in some instances, diverting them to Mediterranean harbors. 
 "This situation is unacceptable and unnecessary, even if we agree that it is important to uphold the sanctions against Iraq," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told a parliamentary committee today.
At issue is an international naval blockade of the Strait of Tiran, connecting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. It keeps ships from sailing unimpeded up the gulf to Eilat or to the nearby Jordanian port of Aqaba, and this week it produced an Israeli complaint to the United States and accusations from the political opposition that the Government has not pressed Israel's case hard enough.
 
No Choice, Americans Say
 As chief enforcers of the embargo, the Americans insist that they have no choice but to stop everyone. They have no way of knowing, they say, whether a ship sailing through the strait will indeed wind up in Eilat, or whether it will instead turn into Aqaba or even stop somewhere else along the way with goods that could then be carried overland to Iraq.
"We're consistent, and we're unbiased," Lieut. Comdr. Bruce Cole, a United States Navy spokesman, told The Associated Press recently. "Vessels of all nations, including the United States, are subject to inspections."
But to Philip Earon, Eilat's Deputy Mayor and acting harbor master, that argument is "quite absurd."
"How can anyone think than any Israeli ship coming to Eilat could be carrying any kind of goods, let alone weapons, for Iraq?" he said. "The only missiles are coming from Iraq to us, not from us to Iraq."
Part of Israel's unhappiness is rooted in historical memory: Blockades of the Strait of Tiran have led to war in the past, conspicuously in 1967 after Egypt closed it to Israeli shipping. The fact that the intercepting is being done by friends this time is not seen as much of an improvement by some Israelis.
 
Port's Economy Hurt
 Perhaps more to the point, the blockade has put a dent in the economy of Eilat, where 700 families depend for their livelihood on a port that has turned dormant in recent weeks as the United States Navy has apparently tightened its controls.
In the last month, Eilat officials say, six container ships have been turned back by the Americans at the strait, and forced to go instead through the Suez Canal to the Israeli ports of Ashdod and Haifa, on the Mediterranean. Because of safety rules for the inspections, United States fleet commanders have begun waving off any ship approaching the strait that carries more than three tiers of containers. That works conspicuously against the Israelis, whose ships routinely stack containers four rows high or more.
In the end, the cargo still makes it to Israel. But the detours amount to an economic punch in the stomach for Eilat, and going through Suez to the Mediterranean adds several expensive days to the journey.
"We're losing quite a bit of money," said Rivka Benvenisti, a spokeswoman for Zim, the Israeli shipping line.
The issue is taken seriously enough here for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to have raised it with a high-ranking State Department team that left Israel today after spending several days in the region trying, without visible success, to break a stalemate in the Middle East peace talks.
One idea floated by the Israelis is that they give the Americans five days' warning that a cargo ship is headed for the Strait of Tiran, and then reconfirm once the ship reaches Eilat.
Thus far, United States officials have done little more than cluck in sympathy and say they are studying the proposal. But they also note that the three-year-old embargo against Iraq was authorized by the United Nations and that therefore any decision is not up to Washington alone.
Some right-wing Israeli politicians go so far as to suggest that the inspections are a plot by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations Secretary General and an Egyptian, to divert Israeli ships through Suez to bring his country extra canal fees.
It is "a dangerous ploy, rude and sly," Rafael Eitan, leader of the Tsomet Party, told Mr. Peres today. Mr. Peres seemed little impressed.

HEADLINE: JITTERY IRAQ HIDES INDUSTRIAL ASSETS

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 14

 BODY:
In anticipation of renewed American and allied air strikes, President Saddam Hussein is trying to protect strategic industries and important Government installations by removing crucial machinery, records and equipment and hiding it, foreign diplomats and Iraqis say.
This wholesale dismantling of the light industrial and Government sites thought to be targets appears to have begun in earnest in June, they say, before President Clinton launched a Cruise missile attack against an intelligence center in Baghdad. 
 But it has accelerated since then, particularly in the military-industrial sector, with factories being stripped of whatever machinery can easily be removed and the workers sent away indefinitely. Offices in the rebuilt presidential palace here have also been evacuated. And in some cases, Government officials have been ordered to take files home for safekeeping.
Iraqis here say the foreign intelligence service headquarters, which the United States attacked on June 27 with the loss of six civilian lives, was one of the Government sites that had already been evacuated in the belief that it might be targeted again.
 
Hussein Relative in Charge
 This effort to protect Iraq's crucial industrial and governmental centers from another bombing attack is being organized by President Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel Hassan, who oversees military industries.
And it is occurring as Iraq finds itself at another standoff with the United Nations Security Council over plans for monitoring two missile testing sites to insure that Baghdad does not develop forbidden weapons.
Rolf Ekeus, the head of the special commission overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is expected here on Thursday for talks with the Iraqis about their refusal to let his weapons inspectors install surveillance video cameras at these sites or to seal the equipment to prevent its use.
Under the Security Council's gulf war cease-fire terms, Iraq is required to give up its weapons of mass destruction and to allow long-term monitoring of its industries.
 
Warnings From U.N. and U.S.
 The Security Council has already warned Iraq that it faces "serious consequences" if it continues to prevent the inspectors from carrying out the monitoring. And President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have both hinted at possible new military action.
According to a recent United States Congressional study, despite the trade embargo Iraq has succeeded in rebuilding about 80 percent of its military industry, which was heavily bombed during the gulf war.
The assumption among diplomats here is that Iraq still wants a negotiated settlement to the dispute, particularly since the Security Council has made it clear that Baghdad's request for a partial lifting of the oil embargo so it can buy more food and medicine will not be considered until the quarrel is resolved. [Talks at the United Nations on the oil sales were suspended tonight, Reuters reported, when the Iraqi delegate said he needed instructions from Baghdad.]
But it is not clear whether a resolution will be possible because Iraq is effectively challenging the special commission's right to carry out the long-term monitoring, which Baghdad has not accepted in principle.

HEADLINE: Balkan Envoy To U.S. Gets New Respect

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Two months ago, Ljubica Acevska could barely get her phone calls to the State Department returned. Her requests for appointments with top officials at the National Security Council went unanswered.
Now, with some 300 American troops in Macedonia, Ms. Acevska, the country's representative in the United States, says there has been a "tremendous change in our interaction." 
 "People are more accessible," she said, referring to Government officials here. "I get my calls returned. I get briefed."
Ms. Acevska said relations had been looking up since Macedonia's President, Kiro Gligorov, met with Mr. Christopher in Vienna on June 14 to discuss the troop deployment there.
Macedonia, the tiny republic south of Serbia that split from Yugoslavia last year, is seen by many as a dike preventing civil wars in Bosnia and Croatia from spilling over into the rest of the Balkans. Macedonia has so far avoided being dragged into the conflict.
 
A Strategic Location
 "For months, I've been telling anyone who would listen that we are strategically located, that we can play a key role in this," said Ms. Acevska.
But she said that her main concern is United States diplomatic recognition for Macedonia, and on that, Washington has not changed its position. The United Nations and 30 countries recognize Macedonia, but the United States does not.
Ms. Acevska, a Macedonian-born American, has spent the last 18 months lobbying the State Department, the National Security Council and Congress for recognition.
"They're still not treating us as a sovereign nation," Ms. Acevska said. "We think it's a good idea to send troops, but the key to a peaceful Macedonia, and the Balkans, is recognition and economic assistance."
The United States has indicated that it will deal with Macedonia's recognition once Greece resolves the dispute it has with Macedonia's name, flag and parts of its Constitution, all of which Athens sees as implying that the Government in Skopje harbors a claim to the northeastern Greek province also called Macedonia.
"They will support whatever is acceptable to Greece, but Greece has a consulate in Macedonia," Ms. Acevska said. "Why can't we have one here?"
 
A Thaw in Relations
 Still, she is heartened by the thaw in relations between her office and the United States Government.
"For the first time people began to hear what we've been saying," she said. But even when she couldn't get her calls to the State Department returned, Ms. Acevska said, the State Department would call from time to time to chastise her because Macedonia exported more finished woolen goods than the United States wanted, or to complain some Macedonians weren't honoring the sanctions against Serbia.
"The U.S. doesn't recognize us, the economy is deteriorating, nobody is helping and I'm getting a lecture," she said. "But I am diplomatic. I say, 'The official policy is that we are complying, but it would help if Macedonia was recognized as a sovereign country and compensated for its hardship from the sanctions.' "
The 36-year-old Ms. Acevska, who grew up in Mansfield, Ohio, said she had no idea she was descending into a diplomatic twilight zone when she left her job as a partner in Gulf Enterprises, an international trade and development company here, to become Macedonia's representative in January 1992. Ms. Acevska said she receives $2,500 a month in expenses from the Goverment in Skopje and lives on savings from her previous job.
"Financially, I went from the top to the bottom," said Ms. Acevska, whose designer suits, jewelry, and Jaguar XJS raise eyebrows when she pleads Macedonia's case.
"When people see me in the car, the clothes that I wear, I have to explain that this is from my past life," she said. "This is not a reflection of the way things are. Macedonia is only paying expenses. This is a labor of love. I still have relatives over there. I want to make a contribution. I'm in a position to do that."
 
Passports and Debt Problems
 Ms. Acevska, who is registered as a lobbyist for Macedonia with the United States Department of Justice, juggles a myriad of diplomatic housekeeping tasks, from making arrangements to settle Macedonia's debt with the International Monetary Fund to trying to help Macedonians who want to visit Macedonia but whose Yugoslav passports have expired.
"I am the ambassador, the cleaning lady, everything," she said. Since Ms. Acevska is an American, she could not be the Ambassador, when one is appointed, unless she gave up her United States citizenship, something she has not considered to date.
All kinds of economic and cultural relations ensue from normal diplomatic recognition by the United States. Macedonia is one of a number of countries and organizations that lead lives on a sliding scale of recognized non-recognition.
The United States also may recognize a country but not have formal relations with it, each country doing business with the other through an interest section in a third nation's embassy in each country. For example, the United States operates an interest section in the Swiss Embassy in Havana; Cuba operates out of the Swiss Embassy in Washington.
Beyond that, said Joseph C. Snyder, a spokesman for the State Department, "There are a lot of ad hoc arrangements."
Ms. Acevska does not like to think of herself or the country she is representing as an ad hoc relationship.
"You don't commit American lives to places you consider ad hoc," she said.
