HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Applying a Discount To Good Earnings News

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
THANK heaven for rising earnings.
Still recovering from the mid-April meltdown in stock prices, investors breathed that collective sigh of relief last week. As a flood of quarterly earnings reports poured from American corporations -- most of them showing enviable growth -- the major indexes bounced back. The Nasdaq rose 9.7 percent for the week, while the Dow Jones industrials jumped 5.2 percent. 
 Strong earnings from bellwethers like Chase Manhattan, Texas Instruments, Citigroup and America Online were much-needed comfort for investors reassessing their appetite for the newly apparent risks in stocks.
With many equity strategists reiterating their belief that the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 will earn 20 percent more this year, on average, than they did in 1999, investors regained some confidence that stocks would again produce the double-digit gains they have come to love.
While this seems an admirably sensible approach -- how quaint to base an investment decision on something real, like a stock's earnings! -- it may not produce the results that investors want. Market history teaches that when earnings growth is hottest, gains in stocks are disappointingly cool.
Statisticians at Ned Davis Research, an investment firm in Venice, Fla., have gone back to 1927, studying how stock prices have reacted to earnings increases and declines. Here are their findings:
During periods when earnings growth in the S.& P. 500 stocks exceeded 20 percent, as is expected this year, the index has historically gained an average of 1.2 percent. When earnings have risen 10 percent to 20 percent, the S.& P. has typically risen 6.2 percent.
The real gains for stocks come when corporate earnings growth is slow or nonexistent. The S.& P. 500 gained 9.7 percent, on average, during periods when earnings were rising or falling slightly -- gains or declines of less than 10 percent. And when S.& P. earnings were falling sharply -- 10 percent to 25 percent -- the index gained an astonishing 28.7 percent, on average.
"This generally just shows that from a long-term perspective, strong earnings growth in and of itself is not that bullish," said Tim Hayes, global equity strategist at Ned Davis Research. But that finding is less counterintuitive than it may seem. "The market tends to anticipate, to discount earnings growth well in advance of it happening," Mr. Hayes said. "So by the time you get the peak earnings growth, the market tends to have discounted it."
This anticipatory characteristic of the market means that stocks turn in their best performances when earnings are disappointing. Only in hindsight does it become clear that stock prices moved higher because investors had perceived that earnings were bottoming out and about to turn up.
Not that earnings growth is bad for stocks, of course. It's simply that big jumps in profits cannot be expected to support stock prices that have already been levitating for some time.
"What really drives stocks is what people are expecting," Mr. Hayes said. "If expectations are really high, you're setting yourself up for disappointment."
And what does that mean for stocks? In the current market, where many of the biggest and most popular stocks are still priced for perfection, it just may be that perfection is not enough.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BROOKYLN UP CLOSE;
Residents Seek a Tighter Cap On Towers in Their Midst

BYLINE: By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
Dismayed over two towering buildings currently rising in Brooklyn Heights, community groups packed Borough Hall on Monday to demand that the city impose stricter limits in its proposed rezoning of downtown Brooklyn.
In a proposal presented by the Department of City Planning to Borough President Howard Golden, the city would create a Special Downtown Brooklyn District, a 90-block area bounded by Tillary, Clinton and Court Streets and Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. 
 Comparing downtown Brooklyn to high-density areas like Midtown and Lower Manhattan, Regina Myer, director of the City Planning Department's Brooklyn office, said the area needed "more flexible regulations to allow for more flexible commercial growth" to become a thriving hub.
The plan is part of a citywide proposal to adjust zoning rules that date back to 1961. The new rules would prevent isolated towers from rising in low-slung neighborhoods and would require new buildings to be situated closer to the street.
In downtown Brooklyn, buildings in commercial areas could be no higher than 495 feet, and they would have to be lower in residential areas. Until now there have been no absolute height limits in the area.
Community representatives at the hearing said they supported caps on height, but most argued that the proposed limits did not go far enough. They cited two buildings under construction -- a 330-foot residential tower on Montague Street and a 210-foot multiplex on Court Street -- as the type they hoped to prevent.
Ms. Myer said that under the proposed regulations those buildings would not have been approved. She added that even in the 495-foot area most developers would not be able to build up to that limit because of square-foot limitations.
But some people said they feared developers would not hold back.
"We feel that the 495-foot limitation is not so much a limitation as an invitation," said Kenneth Diamondstone, treasurer of the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation.
The borough president is to make his recommendation next month, after which the commission would hold a final hearing on the proposal.

That Groan You Hear Is From the Power Grid

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: VALLEY FORGE, Pa.

 BODY:
THE power for every street light, every water pump, every computer, every television set, every television studio -- in short, everything that hums or glows with electricity for more than 23 million customers between Staten Island, Ashtabula, Ohio, and the northern tip of Virginia, lay before Joan Clark.
In front of her desk at the power control center here, Ms. Clark, a system operator, surveyed a 20-foot-high wall map of all the region's power plants, lines and substations. computer screens displayed data on transmission, her responsibility on this shift. 
 In the heat and humidity of last summer, the lights went out in parts of New York City, New Jersey, Chicago and the south-central states when peak demand for power overwhelmed the system. Federal officials and industry experts say it will probably happen again this year. But Ms. Clark and her colleagues at the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, the largest control center on the continent, try not to let the threat weigh on their minds.
"I see it as a giant video game," said Ms. Clark, an 11-year veteran. She has various tools to fight off attackers, she said, but "you only have this one guy, and if the one guy dies, you're done. The lights go out."
Ms. Clark's "one guy" is in trouble. The strong American economy demands ever more power, and the restructuring and partial deregulation of the power industry mean that ever more of that power is traded and transmitted between widely separated producers and users. The strains on the grid are growing rapidly, and the power system's reserve ratio -- the excess of generating capacity over peak demand -- has narrowed in some areas to an uncomfortably tight 5 percent or less.
But the restructuring has also created big disincentives for anyone in the industry to invest in the grid, build new lines or even pay for research on how to transmit power more efficiently.
Because of these strains, the nation's power supply is becoming less stable and reliable, even as reliability becomes more important. Thirty years ago, when the lights flickered for a moment, hardly anyone noticed. Today, that flicker can crash the computers upon which the country depends for most everything from control of complex manufacturing processes to the downloading of middle-school homework. And no immediate solution is apparent.
Tomorrow, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is scheduled to begin a nationwide series of conferences on power reliability with meetings in Hartford and Newark. "While the demand for electricity is soaring, the reliability of our electric grid is, at times, faltering," he said in a statement.
JUST how much work the grid does is hard to quantify. Total consumption and production (always equal) can be measured, but not how many megawatt-hours moved how many miles.
But there are indirect ways to gauge the strains. One is how many times utilities invoke an emergency procedure called transmission line relief, or T.L.R., which freezes new transactions between power generators and customers for a while when the grid cannot handle any more volume. In a study last December, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission counted 400 such freezes in the first 10 months of 1999; in all of 1998 there were only 300.
That is a sign that the grid is often unable to support the main goal of deregulation: to allow independent generators to compete in an open marketplace. If the grid cannot handle a shipment from the cheapest available generator, users must buy from a more expensive source, while cheaper generating capacity lies idle.
Part of the problem, experts say, is that in most of the country, transmission-line owners charge flat fees regardless of distance or demand. So they have no means short of a T.L.R. freeze to ease the load when the system is straining. Almost alone among the consortiums that operate regions of the grid, Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland uses a sliding fee scale for some transmission, allocating scarce capacity to those willing to pay most, and seldom resorts to a freeze.
Even if variable pricing were the norm everywhere, transmission remains regulated, and the earnings of the line owners -- typically utilities -- are capped at a set percentage of revenue. Variable pricing cannot add to their profits, and they have little incentive to invest in more capacity.
And it shows. The construction pace for new transmission lines fell by more than half from the late 1980's to the early 1990's, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility trade group; experts say it has slowed further since.
"There's a market solution to the T.L.R. problem," said Philip R. Sharp, who spent 14 years as the chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power before joining the Harvard faculty in 1995. But the market is doing nothing to solve transmission capacity shortages, he said: "That is the one people have to put their attention to."
The strains can also produce incredible spikes in the wholesale price of electricity -- from the normal $20 to $30 for a megawatt-hour up into the thousands. The spikes would not happen if every area of the country had enough power plants, or if the grid could always move power to where it was needed. Experts say they could also be prevented if there was a system to reward more customers for reducing power use when demand was unusually high, the way airlines compensate people who volunteer to be bumped from an overbooked flight.
The other two legs of the three-legged stool of electricity -- generation and distribution -- are faring much better. Entrepreneurs are building conventional power plants while scientists make steady advances on alternatives like windmills, fuel cells and solar arrays. Distribution networks, which deliver power locally from substations to customers, are using new technology to spot developing problems and to introduce peak and off-peak billing.
Between the two is the transmission grid -- once securely part of an integrated industry, now looking increasingly neglected.
In states where electric power has been deregulated -- 24 so far, plus the District of Columbia -- most utilities were told to choose between being generators or transmitters and distributors. Separating the two has left the grid's needs in limbo.
"When it was vertically integrated, it was much easier for policy makers to see need," said Charles D. Gray, the executive director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissions, whose members are state regulators. Formerly, a utility went before regulators with a power plant here, customers there and a clear case for a line in between, he said. Now the utility would be asking to build lines to carry someone else's power to someone else's customers, diffusing responsibility and reducing the impetus for the project.
James J. Hoecker, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said some utilities were not eager to add transmission capacity that would only let new competitors bring power into their old monopoly territory. The system will not work well, he said, until specialist transmission companies emerge, drawn by better incentives. "There's a need to make this an attractive enterprise," he said.
Another complication is the nature of the grid -- more like a network of canals than of roads. Power does not follow a preset route; it flows along whatever path offers the least resistance. Even before deregulation, utilities complained of having to handle power wandering through from one far-off region to another. But new technology that could ease this problem is languishing in labs.
LITTLE of this was of immediate concern to Ms. Clark, whose Friday afternoon was going pretty well. Demand was running at about 29,000 megawatts, far below last summer's peak of 52,200.
But her boss, Phillip G. Harris, president and chief executive of the consortium, sees long-term structural problems in the industry that promise difficult days ahead. He and others believe that companies that want to make money in unregulated areas will look to build power plants where demand is high. But little of that vigor will spill over into the boring transmission sector.
"In a regulated business," Mr. Harris said, "the way you improve the bottom line is to decrease costs" -- hardly a recipe for increased investment. And in any case, transmission is a sideline for the companies that provide it. "It's typically less than 10 percent of their assets," he said. "It's not going to get most of the executive-level attention."

ACity With Few Pillars Looks to Its Bricks

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
ROBERT MAGUIRE gazes out from the 45th floor of his downtown building at a corporate center that is no more.
Mr. Maguire's development company, Maguire Partners, owns more prime real estate in downtown Los Angeles and other parts of the region than almost any other private landlord. And he has watched as one major corporation after another -- including flagship tenants for his properties -- has been acquired or moved its headquarters out of town. 
 The latest high-profile loss is the Times Mirror Corporation, publisher of The Los Angeles Times. When, after more than a century of control by the powerful Chandler family, the company is acquired by the Tribune Company of Chicago, it will join a list of former linchpins like the Security Pacific and First Interstate banks, Great Western Financial, Atlantic-Richfield, Lockheed and Carter Hawley Hale, the retail chain.
"I think all the big companies here have taken a pill that makes them go away," said Mr. Maguire, who is 65. "The city can survive without them, but not as it was."
Like other entrepreneurs in Los Angeles, though, Mr. Maguire is less interested in talking about the past than about the great opportunities he sees in the region's sprawling, now largely pillarless economy. After a sharp drop-off in the early 1990's, Los Angeles has rebounded smartly: unemployment has fallen by nearly half, to 5.5 percent, thanks to growth in technology, media, trade and even industrial companies.
This revived economy barely resembles the big-company city of 20 or 30 years ago, which was built around titanic military contractors, movie studios and land development interests that arose after World War II to create one of the world's largest urban agglomerations.
Among the nation's biggest cities, Los Angeles has one of the highest percentages of private sector employment in companies with fewer than 100 workers, according to Cognetics, a research firm. The city is now home to fewer Fortune 500 companies than San Francisco, never mind New York or Chicago.
"Los Angeles has become an anomaly," said Lloyd Greif, a native Angeleno whose specialty investment bank, Greif & Company, caters to smaller local companies. "It has always had an entrepreneurial undercurrent to it, a Wild West kind of atmosphere."
ONE sign of the new grass-roots vitality of the city: Although the giant commercial banks have been leaving, venture capital has been pouring in. Southern California now attracts more new venture capital investment than any region of the country except the Boston area and Silicon Valley.
With aerospace still in decline, software and information industry employment has surged, particularly in a plethora of smaller e-commerce and digital entertainment companies in Los Angeles County.
Many of the city's other industries are also increasingly characterized not by a few large companies, but by sprawling networks of smaller ones. Such companies account for most employment in the city's apparel industry, now the nation's largest, and its resurgent furniture industry.
The decentralized pattern parallels geographical and ethnic changes in the city's business structure. Once a prospective "capital of the Pacific Rim" that aspired to rival Manhattan, downtown Los Angeles no longer has even the thinnest of claims to being the business center of its own region. The Westside district has eclipsed it, not only in total office space but also in rental and occupancy rates.
Even the San Fernando Valley, partly inside and partly outside the city limits, has a stronger claim to primacy than downtown: it is home to three Fortune 500 companies, including Walt Disney, now arguably the region's most important company. According to a recent survey by Manpower, the staffing agency, companies in the valley expect to add workers this year at twice the rate of their center-city counterparts.
For decades, the business leadership in the central business district was almost entirely white and largely from the Midwest. Today, the city's emerging leaders are mainly immigrants -- mostly from Asia, the Middle East and Latin America -- who dominate the apparel business and play important roles in international trade and entertainment.
Los Angeles immigrants are almost twice as likely to start their own businesses as their counterparts in New York, Chicago and similar large cities, according to a recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington.
EVEN the technology sector is coming to be dominated by immigrants. Rohit Shukla, the Bombay-born president of the Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, estimates that as many as half of the region's high-technology companies are now run by immigrants, particularly in heavily Asian areas like the San Gabriel Valley.
Mr. Shukla believes that on balance, the city is better off without mandarins like the Chandlers, who for decades shaped the city, its politics and cultural life. "The Chandlers were dissociated from reality for a long time," Mr. Shukla said. "They didn't notice that in the 1990's a whole new bunch of people had come to replace them, people with little baggage of the past who have been reviving our economy."
But others see a downside in the evaporation of the old-school business establishment. Steven Koltai, president of Event.411, an Internet company in Marina del Rey with 100 employees, points to dwindling corporate support for the arts and charities, which must increasingly depend on the whims of the region's large supply of wealthy individuals from Hollywood or other industries.
"The lack of large institutions like banks makes it hard to develop a center of gravity for the city," said Mr. Koltai, who was an executive vice president at Warner Brothers before starting Event.411 in 1996.
But he said the relative absence of an entrenched elite, and the wide dispersal of potential business locations, allowed smaller companies to grow unfettered by hierarchies or overcrowding.
"There is clearly a lack of central control and authority here," he said. "But the freewheeling, open kind of 'let's go for it' spirit remains this city's major advantage."

Fighting for Jobs on Their Own Turf

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
SHAMSUDDIN RIZA knows a thing or two about gut rehab, the term used to describe tearing apart a structure from the inside and renovating it. Mr. Riza, the owner of a small family contracting firm in Harlem, oversees a crew of workers who labor in the hollow shells of brownstones on West 133th and 134th Streets. He has also seen his neighborhood undergo a kind of gut rehab of its own.
Harlem has become a place of operatic jack hammers, of deep pits of shuffled earth, of brownstones embraced by orthodontic scaffolds, of yellow hard hats. The economic renewal means one thing: construction. 
 Lots of it. But neighborhood contractors like Mr. Riza say they have been excluded from Harlem's boom.
Mr. Riza founded his contracting firm in 1976, closed it for a while, then reopened in 1997 as KJS Construction. Although he subcontracts for a few private companies and occasionally for the city's department of Housing Preservation and Development, he said opportunities for small minority firms are limited.
About $900 million will be invested in residential and economic development projects in Harlem in the next five years by federal, state and local governments, development corporations, banks, housing organizations, entrepreneurs and private investors. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development is contributing $343 million to building and restoring homes in Harlem.
All that money, boosters say, will do a lot to improve Harlem economically. But as the polish is placed on cherrywood banisters, and as new mirrored shopping centers on 125th Street reflect a changing mix of consumers, who benefits?
"It's abundantly clear to me that local contractors, subcontractors and vendors are almost totally shut out of the construction work and the related trades work in the Harlem community," said Lloyd A. Williams, president and chief executive of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. "I would be very surprised if over 20 percent, and that's very generous, of the construction work that is being done in Harlem, whether it is rehabilitation or new construction, is being done with local contractors or minority contractors."
Before any project can move ahead in the city, the developer must present a proposal to the neighborhood's community board. In most cases, Mr. Williams said, developers promise to hire locally. But because proposals are not binding, few honor those commitments, said Stanley Gleaton, chairman of Community Board 10 in Harlem. "Local hiring, it's a joke," he said.
Asked about policies in this area, Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, cited several programs intended to expand neighborhood participation in home-building projects. The mayor's office declined to comment on involvement in other types of development in Harlem.
Community boards can monitor hiring, but they have little influence on the awarding of contracts. Mr. Gleaton said his board had brought this issue to the attention of the city, the Council and private investors. There is agreement that hiring within the neighborhood is a good idea, but no one monitors hiring to ensure that it happens.
Of the few Harlem residents who have gotten construction jobs, most are only employed daily, and do not have benefits or job security, Mr. Gleaton said.
Labor unions have stepped up efforts to organize those workers. The Mason Tenders' District Council of Greater New York and Long Island, which represents laborers, and the New York City District Council of Carpenters are active.
Byron Schuler, an organizer with the carpenters' union, said that while 85 percent of the workers on nonresidential projects in Harlem are unionized, only 30 percent of the workers on residential projects belong to a union. Union carpenters earn about $30 an hour, plus benefits, he pointed out, but day laborers make as little as $30 a day.
Mr. Schuler spends his days at construction sites around the city urging workers to join his union and encouraging contractors to take part in a minority apprenticeship program offered by the union. He said the union is also lowering certain initiation fees and making its eligibility requirements more flexible to allow firms with as few as one or two employees, to join the union.
Contractors like Mr. Riza are wary of such overtures on the part of unions.
"The only reason they're here at all is because there's gold in these hills," he said. "But when they come to Harlem, they squeeze the little guy out."
"I'm pro-union to a certain extent," said Mr. Riza, who spent 15 years as an organizer and shop steward for two unions. "But I'm more pro-equality, and there was a time when blacks and Latinos and women had to go to war to get any work from the union."
There is, however, considerable support for unionizing Harlem's construction workers.
Judy A. Riley, a program coordinator for Consortium for Central Harlem Development, a nonprofit group that provides technical advice to some 30 small minority contracting firms in the neighborhood, said many such companies would like to see their employees unionize because union membership brings eligibility for larger construction contracts.
And Councilman Bill Perkins sees unionization as helping many Harlem construction workers who now accept day labor because they cannot get permanent jobs. Still, he is not overly optimistic.
"When you walk through Harlem these days, you see all these ribbon cuttings," said Mr. Perkins. "You see the developer, you see the governor, you see the contractor, you see the politicians, but you don't see the worker. The guy from the neighborhood with the construction hat should be holding the scissors, and the other guys holding his hand. But not only is he not holding the scissors, he's not in the picture at all."

A Country Making History Is Too Busy to Read It

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT the top of Iran's list of historical grievances against the United States is the coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 to oust Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstate Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi.
During the revolution in 1979 and the seizure of the American Embassy that soon followed, militant Iranians often cited the coup as proof of the United States' evil designs in Iran. Over the years, the coup has fueled a conspiracy-theory view, widely held among ordinary Iranians, that external powers, particularly the United States, are behind every misfortune to befall Iran. 
 So one might have expected that the surfacing of a secret official C.I.A. report that lays out the American plot in all its detail would have been the talk of Iranian political and journalistic circles last week.
Not so.
This is not a moment for historical reflection in Iran. Iranians are too busy fighting a brutal, open-ended political war in real time to worry much about a short, if equally brutal, war 47 years ago.
Today's war is waged on several fronts -- the courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the bazaar, the streets. And last week the fighting was particularly intense, having heated up after reformist candidates swept to victory in the first round of Parliamentary elections in February. The stakes are high -- the nature of the Islamic Republic itself -- and the outcome is uncertain.
The story mesmerizing the Iranian media last week was not out of Washington but out of Berlin; its subject was the disruption by opponents of the Islamic Republic of a conference there on Iranian politics. The protesters heckled the speakers, all of them reformers. One woman protested with a hip-rotating dance. Another stripped to her bra and panties.
The speakers expressed embarrassment and disgust. But the protest was videotaped and much of the footage was aired on Iran's state-controlled television, in an effort to discredit the reform movement.
By the end of the week, 140 members of the outgoing Parliament had signed a letter to the nation's leading conservative cleric, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, branding the conference participants "traitors" and calling on the judiciary (which Ayatollah Khamenei controls as Iran's Supreme Leader) to punish them. Ayatollah Abolghasem Khazali, who is never unrestrained in his language, said the participants deserved to die. "They insult Islamic sanctities," he was quoted in the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz as saying. "They attend a conference to say nonsense. Kill them wherever you find them. This is God's unchangeable position."
The Berlin incident was not the only example of a political bloodletting since the parliamentary elections. Recently the Expediency Council, an oversight body headed by former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, ruled that the new Parliament will have no authority to investigate any institutions controlled by Ayatollah Khamenei. That would deprive Parliament of the power to look into abuses in the judiciary, radio and television, the intelligence and security apparatus and the giant state-supported foundations that control huge swaths of the economy.
Nine days ago, Ayatollah Khamenei delivered an extraordinary sermon in which he acknowledged a need for reform in all of Iran's major institutions. But he also denounced the promotion of "U.S.-style reform" as inauthentic and un-Islamic, further emboldening conservatives who often act in his name. The Merchants' Association of the Tehran bazaar, for example, called for the bazaar to close last Thursday as a show of support. But Thursday is the best shopping day of the week. In bold defiance -- and a sign of how fluid and unpredictable politics have become in Iran -- merchants opened their doors anyway.
There is even talk of a coup, but it has nothing to do with 1953. Last Sunday, the Revolutionary Guards issued an official threat against the reformists. "If necessary, our enemies, be they small or large, will feel the reverberating impact of the hammer of the Islamic revolution on their skulls," the communique said.
WHILE all this has been going on, a council responsible for vetting candidates and overseeing elections has invalidated the first-round election victories of a number of reformist candidates and a run-off election has been postponed.
To silence an increasingly emboldened press, the outgoing conservative Parliament also passed a law last week that severely restricts the activities of the press. And a high-profile, high-stakes trial of 13 Jews and several Muslims on charges of spying for Israel remains in the background, having been put off until next month.
Still, the remarkable thing about this moment is that all of this evidence of a conservative backlash has failed to quiet the reformists. One pro-reform group, the Islamic Revolution Mujaheddini Organization, responded to the Revolutionary Guards communique by calling its goal "a childish dream." In a letter released to the newspapers, the group said that "The power mafia is seeking to justify an anti-reform coup with the goal of imposing dictatorship under the cover of religion."
Criticism is even coming from the far provinces. After the state-run television announced the invalidation of the election of the candidate from the town of Oshnaviyeh in West Azerbaijan province, the local governor, Ali Mostafavi, called the move unjust and unbelievable.
There is a lesson for the United States in all this. American policy makers have clearly been hoping for months now that modest concessions to Iran, like a lightening of sanctions, may encourage a dialogue -- and that a change in the American attitude toward Iran's history can only help. Last month, when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced the easing of sanctions on non-oil exports from Iran, she called the "democratic winds" in Iran "so refreshing" and acknowledged American errors in past dealings with Iran, including the C.I.A.-led coup in 1953.
BUT she is still waiting for the Iranians to respond to that speech with concrete gestures. The problem is that the political winds now blowing in Iran are more like a hurricane. And until they subside, there is little chance of meaningful movement toward the United States.
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will arrive in New York for United Nations-related business this week, but he has been turning down invitations to speak. In such a wild and uncertain atmosphere, what could he possibly say?

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH BROOKLYN;
Is There A Fairway In Red Hook's Future?

BYLINE: By MONICA DRAKE 

 BODY:
Fairway may open a new supermarket in a city-owned warehouse on the Red Hook waterfront, a move that could jump-start nascent development efforts in the neighborhood.
The store is negotiating with Gregory O'Connell, a Brooklyn developer, to add a third Fairway to the food-store chain, which has popular outposts on the Upper West Side and in Harlem. 
 The owners and developer declined to give specifics, saying discussions were under way. But Harvey Schultz, a consultant who has been working with Mr. O'Connell on the project, said the plan would include a Fairway on the lower floor of the 230,000-square-foot warehouse, which is on Van Brunt near Beard Street. Other tenants would occupy the upper stories.
The store, which would be the second supermarket in Red Hook -- there are also 10 grocery stores -- could provide up to 400 jobs, according to the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation.
To some residents, adding a Fairway would be an optimal use of the site, which offers spectacular views. The proposal is part of a decadelong redevelopment effort by Mr. O'Connell, who owns a large chunk of waterfront and is managing the warehouse for the city.
"Residents have noted a significant lack of services and goods in the community," said Craig Hammerman, district manager of Community Board 6, which includes Red Hook. "We would welcome healthy competition for food at discount prices."
Mr. Hammerman added that a Fairway, which would be less than a mile from the Red Hook Houses, a public development, would create needed jobs.
He acknowledged there would be increased traffic, but, he added, "as long as there is a benefit, more people are inclined to see a positive trade-off."
Others, like City Councilman Angel Rodriguez, whose district includes Red Hook, see the prospect of a big-box store on the waterfront as a waste of prime land.
He said he would oppose the plan if it went before the Council. "I don't think you take that property and view and put a supermarket there," he said.
Another foe is John McGettrick, a leader of the Red Hook Civic Association. "We support jobs that contribute to economic development," he said, but not ones that "allow us to become a drive-by community." MONICA DRAKE

HEADLINE: The Maniac Markets;
The Making Of a Market Bubble

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON and SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
AH, to pen the first draft of history.
"IVillage Becomes a Metropolis on First Trading Day," roared a headline in The Los Angeles Times on March 20, 1999, describing the tripling in the stock price of iVillage, the online community for women. When Miningco.com went public a few days later, The Wall Street Journal called that Web forum "the latest Internet stock to strike gold." And a few days after that, Priceline.com ended its first trading session at four times its offering price, prompting USA Today to call it "a hot ticket." 
 Awful puns aside, those were heady days. The seven Internet companies that sold shares that month were in the vanguard of the legions that made their debuts in 1999 before a public hungry for nothing but Net. Stock prices exploded out of the gate. Entrepreneurs became billionaires overnight. And in the months that followed, investors only clamored for more as the hysteria for anything dot-com reached fever pitch, helping push the Nasdaq market index to its all-time high on March 10, 2000.
Now for the rewrite.
The Nasdaq market's recent rout, even with last week's rebound, helped bring the highfliers back to earth. Four of the seven companies that went public in March 1999 now are trading below their offering prices: Manhattan-based iVillage, down 49 percent; OneMain.com, a collection of Internet service providers, down 72 percent; Autobytel.com, which refers car buyers to dealerships over the Internet, down 74 percent; and Ziff-Davis-ZDNet, which operates technology Web sites, down 34 percent.
The remaining three -- About.com (the Web portal that began life as Miningco.com), Priceline.com and Multex.com, which distributes financial information -- are trading at least 60 percent off their record highs. (Priceline.com has performed most admirably, up 324 percent from its offering price.)
Market pundits say Internet stocks were due for a correction. Anyone who read a prospectus knew that the dizzying sums that investors were paying for unseasoned companies defied their fundamental worth. The breezy days of last spring were bound, logic said, to turn unwelcoming and cold.
But how was it that the investing world suspended disbelief in the first place, letting the most irrationally exuberant investors assign values to these companies?
Put simply, it was in the interest of everyone involved to take advantage of a frenzied market that, in more measured times, would have seemed absurd. Entrepreneurs rushed to get money -- and lots of it. Venture capitalists were eager to cash out. Investment banks were happy to oblige. And, of course, rapacious investors -- big institutions and the man and woman on the street -- clamored for their shares of the new economy.
It is too soon to close the book on the Class of March 1999; the Internet story is far from over. No expert worth the title can predict the permanence of the damage caused by the market's recent shakeout. And investors are only beginning to decide which companies they think have the most promising future.
Even so, these companies are a microcosm for an Internet marketplace where the fortunes of companies have been made -- and lost -- virtually overnight. And their experiences shed light on the roles that financiers, entrepreneurs and investors played in inflating the Internet bubble until it almost burst.
"Try to think about it as Charles Darwin meeting Adam Smith," said Gary Rieschel, a partner at Softbank Technology Partners in Mountain View, Calif. As in nature, he explained, "the checks and balances have to get out of whack for them to get back in order."
 
The Natural Order of Things
Steve Smith, a founder of OneMain.com, knows about the natural order firsthand. His company, an Internet service provider (like America Online), went public on March 25, 1999.
Even then, Mr. Smith recalled, he was worried that the offering price for his company -- $22 a share -- was too high, even though bankers had discounted the value of his subscriber base to the clientele of more established peers.
But who was he to bicker over his good fortune? "I wasn't going to argue with the market at that time," he said.
This, after all, was a market that had just bid up iVillage -- a company that had struggled for several years to go public -- from an offering price of $24 to a first-day close of $80.13. And those numbers did not fully express the demand for dot-com shares; iVillage's investment bankers at Goldman Sachs had originally planned to price the stock at $12 to $14.
So iVillage became the standard against which other companies measured first-day success. Watching the excitement about iVillage mount, executives at Miningco.com decided to put off their public offering so its shares, too, could command more than the $12 to $14 a share that executives first expected, recalled Dan Veru, an early investor in the company. It was a smart move; bankers at Bear, Stearns priced Miningco.com at $25 a share.
How could a rational market push the share prices of these nascent companies to such heights? As he conducted the road show for OneMain.com, pitching the business to professional money managers, Mr. Smith recalled, he was surprised that they did not ask many in-depth financial questions. Of his 72 one-on-one meetings with institutional investors, he said, few lasted more than 20 minutes.
"I found people were only interested in the story," he said. "They hadn't read anything at all."
Mr. Smith's stock hit a high of $39.5625 the day it began trading, an 80 percent increase over the offering price. Colleagues at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, where he had been a banker for nine years, swooned.
Soon, though, the stock price of OneMain.com began to slide -- by June, the shares were trading in the mid-teens -- despite Mr. Smith's contention that he was delivering on everything he had promised investors, including his subscriber projections. He said, however, that bankers at what is now Deutsche Bank Alex Brown had failed to deliver on two of their promises: The analyst he had expected to cover his company left the bank, Mr. Smith said, and its sales and trading desk did not support a higher price. And that, he added bitterly, was despite OneMain.com's having paid fees of more than $7 million. Deutsche Bank Alex Brown declined to comment.
And so Mr. Smith, a 40-year-old Californian, found himself across the table from investors for 40 days last year, struggling to pump up his stock price. He was briefly successful -- OneMain.com hit $33.125 last July, during a two-week road trip that took him from San Diego to Boston. But the shares have since drifted downward, falling 87 percent since their peak to close at $6.25 on Thursday, even though he said the company has met the earnings and revenue targets it set for itself.
For Mr. Smith, who owns 8 percent of the company, that decline has erased tens of millions of dollars in his net worth.
Other executives in the March '99 class said that at least some investors inquired deeply into their companies and business models. But the executives agreed that most professional money managers had ignored fundamentals and just bet on stocks that seemed to have momentum.
"There is a herd mentality around Internet stocks," said Daniel L. Rosensweig, chief executive of ZDNet.
Even those who professed to be long-term fundamental investors turned out to be short-term traders, he said. "You go on the road show, and all these people say they will hold forever. Then you get the first list of shareholders and find out they flipped the stock right away. The best you can hope for is that they will buy your stock back on the dip."
Yet once a stock falls out of favor, even good news will not necessarily restore its luster. A month ago, iVillage announced a $200 million venture with Unilever, the consumer products giant. And while financial analysts lauded the news, investors ignored it.
"I announce highly strategic deals, and there is no movement in the stock," said Candice Carpenter, the company's chief executive. "Poor Pavlov's dog is confused. It doesn't know what to do."
 
Risky Business
Like most of her peers, Ms. Carpenter attributes her company's stock performance to an investing environment that now favors the business-to-business Internet sector and companies promising a quicker path to quarterly profits.
In an earlier era, that would have sounded like an odd complaint; companies generally did not even go public until they stood a good chance of delivering profits. So if the market is again demanding earnings, it is only reverting to form.
But when iVillage and the others had their coming-out parties, Ms. Carpenter rightly notes, Internet companies and their bankers certainly made no secret of the hurdles that stood between them and earnings. Specifically, she said investors in iVillage were told that it could take the company 7 to 10 years to become profitable.
In fact, some companies devoted 20 pages or more of their prospectuses to such warnings. So much so, some analysts suggest, the cautions had little meaning.
"The risk factors have become so common they are almost irrelevant," said Scott Siprelle, a cofounder of Midtown Research Group, a Manhattan investment boutique.
Because Internet companies were so young, he said, investment banks relaxed their insistence on a management team that had long worked together and on years of profitability before taking a company public.
"A good investment bank has to constantly balance the franchise versus the revenue," Mr. Siprelle said. "But the opportunity has been so large it has been hard to be disciplined."
Since Jan. 1, 1998, investment banks have earned an estimated $2.18 billion in underwriting fees for taking Internet companies public, according to Commscan, a research company based in Manhattan.
One of the most prosperous investment banks in the technology world is Goldman, Sachs; since 1995, it has helped take 54 Internet companies public. If Brad Koenig, Goldman's co-head of technology investment banking, sounded frayed last week, it was because the criticism leveled at bankers for stocks trading below their offering prices was wearing a little thin.
"First of all, you have to remember that investment banks and underwriters were getting criticism for underpricing I.P.O.'s not too long ago," Mr. Koenig said. He is right: banks took a drubbing all last year for pricing offerings too low, supposedly to make the stock price soar in first-day trading.
Now, with e-commerce stocks suffering, Mr. Koenig suggests that it is unfair to blame the same bankers for having set offering prices too high.
"It's not like you wake up one morning and price the I.P.O.," he said. He explained that pricing was a three- to four-month process of comparing companies against their peers. Considerable time is spent examining fundamentals.
And even established companies, like Yahoo, traded lower than their offering prices in the early days. Besides, it isn't as though bankers don't exercise discretion: Goldman is one of the most selective, he said, and turns away 15 companies for every one it takes public.
"I don't think we should be held accountable or responsible if a sector falls out of favor," Mr. Koenig said.
In a momentum-driven environment, though, financiers certainly play their part in the making of fads.
When Isaak Karaev and James Tousignant founded Multex Systems seven years ago, they wanted to help brokerage firms send electronic research to institutional clients.
"Then the Internet happened," said Mr. Karaev, the company's chief executive. "And all our investors said, 'This is an Internet play.' We took the opportunity to change ourselves."
Multex created a Web site that lets individuals read Wall Street research for a fee. But the venture capitalists were not satisfied. "The consumer was the big play, so everyone wanted us to jettison everything else and give it all away free," Mr. Karaev recalled. The founders agreed to change the company's name to Multex.com, but insisted on keeping the institutional investor service, which accounted for two-thirds of revenue.
Their venture backers should be grateful they did; now, business-to-business Internet companies are hot, while those catering to consumers are not. These days, Mr. Karaev said, the company calls itself a "financial e-marketplace," to play to the latest frenzy.
"Our strategy hasn't changed," he said. "The challenge is which component to highlight."
Robert Greene, who invested in Multex at Chase Capital and is now a partner in Flatiron Partners, concedes that venture money has long followed trends. In 13 years as an investor, he said, "I spent all my time going from one hot area to the next."
Still, the Internet era has been a remarkable time. It used to be that a return of 300 percent was "an awesome home run." Now, with the public markets so accommodating, venture capitalists can make 1,000 percent to 2,000 percent on shares they hold for just two years.
And that means early investors are barely splattered when a bubble bursts. Chase Capital, for example, has paid an average of just over $3 a share for its 3 million Multex.com shares, he said -- putting it hardly in the same boat as investors who bought at $60 a share and saw the stock fall as low as $13.
"Even if these values fall to half of where they peaked, in the context of our industry, they are great returns," Mr. Greene said.
The recent decline, however, has sobered things up, he said. "Two months ago, you would look at a business plan and the investment banks would say, 'We can take that company public in four months for $500 million.' So you would say, 'Why not?' " Now, Mr. Greene said, "We don't say 'Why not?' We say 'Why?' "
 
Not to Mention Day Traders
If any one group played the most public role in fueling the Web frenzy, it was day traders and other online investors, many of them congregating in Internet chat rooms like Silicon Investor and Raging Bull. They could sometimes inflate and burst bubbles in a single day.
A little after midnight on March 26, 1999, someone posted a message on Silicon Investor wanting to know if Autobytel.com shares would begin trading later that day. They would -- offered at $23 a share -- and by noon, posters were speculating about how high the price would soar.
"All indications are it will open between 40 and 50," wrote "Scott H."
"They wouldn't start over lunch would they?" added "William Griffin."
"Looking 60-65 opening in next 10-20 mins," wrote "SteveG" at 12:50 p.m.
"WOW," Scott H. responded. "Steve, do you think it will take off after the open?"
In a word, yes. Autobytel.com opened at $52.75 a share, hit a high of $58 and then closed for the day at $40.25.
"nnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooo wwwwaaaaayyyyyyyyyy!! Close around 39-40!! OOUUCCHHH!!!!!!!!!!" wrote "Opey."
"Got to feel the pain for the buyers at $58," replied "Panita." "They will not sleep well tonight."
Since then, the stock has plummeted, closing Thursday at $6.03, down 90 percent from its high.
And in the chat rooms? "IS THIS ONE GOING ANYWHERE?" read one message posted last month.
Chief executives of the Class of March '99 say they find these investors to be distasteful. Ms. Carpenter said iVillage now has a corporate policy of not answering questions from day traders and people in chat rooms. Still, when shares in iVillage and About.com were enjoying positive momentum last fall, both companies rushed to raise more cash in secondary offerings.
Were they taking advantage of the moment? Ms. Carpenter said iVillage recognized that the business-to-consumer Internet story "was going out of favor."
"We always wanted to have cash on hand for a nice long time," she said -- enough cash, she hopes, to last through what may be a long summer of investor discontent.

Getting It Wrong in a Photo

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD with KARI HASKELL 

 BODY:
IT became the most remembered photograph of the fall of Saigon, capturing the last chaotic days of the Vietnam war, and most people believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the United States Embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption usually says.
But as with much about the Vietnam war, the caption is wrong. The building is an apartment complex. The people fleeing are Vietnamese. The last helicopter left about 12 hours later. 
 In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam war. Americans, whether conservative or liberal, often imposed their own ideas on that troubling war, and that seems to be what happened with the picture, said Hubert Van Es, a United Press International photographer who took it 25 years ago, on April 29, 1975, from the roof of a hotel half a mile away.
"I put the correct caption on it," said Mr. Van Es, who now lives in Hong Kong, "but people back in the United States just took it for granted that it must be the embassy, because that was where they believed the evacuation took place."
The picture was of an apartment building for the employees of the United States Agency for International Development, its top floor reserved for the Central Intelligence Agency's deputy chief of station. The address was 22 Gia Long Street, about a half mile from the embassy. I lived around the corner as one of the last two correspondents of The New York Times remaining in Vietnam and left later that afternoon.
In the last days, as the embassy hastily prepared for the last stage of evacuation, 22 Gia Long was chosen as one of about a dozen possible gathering places for Americans. The secret signal for the start of the evacuation was a radio broadcast saying the temperature in Saigon was "105 degrees and rising," followed by the first 30 seconds of "White Christmas."
The United States ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham A. Martin, had delayed the final evacuation in the vain hope that President Gerald Ford and Congress would rescue the collapsing South Vietnamese army. Mr. Martin assumed that the United States Air Force could use Ton Son Nhut air base to lift out the last few thousand Americans. But the rapidly advancing North Vietnamese Army wrecked that idea, shelling the base on the morning of April 29 and shooting down some South Vietnamese Air Force planes trying to take off, their wreckage littering the runway.
The C.I.A. station chief, Thomas Polgar, had a problem. The night before, he had telephoned a group of senior South Vietnamese politicians, generals and police officers who had helped the agency, telling them to gather at his house with their families for evacuation. Among them was Tran Van Don, deputy prime minister and defense minister, and a general who was chief of military communications intelligence. But by late morning, the area was no longer secure, recalled Mr. Polgar, who is now 78.
Then Mr. Polgar had an inspiration. The elevator shaft on the roof of the apartment building at 22 Gia Long Street might support a landing in an emergency.
Mr. Polgar brought in a C.I.A. employee, O. B. Harnage, to direct the Vietnamese officials and their families to Gia Long Street and have them flown out by Air America, an airline owned by the C.I.A. for its operations in Southeast Asia.
WHEN Mr. Harnage landed on the roof in a silver Huey helicopter, some people were panicking. Some junior officers and policemen had been allowed in on condition that they use their weapons to keep a crowd milling in the street outside from storming the building.
Stationing himself next to a ladder leading onto the roof, Mr. Harnage tried to help the Vietnamese families up. But the first man who appeared, Mr. Harnage recalled, was a Korean who was hysterical and Mr. Harnage punched him out of the way to maintain order. The Huey, the workhorse of the American effort in Vietnam, normally carried about eight passengers, but Mr. Harnage jammed in as many as 15 Vietnamese, and jumped on the helicopter's skid, standing in the open doorway as it flew to Tan Son Nhut on the edge of the city.
Mr. Harnage, who was later awarded a C.I.A. medal, made four or five of these flights to the air base, where larger Navy or Air Force helicopters ferried the families to ships waiting in the South China Sea. At a time when America abandoned many Vietnamese allies and South Vietnam's military and political leaders abandoned their own country, it was a heroic act.
But one mystery remains. Is it indeed Mr. Harnage in the photograph? He believes it is. The picture, which he saw a week later in a Manila newspaper, shows a man in a white shirt and dark pants, which Mr. Harnage was wearing that day. His wife also saw the photograph. "She said she recognized me from my backside," said Mr. Harnage, who is now 75. He recalled her saying she knew him "because I was always leaving" to go somewhere on another mission.
Others say they were the ones in the picture. Mr. Polgar said he's unsure who it is. "But if Harnage says he is the man in that picture, I'll take his word for it," he said.

HEADLINE: A Dot-Com That's, Like, Awesome

BYLINE: By GARY KRIST 

 BODY:
IN this time of dizzying volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, since its (imaginary) initial public offering in January.
PipeDream's stock zoomed from an initial price of $2 a share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder and chief executive, Ethan Proctor, the youngest dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off in technology stocks, however, PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4. To find out how the fledgling company was weathering the storm, we arranged to meet Mr. Proctor at the Silicon Valley Video Arcade in Mountain View, Calif., where the 17-year-old visionary was leading his senior managers in a team-building exercise involving the obliteration of slime creatures. 

 The New York Times: Mr. Procter, what has been your greatest challenge in starting this company?
 
Ethan Proctor: Homework.
 
The Times: Homework?
 
E.P.: Well, yeah. I've got this English teacher? And she's making us read Beowulf? It's sort of hard to develop international marketing strategies when you know you're getting quizzed on the genealogy of Hrothgar and Unferth right after lunch period.
 
The Times: So it's been a struggle?
 
E.P.: Absolutely. If it weren't for The Geekmeister here Chief Financial Officer Thomas Benson Jr. , we'd never have been able to get granular on our business plan in time for the I.P.O.
 
The Times: Mr. Benson, is it true that you and Mr. Proctor started PipeDream in the basement of your mother's ranch house in suburban San Jose?
 
Thomas Benson: Totally.
 
The Times: Where is corporate headquarters now?
 
T.B.: In the garage, behind the broken sofa-bed.
 
The Times: It must have been a thrill to engineer one of the most successful I.P.O.'s in Nasdaq history. How do you explain your company's initial success?
 
E.P.: Obviously the market understood that PipeDream's unique position -- straddling the B2B and e-commerce sectors -- would allow us to really pancake the value chain, injecting old economy revenue-growth models at new economy valuations. Plus, a lot of people seemed to like the name.
 
The Times: Nonetheless, PipeDream is an untested company run by young, inexperienced executives, without even the remotest expectation of a profit. What do you say to people who claim that prices of companies like PipeDream were ripe for a correction?
 
E.P.: All I can say is they sound like my mom vice president for commissary operations Helen Proctor . We gave her the chance to load up on stock options at the very beginning, but she did a total self-toast. Told me that the only thing she wanted in exchange for her services was that I clean up my room.
 
The Times: And what does she say now?
 
E.P.: She stopped being mad at me when I bought her a controlling interest in Mary Kay Cosmetics for her birthday. But now, after the correction, she keeps going "I told you so, I told you so." I hate that.
 
The Times: But doesn't she have a point? Given the drop in your market capitalization, won't you have trouble raising the money you need to achieve your growth targets?
 
E.P.: O.K., the V.C.'s have sort of stopped returning my phone calls. But my management team and I are exploring alternative funding sources.
 
The Times: Such as?
 
E.P.: Paper routes. And Dad's raising my allowance.
 
The Times: Some of your critics have complained that PipeDream seems to lack focus. What is PipeDream's mission in the marketplace?
 
E.P.: Well, like, we represent a new, you know, paradigm, geared to the rapidly-changing realities of the 21st-century virtual marketplace.
 
The Times: But what kind of product or service do you provide?
 
E.P.: "Product" and "service" are totally last millennium concepts. PipeDream is the future, and so whatever the future turns out to be, PipeDream's going to be right there. What more do investors need to know?

How To be A Hack

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Oh, the outrage! The Web site maintained by Mobilization for Global Justice, the umbrella organization for last week's Washington protests, gave precisely one example of the economic evil the World Bank does. I looked into that story, and found that it doesn't quite have the claimed moral. Actually, the bank -- not always a lovable organization, to say the least -- in this particular case comes out smelling like a rose. But clearly, to say this in last Wednesday's column was terribly unfair. If a story confirms what the protesters believe, it is a telling example; but if it doesn't, explaining the truth of the case is a cheap shot.
And anyway, as a number of readers have informed me, everyone knows that I am a hired tool of global capitalism. This charge upset me greatly. In fact, I asked my masters for a raise, to 35 pieces of silver, to compensate for my hurt feelings. 
 But maybe this is a good occasion to talk about political bias in economic analysis. It is a real issue. But the corruption is more subtle -- and also more evenly spread across the political spectrum -- than my hate mailers seem to realize.
First of all, academic research in economics is by and large carried out without strong political bias. I'm not saying that what you read in the journals is always right (don't get me started), or that the researchers themselves are noble characters: successful economists, like successful academics in any field, are usually ambitious men and women with large egos. But the structure of rewards in a field in which top departments are constantly jostling for prestige favors cleverness and originality, not political correctness of any stripe.
While hired guns do not flourish at Harvard or the University of Chicago, in Washington they roam in packs.
Portrait of a hired gun: He or she is usually a mediocre economist -- someone whose work, if it didn't have an ideological edge, might have been published but wouldn't have had many readers. He has, however, found a receptive audience for work that does have an ideological edge. In particular, he has learned that pretty good jobs in think tanks, or on the staffs of magazines with a distinct political agenda, are available for people who know enough economics to produce plausible-sounding arguments on behalf of the party line. Ask him whether he is a political hack and he will deny it; he probably does not admit it to himself -- but somehow everything he says or writes serves the interests of his backers.
Most of these hired guns work on behalf of right-wing causes: it's a funny thing, but organizations that promote the interests of rich people seem to be better financed than those that don't. Still, the left has enough resources to front a quorum of its own hacks. And anyway, love of money is only the root of some evil. Love of the limelight, love of the feeling of being part of a Movement, even love of the idea of oneself as a bold rebel against the Evil Empire can be equally corrupting of one's intellectual integrity.
How can you tell the hacks from the serious analysts? One answer is to do a little homework. Hack jobs often involve surprisingly raw, transparent misrepresentations of fact: in these days of search engines and online databases you don't need a staff of research assistants to catch 'em with their hands in the cookie jar. But there is another telltale clue: if a person, or especially an organization, always sings the same tune, watch out.
Real experts, you see, tend to have views that are not entirely one-sided. For example, Columbia's Jagdish Bhagwati, a staunch free-trader, is also very critical of unrestricted flows of short-term capital. Right or not, this mixed stance reflects an honest mind at work. You might think that hacks would at least try to simulate an open mind -- that simply for the sake of appearances the Heritage Foundation would try to find some tax it supports, or the Economic Policy Institute find some trade liberalization it favors. But it almost never happens.
Of course, honest men can disagree, and they can also make mistakes. But it's still a good idea to tune out supposed experts whose minds are made up in advance. Or at least that's what they told me to say.

New King of the Hill

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
No event better underscored the changing of the guard in the Internet economy than when the market capitalization of Cisco Systems surpassed that of Microsoft.
Briefly peaking at a half-trillion dollars before slipping over the last month, Cisco has been the exemplary Silicon Valley growth machine of the last five years: its annual earnings growth over that period has averaged almost 43 percent; revenue growth has been above 50 percent. 
 The rise of Microsoft marked the shift from centralized computers to the desktop PC. Cisco's dominance is evidence of the new hegemony of the Internet.
For many industry executives in Silicon Valley, Cisco's ascendancy underscores two growing beliefs: that Microsoft has peaked, and that the financial success stories of the Internet age will be driven by the world's insatiable appetite for additional communications capacity.
Cisco is the leading manufacturer of the Internet's plumbing -- powerful computers that route and switch the data packets among Web servers and Internet surfers. Because of this, it stands to be the largest beneficiary of the growing push toward multimedia.
Under John Chambers, its chief executive, the company has pursued a strategy of growth by acquisition that has been so successful that in the valley the company is known as the Borg -- after the "Star Trek" character that incorporated its enemies.
Its growth-by-acquisition model has allowed Mr. Chambers to scan the horizon for the next important Internet niche and then to buy the companies whose technologies will ensure that Cisco maintains a No. 1 or No. 2 position in markets where it chooses to compete.
"The biggest issue in the future is how many balls can John Chambers juggle?" said David Bunnell, author of "Making the Cisco Connection: The Story Behind the Real Internet Superpower" (John Wiley & Sons, 2000). Of course, growth also depends on the stock market's continued enthusiasm for Cisco, he noted; the company now uses its explosive stock value to provide "Cisco dollars" to fuel its acquisitions, of which there have been dozens.
But with a P/E of well over 100, it is fair to question the inflated value of that currency. "The valuation is extreme," said Andrew S. Cupps, portfolio manager of the $850 million Strong Enterprise fund, who adds that Cisco's current multiple assumes that it will be able to maintain its dominance of networking and continue to execute its strategy flawlessly.
That is a tall order. "I don't think they are going to just roll over into the next paradigm," Mr. Cupps said. Indeed, while the growth of Cisco's router and switch business seems assured, the company has begun zeroing in on markets that are certain to lead to titanic industry battles: Internet telephony and Internet appliances.
Mr. Chambers has said that he is anxious to remove the traditional analog telephone from his desk and replace it with one that routes voice conversations over the Internet. That will ensure that Cisco collides head-on with two of the companies that are already its biggest competitors, Lucent Technologies and Nortel.
Even so, that battle may pale in light of Cisco's growing interest in the market for Internet appliances -- consumer devices designed to permit Internet surfing from the kitchen or the den. Thought to be the next great area of Internet growth, the struggle over the appliance market will inevitably set Cisco on a collision course with Microsoft. JOHN MARKOFF

Strong Earnings Help the Market Rebound

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
The stock market staged a solid recovery last week as investors sifted through the wreckage of the recent sell-off and picked up some bargain-priced goodies.
Shares of both old-economy and new-economy companies were also helped by a string of positive quarterly earnings reports. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average settled at 10,844.05, up 5.2 percent, in an abbreviated trading week. The markets were closed on Good Friday. The Nasdaq ended the week at 3,643.88, up 9.7 percent.
Analysts said investors concentrated on the earnings reports and other signs of fundamental strength as they determined which stocks to buy.
The outlook for many corporations has been and remains very positive, and that's the only reason to buy stocks -- to participate in the growth of a company, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons.
Mr. Goldman, however, predicted more market volatility in the near term.
The positive earnings reports crossed all industries, with companies like Times Mirror, Boeing, Eli Lilly, Chase Manhattan and America Online reporting sizable gains. VIVIAN MARINO

Making Education An Online Brand

BYLINE: By ANN KIRSCHNER 

 BODY:
AS president and chief executive of Fath-om.com, the new Internet venture of Col-umbia University, Ann Kirschner is pressing hard to bring higher education to cyberspace.
While other universities were putting courses and degree programs on the Web, she was planning a for-profit company to offer classes as well as reference books, museum objects and other educational services online. 
 Besides Columbia, the partners so far are the New York Public Library, the British Library, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, the London School of Economics and Political Science and Cambridge University Press.
Dr. Kirschner, who is 49, was previously vice president of interactive programming and development for the National Football League, having created NFL.com, Superbowl.com and Team NFL on America Online. But before she entered the business arena, she was an academic. With a doctorate in English literature from Princeton, she lectured there on Victorian literature until she decided that the academic pace was simply too slow (though she serves on the Princeton English Department's advisory council).
 She realizes that not all of academia is as ready to move online as she and Columbia are. But she is convinced that higher education is at a turning point.
"If Galileo were alive today, would he be teaching at the University of Padua?" she asked. "Maybe. But he'd be teaching in new ways. And the Internet is the hottest new game in town."
 Her aspirations are as grand as her perspective. In her view, Fathom.com has the "potential to be a category killer."
 "There are only a handful of institutions," she said, "with our name recognition and our content." KAREN W. ARENSON

HEADLINE: Retired, Rehired: Dutch Fill Crucial Work Force Gap

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM

 BODY:
Frans Tuijntjes, a former NATO test pilot, has flown in the Arizona desert, across much of Europe and over the African bush. But these days he is selling men's clothing and loving it.
The former pilot, who has just turned 69, was bored in retirement. So when he heard of 65+, a new employment agency designed for the elderly, it seemed just the thing. 
 "I've sold airplanes, so I figured I could sell a suit," he said, returning from his part-time job at a local Marks & Spencer store. "It's fun because I meet all sorts of people and I can practice my languages."
Recruiting the elderly -- men and women who want to occupy their day, battle loneliness or top up their pension -- has become a Dutch growth industry. While unemployment hovers around 10 percent in other parts of Europe, the Dutch now have the opposite problem: with only 2.7 percent jobless, the country is seriously short of workers.
Companies describe older employees as unusually motivated, experienced and loyal. Demand is such that this year the 65+ chain is expanding into 10 cities.
Only a decade ago, the indulgent Dutch welfare state was subsidizing inactivity. It encouraged the middle-aged to take early retirement or disability pay in order to make room for the unemployed young. Many people opted out, with almost full pay.
But harsh cutbacks and investment incentives have turned the tables. The economy grew quickly for the past five years, reaching 4.3 percent in 1999. Companies complain that the tight labor market is now hampering growth because they can no longer fill vacancies.
The labor shortage has prompted a national debate on some sensitive questions: how many more immigrants should be let into a small country that is already one of the world's most densely populated? Can the government force people to re-train? How far should it raise retirement age?
Last month, the government formally summoned the elderly to return to work, saying it needed their experience. It sweetened the call with a package of incentives.
Jos Veenhuis did not need such prodding. He got his job through 65+ and spends two or three days a week as a guard at the Rembrandt House museum.
"It gets me out of the house, and it's fun when people ask questions," said Mr. Veenhuis, 70, who retired at age 59 as personnel chief at Amsterdam's main railway station.
He has boned up on topics such as Rembrandt's stormy life and the restoration of art works. And he enjoys coming home at night with a few stories. "Americans ask things like 'What wax do you use?' because some restored paintings look so bright and shiny," he said. (No wax). "The Dutch want to know if the furniture in the house really belonged to the Master." (It didn't).
Mr. Veenhuis has used the extra income on holidays with his wife in Greece and Spain. "And I've become a real Rembrandt fan," he said.
At the 65+ agencies, jobs being offered tend to be part-time, which is what older people usually look for, said Annemarie Egels, a branch manager in The Hague. Most of her applicants are men, because, she said, after a long career, they seem to feel more frustrated or isolated in retirement than women, who in that generation often stayed at home. Mrs. Egels said there are more requests for receptionists, cashiers, personnel managers and accountants than she can handle.
The range is even wider at 55+, an agency for over 55-year-olds in Rotterdam, which in the past 18 months has seen demand soar for health care workers, teachers and librarians. "Companies tell us they find the older people not only more experienced, but also more polite, more patient and punctual," said Christie de Groot, the agency director.
Recruiters say there is also a need for former executives, who may be called in to help start up or reorganize companies, since younger workers are often very specialized.
Mrs. Egels recalled one recent project that involved merging several libraries for the blind and creating a common database. "We found a retired publisher, lawyer, real estate agent and mathematics teacher," she recalled. "They did the job in a year and they've all been friends ever since."
Calling in the retired has other benefits. Employers can pay them 20 to 25 percent less because they no longer need to contribute to social security or other benefits.
But additional earnings can push the pensioner into a higher tax bracket. "Of course my income taxes have gone up a bit," said Bert Pel, 66, who used to head a federation of importers and now does part-time bookkeeping for the Red Cross. "It's worth it," he said. "I'm making new friends and I keep up with the new computer systems."
Computers are one problem area. The elderly have little or no experience in information technology, yet demand for even basic computer skills is such that employment agencies are providing training. Even 65+ thinks the investment is worthwhile. For its clients, it pays half the cost of the computer training course. The client or the employer pays the rest.
Because jobs are often short-term or part-time, no reliable statistics are available showing how many retired people are now working. Agencies like 65+ and 55+ handle hundreds of applicants each month. But it is clear that the retired who have gone back to work are just a small portion of the two million people who are 65 or older in the Netherlands.
And this underscores another fundamental issue. Europe's overall population is older than that of any other continent and the Netherlands is among the countries where every year a smaller percentage of people are working and a larger percentage are collecting pensions.
A recent Dutch government study said that by 2030, the country will need to double the number of people over 55 years of age to pay the bills for pension, disability and unemployment benefits. At present, less than one in three people between 55 and 65 still hold regular jobs, one of the lowest rates in Europe.
Mr. Tuintjes, the former test pilot, said three days per week at the Marks and Spencer store were enough pressure. "I'm already by far the oldest employee there," he said with a chuckle. "Of course I'll keep going as long as I don't make a fool of myself."

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Wrigley Is Old-Fashioned, But Packed With Panache

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; David Barboza, who is based in Chicago, is the Midwest business correspondent for The New York Times.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
They call this area Wrigleyville, and fans swarmed here on opening day on April 10 to see the ballpark that remains a symbol of old-fashioned baseball.
This is where games are still played in the middle of the day. The view from home plate is of ivy-covered walls and Waveland Avenue, where scores of fans can take in the game from neighborhood rooftops. There is no giant Coca-Cola bottle perched in the center-field bleachers, no Gap advertisement in left-center or Ruggles restaurant just beyond the 400-foot mark in right field. 
 At a time when major league teams have christened multimillion-dollar corporate palaces like Comerica Park in Detroit, Enron Field in Houston and Pac Bell Stadium in San Francisco, Wrigley Field is bucking the trend toward corporate sponsorships and spanking new refurbishments.
The Cubs' old park, which was built in 1914, retains what is, in effect, a ban on corporate advertising on the field, the only such ban in the majors. And even though Wrigley is set in a busy, residential neighborhood where one of the largest parking lots is at a local convent, significant alterations are not even being contemplated.
"There is no interest in doing anything that's going to change the nature of Wrigley Field," said Andy MacPhail, the president and chief executive of the Chicago Cubs. "We never say never, but we recognize that this place is special."
How can the Cubs make this high-minded choice? Wrigley has 39,000 seats -- making it and Fenway Park in Boston the only two parks in the league with fewer than 40,000. Fenway has the smallest park in the majors, seating 33,871, but Red Sox tickets are among the most expensive -- ranging between $14 and $45 -- and Fenway has a lot of advertising. Moreover, the Red Sox are considering replacing Fenway with a park that has more luxury boxes, corporate sponsorships and other cash-generating ventures, which would make Wrigley the last park of a bygone era.
And why not? In good years and bad, fans seem to flock here, not just to see Sammy Sosa whack balls onto Waveland Avenue, but to revel in an old ballpark, with its charms and its absence of new-age spectacle. A year ago, Wrigley sold more than 92 percent of its tickets -- a record 2.9 million tickets, third best in the majors -- despite the fact that the team ended up in the basement of the National League Central. And that doesn't count the rooftops around the park, where three flats have been fitted with rows of stadium-like seating. The team also has among the lowest ticket prices in the majors, with the most expensive seats often selling for just $25.
The Cubs can get along with a creaky, old park and bargain ticket prices because of the hefty television revenue that comes from being in the third-largest media market in the nation. Although Cubs management has finally made the off-season personnel moves to bolster Sosa and his four-year, $42.5 million contract, history shows that fans come no matter how the Cubs are playing. Most games are sold out largely because Wrigley is an old-fashioned "field of dreams" for fans who root, root, root for the "Cubbies."
"Compared to other clubs, the Cubs don't care what players they put on their field because they sell out every game," said Todd Gruen, an editor at the Team Marketing Report, a sports marketing firm in Chicago. "Even without Sammy Sosa, it's a fun ballpark."
Wrigley, however, is not the oldest park. That distinction belongs to Fenway, which opened in 1912. Tiger Stadium (1914) was also a nostalgic site, but it got the wrecking ball. And while the new park in Boston may well retain the historic Fenway name, the trend these days is to sell the naming rights for a pretty penny. A decade ago, fans jammed into Candlestick, Three Rivers Stadium and Fenway. Now, they are welcomed to Qualcomm Stadium, Bank One Ball Park and Tropicana Field, names that don't exactly roll off the tongue or conjure images of hot dogs and pennant fever.
But corporations do generate cash, a lot of it. Pac Bell paid $50 million for the naming rights to the San Francisco Giants' new stadium for 24 years; Bank One paid $66 million for 30 years; and Enron paid about $100 million to associate itself with the Houston Astros' park through 2030.
What Wrigley gives up in sponsorships, parking and luxury boxes, Cubs officials say it makes up for in sellouts and television revenue, even though the games are broadcast on WGN, which, like the Cubs and Wrigley, is owned by The Tribune Company, publisher of The Chicago Tribune.
"In the best of circumstances, they could generate another $20 million in a new stadium, but the White Sox have a new stadium and they're doing terribly," said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College in Massachusetts. "The Cubs do well with what they have. There's a certain cache that comes with playing in an old ballpark."
Indeed, in recent years, other teams have tried to incorporate some of the Wrigley charm into new parks. There is a movement toward smaller, retro stadiums -- not even stadiums, parks or fields, they now say. Baseball owners are trying to create a neighborhood feel, using brick fencing, and almost Disneyesque recreations of Main Street around the park. Gone is the 60,000-seat dome movement of the 1970's and 1980's. But the new stadiums are also crowded with corporate logos and billboards.
"Arizona looks like a minor league park -- it's plastered with billboards," said Benjamin De La Fuente, a Cubs spokesman.
Pac Bell Park has dozens of corporate logos, including a 90-foot replica of a Coca-Cola bottle in the center-field stands, next to a giant sculpture of a baseball glove. At Enron Field, which is named after a natural gas company, there is the Conoco Home Run Alley, and the Conoco Bell Tower, named after the oil company. Some 27 companies -- UPS, Miller, Budweiser, Chevy, Ford, Dodge, A.I.M. management funds, Kroger's supermarkets, to name a few -- have signs in the stadium.
There are also restaurants, batting cages, waterfalls, fireworks shows and fantasy baseball at the new stadiums, for when fans get restless with watching all baseball all the time.
At Wrigley, logos and promotions appear only in the concourses. There are also small, almost invisible promotions on the backs of some seat cup-holders. Even though Wrigley is named for the founder of the Wrigley chewing gum family that sold the team in 1981, The Tribune Company has largely ignored the corporate juggernaut, choosing instead to gradually upgrade an old park, which put in lights for night games only as recently as 1988.
The motto here: don't spoil it. The charm of Wrigley, the Tuesday afternoons with beer in the bleachers, the ivy-covered walls, the old organ that plays at the beginning of each game, and the white and blue flags that signal whether the Cubs have won or lost that day's game. Any major changes, the thinking goes, would generate huge resistance among the fans.
"If they ever decided to junk Wrigley Field, the fans would protest," said George Castle, who has covered the Cubs for The Times of northwest Indiana for 20 years. "They'd tear down the Tribune Tower."
Then again, critics here say the owners aren't exactly opening their pocketbooks to snatch up talent, either.
"The talk around baseball is why don't the Cubs spend more money?" said Castle, who has written a book about why the Cubs have not won a pennant since 1945. "If they spent more, they'd make more in television revenues."
Of course, at $55 million last year, the Cubs had a hefty payroll, far more than the Kansas City Royals ($18 million), but far less than the Yankees ($88 million.)
With free-agent contracts skyrocketing, the Cubs and other teams are trying to develop strong farm systems. But when Sosa's contract comes up next year, the Cubs may need to rethink an old stadium that has just one elevator, little room for food and beverage concessions and luxury boxes that even top executives say aren't quite luxurious.
But MacPhail insists the team will find a way to sign top players without altering the stadium.
"I don't think it would mean if Sammy Sosa's a free agent we need to put a second deck on the bleachers," he said. "We wouldn't make a change that can last 50 years to accommodate one player."

HEADLINE: The Andes in Tumult, Shaken by Political Tremors

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER with CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
Guerrillas and the cocaine trade batter Colombia. A strongman rides roughshod over a discredited Congress and courts in Venezuela. Ecuador reels from an economic crisis and a coup. Bolivia has just emerged from a state of siege. And Peru awaits an election between an autocrat accused of trying to steal the presidency and a political firebrand.
Suddenly it seems as if all the Andes are in tumult. Recent events have exposed fractures in each society, some old and some new, and one Wall Street firm has gone so far as to warn its clients that the region is becoming "the Balkans of Latin America." 
 But if it does appear that institutions in these countries are breaking down, many of the conflicts that divide the societies today are different from those in the past. Turmoil is no stranger to the region, which has had more than its share of dictators, guerrilla movements and economic crises. But the current discontent is being generated less by conflict over the type of government countries should have than the quality.
Democracy has been ascendant in the region for a decade, but the longing for more representative and responsive governance is greater now among the region's 100 million people than ever before, experts say. That aspiration increasingly bumps up against governments that have been unable to provide an equitable sharing of power and wealth.
"The one thing these countries have in common," said Michael Shifter of the Washington-based research group Inter-American Dialogue, "is deterioration and decay in the quality and performance of institutions, in their inability to produce the results that people demand and will respect."
While cautioning against "the trap of talking about an Andean virus," he said, "There is something going on that is not supposed to happen."
These problems are most visible in Peru and Venezuela. After years of ineffectual governance, both countries -- first Peru with Alberto K. Fujimori in 1990 and then Venezuela with Hugo Chavez in 1998 -- elected political outsiders who promised sweeping democratic changes.
But in each case the line between overhauling the institutions of democracy and usurping them altogether became quickly blurred by men who have shown authoritarian tendencies. The challenge now -- particularly with each country facing elections in coming weeks -- is to reassert where that border is. That may mean voting the men out of power and vigorously protesting any attempt at fraud.
But the situation in Ecuador, where the government has been headed toward a total collapse, may be even more acute. It has had five presidents from various parties over the last four years and not one has been able to deliver the political and economic stability that citizens crave. Now, as a desperation measure, the government has adopted the dollar as Ecuador's currency.
In January, President Jamil Mahuad was overthrown in an uprising jointly organized by disgruntled colonels and Indian leaders, who for generations have felt excluded from the political and economic life of their country but have had little opportunity to change their circumstances.
The military coup was the first to succeed in Latin America in more than a decade. Though it ended with the army installing a civilian leader -- the country's vice president, Gustavo Noboa -- the action sent a strong signal through the region that soldiers may yet be tempted to short-circuit democratic governments they consider corrupt or ineffective.
Beyond Ecuador, in all five Andean countries, long-simmering feelings of political and economic exclusion have begun to boil over in populations that are at the same time susceptible to charismatic political figures who offer a bold new path, one that sometimes tempts citizens with undemocratic measures.
"The institutional vacuum is the real problem," said Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami. "The lack of leadership, the inability of parties to throw up new candidates, and the absence of formal linkages to the population is really striking and very, very worrying."
Each country has sought its own kind of savior. When Peruvians first looked to Mr. Fujimori a decade ago, he was elected in a break from the traditional political parties, which had failed to control debilitating terrorism and hyperinflation.
Now Peruvians are considering Alejandro Toledo, a business school professor who is offering a surprisingly strong challenge to Mr. Fujimori, forcing a runoff election that must take place by June. Mr. Toledo has promised to resuscitate democratic institutions, like the Congress and judiciary, smothered under Mr. Fujimori's heavy hand.
In Bolivia, Gen. Hugo Banzer, who was the country's dictator in the 1970's, was voted into power in 1997 pledging to fight corruption, eradicate coca production and modernize the state. His return clearly demonstrated how democratic aspirations still mingle with the lingering desire for a firm hand.
Much the same can be said of President Chavez in Venezuela, a cashiered army colonel who last year assumed the very office he tried to gain in a coup seven years earlier. While he now promises a "peaceful social revolution," a number of signs suggest that he intends to concentrate power in his own hands.
While Mr. Chavez's attacks on Venezuela's Constitution, Congress and courts have resonated overwhelmingly with Venezuelans, his attempts to forge an all-powerful presidency have not. Instead, they are generating growing suspicion of an equally grave threat to the country's democracy and have led to the unexpected emergence of a rival in the presidential vote set for May 28, from a fellow coup plotter, Francisco Arias Cardenas.
Now Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, seems to be trying to take advantage of the same discontent. Faced with twin plagues of Marxist guerrillas and drug trafficking, he is proposing a referendum to dissolve the Congress, seen by most Colombians as corrupt and inefficient, and replace it with what he pitches as a more responsive body.
But Mr. Pastrana, whose own popularity has been slipping, may be too late to capitalize on such sentiment. The apparent front-runner in the presidential election, now two years off, is Noemi Sanin, leader of a non-party movement called Colombia Yes, who is sounding many of the themes that have proved so appealing elsewhere.
"In Colombia the state is not operating," Ms. Sanin, a former foreign minister, told the newsmagazine Semana. "We do not want to participate in the sterile fights and embraces between which the traditional parties alternate while they carve up bureaucratic spoils and the national budget."
The situation in each country points to a regional crisis that is first and foremost political, where the urgent need for more effective government converges with the desire that those governments be democratic.
The most striking recent example was in Peru. "What I saw was a rejection of the imposition of a regime that said, 'We'll do what we want,' " Enrique Zileri Gibson, editor of Caretas, Peru's leading magazine, said of the protesters who took to the streets after Mr. Fujimori was accused of trying to steal a presidential election two weeks ago and chanted, "Democracy yes, authoritarianism no!"
But the region's severe economic and social problems cannot be ignored. The smaller Andean countries are so hard-pressed that Bolivia's attempt to levy a 20 percent increase in water rates this month provoked a response so violent that Mr. Banzer dusted off his old autocratic tools and declared a state of siege. High unemployment rates have worsened and expanded the already huge informal sector of these economies.
"This is the largest growth sector of society, but no one is speaking for them," Dr. Gamarra said. "The problem is that because they are so tenuously tied to the system, with no unemployment insurance, health care or social security, they will vote for whoever promises a wonderful reform."
To a large extent, that excluded economic class coincides with the Indian and mestizo, or mixed race, population, and those people of indigenous descent are becoming more dissatisfied and assertive, especially as they move from village to city.
The coup in Ecuador was the clearest indication of this discontent. Another is the rise of Mr. Toledo and even, to some extent, Mr. Chavez. Both have strongly Indian features and a mestizo appeal.
The rise of this new type of leader is striking in a region where politicians have traditionally tended to be upper class, lighter skinned and of purer Spanish descent, and where many questions born in colonialism and surrounding ethnic identity, language and culture have remained unresolved for 500 years.

HEADLINE: Americans Of Two Minds On Sanctions, A Poll Finds

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
The more Americans know about the world, the more likely they are to favor diplomacy over punitive sanctions in dealing with troublesome foreign countries, a poll has found. Embargoes, they say, not only isolate the nations at which they are aimed but also hurt American business.
When Americans lack information about a country, or when their leaders do not adequately publicize and explain their policy thinking, many fall back on long-established stereotypes of "bad" and "good" nations, the poll found. Judgments about how to deal with those nations are then made on those images. 
 The survey -- by First International Resources, a business consulting group, and the polling organization Penn, Schoen & Berland -- was done in two parts for the sake of comparison. A national sample of 995 average voters was made first, and then 176 knowledgeable "elites" working in government, academic life and research institutes were surveyed.
The full poll results are expected to be made public next week. The survey, based on interviews from Feb. 28 to March 21, focused primarily on attitudes toward economic sanctions on Iran, but when respondents were asked to name "good" and "bad" countries, the findings suggest that the attitudes apply to sanctions policy toward other nations.
Respondents in the general public knew very little about Iran and the recent political changes there, including gains by moderates in parliamentary elections. Only 15 percent of them had heard about advances by Iranians who advocate reform; only 2 percent knew of the 1997 election of a more moderate Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami. Among more knowledgeable people, 58 percent had heard about the shifts toward moderation.
Both groups, however, were still instinctively unfavorable to Iran, based on its reputation for support of terrorism and Islamic militancy. Only Iraq outranked it on the enemies' list among the general population. But the elite respondents were far more likely to say that Iran had changed -- they ranked Serbia, Libya and Iraq as worse cases -- and that Iranian moderates should be helped. These more knowledgeable people also said that sanctions got in the way of dialogue with Iran.
"Both the general public and the elites believe it is extremely important to keep channels of communication open with countries like Iran," the poll concluded, "and that penalizing or isolating rogue countries is not the way to get them to change."
Sanctions have been a major policy tool of the Clinton administration, whether imposed by the United States alone or through the United Nations. Other nations, including American allies in Europe, have been critical of long-running embargoes and other sanctions, saying that they rarely hurt dictators but can harm ordinary people. They also get in the way of international business, or create tensions when the United States tries to force other nations to adhere to its own trade and investment restrictions.
Recently, an American embargo on Iran was eased to allow for importing certain goods like caviar, pistachios and Persian carpets -- a move of which 6 of 10 poll respondents in the general public were unaware. Sports exchanges that have taken place drew universal support in the poll, and 77 percent of average voters and 90 percent of the elite respondents said sanctions should be lifted if Iran responded favorably to an initial easing of the embargo.
In Congress, a small but widening movement is questioning the long-term value of inflexible embargoes. There are concerns that in Iraq, for example, a decade of sanctions may be strengthening the hand of Saddam Hussein while causing unacceptable hardships to the Iraqi people.
Representative Tony P. Hall, Democrat of Ohio, was in Iraq last week to assess the cumulative effects of the comprehensive sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He is expected to announce the results of his trip today.
The new poll found that while Americans continued to think that sanctions should remain a tool of foreign policy and that big business would from time to time have to make sacrifices because of embargoes, respondents in both groups preferred sanctions to be imposed through international organizations.
They also expressed concern about the use of sanctions if American jobs were at risk, and when presented with facts about American losses, were more likely to want sanctions lifted, or at least eased.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Start-Up and Risk Are New Business Watchwords

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 22

 BODY:
Starting this week, music fans across Japan will be stepping up to a gadget that resembles a souped up, stand-alone automated teller, plugging in a blank minidisk, dropping in some coins and, 30 to 40 seconds later, walking away with their favorite recordings. And they will not be limited to just a few selections; thanks to a super-fast, high-capacity digital connection to a central computer, thousands upon thousands of popular songs will be potentially available at the touch of a few buttons.
No more long waits. No more illicit downloading of MP3 files. Just music fast, simple and cheap. 
 It's called a Music POD, and while it may seem like just another plaything for Japanese teenagers, it is in fact a powerful representation of the tectonic shifts taking place in the economy here.
What the Music POD embodies is the entrepreneurial vision of a 30-year-old college dropout and the business skills of a 40-something former salary man, founders of a young company called V-Sync. They are the sorts of men who five years ago would have toiled anonymously inside a major corporation, climbing the ladder of seniority and keeping their dreams tightly locked up in their heads.
But today changes in the relationship between employer and employee, the liberalization of the financial markets and the explosion of new business models in the freewheeling arenas of the Internet and information technology are spawning a whole new breed of entrepreneurs who care little for the conventions that have dominated Japan Inc. for decades.
"I don't want to be a gear turning the wheels of a big company," said Katsuma Fujii, V-Sync's chairman and the younger of its co-founders. "It's difficult for a lowly gear to get his bosses to listen to, let alone accept, his out-of-this-world ideas in a traditional Japanese corporation. I want to do what I want to do."
While the number of start-ups that can be counted is still low in comparison with the United States, venture capitalists say they began detecting a significant increase in activity last year that is continuing today despite the weak economy. The number of initial public offerings was up for the first time last year since the peak in 1995, and the percentage of those companies that were less than 10 years old was the highest it had ever been, according to Jafco, Japan's largest venture capital company.
Japan, of course, has always been a nation with many small businesses, despite its image as the land of corporate leviathans manned by regiments of salary men. And what gets forgotten is that some of those leviathans -- Honda, Kyocera and Sony, to name a few -- were spawned by visionary entrepreneurs.
But the economic structure that evolved after World War II, with its heavy emphasis on government-directed bank lending, its punitive tax structure, its ban on stock options and its lack of pension portability, stifled the entrepreneurial spirit here.
"What we would call the upside didn't exist under that system," said Karl K. Fooks, managing director in charge of deploying venture capital for J. P. Morgan in Tokyo, where it has recently announced investments in three start-ups. "The banks forced you to pledge your entire family as collateral, and the tax man took most of your profits."
Thus, until the last year or so, when many of those disincentives started eroding, entrepreneurs tended to be shackled to the big kaisha, or corporations, which provided them with a steady stream of orders, helped them establish a line of credit with a bank and squeezed their profits in hard times. They were, effectively, the minor outlying satellites of the business clusters called kei retsu, and their fortunes very much depended on the kaisha's patronage.
So Japan's best and brightest made the rational choice to join the big companies, where salaries were small but benefits like cars, housing allowances and school tuition were generous and untaxed. The further one climbed up the ladder, the better the benefits became, making lifetime loyalty far more attractive than striking out on one's own.
"People love to say the Japanese are risk averse," Mr. Fooks said. "That simply isn't true. There was just no reward for taking entrepreneurial risk in the past."
All that is now changing. For one thing, many big companies are slowly realizing the benefits of competitive procurement practices and the costs of providing life support to so many small partners. Corporations are also struggling to pare their work forces, largely by drastically cutting hiring of new employees. Unemployment hit another high in March, and a record share of college graduates this year will be unable to find established jobs, a trend that is encouraging more and more people to start businesses.
Further, the big companies that still dominate the economy are adopting compensation programs based on performance and abolishing remuneration determined by seniority, fast diluting the attractions of lifetime employment.
The evolution of the financial markets here is also helping entrepreneurs, as new stock markets emerge designed to foster young businesses and a flood of venture capital provides money that once was parceled out almost exclusively by big banks largely interested in corporate customers and real estate developers.
"I didn't even go to a bank when I started my company because I was pretty sure about the answer -- no," said Moto Kuroi, co-founder of Neuromagic, a Web design and strategic consulting firm. "I started the company with money from my friends and myself."
To be sure, V-Sync and Neuromagic have a few beneficial ties to big business. Sharp, Sumitomo Trust, Marubeni and other established Japanese companies have invested in V-Sync. Similarly, Neuromagic relies on Dentsu, the giant Japanese advertising agency, for some of its orders.
The difference is that were either of these two companies to lose those backers, they would scarcely miss a beat. When Internet Initiatives Japan, which specializes in connecting corporate customers to the Internet, wanted to raise money here two years ago, it was stymied. It finally went public last summer -- on the Nasdaq market in the United States.
But since then, two new stock exchanges have been set up specifically to foster fledgling enterprises -- Mothers, which made its debut late last year, and Nasdaq Japan, which will open this summer. Meanwhile, the pool of venture capital here is swelling. Even the government is eager to develop entrepreneurs, earmarking 10.3 billion yen, or about $97 million, for new ventures.
"I don't worry so much about finding money," said Mr. Kuroi, who almost sold Neuromagic recently but decided he would rather remain independent. "I worry about getting the right people to back us."
Part of the challenge for venture capitalists is that the large majority of money available to finance new businesses arrived only recently, so many of the entrepreneurs here have figured out ways to build their operations without it.
"Only one year ago, too little money was chasing too few deals," said Mitsumasa Murase, chairman and president of Jafco, the venture capital company. "Now, we have too much money chasing too few deals."
That is especially true now that barriers to taking young companies public have been eased, making private capital less crucial in nursing them. "Previously, if you invested in early stage companies, it would take 30 years to cash out and make money on them," Mr. Murase said. "Now, companies are going public at lightning speed, one and a half or two years after they are founded."
Just this week, V-Sync began making plans to offer shares to the public on the Mothers exchange. "We are rather like a telecom company, so we need money to build a fiber optic infrastructure," said Takaya Ibe, V-Sync's president and co-founder. "That requires a huge amount of money, and we feel the stock market is the best place to go for that."
In many ways, Mr. Ibe is even more remarkable than his whiz-kid partner, Mr. Fujii. To start with, after graduating from college, Mr. Ibe went to work for Hoechst, the big German chemical company, rather than a Japanese kaisha, a far rarer occurrence then than now.
He eventually left for a company specializing in semiconductor robotics, his second break from the traditional Japanese career pattern that chains employees to companies for life. From there, he went to Bandai, where he was part of a team that developed a variety of popular gadgets using computer chips.
But what most interested Mr. Ibe was developing circuitry to create three-dimensional computer games. At that time, about 15 years ago, Bandai was reaping the benefits of its simple, two-dimensional Super Mario games.
"I explained to the board that if we could introduce 3-D, the prospect for games would be great," he said. "But they told me, 'This two-dimensional Mario is beautiful and fun. Why should we create something new? What do we need 3-D for?' "
Disappointed, he stayed at Bandai a few more years but then struck out and founded his own company. On one project, he met Mr. Fujii.
The young Mr. Fujii was then working for a company that was a subcontractor to Bandai. "Even though I invented some smash hit products," he said, "the profit always went to Bandai. That's why I decided to start my own company and asked Mr. Ibe to be my partner."
Mr. Ibe had not forgotten his dreams, either. "I kept remembering the whole 3-D thing with Bandai and how Playstation and Nintendo had proven I was right," he said. "I did not want to repeat that mistake and miss out on an opportunity."
So he and Mr. Fujii pooled their money and went into business in hopes of exploiting the emerging network technologies already taking off in the United States. They were lucky when they received a research grant from Okayama Prefecture. They won a bid to supply information kiosks in train stations, beating out corporate titans like NEC and Fujitsu. And the giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone turned to V-Sync when Mitsubishi Electric failed to deliver an information terminal.
The genius of people like Mr. Fujii has been in recognizing that subterranean Japan is a veritable spaghetti bowl of underutilized fiber optic cable and finding ways of putting it to use. Indeed, V-Sync's dreams go far beyond music; any kind of digital information -- books, movies, software, games -- can be downloaded through the POD.
That understanding of the power resident in telecommunications networks is what distinguishes many of the new entrepreneurs from their predecessors and the big kaisha. They have largely had to educate themselves, which has given them a self-confidence that is rare in Japan.
Mr. Kuroi, the Neuromagic founder, was a philosophy major studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo -- "I wanted to go to Hitotsubashi University," he said, "but I wasn't a good enough student" -- when he discovered the potential of networked technology.
"At that time, there was no commercial Internet, everything was operating at a speed of 2,400 baud, you couldn't send images or pictures of any kind, only text," he said. "I knew the technology would change, but my friends said what I was talking about was impossible."
After trying out a couple of different jobs, Mr. Kuroi met several employees of Apple Computer. "Those guys didn't think like Japanese, and being around them helped me to realize I don't need a protector."
So he started Neuromagic with a friend who left IBM Japan. They are still the sole owners of the company, which now has 20 employees.
Neuromagic, a pioneer in Japan's young Internet production industry, has worked on more than 100 Web sites, including sites for Sony Music Entertainment and Citibank Japan. It helped Gap plan its new store in Tokyo's trendy Harajuku neighborhood.
But Mr. Kuroi is not sanguine. Web site design companies are springing up all over, and he is well aware that his American counterparts are often operating outfits with 25 times the staff that Neuromagic has.
"We have to be more competitive, offer customers more services and ideas," Mr. Kuroi said. "That will take money."
His parents initially objected to Neuromagic, asking Mr. Kuroi to explain why they had wasted money sending him to college. "My father wanted me to work for Hitachi, Toshiba, Matsushita," Mr. Kuroi said. "That was his direction."
But Mr. Kuroi, who is 37, has now convinced his father that he made the right choice. "We are different from our parents' generation," he said. "We have different D.N.A."

HEADLINE: Hard Choices for a Graying Island;
Battle Over Resources May Be Glimpse at America's Future

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

DATELINE: SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y., April 22

 BODY:
Snugly sheltered by geography and sensibility from the workaday bustle of Long Island's North Fork and the antsy glamour of the Hamptons to the south, this summer resort island has become a kind of year-round Elder Dorado. More than a third of its 2,300 winter residents are over 60, twice the average nationally and in the metropolitan area. The percentage may be even higher in summer when the population swells to about 10,000.
But even when gray is a primary color, it is not an ethnic, racial, religious or socioeconomic group. 
 Indeed, anthropologists from the booming geriatric-industrial complex might find a monograph of sorts here in the faltering campaign by some older residents to build a $750,000 center for the island's elderly. The plan has been attacked by some of the island's old people who think a senior center is unnecessary or should not be done without doing something as well for working parents and teenagers; they seem afraid of a tax increase, of change, of isolation, of seeming greedy, of being a burden.
"Which old people are we talking about?" asks the Rev. Fred Puelle, 65, a retired Lutheran minister who leads the island's Senior Citizens Affairs Council, an advisory board, and delivers Meals on Wheels. "The ones rocking in the corner or the folks who flirt, work out at the fitness center and enjoy the grape? The folks waiting for me to bring them food or the ones down in Palm Beach for the winter?"
Rockers or flirters, natives or weekenders, the old on Shelter Island did not arrive from somewhere else waving Medicare cards and a lease on a condo in an isolated village with the word leisure or heritage on the locked gate. Because the nation is aging rapidly, what is happening here now, while unusual, may be the harbinger of a returning way of life; the old here aged here and stayed here.
This 8,000-acre island, one-third of which is protected by the Nature Conservancy, was settled in the 17th century by the English, who displaced Indians and built a food and timber plantation worked by African slaves. Later, it was a base for fishermen.
Now, the mansions are best seen from the water, and the trailers and rusted cars in weedy backyards tend to be clustered in the island's middle. Most homes appear to be middle class, an eclectic mix of suburban ranches and split-levels, frame cottages and beachy boxes.
But as with any small island where the inhabitants know all and reveal little, the facades are misleading; living next door to occasional weekenders with city apartments and stacks of frequent flier miles are the house painters and real estate agents who depend on them.
And both groups include many on Medicare.
The island is not a place created for the needs of sunset-special diners; there are few stores or restaurants, it is accessible only by ferry and plagued by power blackouts, rampaging deer and Lyme ticks, all local badges of hardy courage. Local politicians can safely express their concern for the young families driven off-island because the older people who helped drive up real estate prices are so fragmented by their politics, economics and class.
"You want to think that this island is very special," says Art Barnett, the 70-year-old former publisher and editor of the weekly Shelter Island Reporter and now its town hall reporter. "But I've come to think that it's like everywhere else, except maybe you can see things more clearly here."
Most poignantly and universally, you can see those sore spots where individual vulnerability rubs against independence, and where the romanticized American past rubs against the present reality of communities trying to care for their own. The heroes of the island are the volunteers of the fire and rescue companies; yet the aging population has not only increased their workload, it has lowered their pool of young recruits.
Mr. Barnett, who opposes the all-senior center, and Seymour Weissman, 68, its most vocal champion, are aware of those sore spots.
Mr. Weissman, a retired Manhattan television producer, describes himself as the flamethrower of the nonprofit foundation formed to raise the money for the prospective all-senior center. Stocky, emphatic, he punches out his words.
"We've got an invisible elderly population here suffering from malnutrition and from the greatest disease of all, loneliness," he said. "A center would offer socialization, give caregivers respite, we could have nurses, technicians, social workers come in from off-island. There's a great deal of federal and foundation money available, but you have to have the building first. The money goes to programs, not to bricks."
Mr. Barnett discounts Mr. Weissman's bleak portrait as he campaigns for the renovation of the American Legion hall, underused as old soldiers fade away, into a community center for children, teenagers and the elderly. A former marketing executive from Long Island, Mr. Barnett speaks softly about using the past for guidance.
"I'm for what I call noninstitutional care," he said. "Neighbors looking out for each other, the way it's always been. It never gets into The Reporter, but the police are always helping an old man back into his bed, reassuring an old woman who has heard sounds in the night. Someone brings a casserole, drives you to the doctor, takes care of the dog. Someone looks out and sees that the lights are still on in Charlie's house, the newspaper hasn't been picked up, and calls Henrietta, who probably has done something about it already."
True, Henrietta Roberts, 67, the part-time coordinator of senior services, checks on three shut-ins on her way home and runs a "telephone reassurance" network for 14 others. But she thinks that "the islander mentality of taking care of their own" may be outmoded.
"It worked once, but there are too many old people now," she said, in her basement room off the Red Cross offices. A garage is filled with donated canes, walkers and wheelchairs. "I think we may now have almost 1,000 seniors on the island. They are living so long that their problems become very complex. Just like everywhere else. Sometimes this work is so depressing. It's a crystal ball of what's coming for me."
As did Mr. Weissman and Mr. Barnett, Ms. Roberts moved here permanently after years of vacationing on the island. She retired as a human resources manager for a Manhattan corporation. She likes the idea of an all-senior center because of the services and personnel it could draw, but she is torn; her 15-year-old grandson also needs a safe place to drop in with his friends.
"Ultimately it's all about money," she said. "People are afraid of taxes. When I wrote to the seniors about the Town Board giving us the land for a center, I got a letter back asking me to use cheaper stationery."
Money creeps into every conversation about the center. Critics of the proposal roll their eyes at an architect's rendering of four offices, a conference room, a classroom, a porch, a patio and a fireplace, and handsomely landscaped grounds.
"You have to look at the total community," Mr. Barnett said, "because you can't separate the needs of the aging from the needs of their grandchildren -- who may need a youth center to let off steam -- and of their sons and daughters who work and need day care for the kids. We don't even know exactly what the needs of the community are, and here we have a $750,000 Taj Mahal."
Mr. Weissman bristles at that. "Too good for old people? No one really wants to deal with this; the problems of old age are viewed with horror, coming attractions to be denied. No celebrities, it's not sexy. The Yacht Club raises money to send a young sailor around the world to race. That's fine so long as it's not at the expense of what's really necessary."
He takes a deep breath. "You know what it really is. Pure class warfare."
This is not a new idea. Some years ago, a letter published in The Reporter derided the faltering campaign for a new school building. Why even bother, asked the writer, whose address was one of the island's toniest, when graduates of the school would just go work on the island's ferry anyway? The backlash reinvigorated the campaign, and the town built a splendid new school, whose need is questioned to this day.
A more recent class warfare story is told at the weekly communitywide senior lunch at the Presbyterian church, the headquarters of senior nutrition services paid by Suffolk County. A year ago, 14 older bridge players from the Ram Island neighborhood, the island's geographical and social Upper East Side, appeared at noon one Monday. The regulars were thrilled and intimidated. The newcomers sat by themselves at the $2 lunch, stayed late to play cards and never returned.
But the moral of that story -- rich folks are snooty -- loses steam quickly; the regulars had made no effort to welcome the upper crust and, in fact, do not much mix among themselves either. Husbands and wives save seats for each other. When Dorothy Bloom, 76, once handed out numbers with instructions to find the matching chair, she had a rebellion.
"They were shouting, 'NO, I always sit THERE,' " Ms. Bloom said. "My mother had an expression about certain old people. 'He don't even know the Civil War is over.' "
Ms. Bloom was sitting at a Monday lunch with Alice Fiske, coquettish about her age and dressed for a cocktail party, who dismisses the cliquish Ram Islanders with a wave. She is the grande dame of Sylvester Manor, the island's original English settlement. Her late husband's ancestors once ran the slave plantation on the site. Why does she come to Monday lunch? "It is my duty," she said, "to support worthy causes."
She expressed her noblesse oblige amid 30 lively middle-class diners, mostly in their late 70's and early 80's. Typically, they had retired to Shelter Island 20 years ago after many years of summering here or visiting relatives. They had driven themselves to the church. They all happily complained about how busy their lives were; after lunch, which few lingered over, they had to rush off to shop, walk the dog, quilt, pick up a grandchild, see a doctor.
The elegant Ms. Fiske noted that no one had done a real study of what anybody of any age really needed. What kind of building do older people want? And which programs? Do Shelter Island retirees need or want square dance lessons, a dialysis unit, day care for Alzheimer's patients? She said she wanted more details about the kind of activities in any new center. "Why are old people old?" she asked. "Because younger people put them in places and stack them like logs."
A random telephone poll of 300 residents, presented to the Town Board recently, seemed to indicate that if no tax money was involved, people had no strong preferences among a community center, a youth center or a senior center. But the senior center dropped out of favor if taxes needed to be raised 3 to 5 percent. Where had those figures come from?
Town Supervisor Gerry Siller said he did not know, although he had endorsed the poll. He said it was financed by an anonymous older resident who had rejected Mr. Weissman's plea for a donation, citing a lack of data. Mr. Siller, a 46-year-old landscape contractor, thinks that the greatest priority is more affordable housing for local families, which was the lowest priority recorded in the poll. In fact, he confided, he is working back channels to finance such housing with that very same multimillionaire who financed the poll.
This, he said, was the Shelter Island way of taking care of its own, everyday people helping one another, and in crises -- like forestalling development -- going down those long private driveways to the big houses overlooking the deep-water docks.
But the senior issue, Mr. Puelle thinks, needs more than just money. "There has to be a readjustment in attitude," he said. "It's about acknowledging a population that no one -- including members of the population -- really wants to identify with."
He was talking fast as he steered the Meals on Wheels van up a driveway of overgrown weeds and broken concrete. In the back, his wife, Doris, also 65, prepared boxes of food.
This first house was dark, overheated and stinking of liniment, as were most of the dozen houses he visited that day. Mr. Puelle checked for danger signals: too many days of unwashed dishes, bathroom smells, moans of pain, dishevelment, silence. A querulous voice from a distant room finally ordered him to just put the food on a counter strewn with medicine vials. Mr. Puelle called out his standard farewell, "See you next week, God willing."
Back in the van, he asked, "So, what kind of senior center does he need? Do Doris and I need?"

HEADLINE: MEDICINE MERCHANTS: Birth of a Blockbuster;
Drug Makers Reap Profits On Tax-Backed Research

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

 BODY:
On Jan. 7, 1982, in a laboratory at Columbia University, a little-known science professor, Laszlo Z. Bito, finished a nine-month experiment on the eyes of cats. In his handwritten data, carefully charted in gray hardcover notebooks, lay the origins of what every pharmaceutical company longs for: a blockbuster drug.
The drug is Xalatan, a best-selling eyedrop for glaucoma. With $507 million in sales last year -- and the potential for billions more, most of it pure profit -- the four-year-old medicine is the equivalent of liquid gold for its manufacturer, the Pharmacia Corporation. The eyedrop earned Columbia University about $20 million in royalties last year, and it has made a millionaire of Dr. Bito as well. 
 Yet there are other, unseen, partners in the creation of Xalatan: the American taxpayers, who backed Dr. Bito's work with $4 million from the National Institutes of Health. The taxpayers have reaped no financial return on their investment; their reward, government officials say, is the eyedrop itself.
Xalatan costs patients $45 to $50 for a tiny bottle that lasts six weeks. That price -- about $1 a day for a drug that staves off blindness -- may not seem excessive. But the key ingredient in that daily dose costs Pharmacia only pennies to make, and Americans, who live in the only industrialized nation that lacks government restraints on drug prices, pay more than twice what European patients pay for the drug.
That puts Xalatan out of reach for patients like Albert Russell, a retired optician and part-time blues singer from Prince George's County, Md. Mr. Russell, whose glaucoma has left him nearly blind, lives on an $832-a-month Social Security check. He is among the one-third of elderly Americans who lack prescription drug coverage, and when he talks about Xalatan, he uses the word "outrageous" to describe its price.
To officials at Pharmacia, the price is fair. "We are bringing forth innovation," said Dr. Anders Harfstrand, the company's vice president for ophthalmology, "and innovation always brings a premium."
In this election year, the cost of prescription medicines is at the center of the political debate. With the biomedical revolution yielding a flood of new therapies, drugs are now the fastest-growing component of the nation's trillion-dollar-a-year medical bill. As Congress contemplates expanding Medicare to include prescription drug coverage, and some states move to bring drug prices more in line with those in foreign countries, the industry is struggling to fend off federal regulation that might limit its ability to set prices.
At the heart of the fight is Dr. Harfstrand's contention that the price of medication is justified by the extreme risk of failure and high cost of drug discovery -- an average of $500 million per drug, by the industry's estimate. It is an argument that the pharmaceutical industry, one of the world's most lucrative and secretive businesses, has relied on for more than 40 years. But it has rarely been put under a microscope, because the industry will not divulge the costs of researching and developing a particular drug.
To shed light on the subject, The New York Times examined Xalatan, from its genesis in Dr. Bito's laboratory to its arrival in the medicine cabinets of patients in 57 countries. Pharmacia declined to disclose specific financial information about the making of the drug. But through interviews with key participants and an analysis of publicly available documents, the examination found, among other things, that Pharmacia spent no more than $150,000 to buy the rights to Dr. Bito's invention from Columbia. Though it later spent tens of millions of its own money to develop the drug, the company acknowledges that Dr. Bito, with the taxpayers' support, provided it an "uncut diamond" that later became Xalatan.
The industry's reliance on taxpayer-supported research -- characterized as "a subsidy" by the very same economists whose work the industry relies on -- is commonplace, the examination also found. So commonplace, in fact, that one industry expert is now raising questions about the companies' arguments.
The expert, Dr. Nelson Levy, a former head of research and development at Abbott Laboratories, who now works as a consultant for industry and the federal government on drug development, bluntly challenged the industry's oft-repeated cost of developing a drug. "That it costs $500 million to develop a drug," Dr. Levy said in a recent interview, "is a lot of bull."
Finally, the examination found, federal officials have abandoned or ignored policies that could have led to lower prices for medicines developed with taxpayer dollars. That is partly because the government has lost track of what drugs are invented with its money, and partly, officials say, because the industry resisted government efforts to get involved in pricing.
As Dr. Bernadine Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a recent interview, "We sold away government research so cheap."
 
Going Against the Standard
Like many scientific discoveries, the invention of Xalatan began with a hunch. It was the mid-1970's, and Dr. Bito, a hard-driving researcher who bucked the eye-research establishment with his unconventional ideas about glaucoma treatment, had been named an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University.
Born in Budapest, he was conscripted into a forced labor coal mining camp at 18. In 1956, the year the Communists quashed a rebellion in his homeland, he escaped, eventually fleeing for the United States. His passion was writing, but he abandoned it for a career in science, particularly the study of the eye.
Dr. Bito was interested in a family of chemicals produced by the body, prostaglandins, and how they might affect the eye, particularly the fluid, known as aqueous humor, that nourishes the cornea and the lens. In glaucoma, the aqueous humor does not drain quickly enough, causing an increase in intraocular pressure inside the eye. This pressure can damage the optic nerve, causing vision loss and ultimately blindness.
 An estimated two million Americans have glaucoma, and every year, 120,000 Americans go blind from the disease. The elderly, African-Americans, and people with family histories of the disease are at greatest risk. Glaucoma is often called "the sneak thief of sight." Often, by the time the patient notices vision loss, glaucoma can only be halted, not reversed.
When Dr. Bito began his research, ophthalmologists had already concluded that prostaglandins raised intraocular pressure, and were therefore dangerous. But Dr. Bito, along with a student at Columbia Medical School, Carl Camras, suspected otherwise; they thought that if prostaglandins were given in extremely small doses, they could actually reduce the pressure.
In 1977, after a series of studies on the eyes of rabbits, they published a paper showing just that. "It was blasphemy," Dr. Camras said.
Dr. Bito continued the work with monkeys, cats, and even himself, squirting the chemical in his own eye to gauge how much redness and irritation it caused. The studies were paid for by the National Eye Institute, a branch of the health institutes.
Within weeks of the cat experiment's conclusion in 1982, administrators at Columbia University had steered Dr. Bito to a patent lawyer; in May of that year, he applied for a patent.
It felt strange, he said, but it signified the changing culture of the ivory tower. As a professor, Dr. Bito was accustomed to publishing his work in journals and talking about it at scientific meetings. Patenting, to him, represented secrecy, the culture of industry, not academia.
"It was looked down on," Dr. Bito said. "It was too commercial."
 
Law Behind the Companies
Commerce, however, was exactly what Congress had in mind when, in late 1980, it passed legislation that directed federally financed researchers like Dr. Bito to patent their inventions, or risk losing control of them to the government.
Ronald Reagan had just won election on a platform to make America strong again. Japan's electronic industry was out-competing the United States in its own backyard. Determined not to lose, Congress passed Public Law 96-517, known as the Bayh-Dole Act after Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas.
The law was designed to push federally financed research from the university laboratory into the marketplace. Scientists who made discoveries using taxpayer money were required to file invention reports with the government. Universities were directed to license patented inventions to companies that would commercialize them.
The law was originally passed to aid small businesses, but later it was modified so that even big companies like Pharmacia could benefit. If a company did not develop a product quickly enough, the government could revoke the company's license and hand the job over to a competitor. It could also take control of an invention to alleviate "health or safety needs," the law said.
Once an invention is on the market, the law grants the government the right to buy it without paying customary royalties. At the same time, say patent experts in the Clinton administration and at the National Science Foundation, other laws enable federal agencies to put taxpayer-financed inventions out to competitive bidding. For example, the government, which buys Xalatan, could give companies other than Pharmacia the opportunity to manufacture the eyedrop and sell it at a lower price -- but only to the government.
So, these experts say, the Bayh-Dole law, in conjunction with other provisions, could result in lower drug prices for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, two major purchasers of medicines.
But in the 20 years since the Bayh-Dole bill became law, the government has not taken advantage of these provisions, say officials at the health institutes. One reason, said Dr. Wendy Baldwin, a deputy director at the agency, is that the government already buys drugs cheaply by purchasing them in bulk. But even if federal officials wanted to use the Bayh-Dole Act to get medicines at still cheaper prices, they could not because they do not keep track of products, including drugs, that are invented with taxpayer money.
That failure has drawn criticism from the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, which last year conducted a review of the government's invention reporting system. "Inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent," the accounting office concluded.
Also, last year, a preliminary report by the inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services found that as many as 22 percent of discoveries financed by the health institutes were not reported by universities, as is required. More than 2,000 inventions developed with government money were reported to the health institutes last year, but Dr. Baldwin and other agency officials said in interviews that they had no idea which, if any, companies had licensed those inventions, or how they were being used.
As for the issue of what consumers pay for drugs, the health institutes has concluded it should stay out of it. When Dr. Healy was director of the agency in the early 1990's, she insisted that companies interested in developing drugs that had been invented by government scientists sign contracts agreeing to "reasonable pricing" for those medicines.
The companies balked at the reasonable-pricing clause. "I was persona non grata for it," said Dr. Healy, who now heads the American Red Cross. The provision was dropped in 1995 by Dr. Harold Varmus, her successor; at the time, he said the policy was discouraging collaboration by driving industry away.
In the end, said Dr. Baldwin, the official designated by the N.I.H. to answer questions for this article, taxpayers may not get lower drug prices. Still, she said: "The current policies are actually bringing drugs to market. It's a huge advance, a wonderful accomplishment."
 
Going Abroad for Help
If the federal government leaves it to companies to decide how much consumers pay for taxpayer-backed inventions, universities are even less concerned about the prices. The Bayh-Dole Act has meant a windfall in revenues from licensing and royalties for them, none more than Columbia.
Last year, Columbia earned $96 million in licensing fees and royalties under the Bayh-Dole law, ranking it first among universities in royalties from inventions, said Jack Granowitz, who runs Columbia's program to commercialize university inventions. Roughly $20 million of that money was from Xalatan; one-fifth goes to Dr. Bito and the university keeps the rest.
When Dr. Bito first filed his patent application in 1982, no drug company in the United States would touch it; most glaucoma experts remembered well the studies showing prostaglandins could only hurt people with the disease. Dr. Bito recalled: "They said, 'It's crazy. You can't put prostaglandins in the eye.' "
So Dr. Bito approached another Hungarian eye researcher who knew people at Pharmacia, at the time one of Sweden's largest drug companies. (The company, now of Peapack, N.J., has since undergone two mergers, one with Upjohn in 1995, and another this year, with Monsanto.) Within a year, Dr. Bito said, Pharmacia had bought exclusive rights to his idea, paying Columbia between $100,000 and $150,000. The government received no fees; the law did not require it.
For Pharmacia, which was already marketing a cataract therapy developed by Dr. Bito's Hungarian friend, it was a nice fit. It was also a way for the company to hedge the risky bets it made on drug development.
The industry's own studies show that drug research is riskiest in the early stages, when a company has no way to tell if a given compound is a blockbuster or a dud. The companies often build on basic scientific findings that emerge from taxpayer-financed studies, underwriting the applied science themselves. But in some cases, as with Xalatan, those studies actually produce a practical discovery that can be licensed, allowing companies to step in when profits seem more assured.
No one knows precisely how many medicines result from such licensing arrangements, but they are not unusual. For example, Trusopt, a glaucoma eyedrop by Merck, was taken to the market in similar fashion, after researchers at the University of Florida, with backing from the National Eye Institute, discovered how to convert a related drug from pill to drop form. As Dr. Carl Kupfer, the institute's director, said, "A pharmaceutical company wouldn't take over the drug unless the animal testing looked very feasible."
Still, Pharmacia was hardly getting a finished product. "An uncut diamond" is how Dr. Harfstrand described Dr. Bito's work. Using the natural prostaglandins Dr. Bito had identified, Pharmacia had the task of developing a synthetic molecule that could be given safely to people.
It was a tall order. As Dr. Bito well knew from squirting the chemicals into his own eyes, the prostaglandins caused redness and irritation. One of Sweden's leading eye experts, Dr. Anders Bill, remembered informing the company that Dr. Bito's idea was "next to ridiculous," and giving it only a 5 percent chance of success. The drug industry's trade association says for every 250 compounds that emerge from a laboratory to enter this kind of pre-clinical testing, only one makes it to market.
By 1985, two years into the Pharmacia's contract with Columbia, the company's research was progressing slowly. Dr. Bito persuaded Mr. Granowitz to write a letter to the company reminding it that, under the Bayh-Dole law, the government could step in and take control of the invention. The next year, Pharmacia hired a new manager for the project, a Swedish pharmacologist, Johan Stjernschantz.
By 1988, Dr. Stjernschantz had found what Pharmacia was looking for: a family of chemical cousins to Dr. Bito's prostaglandins that also lowered pressure but without the troubling irritation. From this family, Dr. Stjernschantz said, he selected latanaprost, the key ingredient for the compound that would later take the trade name Xalatan.
The uncut diamond was now a sparkling gem.
 
Government's Silent Role
How much was Dr. Bito's government-supported work worth to Pharmacia? Only company officials know, and they won't say.
That kind of secrecy is typical, making it difficult for outsiders to examine drug pricing issues. Nonetheless, experts characterize work like Dr. Bito's as an extremely valuable subsidy for a business that is already receiving government help in other areas, such as tax credits for research and development.
Dr. Levy, the former Abbott Laboratories executive, says preclinical research could account for as much as 20 to 25 percent of a company's research and development budget for a particular drug.
"N.I.H.-supported research represents a subsidy to pharmaceutical development," said Dr. Louis Lasagna, an expert in drug development at Tufts University whose studies are widely cited by the industry. "But you need a midwife, the companies, to bring it to market."
The word subsidy, not surprisingly, rankles drug industry officials, who say other businesses, including the medical device industry, also benefit from public science.
Yet it is clear that the government plays an important, and an increasing, role in drug development, both through inventions like Dr. Bito's and more basic scientific research on which the companies can build. A 1995 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that, of the 14 new drugs the industry identified as the most medically significant in the preceding 25 years, 11 had their roots in studies paid for by the government.
"The general pattern is that industry is building enormously heavily on basic research supported by N.I.H.," said Dr. Francis Narin, president of C.H.I. Research, a consulting firm that has analyzed patents as a way of measuring the role public science plays in industry.
In a 1997 study commissioned by the National Science Foundation, C.H.I. looked at the most significant scientific research papers cited in medicine patents. It found that half the cited studies were paid for with United States public funds, primarily from government and academia; only 17 percent were paid for by industry. (The rest came from public and private foreign sources.)
And in a study with the National Eye Institute, published in 1996, C.H.I. found that 41 percent of patented eye-care technology was linked to research financed by the health institutes, including Dr. Bito's studies, which have been cited in 15 patents, including Xalatan's.
"I think that is very typical," Dr. Narin said of Dr. Bito's work. "If you find any good advanced biomedical patent, and you look at its science references, most of them are going to be public," meaning from publicly financed research.
The industry's estimate for the average cost of developing a drug -- $500 million -- is drawn from a study published in 1991 by Dr. Lasagna and Dr. Joseph DiMasi, an economist at Tufts, and adjusted to reflect inflation and the additional testing drug companies have begun doing to obtain F.D.A. approval for their medicines. Only a small percentage of the $500 million represents the actual cost of developing a particular medicine, Dr. DiMasi said. The rest is the cost is attributed to lost opportunities: years spent going down scientific "dry holes" and research money that could have generated interest had it been invested instead.
Dr. Levy, the drug development expert, says the Bayh-Dole law has altered that equation. In the past, Dr. Levy said, "academia was coming up with concepts, not molecules" for drug development. Today, university scientists are more commercially oriented; many are spinning off their own biotech companies to develop their ideas. That, in turn, has enabled companies like Pharmacia to shift resources away from in-house research and development and toward outside collaborations, a strategy known as "external innovation."
For instance, Pharmacia shut down Dr. Stjernschantz' prostaglandin lab after Xalatan went on the market in 1996, instead giving Dr. Stjernschantz a grant to continue his research at a nearby university. And last year, Pharmacia spent $650 million to buy Sugen, a biotech concern in San Francisco that is collaborating with the National Cancer Institute on clinical trials of its two leading drugs. The company's co-founder, Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, is a New York University scientist whose initial financing included a nine-year grant from the cancer institute, N.I.H. records show.
So the pharmaceutical companies have become more efficient, in part because university researchers are more efficient. As Dr. Levy put it, the companies are "not having to dig as many dry holes."
 
Drawback in Development
Once Dr. Stjernschantz had identified the latanaprost molecule, Pharmacia needed a place to produce it in large amounts for testing in people. It takes 110 raw materials, 32 separate chemical reactions and three months to make a batch of latanaprost, and few companies had the technical know-how.
Among those that did was the Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical Works, in Dr. Bito's hometown, Budapest. The 88-year-old company, owned until recently by the Hungarian Communist government, sits hard by the railroad tracks in a drab corner of the city, a vast array of 100 low-slung buildings connected by a maze of steel pipes.
Dr. Bito knew Chinoin's chemists well. He introduced them to officials at Pharmacia, and after some testy east-west negotiations, clinical trials were under way by the early 1990's in three countries, with Chinoin producing the key ingredient.
Dr. Camras, the young medical student who worked with Dr. Bito at Columbia, was brought in to run the United States arm of the final study; by this time he had become an ophthalmologist, with an academic appointment at the University of Nebraska.
Human testing is typically the most expensive part of the drug development process. Clinical trials usually consist of three phases; the first study tests safety and looks for the proper dose; if the drug is safe, it moves to the second phase to test effectiveness in a limited number of patients. The costliest clinical trial is the last one, the large Phase 3 study to prove the drug is safe and effective, proof that is necessary for the Food and Drug Administration approval. Depending on the drug and the amount of medical care involved, experts say the cost of a Phase 3 trial can range from $10,000 to $20,000 per patient.
The Phase 3 study of Xalatan was relatively small, just 829 people. The company will not say what it spent on that study, or any other. But Dr. Stjernschantz, the project manager, said the total costs for all trials was significantly less than $30 million, an estimate that, a Columbia researcher said, Pharmacia provided to the university before the testing had begun.
The trials gave the company precisely what it was looking for: proof that Xalatan, given once a day, lowered intraocular pressure as much as the gold standard of glaucoma treatment, timolol.
But the studies turned up a worrisome, and unique, side effect: Xalatan caused 7.2 percent of patients' eyes to darken, changing from blue or green to brown. The company nearly pulled the plug on the project. "That was a very terrible crisis," Dr. Stjernschantz said.
In the end, the pigmentation issue led to less-than-wholehearted backing from the F.D.A., which approved the drug on June 6, 1996, with a caveat: Xalatan, it said, should be used only as backup therapy when all other drugs have failed, and not as a "first-line" treatment. It was a setback, but hardly a fatal one.
Today, Xalatan is approved for sale around the world, from the United States to Japan, Australia and all across Europe. The key ingredient is still being manufactured at Chinoin in Budapest, although the Hungarian company has since become a subsidiary of Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical giant.
The Chinoin-Pharmacia partnership has been a profitable one. Chinoin is making a 50 percent return on its prostaglandin investment, company officials said. And Pharmacia pays Chinoin slightly more than $5 million a year for the manufacturing of latanaprost, said Tibor Szabo, who directs the prostaglandin business unit at Chinoin.
That amounts to roughly one one-hundredth of Xalatan's $507 million in annual sales last year. Or, to put it another way, the cost of making the key ingredient is just 1 percent of the revenue Xalatan generates.
 
Pricing Around the World
Between Dr. Bito, the National Institutes of Health and Pharmacia, 20 years and many millions of dollars were spent getting Xalatan to a point where it could be sold to the public. But those costs bear little relationship to the price of the drug.
Nor is the price based on what the company spends to make and sell Xalatan, which includes not only the $5 million paid to Chinoin but also the cost of diluting, bottling and shipping the drug, the royalties paid to Columbia, and other costs, such as marketing.
Globally, there can be scores of prices for the same drug, as Xalatan shows.
In the United States, where there are no government restrictions, the basic price set by the company is determined by what the market will bear, taking into consideration the competition, the drug's side effects, and the patient population.
Xalatan is the first and only prostaglandin-based glaucoma drug, which gives it a competitive edge. It is taken only once a day; other drops must be taken more often. And aside from the eye pigmentation, it has fewer side effects. In the United States, the company sells the drug for about $36 a bottle wholesale, far more expensive than the cheapest generic, but roughly in line with other brand-name glaucoma medications, according to industry data and experts.
That price changes from customer to customer. Large health maintenance organizations, as well as the government, can often wring discounts out of manufacturers, while people with no prescription drug coverage must pay the full price. The Department of Veterans Affairs, for instance, pays $25 a bottle for Xalatan, about half what uninsured patients like Mr. Russell pay. And there are even different prices within the government; smaller federal agencies pay $29 a bottle for Xalatan.
Overseas, price controls make for a different story.
In Dr. Bito's home country, Hungary, where the government pays for approved medications, Pharmacia receives a negotiated price of $17.50 a bottle for Xalatan, said Katalin Szutrely, who runs Pharmacia's Hungarian branch. Because the drug is so costly, she said, obtaining government approval to market it was difficult. One selling point was Dr. Bito himself. "We were proud of him being the inventor," she said, "and we used his name."
That does not mean the drug is reaching a lot of patients in Hungary. A panel of Hungarian eye doctors recommended Xalatan as a first-line treatment, Ms. Szutrely said, but the government pays for it only when doctors can prove all other eyedrops have failed. As Ms. Szutrely said, "If you don't have the reimbursement, you cannot sell the drug."
Back in Washington, the debate revolves around dueling sets of statistics about why Americans often pay more. Some say the price of new medicines is driving up health care costs. Kaiser Permanente, the health maintenance organization, says it spent $4.7 million on glaucoma drugs in 1995, the year before Xalatan was introduced. Last year, Kaiser's expenditures for glaucoma reached $20.4 million, $9 million of it on Xalatan.
To counter such numbers, industry officials argue that Xalatan and other new medicines may be saving money as well, by reducing the need for doctors' visits and also for surgery. At the same time, they say the American free market provides the companies with the profits they need to plow back into research, so that patients can benefit from the next generation of drugs like Xalatan.
"I'm worried about low prices in Europe," Dr. Harfstrand said. "It discourages innovation."
And because more prescription drugs are made and sold in the United States than any other country, the thought of regulation is especially troubling to the companies. In the case of Xalatan, for instance, more than half the drug's sales are in the United States.
"The U.S. has been the only major free market for pharmaceuticals," Fred Hassan, Pharmacia's chief executive, said in a company newsletter last fall, "and that has benefited patients as well as our industry."
 
Science vs. Selling
As Xalatan's inventor, Dr. Bito likes to think of the drug as a triumph of science. But at Pharmacia, they speak proudly of Xalatan as a triumph of marketing.
The F.D.A.'s recommendation of Xalatan as only a backup therapy presented a considerable challenge to the company: How to persuade doctors to turn to their drug before other glaucoma medications. The company pursued an aggressive strategy, according to the drug agency's records and interviews with eye doctors, leaving the impression but not stating explicitly that Xalatan should be considered as a first-line therapy. The drug's growing sales suggest the strategy has worked; in an advertisement announcing its merger with Monsanto, Pharmacia proudly called Xalatan "the new gold standard for treatment of glaucoma."
Company documents show Pharmacia spent 40 percent of its overall revenue on marketing and administrative expenses last year, more than twice what it spent on research. In the last year alone, it increased its global sales force by 30 percent to 6,500 people, including scores of "detail men" who make door-to-door visits to doctors. Last year, company officials say, those detail men gave away more than a million free samples of Xalatan to doctors.
Companies gauge a product's success by its gross-profit margin -- the money left from sales after expenses, but before taxes. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association says only three out of 10 medicines recover their research and development costs. But those that do, like Xalatan, can be hugely profitable.
A reconstruction of Xalatan's profitability, based on outside experts and company documents, suggests its profit margin is likely higher than the company's average of 76 percent, perhaps as high as 90 percent. The company, however, will not talk about Xalatan's earnings.
As Dr. Harfstrand said, "We never comment on gross margins on individual products."
 
Easy and Effective
To spend a day in the examining room with Dr. Harry Quigley, director of the glaucoma service at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University, is to see why Xalatan is popular with both doctors and patients. As one of the nation's best-known eye specialists, Dr. Quigley sees as many as 40 patients on any given day, and these days, it seems, he is prescribing Xalatan to most.
He likes the drug for the obvious reason: It reduces intraocular pressure. His patients like it, too; in interviews, several said it caused less redness and irritation than other glaucoma drops, and they preferred its once-a-day formula. Other drugs to combat glaucoma must be taken as often as four times a day. For Dr. Quigley, convenience is hardly a side issue; the once-a-day regimen, he said, means patients are more likely to take their eyedrops.
In October of 1996, a few months after Xalatan was on pharmacy shelves, Dr. Quigley prescribed it to Mr. Russell, the retired optician, who is blind in his right eye and nearly blind in the left. The drug worked to perfection, lowering Mr. Russell's intraocular pressure to well within normal range. "It was fantastic," he said.
The only problem was the price. "Forty-five bucks," Mr. Russell exclaimed, cradling a bottle of Xalatan in his hand. "I flinch every time I think about it."
Like many older people, Mr. Russell takes other medications that run up his monthly prescription drug bill. For a time, he said, he paid out of pocket for Xalatan. Then his wife, Millie, discovered that Pharmacia runs a prescription assistance program for patients with "short-term financial hardship." Under the program, the company provides drugs, with patients typically making a $5 co-payment to the pharmacy, for six months, and then patients can reapply.
Mr. Russell was approved for the program. But last August, he received a letter from Pharmacia telling him his discounted supply of Xalatan would run out in November, and urging him to find another, more permanent, way to pay for the drug.
But Mr. Russell did not have another way to pay. So Dr. Quigley proposed an alternative that Medicare would pay for: surgery to lower the intraocular pressure. It was not the optimal solution, Dr. Quigley said, because Mr. Russell's glaucoma was well controlled with the drops and the operation meant a two to three percent risk that he would lose sight in his only good eye, plus a continuing risk of infection.
"The best way to take care of Mr. Russell would have been to continue his medications," the doctor said. "That was not practical, so we did the next best thing."
For Dr. Quigley, the situation was hardly extraordinary. Too many of his patients, he said, are "being forced to choose between paying the rent, buying food and taking expensive medicine." And he is irritated that Pharmacia offers patients only short-term help. "If somebody is going to start taking medication," he said, "they are going to need it indefinitely, and they are unlikely to be poor for only 6 or 12 months."
Also troubled is Dr. J. William Doyle, a University of Florida ophthalmologist who has studied company assistance programs and found them often inaccessible to patients. "It's a hassle," he said, and many patients choose cheaper, less effective medicines rather than jumping through the bureaucratic hoops necessary to get drugs at reduced prices.
At Pharmacia, officials will not divulge information about how many patients receive help from the medication assistance program, or how much the company spends on in it.
Mr. Russell, for one, says he is quite familiar with the pharmaceutical industry's arguments about the cost of prescription drugs, and he does not believe them.
"They say the extra price is for research," he said. "That's hard to believe."
Though it is not the most often-prescribed glaucoma drug, Xalatan brought in more revenue last year than any of its competitors, and was Pharmacia's best-selling product prior to the company's merger with Monsanto. Pharmacia, which had $7 billion in revenue last year, before the merger, forecasts $750 million in annual sales for Xalatan by 2002. But the patent is due to expire in 2011, according to the company, and competitors are busy developing rival products. Pharmacia is busy, too; it is already seeking F.D.A. approval of a new product, a combination of Xalatan and timolol, the leading generic competitor, that could extend the life of the patent.
As for Dr. Bito, he has closed down his lab at Columbia and is back in Budapest, living in a spacious apartment with high ceilings and wood floors and a large picture window that looks out on the Roman Catholic church he attended as a boy. Despite the millions he has earned from Xalatan, he lives relatively modestly, driving around hills above the Danube in an 18-year-old Russian car. He has finally achieved his dream of becoming a novelist; his latest book, "Abraham & Isaac," has made the best-seller list in Hungary.

HEADLINE: THE ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE: THE SCENE;
Police Fire Tear Gas as Hundreds of Angry Protesters Take to the Streets in Miami

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO and FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 22

 BODY:
Outraged that Elian Gonzalez was taken from them, hundreds of Cuban-American protesters took to a major road here today, burning tires and throwing rocks as police officers in riot gear moved in, firing tear gas and making hundreds of arrests.
Roaming along Flagler Street, a four-lane avenue that cuts east-west through Little Havana not far from the house where 6-year-old Elian had stayed, the demonstrators overturned Dumpsters and threw old appliances and garbage into the street. The police initially appeared to fall back along the perimeter of the troubled streets, allowing the protesters, many of them young Cuban-Americans carrying Cuban flags and placards denouncing the Clinton Administration, to slow traffic. 
 But by midmorning, officers wearing riot helmets had moved in from several directions along Flagler, banging their protective shields in warning as they walked forward. The police then fired and heaved tear-gas canisters at protesters, many of whom responded by throwing rocks and hurling profanities at the police. The Associated Press reported that more than 260 people had been arrested by tonight.
"Get out of here, out of here," one man screamed as the police, menacing in black, ran toward a group of demonstrators in the early afternoon at Flagler and 30th Avenue, where dozens of protesters had set fire to a pile of tires. "You don't belong, this is our home."
With the acrid smoke from burning tires and tear gas filling the air, dozens of people ran into parking lots and alleyways, down the narrow side streets and into the small apartment buildings that line Flagler. "Dogs! Dogs!" yelled one woman as she ran from a cloud of tear gas.
"It's not right to shoot tear gas at people who are in their homes," said Hector Alvarado, 28, holding his shirt over his tearing eyes. "We were arguing with the police, asking for liberty for Elian. Then they came and started firing."
Another protester, Eduardo Santana, said: "They came right at us, shooting tear gas at us. There were children there. The tear gas hurt. I fell right there. I couldn't breathe, but they said, 'Go, get out,' and pushed me back."
Mr. Santana, 48, who held a Cuban flag, added: 'This isn't right. This is our country. We're Cubans, but we're U.S. citizens too."
Many of the protesters, in fact, viewed the police as brutal aggressors, equating their tactics with the ones they said were employed in Communist Cuba. They saved their harshest language for Attorney General Janet Reno, who ordered the operation to remove Elian, and President Clinton, calling them President Fidel Castro's puppets.
"This is not a democracy," yelled Roberto Hernandez, 33, marching west on Flagler as protesters gathered to burn a pile of rubbish and tires. "We want the country to see this is not a democracy, that our government has no respect for us."
What much of the nation saw on television, however, were hordes of young men overturning garbage cans and newspaper boxes and trying to set fire to the debris in the street. Police officers tried to respond as best they could, with squads of officers rushing in unmarked cars from one spot to the next, exiting quickly and throwing tear-gas canisters to disperse crowds and then speeding off. Fire Department crews were also harried, putting out one fire after another, at times being hampered en route by protesters and motorists.
Meanwhile, at the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who had been caring for the boy, protesters from around the neighborhood and beyond gathered to pray and debate what to do next. Some were seething with anger, with one young man burning an American flag.
Others equated the operation to the government's disastrous raid on the compound near Waco, Tex., which had been ordered by Ms. Reno. Several people held up crosses, one with a baby doll nailed to the wood, red paint smeared across its body.
"This is incredible that this happened," Jesus Jorge, 53, muttered, shaking his head. "Clinton and Reno will pay for this in front of God's justice. This is unpardonable."
The political leaders of the city, whose careers flourished with the political and economic strength of the Cuban-American community, left no adjective unturned in their denunciations of Ms. Reno and President Clinton.
"My personal feeling is that what our president of our country and our attorney general ordered was one of the most shameful acts I have ever seen," said Joseph Carollo, the mayor of Miami. "It is one of the most disgraceful and shameful acts in the history of our government."
Yet for all Mayor Carollo's fury, he said that his first concern was "to keep peace in our community." He added: "What I am asking the people of Miami to do is act with their heads, not their hearts. To use their heads and fight within the law." Any violence, he added, "will make Miami the loser, America a bigger loser, and will only benefit the criminal dictator Fidel Castro."
Others expressed relief. Marvin Dunn, the chairman of the psychology department at Florida University and the author of a definitive history of the 1980 riots in Liberty City, a predominantly black Miami neighborhood, said today: "I'm thrilled. It is overdue."
The intensity of the debate over Elian, and the obsessive media coverage, Mr. Dunn said, were "putting this community through a protracted and ugly crisis. I admire Janet Reno for taking action. And I'm very happy for this boy's father."
Mr. Dunn said he believed the confrontation over the boy was "the most divisive event in Miami's history, and a lot of non-Cuban Hispanics have been on the sidelines."

HEADLINE: Edward Logue, Visionary City Planner, Is Remembered

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 22

 BODY:
Undaunted by the fact that he was doing the impossible, Edward J. Logue roared up and down the East Coast from the 1950's to the 1980's like an urban renewal whirlwind, building and rebuilding precincts on which others had given up hope: downtown New Haven, Scollay Square in Boston, Roosevelt Island and Charlotte Street in the South Bronx.
"He was Robert Moses and he was the anti-Robert Moses all at once," said Lawrence P. Goldman, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, speaking of New York's other master builder of the mid-20th century. 
 "He could think as big as Moses," said Mr. Goldman, who once worked for Mr. Logue, "and had no less ability to implement. 'I'm not inclined to generate plans that don't get built' was one of his favorite assertions. But unlike Moses, he was as committed to social transformation as he was to physical development. Roosevelt Island had the most ambitious socioeconomic mix of any new community anywhere in the world."
Mr. Logue died Jan. 27 in his home on Martha's Vineyard at 78. Mr. Goldman and about 200 other friends and former colleagues gathered here today for a memorial service at Faneuil Hall, restored as part of Mr. Logue's "Walkway to the Sea," within sight of the monumental Government Center complex that supplanted ragtag Scollay Square in the mid-1960's, under his watch.
Those colleagues had been Young Turks at a time when "urban renewal" was a promise, not a threat. And now their hair matches the pewter walls and chalk-white columns of the meeting room where they joined to say goodbye to their mentor.
They came from an era when city planners thought big, not just in physical scale but in social ambition, believing that good architecture made good neighborhoods, and that economic integration made even better neighborhoods; and when they possessed -- for better and worse -- the political capital necessary to override community opposition.
Mr. Logue was the development administrator of New Haven from 1954 to 1960, development administrator of the Boston Redevelopment Authority from 1961 to 1967, president and chief executive of the New York State Urban Development Corporation from 1968 to 1975 and president of the South Bronx Development Organization from 1978 to 1985.
It was not a bloodless administrator who was being recalled today, however, but a robust and pugnacious man whose convictions, constitution and language were always strong. It was not so much the successful builder of 33,000 housing units statewide but the gambler who tried -- and failed -- to develop 900 low-income apartments in Westchester County.
It was young Lieutenant Logue of the Army Air Force in World War II, a bombardier in the skies over southern Italy, with a view of entire cities below him. "That experience afforded Ed a sense of vision," said Msgr. Michael F. Groden, director of the planning office for urban affairs in the Archdiocese of Boston, "a sense of the big picture that would serve him well."
Critics of Mr. Logue's tactics would see the same image in a far less benign light. "Logue tosses people and small businesses around ruthlessly," the urban analyst Jane Jacobs said in 1970. Mr. Logue and his allies always dismissed such charges, invoking his motto of "planning with people."
But there was no question that he was not a man to stand on niceties. Or business as usual. Or zoning. Or bureaucratic oversight.
In Boston, Mayor John F. Collins armed Mr. Logue with broad, centralized powers. Mr. Logue used that latitude to hire inventive architects for an untraditional Government Center. City Hall, with its honeycomb concrete facade looming like a great inverted pyramid, was downright revolutionary.
"It is the function of distinguished architecture and imaginative civic design to see that beauty is the hallmark of the renewed city," Mr. Logue said in 1967.
You would still get a debate as to whether Government Center is beautiful. But Anthony Lewis, a columnist for The New York Times, attested to the allure of this reinvigorated city. "I came back to this country from London in 1973, and the Times publisher let me choose where I would live," he said. "I chose Boston: Ed Logue's Boston."
In 1968, having lost a mayoral campaign here, Mr. Logue was invited to meet Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York to discuss a new kind of agency, the Urban Development Corporation, that was to build affordable housing and create jobs.
"Is this corporation going to be subject to local rules, zoning and codes?" Mr. Logue asked Mr. Rockefeller and Stephen Lefkowitz, then a lawyer for the state and now a partner at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, who recounted the story in an interview.
"Of course," the New Yorkers answered.
"Then it's no damn good," Mr. Logue replied, waving his hand. "It's not going to mean a damn thing. You've got to bypass all that." After Mr. Logue left, the governor turned to Mr. Lefkowitz and said:
"Well, that's what we've got to do. Do it."
Granted powers of eminent domain, exemption from local zoning and the ability to sell its own bonds, the U.D.C. (now the Empire State Development Corporation) undertook 115 housing projects across the state, including three entire "new towns," the most famous being Roosevelt Island, into which residents started moving in 1975.
On an East River island that had been home to hospitals, insane asylums and prisons, Mr. Logue proposed an entirely new, socially and economically integrated community of 18,000 people, saying he wanted to prove he could get "people of different income levels to live harmoniously and send their children to the same schools."
Equally compelling for many who knew Mr. Logue was the effort to build low-income apartments in Westchester, 100 in each of nine towns, including Bedford and Somers. Furious resistance met the plan. Just before one town hearing, word reached Mr. Logue's office that a death threat had been received.
Mr. Logue went anyway, recalled Richard A. Kahan, who was to head the U.D.C. himself one day but was then a fledgling staff member. Arriving at the meeting hall, Mr. Logue "took the most prominent position, folded his arms and sat down like Buddha," Mr. Kahan said in an interview. "I thought, 'This is courage.' "
But the nine-towns plan foundered and led to a dilution by the Legislature of the corporation's broad powers. Worse was in store. By 1975, it was bankrupt, and Mr. Logue resigned.
As head of the South Bronx agency, Mr. Logue was no longer armed with sweeping power, said Mitchell Sviridoff, former president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation. "This was to be bare knuckles, hand-to-hand combat," he said, in remarks read by Allan R. Talbot, a friend. Still, Mr. Logue built 90 ranch houses with backyards and picket fences, owned by the people who lived in them, on what had been rubble land.
Mr. Talbot brought the voice of Mr. Logue into Faneuil Hall by reading from a 1982 letter written after Mr. Logue had been told that a certain City Planning Department official was blocking an industrial project on East 174th Street in the Bronx.
After several scathingly sarcastic paragraphs, Mr. Logue wound up, "I concluded that the information I got was all wrong and that there was some screw-up and you were being unfairly blamed.
"I know you would never hold up the mayor's top industrial priority in the entire city," he wrote, finishing the sentence with a dismissive vulgarism.
He continued: "I know you will be for the project, and if you have any questions, you would of course call me. I am readily reachable by phone. I know, through no fault of your own, of course, that you never are, because I have tried so many times.
"My very best wishes."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Knicks-Lakers Series Would Thrill N.B.A.

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Phil Jackson sidled up to an NBC producer nearly a month ago and offered up a rhetorical proposition: "I bet you guys would love to see the Knicks and the Lakers in the finals, wouldn't you?"
The producer smiled at the Lakers' coach and left it at that. No use adding to the conspiracy theories harbored by dozens of small-market fans who think their Pacers, Jazz or Spurs won't get a referee's call when it matters most. 
 In New York, too, they will be crying foul -- the moment Vince Carter is sent to the free-throw line because Latrell Sprewell breathed on him in the final seconds of a tight game. After all, Carter, the skywalking Raptor forward, was pictured in all his airbrushed glory this week on the cover of ESPN Magazine with the heading: "Must See VC."
In fact, Carter and players with flair and panache like Sacramento's Jason Williams and Chris Webber generate better ratings, just as genuine rivalries like New York-Los Angeles generate more fan interest. And at a time when numbers have dipped considerably, the National Basketball Association and its broadcast partners are dying for viewers.
But the idea that someone is pulling strings in either the N.B.A. or NBC corporate offices seems a bit of a reach.
"It always amazes me every year there's this conspiracy to get certain teams into the finals or the conference finals for ratings or whatever, and I think that takes away so much," Doug Collins, the NBC analyst and former coach, said last week. "I've never been one to believe that. Maybe I'm naive, but I think that puts a World Wrestling Federation mentality on a sport that I think has a lot of integrity. I hate to see that come up all the time: 'NBC wants so-and-so in the finals so they can get ratings.' "
Just the same, someone out there needs to start watching more regularly if the league plans to return to the sweeping popularity it enjoyed in the late 1980's and early 1990's. In 34 NBC telecasts this season, ratings dipped 21 percent below those for last season's 28 telecasts. Since Michael Jordan retired before the 1998-99 season started, ratings are down 29 percent.
Jackson might be understating the possibility. Knicks-Lakers may not only be good for the league and network -- it may be necessary.
"I think it would be great," Lakers forward Robert Horry said. "Hopefully it would bring a lot of happiness back to the N.B.A. Because right now, it doesn't seem like the N.B.A. is too happy. They're trying to bring some happiness back. Cameras in the locker rooms. Cameras at the end of practice. Microphones everywhere. After a while, something has to give. Maybe it's us in the finals."
 
Hill, Duncan and Economics
 Grant Hill recently laughed at the notion that he was recruiting his friend and Olympic teammate, Tim Duncan, to join up in Orlando next season after the two become free agents in the summer.
"I heard someone said I was calling him on the cell phone, lobbying him," Hill said. "I don't even think Tim owns a cell phone."
Duncan, meanwhile, shot down another rumor that the Spurs had offered their All-Star center a four-year contract to keep him in San Antonio until after the 2003-4 season.
When their respective teams are knocked out of the playoffs, the speculation and rumors about Hill and Duncan will grow exponentially. Especially because the two share the same attorney, Lon Babby.
"It all sounds plausible, but nothing is on the table from anyone," Babby said Friday afternoon by telephone from his Washington office. "People can guess all they want and some will probably be right. But it's really a nonissue with both Grant and Tim right now."
Babby said he will sit down with Hill and Duncan independently after the season. Orlando and Chicago are the major players in the free-agent market, having cleared millions in salary-cap room to lure the top players. But the Pistons and the Spurs can negotiate more lucrative deals to retain their franchise players.
Hill is the more likely to leave in a potential sign-and-trade deal, especially if the Pistons fall short in the first round again.
"The way it'll work is, I'll give them packets analyzing a team's strength, salary-cap history and whether they're better off with a short-term or long-term deal," Babby said. "It'll have what cities have fewer taxes and which ones tax heavily. But the answer right now to the question 'Are they leaning anywhere?' is no. Not that they've told me."
There is one player in line for a substantial pay raise this off-season. Shaquille O'Neal is about to reap another windfall. He is expected to take advantage of a contract-extension clause in his seven-year, $121 million deal this summer, a possible three-year extension that could land him an additional $76 million.
The way the raise-increase works for players whose contracts were grandfathered into the collective bargaining agreement signed last year is this: You can get a 5 percent raise over the last year of your current deal. In O'Neal's case, that would make his salary nearly $23 million. In the next two years, players are entitled to a 12.5 percent raise over the last year of their deal.
If the Lakers offer the maximum and O'Neal accepts as expected, he would earn $24.15 million in the 2003-4 season, $25.875 million in the 2004-5 season and another $25.875 million in 2005-6 -- at 34. With the current rules, only Kevin Garnett stands to make more over the next decade.
O'Neal said his agent, Leonard Armato, convinced him to renegotiate after four years rather than just sign for the long term. He was able to exercise an escape clause with Orlando in 1996. "That's where a lot of veterans messed up and didn't realize the economics had changed," O'Neal said. "Like Karl Malone. When they first started giving out big money, Malone said, 'O.K., I'll take 10 years with no outs.' Scottie Pippen did the same thing. Then when the money game changed, those guys were upset about the deals they had. Oh well."
 
Better Stats Through Rules
Whether a migration of underskilled underclassmen was to blame or merely a heavy concentration on defense, the aesthetic quality of the N.B.A. has taken its hits over the last few years. The mix of bruising and sometimes bad play has resulted in low scores, fewer offensive possessions and eyesores on the court.
But the rule changes implemented this year to prevent much of the chucking and grabbing by defensive players have apparently made for at least a more appealing product.
For the first time in three years, scoring and field-goal percentage improved.
"I don't know if the rules had everything to do with it, but that's what people have always wanted to see -- a more wide-open game," the Lakers' Kobe Bryant said recently.
"For so long, the Eastern Conference was all about who could stop who on defense. Now, you look at Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Eddie Jones, Sprewell; they have some real athletes out there. Things are changing."

HEADLINE: Peaceful, Easy Feeling Imbues 30th Earth Day

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Under the banner of clean energy, Earth Day participants today celebrated in the nation's capital and at thousands of events around the globe in an extravaganza of entertainment, advocacy and politics.
Environmentalists and supporters participated in events in 183 countries for the 30th Earth Day. 
 Thousands of people gathered peacefully at the Mall in Washington, less than a week after hundreds of demonstrators were arrested here, protesting the global activities of international lending agencies. Among other things, those protesters had objected to the environmental policies of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Today's rallies were organized by the Seattle-based Earth Day Network, whose chairman, Denis Hayes, was the national coordinator for the 1970 event.
The teach-ins and rallies of that original Earth Day, more informal and less global, helped inaugurate the modern environmental movement in the United States and was the spark for two landmark environmental laws signed by President Richard M. Nixon, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
In his radio address today, President Clinton announced two new but relatively modest initiatives to combat global warming and celebrate Earth Day. Mr. Clinton said he was going to require federal agencies to reduce by 20 percent over five years the amount of gasoline their vehicle fleets consume. This would save 45 million gallons of oil a year.
Mr. Clinton also announced a program to allow Federal workers to set aside up to $65 tax-free every month to pay for public transportation.
'While the science on climate change has grown stronger, and the need for American leadership has grown greater, some in Congress have buried their heads even deeper in the sand," he said.
Vice President Al Gore struck a softer chord in his address on the Mall.
He welcomed "the bipartisan talks on Capitol Hill" and spoke of giving "industry the flexibility" to meet environmental goals.
In a starched blue work shirt with the Capitol behind him, Mr. Gore pressed his campaign message that preserving the environment did not have to interfere with expanding the economy. "The environment and the economy go together," he told the crowd. "What's good for one is good for the other."
He plugged his 1992 book, "Earth in the Balance," which has been reissued with a new forward by Mr. Gore to coincide with Earth Day. And he drew attention to his controversial contention in that book that the nation could end its dependence on the internal combustion engine in 25 years.
"Today, that's conventional wisdom," he said. "The Big Three auto makers are working on concept cars that produce absolutely no greenhouse gas emissions whatsoever. They know that it's not extreme but mainstream to champion cleaner fuels. And they know that protecting the environment is the right thing to do; it will create jobs, not destroy jobs, and save the Earth as we know it in the process."
Still, Mr. Gore has been careful and was today in pressing his environmentalist views, in part because he is trying to woo supporters in the traditionally Republican business community.
Dressed in a starched blue work shirt, Mr. Gore used the rally as an opportunity to reinforce his campaign message that preserving the environment did not have to interfere with expanding the economy. "The environment and the economy go together," he said.
Today's celebration in Washington, called EarthFair 2000, was not politically diverse. The speakers who accepted invitations tended to be Democratic and liberal. (Organizers said the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, declined an invitation to speak.)
But the rally's loosely organized format made for some interesting contrasts.
The loudest cheers during Mr. Gore' eight-minute speech came as he mentioned the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who led the festivities. Later tonight Mr. DiCaprio, 25, will be a host on an Earth Day special on the ABC television network. But today's rallies also featured speakers who back a campaign seeking to raise the environmental conscience of some prominent corporations, like the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC and will distribute a movie starring Mr. DiCaprio.
The campaign, ecopledge.com, asks several corporations to change environmental practices, or face possible boycotts from students seeking employment, investors or consumers.
Earlier this week the ecopledge campaign sent to the companies: they asked Disney to stop selling toys containing polyvinyl chloride and they asked Citigroup's investment bank, Salomon Smith Barney, to stop underwriting bonds for the Three Gorges Dam in China. Company spokesmen said they had no comment on the letters.
No one from the Earth Day Network, the organizers of today's events, signed the letter. But ecopledge leaders were planning to speak about the campaign at rallies today in Washington, Boston and Los Angeles.
"We hope to gather 100,000 signatures," said Wendy Wendlandt, the president of Earth Day 2000.
Some of the listeners were receptive to the idea.
"I think it's good to target companies like that rather than small ones, because they are so visible and have a direct effect on our environment and lives," said Heather McLeod, 22, of Washington, D.C.

HEADLINE: Just Another Cuban Family Saga

BYLINE: By Tim Golden; Tim Golden, who has covered Cuba extensively, is an investigative reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
Early on the evening of Nov. 22, Juan Miguel Gonzalez came home from work to find his family in a panic. His mother was trying to tell him something, but couldn't seem to get it out. Finally, she took him into the kitchen and gave him the news: his former wife, Elisabeth, and their 5-year-old son, Elian, were nowhere to be found. The boy had been unaccountably absent from school that day, and one of Elisabeth's friends had told the family there were rumors that she had taken the child on a boat and left for la Yuma, the United States.
Juan Miguel grabbed his younger brother, Tony, and took off across Cardenas, the town on Cuba's north coast where they have lived all their lives. When they arrived at the apartment Elisabeth and Elian shared with her boyfriend, the door was locked; no one was home. They went on to the apartment where the boyfriend's parents lived, but no one was there either, and neighbors said the family had sold its furniture and disappeared. Everyone assumed that like so many Cubans before them, they had headed for the Florida coast. 
 At 9:01 that night, Juan Miguel's father, Juan, called collect to relatives in Miami. In the elaborate case put forward by the lawyers and politicians who sought to keep the boy in the United States, the phone bill for the call has been waved about as evidence that Juan Miguel, 31, might have known in advance of plans for the furtive crossing -- that he might actually have given his approval so that his son could live in freedom. But even the relatives who would later fight him for the custody of Elian recall the conversation differently. "They were worried," said Lazaro Gonzalez, one of Juan Miguel's uncles. "The mother had left with the boy in some sort of boat."
What is, in fact, clear about that first call, and the flurry of others that followed it, is something that was easily lost in the ensuing controversy: Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not hesitate to turn to his aunts and uncles in Miami for help in the crisis, and they did not hesitate to help him. The next day, Lazaro said, he bought a $10 telephone card and called to reassure the family that such trips often took a few days and that he would look out for the boy. Finally, on Thanksgiving, the Miami relatives phoned Cuba with the news that Elian had been pulled from the sea by a couple of fishermen. Later, after visiting him at a hospital near Fort Lauderdale, Lazaro called again to tell them that the boy's mother had perished but that Elian had survived the ordeal astonishingly well.
On Friday, Nov. 26, Juan Miguel's father spoke to his eldest sister, Caridad, in Miami. Television news crews had already turned up at the hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American politicians offering their support. With all the attention, Caridad had begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's rescue: that her brother and his family might finally have a reason to leave Cuba and join the rest of the Gonzalezes in the United States.
"I told him he should grab a visa and one for his wife and another for Juan Miguel and come here right away," said Caridad, a slender, elegant looking woman in her late 60's. "It seemed like they wanted to come; he said he would give an answer. I think they started preparing their papers. But then they called back later and said some functionary of the government would be coming to get the boy."
From the moment Caridad hung up the phone, her brother and nephew began to slip from their relatives' view, leaving nothing between Miami and Fidel Castro but a skinny little boy, now 6. Yet even among the quiet minority of Gonzalezes in Miami who tried again and again to persuade their family members to give the boy back to his father, there has always been a charitable explanation for what happened next. They say that starting with Caridad and her brother Delfin, Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles first thought of keeping Elian in the United States partly as a way to pull the family together. "The obsession of her life has been to have the whole family here," one of Caridad's nephews in Miami told me last month. "That has been her reason for living. The idea was to use the boy to bring the others here."
However difficult it may be to think of the struggle over Elian as the product of a misguided effort at family reunification, it might once have been no easier to imagine what it would take to break the Gonzalezes apart. In the 41 years since Castro came to power, the family has held together through political differences and personal tragedies, long, painful separations and assorted family spats. Even now, it is hard to have a conversation in either country without hearing one of the Gonzalezes talk about how things used to be. "eramos siempre tan unidos," they say. "We were always close."
The Gonzalezes have not been generous with their past. On either side of the fight, they have surrendered only the simplest pieces of their history, sometimes adopting the accounts of their new allies rather than expose something more personal. In Miami as in Cardenas, there have been party lines. And in the absence of any real change in Cuba, or in Cuba's relationship with the United States, they have been easy proxies for political adversaries that know each other well.
Yet before the men started wearing suits and the women got makeovers and everyone began speaking from prepared texts, the Gonzalezes were like countless other Cuban families, divided by geography and politics but also struggling in endless small ways to bridge the Straits of Florida. Their choices -- even about whether to stay in Cuba or leave -- have often been more personal than ideological. Brothers and cousins a few years apart have seen the country through different eyes, and their loyalties have been shaped as much by their personalities as their ideals. Before Elian, the faults that ran through the Gonzalez family had less to do with political history than with telephone calls and care packages and things said in anger that were never quite forgotten.
Now, however, the cold war has come to this: in the last bitter days of the struggle over Elian, Juan Miguel's uncle Delfin, 62, stands behind a police line in Bethesda, Md., with one of Juan Miguel's cousins, Alfredo Martell, who is 28. Speaking through a translator, they tell one television news crew after another that they just want a chance to talk to Juan Miguel, to work things out. Delfin mentions that he is Juan Miguel's godfather; Alfredo and Juan Miguel grew up together in the same house.
Juan Miguel may be within earshot of where they stand. But if so, he is somewhere in the residence of the Cuban government's chief envoy to Washington, and if he is watching on television, he is surrounded by Cuban officials who would hurry to point out the man from the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful anti-Castro political group in the United States. He is the heavyset guy standing directly behind Delfin and Alfredo, the one translating what they say.
Cardenas, where the story begins, is in some ways a logical setting: it sits due south of the Florida Keys, in the path of currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate migrants to the United States. Though it is only two and a half hours east of Havana, the town feels more distant. At rush hour, if it can be called that, the main streets are a tangle of horse carts and bicycles and vintage American sedans. When most of its elegant colonial facades were built in the 19th century, Cardenas was a thriving sugar town, a well-heeled neighbor to the sophisticated port city of Matanzas. But the boom ended before the century was over, a victim of the long fight to evict Spain. By the time Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio Batista in 1959, the most strategic thing about Cardenas was probably its rum distillery.
For the most part, Cardenas was remote from the centers of the uprising. But it was by no means removed from the upheaval that followed. Juan Miguel's grandparents, Luis and Georgina, weathered the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a stevedore at the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children -- Juan Miguel's father, aunts and uncles -- had a tougher time. Their eldest son, Jose Luis, bought into the best cafeteria in town, the Cosmopolita, only to have it confiscated by the new government. Others struggled to find any work at all.
Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20's, was among those in the family with great hopes for the revolution. "I think I supported them for about a month," he said of the Communists. "When I saw the injustices that were being committed, I knew that it wasn't going to be the right thing for Cuba." Though many of his friends had joined the new government, he did not hesitate to attack it in their presence. Eventually, he began conspiring against the new regime.
On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and his mother, especially, was devastated. Pina, as everyone called her, took down the large framed photograph of Fidel that she had put up on the living-room wall. She also tried her best to banish politics from the family's crowded home at No. 170 Cossio Street. "When something would happen in politics, my uncles would always want to discuss it," the eldest of Juan Miguel's cousins, Jose Antonio, recalled. "But anytime things got a little hot, my grandmother intervened. She would say: 'You are brothers. You are a family. Stay away from politics."'
Later, several of Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles would remember 1962 as the year they began thinking about a new life outside of Cuba. One aunt saw her husband hauled off to prison with Delfin. Another uncle, Manuel, or Manolo, as he is known, married and resolved to try to raise his family in the United States. For Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat for Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and requited love.
In September 1965, Castro announced that Cubans with relatives in the United States would be free to leave. By Christmas, chartered American planes were flying twice a day out of an airport 16 miles from the Gonzalez home, near the beach resort of Varadero. In April, Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress, boarded one of the so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami by herself, crying the whole way. She was among more than 17,000 Cubans to make the trip that year, one of almost 300,000 who left before Castro halted the flights in 1973.
Although Caridad promised Pina that she would eventually send for everyone, the others had little choice but to make do. "It's like a chain," said the youngest of Juan Miguel's aunts, Haydee, 56, as she sat in the small home in Cardenas where she has lived alone since the death of her husband and the departure of two of her three children to Miami. "Your husband has his family. You have children, and then they have their families. You can't leave just like that."
Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria. Manolo trained as a mechanic and found work repairing boat motors for a fishing cooperative -- thinking every day, he said, about how easy it might be to gather his family and disappear in the night. Lazaro emerged as a talented young gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources into its sports program; early on, he was in some ways the luckiest. Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela, eventually became a clerk in the local courts, and his father, Juan, took a job as a police investigator in the interior ministry. It was a career choice that not all his siblings appreciated. "Think about it," said Delfin, who had at the time just been freed from a nightmarish series of prisons. "I criticized him a lot. I'd ask: 'Why are you doing that? There is other work around. Leave that alone."'
Unable to find a decent job and unwilling to stifle his complaints, Delfin grew rice in the mangrove swamps and waged a long, low-intensity conflict with the state. In 1979, with Caridad's help, he got a visa and came to the United States just months before his mother's death. Not long after, Castro opened the doors again, and thousands of Cubans left for the United States in the Mariel boat lift. Some of the Gonzalezes bought new suitcases and packed up their belongings. But in the chaos, they hesitated and were ultimately unable to leave.
Shortly thereafter, Caridad received United States citzenship, and members of the family got ready again. Even with money sent by Delfin, the passage wasn't easy. One of Juan Miguel's aunts brought her family in 1983, and Luis, the family patriarch, followed her the next spring. Manolo and Lazaro took their families to Costa Rica in August 1984 and applied for American visas there. It was an agonizing trip in which the two brothers had to leave their wives and children behind for months while they went to the United States to establish residency.
Almost all of the Gonzalezes moved at first into the insular world of Little Havana. Speaking almost no English, they shopped at Latin-owned stores, gossiped at Cuban coffee stands and got their news from Spanish-language radio and television stations that mirrored the zealous politics they had left behind in Cuba. The emigre culture that received them had begun to grow more diverse with the influx of the younger, more liberal Marielitos. But at the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were coming into their own as an American political force.
In Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing the country differently. Although the oldest of Juan Miguel's cousins was only seven years younger than his uncle Lazaro, none of them knew a world before Fidel. In the late 1960's and 70's, when some of Juan Miguel's uncles were growing bitter, when his aunts felt like outcasts for going to church, some of their children seem to have thrived. What they remember now, more than the uniforms they wore or the revolutionary songs they were made to learn in school, is their life in the crowded house on Cossio Street. "It wasn't just on birthdays and Christmas -- it was every night," Juan Miguel's cousin Lourdes Martell said. "All of us, the cousins, were together all the time."
The opportunities they had varied. Like thousands of other young Cubans of his generation, Juan Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose Antonio, became the first member of his family to attend college, earning a degree from the University of Matanzas that led him to a job with the ministry of agriculture. His sister Milagros had a less successful experience with the educational bureaucracy. Considered for a coveted scholarship to art school, she was rejected after an official came to her home for an interview and saw a picture of Christ displayed on the wall.
But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel. Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it presented: attending political rallies, volunteering to work on the agricultural harvest, keeping an eye on the "revolutionary morale" of his comrades. He became a full member of the Cuban Communist Party at the tender age of 24, an achievement he called "the proudest thing that can happen to you."
Like his father, Juan Miguel also fell in love with a woman who seemed to share his commitment to the revolution. In September 1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at her friend Ismary Pruneda's quinceanera, the Latin equivalent of a sweet 16 party, and they soon fell in love. Juan Miguel's friends remember him then as a funny, gregarious kid of 15. Elisa, as everyone called her, was 14: a pretty, diffident girl with black hair and a nice smile. "She talked so softly that you always had to tell her to speak up," Ismary said.
In a town that even now feels more country than city, and in a country where sex and love are often the most available freedoms, no one seems to have worried much that the novios might be too young. "They were little kids, but it was different," Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez, said, not quite explaining the difference. "Today, two kids get married that young and it lasts a few months. That didn't happen with them."
When they did marry, Elisa was just shy of 16, Juan Miguel not yet 17. She rented a white dress from the Palace of Brides on the Calle Real, the main drag in Cardenas, and they borrowed an elegant old car to drive to the ceremony. In the fading black-and-white photographs that Raquel Rodriguez now keeps in a plain cardboard box, they toast each other with Champagne -- Elisa with a shy smile and feathered, Farrah Fawcett hair; Juan Miguel in a dark suit with both buttons buttoned and a wispy teenage mustache.
The couple lived first with Raquel and her second husband, Rolando, in an airy three-bedroom apartment above a pharmacy in the center of town. Elisa, an only child, seemed to thrive among the Gonzalezes. Juan Miguel left school after 10th grade and went to work in a paper factory, training to become an electrician. Before their marriage, Elisa had started a secretarial program at a live-in vocational school in a town an hour away, but she had become homesick and quit. Eventually, Elisa and Juan Miguel went to night school to earn their high school degrees. While he completed his three years of military service with an army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and restaurants.
Her timing couldn't have been better. Varadero, a long ribbon of white-sand beach that extends out from the coast 10 miles west of Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Castro's reluctant effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned by foreign companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the country. Soon, the resort was providing enough dollars to make Cardenas one of the most prosperous towns in Cuba. By the time Elisa finished hotel school, the classes were filling up with Cuba's best and brightest, those who could have chosen medicine or physics but realized that the country's most lucrative jobs would be tending bar and carrying tourists' bags.
Like the scratchy signals of A.M. radio stations and the television broadcasts that people in Cardenas pull down from Miami on homemade antennas, Varadero was also a window on the outside world. Kids from Cardenas would hitchhike just to watch the tourists play Pac-Man or use Coke machines. "You knew there were places called Canada and Spain and New York because you learned about them in geography class," Juan Miguel's cousin, Jose Antonio, 42, said. "But when the tourists started coming, we would go and stand next to them and just sniff. And after all those years of the same soap, they smelled different."
In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest Varadero hotel, the Paradiso-Punta Arenas. The job wasn't glamorous, and there was a catch: the all-inclusive resort discouraged tipping and it attracted mostly low-budget tourists on package trips. But the wages were excellent by Cuban standards, and they were augmented by a steady flow of precious gifts from the guests -- half-empty bottles of rum, shampoo and cosmetics and not-so-old clothes.
"She said that job was her salvation," said Ismary Pruneda, who finished the secretarial program they had started together and ended up hawking pork sandwiches at a farmer's market. "She would say to me, 'Do you think I like cleaning floors?' She did it because she could live decently from that. I had struggled so much to finish, and there I was, 9 or 10 hours a day, yelling, 'Pork meat!"'
Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, at Josone Park, the converted estate of a Basque immigrant who ran the Havana Club distillery in Cardenas before the revolution. Starting on the maintenance crew, Juan Miguel worked his way up to the admission booth, and he shared in the tips that the waiters and bartenders pooled. Eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky 1956 Nash Rambler and to build a home for themselves beside the house on Cossio Street. They watched videos on a hard-earned VCR and drove to the beach in Varadero on weekends.
On the surface, at least, the couple remained steadfast fidelistas. Elisa was by all accounts a diligent maid, and although she was more muted about her politics than Juan Miguel, she, too, became a party member and the secretary of the Communist Party committee at her job. It was not coincidental that those working in Varadero (who now include perhaps a fifth of the Cardenas labor force) tended to be loyal revolutionaries. They showed a proud face to foreign visitors and could be trusted to cope with the new economy's darker side: rampant prostitution, petty theft by hotel employees and a kind of tourism apartheid in which ordinary Cubans were often barred from the restaurants and nightclubs where they themselves worked.
Juan Miguel's cousin, Alfredo, became a hotel security guard and earned much of his income from older foreign men who tipped him to let them sneak young Cuban women into their rooms. They were women whose faces he says he cannot forget. "They would come to you sometimes and say, 'Hey, look, I'm only doing this because I have kids to feed or because my mother is sick,"' he said. "That kind of stuff hits you and hits you until you finally say, 'I am getting out of here or I am going to die in the ocean trying."'
After years of growing prosperity in the 1980's, Castro had announced the "Special Period in Time of Peace," an official euphemism for economic disaster. Even with the cushion of their Varadero jobs, the Gonzalezes had to make charcoal or scavenge for crude oil in order to cook their meals. Alfredo, who did his military service in the Cardenas police, saw the turmoil there through the eyes of his uncle Juan, 54, a proud, easygoing man who had always got along with the regime as he had with his brothers and sisters.
"Anybody who tried to sell things to get by, the cops took it away," Alfredo said. "When the lights went out, people would throw bottles at us. Once upon a time, Juan was one of them. But after the Special Period, he saw that things were not the way Fidel said they were." Alfredo recalled one day when there was nothing to eat and his uncle scrounged up a piece of bread, cut some grass from the yard with a knife and made a sandwich of it. He ate it and then threw up. Without telling his family, Juan Miguel's younger brother, Tony, 25, applied for an American visa. When it was granted, Juan Miguel and his mother talked him out of going, Juan Miguel told me.
Juan Miguel and Elisa had other problems as well. From the time she was 16 or 17, they struggled to have a child, losing four pregnancies in succession. In 1989, she was found to have a bacterial parasite that was thought to have caused her recurrent miscarriages. Even after she was treated, she lost three more pregnancies -- one of them at seven months. Under the rationing system that governs the allocation of everything from children's milk to gifts for newlyweds, expectant Cuban women could buy a crib and a mattress in state stores. Elisa bought the items again and again, her friend Ismary said. "Later, she would have to sell them because she couldn't handle the memories."
After several years of marriage, Elisa and Juan Miguel had also begun to drift apart. Friends saw them as having less and less in common: she loved clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked hanging out with friends. "When they met, it was all dreamy, but at that age, the same things don't matter that matter later on," said Marta Elena Hidalgo, the wife of one of Juan Miguel's closest friends. "Years later, they weren't alike at all. He is this playful, outgoing guy, and she was a girl who was very low key, very reserved."
Juan Miguel, who liked to spend some of his comfortable salary at bars and discoth<heart>ques, began to go with other women. Sitting around the dining-room table recently with his parents, his second wife, Nersy, 23, and their infant son, Hianny, Juan Miguel spoke uneasily about the breakup of his first marriage, mentioning the long, stressful effort to have a child. His mother reminded him of another issue. "Yeah, it was mostly because of the way I was," he said. "How to put it? It was probably my fooling around with other women, being on the street." Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later, they were living together again.
"We had always wanted to have a child," Juan Miguel said. "We got together again to see if we could do it. And finally we did." After months of bed rest and prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993. The couple had known from the sonograms that they were expecting a boy, and they made up their own name for him, using the first three letters of Elisa and the last two of Juan. In his excitement, Juan Miguel couldn't wait for Elisa to return from the hospital to start celebrating. "I told them to wait," her mother, Raquel, 51, said. "But he couldn't stop himself. Elisa's half-brother had gotten this pig, and he slaughtered it right then, and they started frying pork rinds and drinking beer and rum with their friends. They had the party without us."
Now, at least, it is impossible to find anyone who knew the couple well who does not describe both young parents as having cherished Elian. The games and toys that fill his rooms at Raquel's apartment and on Cossio Street might not look like much to a kid now hooked on Nintendo, but they must have looked extravagant to his playmates. "Other kids around here may be in a difficult situation," said Juan Miguel's cousin, Lourdes, who is Elian's godmother. "But there was nothing that boy wanted that he didn't have."
For a while, some of their friends said, the little boy with his father's eyes and his mother's nose seemed to hold the couple together. But after a while, the relationship buckled again. As much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she told her girlfriends, she was tired of his running around. Juan Miguel, for his part, said he felt different, too. "She was like a sister to me," he said. In February 1997, 11 years after they were married and two months after Elian's third birthday, they separated for good. "It was the same as before," Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela, 51, said, looking sadly at her son. "The same motive."
Elisa moved back in with her mother and Rolando, in the apartment above the pharmacy, a short walk from Cossio Street. According to several of her friends and several of Juan Miguel's, she not only shared custody of the boy but also remained close to her former in-laws. And she had a significant example: her mother, Raquel, had remained on such good terms with Elisa's father that she would go to parties with her husband and ex-husband on either arm. Elisa's close friend Lisbeth Garcia said that Elisa and Juan Miguel sometimes fought over Elian but that they generally did an admirable job of remaining friends after the split. "Sometimes I told her that they got along better as friends than they did at the end of their marriage," she said.
Still, Lisbeth and others remember the months after the divorce as a deeply lonely time for Elisa. She and Lisbeth worked long hours at the hotel, often arriving home after 8 p.m., and Elisa seemed to miss the bustle and warmth of Cossio Street. It made it worse that Juan Miguel seemed to meet lots of other women and that his job gave him a little more time to spend with Elian. On Saturdays and school holidays, Juan Miguel would take the boy with him to the park, and on the mornings after Elian stayed over at Cossio Street, they had a long ritual of "little hugs" to mark their goodbyes. "There were times we almost missed the bus because Juan Miguel would spend 10 minutes saying goodbye, doing those little hugs," said his friend Fidel Ramirez, who has worked with him at the park for a decade.
Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, her friend Lisbeth said. They had gone out after work to a Varadero nightspot, the Havana Club. As they danced, several women together, a young man approached them and asked if he could join. Lisbeth agreed; she recognized him as El Loco, a guy she had seen around in Cardenas. After a while, Lisbeth and another friend went to the bathroom, leaving Elisa and the man, Lazaro Rafael Munero, on the dance floor. By the time they got back, Lisbeth said, Elisa had found a new friend.
Rafa, as they called him, showed no sign of the temper that apparently earned him his nickname. When the group decided to continue on to a second nightclub, he offered to pay for a taxi. Then he drove them home in his own car, first dropping off Lisbeth, her sister and her cousin and then leaving Elisa at the apartment above the pharmacy. "I don't think a week went by before they got together," Lisbeth said. "Within about two months, he went to live with her at Raquel's house."
To her mother and some of her friends, that seemed too fast. But Elisa insisted that she had found a good man. The son of an oil worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18, he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the Varadero hotels. Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver, shuttling between Cardenas and Varadero without a license in a country that makes a very big thing of licenses. But Munero was also a master in the Cuban art of resolviendo, or getting hold of things, and he had little trouble winning Elisa's heart. "He knew how to work her," Lisbeth recalled. "He was always very close to her, very affectionate, very attentive. And little by little, she fell for him."

In the storm of propaganda that began soon after Elian's rescue, no one has been hit harder than Munero, who also died in the crossing. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, described him this way: Munero was a bad kid. When he dropped out of school, after picking fights with all sorts of classmates, it was "to undertake a criminal career." When he was with Elisa, the paper quotes a friend of hers, she would turn up with a black eye one day, a swollen wrist the next. "Munero," the report says, "with his dominating and violent personality, exerted a strange and fatal influence over Elisabeth."
But as with much of the story, some of the same people cited in the official account later described Munero in softer, more complex terms. Dayana Oceguera, his jilted former girlfriend and another bright Young Communist in excellent standing, described him as a guy who came on strong and was very sure about things, like his desire for her to quit her studies (which she refused to do) and have his child (which she did). He was a lousy father, she said, but could be helpful in emergencies.
"He wasn't such a terrible person," she said. "He had a strong character and a lot of complexes. If somebody looked at him crosswise, he got mad about it." But she added: "He was a very family-oriented guy. If I got sick, he would take care of me. He could resolver anything -- things that were possible and things that were impossible." Even Juan Miguel seemed reluctant to pile on. "He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop him off," he said of Munero. "We got along with him all right."
Less than a year after Munero had moved in with Elisa, he left Cuba in a small boat with three friends. Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go with him but that she refused. In Miami, Munero lived with an aunt and worked 12-hour days at a car wash for $5 an hour. He passed again and again on invitations to go out after work, to the movies to meet girls, and no one seems to have been impressed by his enthusiasm for America.
Milagros Garcia, the aunt with whom he stayed, thought it was the loneliness, more than the hard work, that Munero couldn't take. She recalled the day when Munero received a letter from Elisa with three photographs. On the back of one, she wrote in a loopy, girlish script: "My Love: Keep this photo which is sent to you with all of the affection that you deserve. From your Little One." On another, in which Elian stares out at the camera with his eyes still wide, she wrote, "For Munero, with all the affection of his little boy, Elian." Munero was thrilled, his aunt said, but she kidded him mercilessly. "I said, 'Ay, Rafa, she's so ugly!' But he couldn't hear that. He told me: 'Auntie, don't say that! I'm in love!' I think he was obsessed with her."
Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero asked his aunt to hold some of his clothes and most of the $3,000 he had saved and used the remainder to buy a motorized rubber raft. His relatives tried repeatedly to dissuade him but could not. On Oct. 26, 1998, he and another man were picked up by the Cuban Coast Guard as they made their way into a bay in the central province of Villa Clara. Munero spent the next two months there in prison, and Elisa's friends said she visited him at least five times.
Munero was released on New Year's Eve, and he appears to have spent the following weeks telling anyone who would listen that his trip north had been a terrible mistake. Several people who saw him then said they believed him; in Miami, his aunt would later say she had heard that he was badly beaten by his jailers. For a time, Munero moved back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment, but the arrangement did not last.
Raquel Rodriguez says now that he was abusive to her daughter and she would not stand for it. But while her views could be tinted by both the loss of her daughter and pressure from the government, she seems to have been clear, long before her daughter's death, of her distaste for Elisa's young boyfriend. Not long after Munero's return, the couple rented an apartment of their own and took Elian with them. Months later, they set off before dawn in a homemade boat with a balky 50-horsepower motor: Elisa and Elian; Munero, his two brothers and their parents; a friend of Elisa's, her husband and his family; and a young couple with a 5-year-old girl. When engine trouble forced the group back to shore for repairs, the young couple had second thoughts and left the girl behind. Elisa kept Elian aboard.
Five months later, there is nothing about Elisa's decision to leave that is not contested in some way. In Miami, lawyers for the Gonzalez family claim that she and Munero had been hounded by the authorities because of his troubles with the law. In Cuba, officials insist that Munero must have coerced Elisa into making the trip. But if Elisa confided her thoughts to anyone who is still alive, they have kept them to themselves.
In her silence, it didn't take long for Cubans on either side of the Straits to seize on Elian as a metaphor for the country's future. Juan Miguel remembers how quickly Cuban-American politicians seemed to appear at his uncle's modest stucco home, picking the boy up and holding him like a trophy. Only in their first conversation after Elian was released from the hospital did the boy ever speak about what had happened. "Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,"' Juan Miguel remembers his son saying. "I told him: 'Don't worry. You will be right back here with me."'
Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his aunt Caridad called. "She told me: 'With all this, your life is set here. With him having come on Thanksgiving and all that, they have all kinds of money collected. They'll give you a house; they'll give you a car. You won't have to work another day in your life. The whole family can come with you."' None of it was very specific, Juan Miguel said, but several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar pleas.
"Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend me," Juan Miguel said. "They started telling me how bad the government here is, all that. And me -- I have my ideals. I told them, 'There's nothing to talk about with you guys,' and I hung up on them. They never said a thing about the boy staying there -- they were just insisting that we should go there." Caridad called back again and again, Juan Miguel said, and he hung up on her every time.
Delfin said he was the first of the Gonzalezes in Miami to insist that Elian should not be sent home and that Lazaro and his 21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis, were the first to back him up. "At the beginning, the father and the family there probably thought about coming here and meeting up with the child in a free country," Delfin said. "But then things got out of their hands. We saw that the government was getting mixed up in something that is none of its business." Caridad told her nephew, "I came to this country to bring Cubans here, not to send them back."
Whatever their politics, none of the Gonzalezes were wrong to suspect that their relatives were being swept up by forces bigger than themselves. On Nov. 24, the day before Elian was found, Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela, had already gone for help to her boss at the city tribunals. He, in turn, had spoken to the first secretary of the Communist Party in Cardenas, Ricardo Chapelin, who called Juan Miguel in the next day. "He was desperate," Chapelin said. "He said the mother had taken the boy, and he was completely against it."
By the time Elian was rescued on the 25th, Juan Miguel had been put in touch with the foreign ministry in Havana, which two days later sent the United States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return. Soon after that, Juan Miguel Gonzalez of No. 170 Cossio Street, Cardenas, found himself face to face with the Comandante en Jefe.
Castro asked him how he felt about the situation and what he wanted to do. "He told me I could do what I pleased," Juan Miguel said. "If I wanted to leave, I could leave. Nonetheless, I told him no. My decision was clear."
Having taken the measure of his man, Castro was quick to recognize the episode's political potential. Only two weeks before, he had been embarrassed by criticism of his human rights record from some of the Latin American leaders who attended a regional summit in Havana. Now, he had an issue with the power to galvanize not only the party faithful but also every Cuban parent and child and millions of people abroad. It was an issue, as Cuban officials were soon noting privately, that also had the potential to isolate Miami's Cuban exiles from other Americans.
It is probably fair to assume that Juan Miguel would have been willing to swim to Miami to pick up his son. Still, he may have been stopped from going right away not so much to prevent his defection (whatever the strength of his principles, his family could always have been kept behind) but also because the Cuban government was in no great hurry for the drama to end. Castro told visitors as early as December that he expected the case to drag on in American courts for months, and he has managed it accordingly, ordering up protest rallies, television programs and "Free Elian" T-shirts on a massive scale. Within weeks of his rescue , Elian had become the biggest revolutionary symbol since Che.
Castro's enemies were just as quick to recognize a poster child when they saw one. Elian was not yet out of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital before the first Cuban-American politicos were on the scene, led by a Sharpton-esque political strategist and public-relations man named Armando Gutierrez. "We met with the family, and I told them, 'You're going to need help,"' said Gutierrez, who rushed over with a couple of local Cuban-American politicians. "I didn't want to make it into a political thing. When I saw Elian's face, I knew it was something special."
As in Cuba, it has grown steadily more difficult in Miami to untangle the thoughts of Elian's relatives from those of their advisers, lawyers and political hangers-on. The $600-a-month rental where Lazaro lives with his wife and two grown children has been a magnet for politicians of various anti-Castro stripes, and it has been infused from the beginning with their mixed feelings of victimization and entitlement. According to people working with the family, the cause has been dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities, advised them on strategy and helped arrange what has thus far been a largely no-show job for Lazaro, who had been unemployed, at the Ford dealership of one of its directors. The foundation, with a team of lawyers, also helped to assemble its own narrative of Elian's flight to freedom. Their method was not entirely unlike that of Castro's state-security operatives, who, according to several Cubans, moved systematically through the Gonzalez family's world, interviewing people, sifting their stories and picking out the parts that might be most useful.
Lazaro, who brought Elian home from the hospital, became the most ardent crusader for the boy's continued stay. But while he has worked closely with the politicians in Miami and Washington, his own politics have remained vague. Many of his relatives say they had thought of him as one of the least politically minded of his brothers, and his life in Cuba was not marked by open conflict with the government. In 1977, he followed his brother Juan into the Cuban National Police and then resigned suddenly four years later, returning to his previous work as an athletic coach. Officials of the Cuban government -- which has a clear interest in maligning Lazaro's reputation -- said he had been forced out after an investigation found him to have associated with "homosexual elements," and they provided copies of police files purportedly documenting the inquiry. Lazaro denied the assertions as libelous propaganda.
The television crews have also gravitated to Lazaro's daughter, Marisleysis, an assistant bank-loan processor with a remarkable capacity to summon her anguish for the cameras. (She has been hospitalized eight times since November for what have been vaguely described as anxiety and stress-related illnesses.) But while Marisleysis quickly stepped forward as a surrogate mother for Elian, her own mother, Angela, has kept almost entirely out of sight. Nor has the media seen much of Jose and Luis Cid, another set of Juan Miguel's cousins, who both have long records of problems with the law. (Luis Cid is awaiting trial in the strong-arm robbery of a tourist in Little Havana last year)
Among the Gonzalez cousins who have been most important to the story told in Miami is one who came from Cuba little more than a year ago, Alfredo Martell. As a latter-day emigre, Alfredo might have been expected to take a more nuanced view of the events surrounding Elian. His mother and sister, who remain in Cardenas, cannot understand why their own family in Miami has put Juan Miguel through such agony. Instead, Alfredo has been a font of assertions meant to undermine Juan Miguel: that Elian's father wanted to move to America himself; that he sometimes beat up Elisa; that he, too, felt betrayed by what has happened to Cuba over the last decade.
A little more than a year after Alfredo arrived in Florida on his own small boat, he views the case with the clarity of a convert. "Sometimes, you think it would be better for the boy to be with his father," said Alfredo, whose own son, Lazaro, 5, has once again been playing with his cousin Elian. "But his father knows he is probably better off here. And the kid tells you constantly that he doesn't want to go. You also have to think -- the boy would not be sent back to Juan Miguel; he would go back to Fidel."
Senior Cuban officials deny this, of course. They have always maintained that as soon as Elian arrived in Cardenas, they would stop the demonstrations, take down the posters and end the daily two-hour television blocks devoted to the case. The houses on Juan Miguel's block, which the government painted over in bright colors, would be allowed to fade; the little shrine in Elian's classroom would go back to being a desk. "He needs to recover his privacy," said Ricardo Alarcon, the Cuban official who has managed the case for Castro. "We are going to have to work on that, but with time, it will happen."
But if Elian will be missed by "Nightline" and "Crossfire," his resonance in Cuba will be more lasting. "What is clear is that he is going to continue to be a boy symbol, a boy hero," Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist Party chief in Cardenas, said. "This battle did not begin with Elian. Our struggle has been one of challenging the government of the United States for its attacks against our country. And we will continue with this struggle, which is one that strengthens us in every way."
Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans, managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the United States attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading influence on Capitol Hill. Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to be weighing movie and book deals of various sorts.
It is hard to see most of the other Gonzalezes as anything but traumatized. And but for Elian and Juan Miguel, none seem to have suffered more than Juan Miguel's uncle Manolo and aunt America, who happened to be in Spain on a long-planned trip in the days after Elian was found. Of all the family members in the United States, they are the ones who have remained closest to their relatives in Cuba, and they are the ones who have tried hardest to persuade the others to give Elian back to Juan Miguel. Manolo says he cannot think about the boy now without remembering the loss of his own son, Manuel Antonio, who died of cancer 10 years ago at the age of 14. He has been hurt by the shouts of "Communist" that he sometimes hears when he is recognized on the street. But he said the worst of it came last month on the last of his several trips to Lazaro's house, when his brothers would not speak to him, Elian would not kiss him and no one even tried to help him when he had to be rushed to the hospital with chest pains. "What has happened, here I don't know," he said tearfully. "I never wanted that boy to go back to Cuba. I only wanted him to be with his father."
Manolo's wife, who sat beside him, started to try to explain what he meant, but she, too, found herself at a loss. "From the beginning, this has been a family problem," she said. "Why could it not be resolved within the family?"

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report;
A New Concept For Web Sellers: Profitability

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
Given the dismal performance of dot-com retailers on Wall Street and in the offices of venture capitalists lately, investors have had their fill of e-books, e-pets, e-drugs and other Web retail operations that burn through cash at Internet speed. What the market seems to be in the mood for now is some old-fashioned e-fficiency.
The problem, according to executives and industry analysts, is that investors had been treating electronic commerce as a popularity contest, giving the sites with the most visitors the highest stock valuations. As a result, many Internet merchants have concentrated more on their Web-traffic figures than on the standard measures of long-term retail success, like gross margins, customer acquisition costs and customer retention rates. 
 But now that investors are seeking evidence that dot-coms can show profits at some point, many Web retailers are getting down to the dirty work of squeezing income from their operations.
"More and more, the focus is now on what will drive near-term revenue," said John Hagel, a partner at McKinsey & Company, the management consultants. "There's clearly a sense of urgency around the efficiency side of the equation, which for a long time was ignored quite explicitly."
In some cases, that urgency translates to difficult decisions about where to devote staff resources -- for example, whether to shift employees from long-term projects to those with more short-term relevance to the bottom line. In others, it means actually using the mountains of data that e-tailers have said all along would help speed their earnings growth -- by allowing them to make better decisions about which customers are the most profitable, for instance.
In any case, the new tensions can mean even harder work for employees who may have been hoping by now to ease into a 9-to-5 routine as the value of their stock options appreciated.
Mr. Hagel and others said the focus on near-term revenue probably means the temporary abandonment of some prominent retail initiatives, like building sites devoted to wireless Internet users or new sites designed to take advantage of high-speed Internet access. "A lot of e-tailers had aggressive plans to expand into related categories that they've put off," Mr. Hagel said, "because that would require a big near-term investment with no revenue hit."
Robert Bowman, chief executive of Cyberian Outpost (www.outpost.com), a Web retailer of computers and electronic goods, said his company was intensifying its efforts toward making a profit -- a goal he predicted the company would achieve "by the middle of next year."
To reach that goal, Mr. Bowman said Cyberian Outpost would have to increase the rate at which buyers return to the site to an average of 3.5 times a year, from the current 2.7 times. Twelve months ago, average visits occurred 1.7 times a year.
The return-rate statistic is particularly important for Internet retailers because they typically spend substantial amounts to attract new customers -- between $80 and $100 each, on average. So the more revenue they can glean from their existing customers, the faster the profits will come.
To retain its existing customer base, Mr. Bowman said his company had increased its focus on e-mail marketing and clung to a policy of offering free overnight shipping, while it also tweaked the Web site's performance.
Earlier this month, "four of our engineers wanted to work on W.A.P.," Mr. Bowman said, referring to the company's wireless-access initiative. "I said, fine, but you have to work on the site's search first, because after the checkout page, it's the No. 1 most abandoned part of the site.
"If you can move that needle 5 percent," he added, "that's significant dollars."
Like many other retailers, Cyberian Outpost has shunned television advertising in favor of print and Internet ads. This represents a shift for Cyberian, which gained attention last year -- and for some, notoriety -- with a TV ad depicting gerbils being shot from a cannon. The ads were shown before Mr. Bowman became chief executive.
Largely because of television ad spending last year, Mr. Bowman said that the company had been paying $90 to attract each new customer, a cost that is now $40 and dropping.
"I tell our people this isn't some online fraternity or sorority," he said. "It's a business that's publicly traded, and it has to be profitable."
Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly, an Internet-only discount apparel retailer, said that because his company started with $4 million, "we never really had the luxury of a war chest, so we were forced to be more disciplined about costs from early on." Bluefly began as a division of Pivot Rules; that company changed its name to Bluefly when it sold its other divisions.
In recent months, Mr. Morris said, Bluefly has found new ways to squeeze dollars from several areas inside the business, including order fulfillment. For example, the company now calculates the efficiency of using different carriers to send packages to different regions, rather than depending on one carrier. "That can play a huge role in lowering costs," he said, adding that fulfillment managers -- whether inside the company or outside contractors -- "are getting smarter about this, because they're being forced to."
Profitability is not unheard of in Internet retailing, according to James Vogtle, director of e-commerce research at the Boston Consulting Group. Mr. Vogtle's firm recently surveyed 412 online retailers on behalf of Shop.org, an industry trade group, and found that 24 percent of Web-only retailers were profitable last year. But according to Shop.org, none of the large, publicly traded e-tailers were among them. Those companies were still spending large amounts of money on marketing to reach as wide an audience as possible.
Bucking the trend, a few Internet companies are finding sources of revenue inside their own marketing departments. David Friedensohn, chief executive of BigStar Entertainment, an online-only retailer of videos and DVD's, said that instead of the "spray-and-pray advertising approach," the company's primary marketing vehicle has been its own database of 1.7 million customer e-mail addresses.
BigStar built content features into its Web site like interviews with celebrities -- features that, when monitored, give the company a better idea of individual customers' movie tastes. In addition to tracking usage and buying patterns, BigStar designed software that can sift through customer profiles before sending an e-mail marketing letter, and can tailor each note to a customer's entertainment preferences.
That approach has not only stabilized the company's marketing costs, Mr. Friedensohn said, but has also generated revenue, since BigStar now sells its e-mail personalization service to other companies. Such efficiency is important, he said, if BigStar is to survive in the long run.
"It's not that you anticipate failure," Mr. Friedensohn said, "but because things change so quickly on the Web, you want to build flexibility into the business."
Mr. Hagel, at McKinsey, said that unlike BigStar, most e-tailers had done nothing with the vast amounts of customer data they have collected. "In many cases they don't have the tools in place, or the skills to use the tools," he said. "But you don't even need sophisticated systems. A lot of this is back-of-the-envelope stuff."
He cited the case of one McKinsey client, an online financial services company that was retaining customers at what was considered a good rate by industry standards. "But they never bothered to look at who was actually leaving and why," Mr. Hagel said.
After some rudimentary sampling, it turned out that the company's most profitable customers were leaving. "Economically, it was a disaster," he said. "This refocused the company completely."
It is understandable why companies have not focused on the bottom line until now, Mr. Hagel added, since "growth has been the biggest imperative."
"But the market's now saying pretty clearly that it's not just growth anymore," he said. "It's about overall efficiency of operations. The only problem is, in most cases, the skill sets to get that done are sadly lacking."

In the early 1990's, while traveling the world to photograph the vestiges of the Industrial Age, Sebastiao Salgado repeatedly came across large numbers of people on the move, not only refugees and displaced persons fleeing wars or famine, but also legions of peasants migrating to cities to escape poverty. He had seen this before, but he now understood the phenomenon to be global.
"There hasn't been a population upheaval like this in modern times," said Mr. Salgado, 56, the Brazilian photographer. "Hundreds of millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America have been forced to leave their homes for similar reasons, whether political or economic. The world has gone from majority rural to majority urban. For the first time we're becoming truly modern. Everything is now interconnected." 
 So after concluding his project on the vanishing forms of manual labor with a widely acclaimed book, "Workers: Archaeology of the Industrial Age," Mr. Salgado turned his attention to what he calls "the reorganization of the human family." He set out to record why people leave their communities, what happens to them en route and where they end up. He also wanted to show the danger, suffering and misery that often accompany their flights.
Now, 6 years and 35 countries later, he has published the results of his travels in a book of 363 black-and-white photographs, "Migrations: Humanity in Transition," accompanied by a slimmer volume of 83 portraits, "The Children: Refugees and Migrants" (both published in the United States by Aperture). Related exhibitions have just opened at the George Eastman House in Rochester and the Maison Europeenne de la Photographie in Paris.
Mr. Salgado's picture of the world at the turn of the millennium is not pretty. His images show victims of war and repression in Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Rwanda, Congo, Angola and Mozambique as well as the Balkans. They follow Latin Americans trying to enter the United States, Africans intent on slipping into Europe and Vietnamese boat people stranded across Asia. And they convey something of the despair and violence of the struggle for land in Latin America.
With the flight from countryside to cities accounting for the largest movement of people, above all in Latin America and Asia, Mr. Salgado's photographs also bare humanity's "new urban face," as he puts it: vast unmanageable metropolises scarred by overcrowded shanty-towns, rampant unemployment, environmental degradation, urban violence and pockets of dizzying wealth and privilege.
"Different national experiences seem to produce the same results," Mr. Salgado, who is based in Paris, said in a recent interview. "At times I wasn't sure if I was in Mexico City or Manila."
"The Children," with its portraits of destitute girls and boys peering mysteriously into the lens, is in a sense a footnote on the state of the world. "When I was with refugees from Mozambique, there were children everywhere stopping me from working," he recalled. "So I said: 'If you want to be photographed, line up here. Then you let me work, O.K.?' It was a trick I used a number of times. Then, when I finally looked at the pictures, I was struck by their intensity. I decided the children should have their own book."
Posed photographs, though, are not typical of Mr. Salgado's work. His camera invariably focuses on people, but it seeks them out in the context of their lives, perhaps in close-up, perhaps in wide shots, but always with the idea of telling a broader story. He has little interest in covering news as such (although he did photograph the Rwandan genocide in 1994). Rather, he wants the emotion awakened by his photographs to provoke political reflection, and he includes lengthy captions in his books to facilitate the process.
If he succeeds, though, it is because images that may be disturbing to view are also striking for their light and composition. And this has led some critics to question whether it is proper to portray misery with an artist's eye. In a recent guest column in Le Monde, Jean-Francois Chevrier, an art professor, went so far as to accuse Mr. Salgado of "sentimental voyeurism" and "exploitation of compassion." Yet for other critics it is the very beauty of his photographs that gives dignity and individuality to those whose misfortunes are being chronicled.
"Every photographer has his own visual language," Mr. Salgado responded. "I know of no other way of working. I take photographs the way I see them, with the light that I have known, with the life that I have had."
It has not been uneventful. In his late teens he left his home town, Aimores in the Brazilian hinterland, to attend college in the port city Vitoria, where he met Lelia Wanick, who became his wife. By the time they moved to Sao Paulo to allow Mr. Salgado to study for a doctorate in economics, middle-class students were taking up arms against Brazil's military dictatorship. And like many educated young Brazilians, he sympathized with the rebel cause.
Finally, faced with the choice of risking arrest or going underground, he left Brazil in 1969 to complete his studies in Paris, becoming, he recalled, "part-migrant, part-refugee, part-exile." Two years later he found work with the London-based International Coffee Organization as an economist and made his first trip to Africa, including areas devastated by drought. When he took up photography in 1973, he already viewed the world through its economic and political problems.
His first photo reportage took him back to Africa to cover famine in the Sahel region. (He later published a book, "Sahel: Man in Distress," in association with Doctors Without Borders.) But while he readily accepted assignments for magazines and newspapers (including one for The New York Times Magazine, when he witnessed and photographed the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981), Mr. Salgado gradually began to orient his work toward what he calls photographic investigations.
One led to a book on rural life in Latin America called "Other Americas," for which this reporter wrote an introductory essay; another resulted in "Workers."
These long-term projects in turn required him to change his way of working. Above all he needed outside backing, which in the case of "Migrations" came from Kodak Professional, a division of Eastman Kodak, and Leica Camera as well as from a half-dozen magazines that published individual reportages as the project advanced. At the same time, to the dismay of some colleagues, in 1994 Mr. Salgado left the Magnum photo cooperative and set up Amazonas Images, perhaps the only agency created to distribute a single photographer's work.
Managed by his wife, an architect, Amazonas Images has enabled Mr. Salgado to ensure that his work is widely seen. "Workers," for instance, was published in seven languages, while its photographs have been shown in some 60 exhibitions. With "Terra," Mr. Salgado's 1998 book about the land struggle in Brazil, instead of a photo exhibition, 1,000 packages containing 50 posters each were sold for $500 or donated to political, church and labor groups across Brazil. The income from the book and posters went to the country's Movement of the Landless.
With "Migrations," which was designed and edited by Amazonas Images, the promotion strategy is no less ambitious. Before the opening of the Paris exhibition, which runs through Sept. 3, the Canal-Plus television network broadcast 30 two-minute films using Mr. Salgado's photographs, while Le Monde published 12 portraits from "The Children" on successive days. And to reach beyond Paris, nongovernmental organizations in France are putting on 120 shows of 61 posters donated by Amazonas Images.
With both "Migrations" and "The Children," which have their own multilingual Web site (www.sebastiaosalgado.com.br), a total of 100,000 copies have been published of each in six languages (English, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese), while 16 related exhibitions have already been scheduled. (The show at the George Eastman House in Rochester through June 18 will travel to the International Center of Photography in Manhattan in the fall.) And where exhibitions are held, Mr. Salgado encourages local newspapers to organize debates, not about his photographs but about what they show.
And while the results of his travels to dismal corners of the world may not go unnoticed, the experience of witnessing violence, despair and misery on such a scale has eroded Mr. Salgado's belief in humanity. "I am a different person from when I began this," he said. "Some of the things I saw made me literally ill. The truth about human beings seems to be the truth of violence. Poverty and the destruction of the planet are going hand in hand. I once had political beliefs, I thought there were answers. I am no longer sure."
But he has not given up. If he has concluded there are no global solutions, he evidently still believes that individuals can make a difference. So on the farm where he was reared, where 1,500 acres of pristine Atlantic Forest were cut down 50 years ago to make room for cattle, Mr. Salgado and his wife have invested a good part of their savings in a program to reforest the area with its original species. This winter the first 80,000 trees were planted.
On its own, of course, the farm can hardly reverse Brazil's devastating deforestation. But plans also include a school on the property that will offer environmental courses to high school students, teachers and municipal officials. The idea, then, is for the farm to serve as a role model.
Even more, it is to convince Brazilians that they can do something to save their forests. And for this, it helps to be the country's most famous photographer. When Brazilians come to hear Mr. Salgado talk about his photography, he never misses a chance to lecture them on the environment.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
Love me, love my dog goes only so far, even in the informality of the dot-com world.

BYLINE: By Tim Race 

 BODY:
YOU'VE probably heard it yourself. Somebody mentions the "new economy." And depending on which way the Nasdaq composite is blowing that day, somebody else asks, sarcastically, "Is there still a new economy?"
Of course there is. The new economy isn't just stock mania. It's about the new ways of doing business -- often, old business -- using new information technologies. 
 But not everything new is wonderful. And if the recent stock market uproar has any lasting benefit, it may be the destruction of some new-economy myths -- beliefs whose accuracy went unchallenged as long as everyone believed without question that they would get rich. The myths, now debunked, include these:
* A goatee confers business acumen.
* Vesting is the young man's Viagra.
* Everybody loves Take Our Dogs to Work days.
For now, let's consider only the last item.
In a recent article in The New York Times, Laura M. Holson and Katie Hafner reported signs of worker disillusionment in dot-com land. Evidence included the case of Carla De Luca, a former CNN producer who had gone to work at a Silicon Valley start-up company. Ms. De Luca left after growing disenchanted by what she considered a forced-fun work style that included a "dogs welcome" policy.
A person doesn't have to dislike dogs to understand why some employees, already doing their best to get along with the other bipeds, might find it beyond the call of commerce to work alongside their colleagues' animals. Dog lovers, though, tend to have a blind spot on these matters, like a friend of mine who fondly recalled working at a Silicon Valley company with a dog-friendly policy.
"People don't bring pit bulls," she said, as if terror were the only criterion for objection. "They're usually big, friendly dogs, like golden retrievers. The worst that's going to happen is they wag their tails and knock over your coffee."
Of course, for workers lacking the dog gene, spilled coffee may be precisely the point. (Or at least part of the point. Allergies, odors, saliva, fleas, the effect of shedded fur on an all-black wardrobe -- these also figure in.)
Maybe the issue isn't really career dogs versus stay-at-homes, though. Instead, the question may be what the panting presence of man's best friend tells us about a certain school of new-economic thinking.
Start with the new casualness. Given the dog's longstanding role in popular culture -- Rin Tin Tin, Timmy and Lassie -- it's understandable how canine companionship came to symbolize the good feeling that the new workplaces were meant to have. (For the record: Apple Computer, the archetypal Think Different high-tech company, banned all pets two years ago, in response to a growing number of employee complaints.)
Then there's the renegade, free-spiritedness implicit in the new, new ways of doing business. This may trace back to that guy in college -- since Woodstock, every campus has had at least one -- who never seems to be in class but can always be found on the central quad teaching his bandanna-wearing mixed-breed to catch a Frisbee. We now know that Frisbee Man was a Web entrepreneur in training.
Maybe the key to the dog code lies in the mathematics of Internet time. Dogs pack seven years of their lives into a single calendar year. Those working at Internet companies like to think they're packing seven years of their lives into a single day. The dot-com mantra -- 24/7/365 -- speaks either to a constancy of purpose or the inability to get one's work done during normal business hours.
Or maybe the dog in the manger -- sorry, typo -- in the manager's office, signifies the mongrelization of work and personal life. A decade ago, PC's and e-mail let people set up home offices and spend more time with their families. Today's pervasive Web technologies seem to encourage some companies to think of the office as home and the employees as surrogate families.
One executive in New York's Silicon Alley, telling the tale on the condition of professional anonymity, recalled a recent job interview that involved a dog.
The prospective employer was Razorfish, a publicly traded Web development company in Manhattan. Even before the interview, with Razorfish's chief executive, 33-year-old Jeff Dachis, she had already decided not to work at the company.
Why? She was put off by Mr. Dachis's dog, a large Weimaraner named Sophie, who sniffed about as the woman sat in the reception area.
Mr. Dachis said that without knowing more about the job candidate in question, he could not comment on the case. But he said Sophie accompanied him to work every day, and for people who aren't comfortable with that, "I'd tell those people to relax."
Besides, he said, it's not as if Razorfish was crawling with dogs. "The general rule is, no dogs allowed," Mr. Dachis said. "But Sophie is an exception. She's an amazing dog. She doesn't bark, she's friendly, she has short hair."
And employees are happy with the Sophie loophole? "My dog's part of the company," Mr. Dachis said. "I created it. I run it. For me to be happy at the company is important. Everyone feels that having Sophie around is such a soothing component of the work environment."
Elsewhere in Silicon Alley, Jerry Colonna, managing partner at the venture capital firm Flatiron Partners, which has helped finance many start-up companies, said he had "no strong feelings either way" on the dog debate.
But then Mr. Colonna told a story indicating that, even in the new economy, Bowser may not be good for business.
"I recall an entrepreneur who brought his dog with him when he and his staff came into our office to pitch for some capital," Mr. Colonna said. "The dog kept wandering around the conference room during the slide presentation -- very odd. One wall of the conference room is glass, and the dog kept bumping into it, thinking it was open space. Needless to say, the man didn't get funding."

HEADLINE: PC Sales in First Quarter Show Double-Digit Growth

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 23

 BODY:
The personal computer industry rode the Internet boom and Asia's nascent economic comeback to double-digit sales growth in the first quarter, two industry reports showed today.
While their preliminary figures differed slightly, both Dataquest Inc. and the International Data Corporation concluded that PC shipments increased by healthy margins during the first three months of 2000. 
 The research groups estimated that manufacturers shipped 30 million personal computers in the quarter ended March 31. Dataquest, a unit of the Gartner Group, said worldwide sales grew 15 percent compared with results in the period a year earlier, while IDC estimated the increase at 20 percent.
Of those totals, Dataquest said 11.1 million PC's were sold in the United States, a 14.5 percent increase. IDC recorded United States sales of 11.6 million PC's, a 17 percent improvement.
Consumers eager for access to the Internet helped offset a corporate spending lull on PC's during the quarter, the companies said.
Bruce Stephen, an analyst with IDC, attributed the sluggish business market to a "Y2K hangover" caused by efforts to protect corporate computer systems from potential problems caused by the rollover from 1999 to 2000.
As Asia's economy continued its recovery from a deep recession, the region's consumers and businesses bought PC's at a robust pace. Sales in the Asia-Pacific market rose by 36 percent in the first quarter, and shipments climbed by 35 percent in Japan, IDC said.
Even though the PC industry remains on a roll, a Dataquest analyst, Charles Smulders, warned that a sales slowdown looms if manufacturers do not develop a new generation of more powerful, stylish machines that persuade businesses and consumers to replace their existing systems.
"The market is getting pretty saturated," Mr. Smulders said.
For now, manufacturers are having trouble getting the necessary parts to keep pace with current demand. The two biggest chip makers, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, both said they had been caught off guard by the first-quarter demand.

HEADLINE: A War Story's Missing Pages: Vietnam Forgets Those Who Lost

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: THU DUC, Vietnam

 BODY:
The eyes of Cpl. Le Van Nao have been gouged out of the enamel portrait on his tombstone in the abandoned South Vietnamese military cemetery where he was buried with honors 31 years ago.
Wandering cows tear at dry tufts of grass where acres of similar tombstones lean this way and that, many of them smashed and vandalized, some uprooted and lying on the ground beside empty graves. 
 Just across a nearby highway lies the carefully tended grave of Capt. Nguyen Xuan Truong, who also died in 1969 at the height of the Vietnam War. He is one of thousands of soldiers on the victorious Communist side who are buried in what is known as a "martyrs' cemetery," their tombstones surrounded by raked gravel paths and beds of flowers.
On official holidays formal ceremonies are held to honor these fallen Communist soldiers. But just 10 miles away to the south, many people in Ho Chi Minh City -- formerly called Saigon -- do not even know of the existence of the abandoned graveyard across the road.
This, in summary, is the story of the war as told today by the victors. It is a tale of heroic nationalists who triumphed over American interlopers in a decade-long war that ended 25 years ago on April 30.
America's South Vietnamese allies, who lost, have been virtually written out of history. Indeed they have mostly been forgotten by both the Vietnamese and American governments, who are engaged now in an emerging effort of reconciliation.
But there has been little effort by the Northern victors to embrace their fraternal enemies, who seem to be remembered, at least by the older generation, with less generosity than is accorded to the Americans.
"I think they have all run away to the United States," said a Communist army veteran, echoing the dismissive attitude of many in the north. "Even those who were kept in camps have left. They are all gone."
This willful blind spot is one sign of continuing frictions between the north and south of Vietnam despite the economic and political integration the government has worked hard to foster.
Among some northerners, suspicions persist that they have not truly won the hearts and minds of everyone in the south. Among some older southerners, resentments linger over lost lives, lost homes, lost careers and lost hopes.
The first years of what is officially known as national reunification were harsh for the people who lived in the defeated south.
More than a million southerners fled the country after the war ended. Some 400,000 were interned in camps for "re-education" -- many only briefly, but some for as long as 17 years. Another 1.5 million were forcibly resettled in "new economic zones" in barren areas of southern Vietnam that were ravaged by hunger and extreme poverty.
These postwar scars linger too.
"For Vietnam, 1975 was the year of national reunification geographically and 1976 was the year of national reunification legislatively," said a Vietnamese journalist in Hanoi. "But for national reunification psychologically it will take several decades more."
Not only are the graves of the southern soldiers left untended, their parents' sacrifice is ignored as well. Only the mothers of Communist soldiers are accorded the title of "hero mother" and are entitled to a small monthly pension.
And while the Communist government helps the United States search for the remains of the last few hundred American soldiers listed as missing in action, and while the Americans share information that could help the Hanoi government track down its own 300,000 missing soldiers, no one has even tried to count the number of soldiers who are missing from the southern side.
One veteran of the South Vietnamese Army, still bitter at heart, was asked how old soldiers like him manage accept these inequities.
"Because we were defeated," said the veteran, who lost not only a war but also his career and social position. "You know, we have accepted that. And we don't have the right to say anything. It has been so for many years. From year to year we forget."
What, then, for people like him, is April 30, the national holiday that celebrates the northern victory?
"We used to call it the big day of mourning," he said. "Now it's just a day off from work. And this year it falls on a Sunday, so we don't even get our day off."
These are the resentments of the older generation, however. The war is not even a memory for more than half the population, born after 1975.
For them, the greatest passions on display do not differentiate between north and south. These are the wild celebrations -- sometimes beyond the control of the police -- when the national soccer team scores an important victory against a foreign competitor.
For some others, the bitter resentments of the past are mellowing into humor.
"Are you red or yellow?" one man teased another as they drank whiskey the other day at a sidewalk stall in Ho Chi Minh City. The colors referred to the wartime flags of the North and the South.
"Today," said his friend, "we are orange."
Foreign scholars debate whether Vietnam is one historical entity that was divided by war or whether the the regional differences among the south, the center and the north are more deeply rooted.
It was only in the 18th century that the southern region, formerly a part of the Khmer civilization of Cambodia, became an integral part of Vietnam, said Robert Templer, the author of "Shadows and Wind: A View of Modern Vietnam" (Little, Brown, 1998). The French colonialists of the next century set the country's borders and divided it by historical region into three parts: the south, center and north.
The "reunification" of 1975 was in fact the first time that Vietnam was an independent nation within its current borders. Since then, the government in Hanoi has taken great pains to maintain a geographical balance in the central leadership.
The first decade of reunification, some scholars say, was a period of "northernization" of the south, when property and farmland were seized by the state and northern officials took over most of the administration.
The free-market reforms that began in 1986 have led some people to refer to the second postwar decade as the "southernization" of Vietnam.
Today, the south is the nation's economic engine, producing two-thirds of its wealth and helping to support the north by sending nearly 90 percent of its tax revenue to the central government in Hanoi. More than $1 billion a year in foreign currency floods into Vietnam to the families of southerners who fled the country.
These are statistics people in the south like to mention when they recite their grievances.
But the years are passing and, as the South Vietnamese Army veteran said, "The wind blows, and it blows away your memories."
He has a 15-year-old son who is more interested in soccer and his friends than in the conflicts of his father's generation.
"The young people, they don't know about us," the veteran said. "They don't know about our past. We don't tell them who we are. It is better for them not to know."
Some day, he said, he may tell his son his story, as well as the story of his own older brother, who also liked soccer and who died as a soldier for the south in 1974.
At a weed-covered shrine on a hill overlooking the abandoned South Vietnamese cemetery, monsoon rains and mold have mostly worn away a heroic inscription: "They died for their country; they sacrificed for their people."
Clusters of old incense sticks sprout from the ground in front of a memorial plaque where someone, not too long ago, wrote in blue marker pen the words: "With respect."
On hot afternoons, a young man named Nguyen Minh Quang likes to rest here in the quiet shade of the shrine. He is a laborer at one of several tiny brick factories that are digging up the thick yellow soil around the graves to bake in their kilns.
Mr. Quang is just 24 and said he never bothered to learn the history of his cool refuge or of the graves that lie beyond it. But he said people do come by from time to time to kneel in front of the memorial plaque and pay their respects.
Others -- perhaps overseas Vietnamese who have returned for visits -- sometimes pay the brick workers to maintain the grave of a brother or a son.
In fact, the young man said, his own father, a wounded veteran who was a sergeant in South Vietnam's Special Forces, visits the shrine once or twice a year to pray.
"He likes to come up here and light incense, but I don't know what for," said the young man. "I only see him come and light the incense. He told me he fought with the Americans. I never asked him why."

HEADLINE: Paul Bao-Jen Chu, Ex-Professor And International Labor Expert

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Paul Bao-Jen Chu, a former international labor official and retired professor at Rutgers University, died on April 6 at a hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla., where he had moved from Bethesda, Md., four years ago.
He was 85.
Dr. Chu also formerly lived in Geneva and Bellemead, N.J. 
 A native of Shanghai, he was an economics graduate of Oberlin College and received an M.A. in international relations from the University of California at Berkeley. He was with the International Labor Organization in Geneva from 1948 to 1974, rising to chief of its workers' education branch.
When the organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968, it credited Dr. Chu with helping to shape and put into effect adult labor education programs and child labor laws.
He joined the Rutgers faculty as a professor of labor education and international relations in 1974, and headed the university's labor studies department until he retired in 1983.
Over his career, Dr. Chu was credited with some 120 publications and reports on labor laws and economics.
He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Phyllis Shu-Yuan Teng Chu; a daughter, Dr. Pauline Chu Pan of Denville, N.J.; a son, Donald Liang, of Morris Plains, N.J.; three brothers, Philip Bao-Mei, of Honolulu, Dr. David Bao-Shen, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Dr. James Bao-Teh, of North Haven, Conn.; two sisters, Constance Bao-Hwa Chu Chien of Manhattan and Rosalind Bao-Yuen Chu of the Bronx; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Immigrants Swell Catholic Clergy

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 20

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago this month, when Saigon fell to Communist armies, the tract of land off Dwyer Road was a just another soggy stretch of wetlands that ran from New Orleans's eastern fringe to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, many miles away.
"This was swamp," said Msgr. Dominic Luong, a Roman Catholic priest and Fordham University graduate who arrived here in the late 1970's. 
 But these days Monsignor Luong can look from his modest office and see a spacious beige church bordered by a trim lawn where three flags -- the Stars and Stripes, a banner representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the yellow and red flag of the former South Vietnam -- snap in the spring breeze.
The church that rose from this drained swamp is Mary Queen of Vietnam, spiritual home to 5,000 parishioners and a landmark both for the growing influence of Vietnamese Catholics in the United States and for the larger church, too, whose demographic contours are being reshaped by immigration.
Major changes in immigration law, together with political and economic upheavals abroad, have brought an influx of Latin Americans, Asians, eastern Europeans and Africans, many of them Catholics whose impact on the church may prove as great as that of the Germans, Irish and Italians who preceded them a century ago.
Among this new group, the Vietnamese are a small minority, but their presence is hard to miss. They have formed parishes and missions across this very Catholic city, as well as in Texas and California, established an annual pilgrimage of tens of thousands of people to southwestern Missouri and, most significantly, produced a disproportionately high number of young men and women studying to become priests and nuns -- when such religious vocations have been in short supply among American-born Catholics.
A few miles to the west, for example, in New Orleans's stately Uptown, Vietnamese seminarians make up a fifth of those studying for the priesthood at Notre Dame Seminary.
On social issues, they tend to be conservative, opposed to abortion and the idea of women as priests.
"Religion is their center -- they brought that with them," said Kyle Dave, 29, a seminarian who is a native of New Orleans and grew up in a neighborhood that absorbed many Vietnamese immigrants.
American Catholic officials say most Vietnamese immigrants are Buddhists, but about 300,000 -- perhaps a third of them -- are Catholics.
That amounts to less than 1 percent of the estimated 61 million Catholics in the United States. But Vietnamese seminarians make up nearly 3 percent of the approximately 3,500 men studying for the priesthood, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, an organization at Georgetown University that studies such trends.
Michael W. Foley, an associate professor of political science at Catholic University, in Washington, D.C., who conducted a study of several new immigrant groups for the American bishops, said, "Seminary enrollments have been on a down slide since the 1960's, and we see some modest recoveries as a result of this new blood."
"The same thing is true of the church as a whole," Mr. Foley said. "The Catholic Church is the only mainline church that has not lost members over the past 20 years, and I think a case could be made for the immigrants as the primary reason."
In May, the Archdiocese of New Orleans will ordain seven seminarians as deacons, a transitional step toward their becoming priests. Among them is Hoang M. Tuong, 31, a parishioner at Mary Queen of Vietnam, who arrived here in 1984, after he and his family fled Vietnam by sea in a tidal exodus of "boat people." Not long after the family arrived here, he entered a high school seminary, a first step along the road he is now following.
"Vietnamese families are very big," Mr. Tuong said, adding that parents often hope to have "at least one" child become a priest or nun. "I have only three sisters," he said. "My family is very small."
Monsignor Luong said he was one of 11 children -- 8 boys and 3 girls. One brother also became a priest and serves among the Montagnard people in central Vietnam.
Monsignor Luong was ordained in 1965 in New York. Over the last two decades, he has become well known in Catholic circles for his work among Vietnamese immigrants.
He recalled the early days in New Orleans East as difficult for Vietnamese Catholics. "We had nothing," he said. "We worshiped outdoors for two years." It sometimes rained on Sundays, but the weather, as he remembered it, always seemed to clear before Mass.
The parish at which he presides was founded in 1983, the beginning of a decade-long boom in the area's Vietnamese population, as immigrants who had been settled in other parts of the nation began to move here. A spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of New Orleans said about 20,000 Catholics were of Asian background, primarily Vietnamese -- about 4 percent of the half-million parishioners here.
Other big centers for Vietnamese Catholics are Houston; San Jose, Calif., and Orange County, Calif. There are smaller communities as well. Monsignor Luong said he recently traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, for the installation of a Vietnamese-born priest there.
Behind his office is a two-story structure that houses a preschool, run by Vietnamese-born nuns who were busy supervising dozens of children in an Easter egg hunt this week.
Sister Mary Faustina Nguyen Bach Yen, 28, said she was 8 years old when her family fled Vietnam in 1979. After more than a year in a refugee camp, the family moved to New Orleans.
The third child among eight, she originally helped her parents in a small business. But, she said, "I was searching for inner peace." As a teenager, she felt a call to become a nun and eventually joined the Daughters of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, the order that supervises the preschool. It has 40 nuns, and four novices preparing to take vows. But, she said, "This is just a small branch in the United States." The order has hundreds of nuns in Vietnam.
Another Vietnamese order visible in the United States is the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, which has a monastery in Carthage, Mo. Each summer, the site becomes a pilgrimage destination for Vietnamese families. "They draw 30,000 to 40,000," Monsignor Luong said.
But as Vietnamese immigrants become rooted in the United States, a question arises. How long will such devotion endure in a culture that esteems material wealth and individual choice?
Already, some of the nuns at the preschool say, it is less easy to talk to a younger generation about a religious vocation than it was to speak with their older brothers and sisters a decade ago. The preschool's director, Sister Rose Tin Vu, said many adolescents' interests tended toward American culture. "Money and fashion" often preoccupy them, she said.
Sister Mary Faustina, who teaches religious education classes to teenagers, agreed. "Most of the teenagers, they've got peer pressure," she said. "It's very hard to listen to the inner voice, to listen to the heart."

HEADLINE: Surviving the Cycle-Business Downturn;
A Maker of Heavy-Duty Bikes Endures in a Fading Industry

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Morris Worksman was a man ahead of his time. In 1898, he had a vision that horse carts could be replaced with human-powered vehicles that would not foul the streets with messy horse byproducts. He finally got his break in the early 1930's when a young company called Good Humor asked him to build delivery tricycles for its ice cream peddlers, establishing the Good Humor man as an American icon.
More than 100 years after the original vision, Worksman Trading, the company he founded, is still making heavy-duty trikes and bikes in New York City. Only now it seems like an anachronism. 
 Manufacturing has long been on the decline in New York City. In the 1950's, there were 970,000 manufacturing jobs in the five boroughs. By 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, the number had dropped to 257,000.
And bicycle manufacturing in the United States is also fading fast. In the last eight months, Huffy and Roadmaster, the two largest domestic makers of bicycles found at retailers like Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, announced that they would close their American factories in the face of competition from low-priced imports from China.
What is left of the domestic bicycle industry are a handful of relatively small companies and manufacturing boutiques that make expensive high-performance models for cycling enthusiasts.
Worksman illustrates the difficulties of trying to make it as an old-line manufacturer in New York City at a time when Internet start-ups and store openings grab the spotlight.
Worksman survives by dominating the market for what it calls industrial cycles. The company's tricycles are used by other manufacturers like Boeing, Chrysler and Ford to move workers, tools and parts around cavernous factories and warehouses. Its two-wheelers are popular with pizzerias in the city as delivery bikes. The D'Agostino chain relies on Worksman pushcarts to deliver groceries.
Worksman also sells a line of recreational bicycles and tricycles as well as food vending carts. "If you have ever bought a hot dog on a street corner in New York, chances are we had something to do with it," said Wayne J. Sosin, Worksman's vice president.
Yet despite a booming economy, the company, which employs 60, says it is under pressure on several fronts. Many of its best corporate customers have merged or moved offshore. Restrictions on sidewalk vending licenses in the city have essentially dried up the local market, once its most lucrative. And there is the threat of competition from Asian manufacturers that can undercut Worksman's prices.
"It's a difficult fight staying in New York," said Jeffrey Mishkin, Worksman's president, whose wife, Barbara, is Mr. Worksman's granddaughter. "I don't want to look at moving away, but with costs becoming very tight, I may reach a point in time when I have no choice."
Worksman's battle plan has been to broaden its offerings. Besides its flagship industrial cycles, the company offers a folding tricycle for older riders and a two-seat model that it says is popular with the disabled. One of its newest products is the ExecuTrike, a lighter-weight version of its industrial model with a basket on the back, intended to speed managers around the factory floor.
The company is also trying to expand overseas, selling to European manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, which now owns Chrysler.
All of the company's products are produced at its factory in Ozone Park, Queens. Brightly colored frames, wheels and partly assembled bikes are stacked around one of the shop floors along with boxes of bike components.
Worksman does not produce its cycles on assembly lines. Instead, workers spend a day or two making components as they are needed. On a recent day, frames were being welded from steel tubes in one corner of the floor, while on the other side of the room wheels were being built by a machine that inserted four spokes at a time until all 36 were in place.
Mario Carmona, 65, has been at Worksman for 25 years, building wheels and operating and maintaining the machines. After immigrating from Puerto Rico in 1953, he said, he worked for 16 years at Iberson, a bicycle manufacturer in Brooklyn, joining Worksman after that company went out of business.
"They treat me good," he said of Worksman. "It's like a family, I have been working here for so long."
Ricky Lalman, 31, who was born in Trinidad, has been working in the shipping department for 11 years. His brother, who services bikes, has been with the company 12 years.
Mr. Lalman also said that Worksman felt like a family but added that too much real family is not necessarily good. Both his parents also worked at the company but quit after a few years. "Sometimes you don't want your parents working where you work," he said.
Worksman prides itself on the durability of its cycles, which sell for $200 to $1,000. Mr. Sosin said people still ask for parts on models it stopped selling in the 1960's.
"They do make a durable product," said Ali Khan, the director of maintenance at D'Agostino's, which bought 100 three-wheeled Worksman push carts for its home deliveries. After a truck hit one of the carts last month, he was pleasantly surprised to see that it had rolled away without extensive damage. "We call them delivery tanks," he said.
Craig Clark, a project coordinator at a plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, where Ford makes Mercury minivans, has bought 15 Worksman tricycles in the last five years. "I have a nice yellow one," he said. "I keep it chained up so it doesn't disappear."
Mr. Clark added that the trikes save time moving people around the sprawling plant, do not pollute, are quiet and give workers some exercise. "We throw a lot of weight on them," he said. "You've got to make sure there is enough air in the tires, but other than that you can really load them down."
That is exactly what Morris Worksman had in mind when he surveyed the busy streets outside his toy shop in Lower Manhattan in the late 1800's. A compulsive tinkerer, Mr. Worksman invented a differential gear for an early three-wheeled Harley-Davidson motorcycle, Mr. Mishkin said. He also made tricycles with cabinets attached.
Barbara Mishkin, his granddaughter, recalled her grandmother's saying that in those early days Mr. Worksman spent all the family's money on patents. "They moved from place to place because they didn't have enough money for food," she said.
All three of Mr. Worksman's children ended up working with him. It was his youngest son, Irving, then still in his teens, who struck the deal with Good Humor. That enabled the company to move from Manhattan to a bigger space in Brooklyn. In 1979, Worksman moved to its current factory in Queens.
After Morris Worksman's death, Irving took over the business. In 1987, just before Irving died, he sold it to his daughter and son-in-law and to Mr. Sosin, who had joined Worksman as head of sales eight years earlier. Last month, during his spring break as a business administration major at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, the Mishkins' son Brian, 21, was working in the shipping department, learning the business from the ground up.
"If he likes it, maybe one day he will want to take over," Mr. Mishkin said.
Just how difficult things are for Worksman is hard to tell, because the company is privately owned and will not divulge information about sales and profits. Jay C. Townley, a longtime bicycle industry executive who is now a consultant in Lyndon Station, Wis., said he believed that Worksman was not in imminent danger.
"The people who have tried to compete with Worksman have mostly dropped by the wayside," he said. "Worksman is going to be fine."
In 1979, the city helped finance the company's move to Queens by giving it tax breaks for 20 years. That arrangement ended last fall, returning the company to its full tax rate.
Now Worksman's owners would like the city to do more. They are looking for a new location where they can operate on a single floor rather than three, to improve efficiency. But there are few such spaces and real estate is expensive.
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, would not comment specifically about Worksman but said there were a number of programs to help companies expand and stay in the city.
Mr. Sosin has hinted that Worksman may not be able to resist the siren calls of Southern states that are offering long-term tax holidays and other incentives.
But Mr. Mishkin appears committed to New York and its diversity. Most of the company's workers live nearby and are immigrants from countries like Guyana, Jamaica, Poland and Senegal. "You have a very good labor pool here," he said, noting that about one-third of Worksman's employees have been with the company 15 years or more.
"We don't want to leave the city," he said. "We are part of the city, just like the street vendors you see. There are no incentives that anybody would give me that would be more worthwhile if the city just made it a little easier for us."

HEADLINE: Bush's Approach to the Uninsured May Be Vulnerable in Its Details

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush's health care plan is a deft piece of politics, many analysts agree, a case study in the carefully calibrated philosophy of compassionate conservatism.
It is a pledge to do something big about the 44 million uninsured and a response to the voters who, in poll after poll, say Democrats would do a better job than Republicans on health care. 
 It is a nod to conservatives, who cherish a belief in free market solutions and hate the idea of expanding government programs.
And it is a parry to Democrats who argue that Republicans have nothing much to say about important social issues like health care, issues that are now at the top of the voters' agenda.
But Mr. Bush's proposal, announced this month in a flurry of domestic policy speeches, also has serious vulnerabilities, some leading health policy experts say, weaknesses that the Democrats are eager to exploit.
And the stakes in this debate are high: Mr. Bush's credibility on issues like health that are generally seen as working to the advantage of Democrats will have much to do with the outcome of the race.
"People want a president who's going to address some of these issues and looks like he cares about them," said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard University. "And he's saying, 'Look, I'm a Republican, a conservative, I'm going to do it with markets, but I will try to address some of these problems.' "
It is, some political professionals have suggested, a version of what President Clinton did in 1992, when he staked his claim to traditionally Republican issues like crime and "ending welfare as we know it."
The struggle in the presidential campaign is echoed on Capitol Hill, where House Republican leaders recently presented their plan, relying heavily on private insurance, to provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly, a problem the Democrats have been campaigning on for 18 months.
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, asserted of Republicans: "They seem to have adopted a strategy of muting differences, but my sense is they're doing it rhetorically. They're trying to talk the talk and not walk the walk."
John C. Goodman, an adviser to Mr. Bush on health, says Republicans are offering market-oriented solutions to important social problems left to languish under the Democrats.
"Clinton and Gore had eight years to deal with this problem, and each and every year the number of uninsured went up," said Mr. Goodman, who is president of the National Center for Policy Analysis. He added, "You can argue that the Bush plan is not generous enough, but it is certainly more than we have now, and it's a step in the right direction."
There are, in fact, fundamental differences between the Gore and Bush approaches to helping the uninsured. Mr. Gore, who announced his health care plan last year, would expand existing government programs, mostly the Children's Health Insurance Program, to cover the most vulnerable uninsured, one group at a time, with a goal of ensuring that all children would have access to affordable coverage by 2005.
Mr. Bush's plan is essentially premised on the belief that coverage can be expanded through the private health care marketplace if low-income people are simply given assistance with the cost of premiums.
"We will not nationalize our health care system," the Texas governor declared when he announced his plan. "We will rely on private insurance. But make no mistake: In my administration, low-income Americans will have access to high-quality health care."
Mr. Bush's basic tool is a tax credit of up to $2,000 for a family -- $1,000 for an individual -- that they can use to cover up to 90 percent of the cost of health insurance. It is a refundable tax credit, meaning that even people who pay no taxes would receive it. The full amount would be available to families with incomes up to $30,000 who are not covered by their employer or any public program, and it would gradually phase out with higher income, ending at $60,000.
The problem with the Bush plan, some health experts say, is that the tax credit falls far short of the cost of a family health policy. Jonathan Gruber, a former Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration and a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has estimated that $2,000 would cover "about 31 percent of the premiums for a typical uninsured family" in the open market.
Chip Kahn, head of the Health Insurance Association of America, described the Bush proposal as "a positive move that will clearly help many of the people who are not now covered by other programs," but added, "This is not going to pay the entire premium for many people, and the problem at the low-income worker level is affordability."
Mr. Kahn said "a decent family plan" that was employer-sponsored would cost about $5,000 to $6,000. Someone purchasing a plan on the individual market might be able to buy one for a few thousand dollars less, he said, but would probably end up with high deductibles and coinsurance payments.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said comparisons to averages were "not fair because it includes all the Cadillac plans out there."
"The best way to help people who have nothing," Mr. Fleischer said, "is to get them started with the essentials of coverage," like hospitalization and visits to the doctor. Moreover, he said, other parts of the Bush tax-cut package will give additional help to low-income families.
Still, some health care experts say low-income families are unlikely to be interested in bare-bone policies -- Mr. Gruber called them "repo-man policies" because they essentially protect the family car from being repossessed in the event of a health care catastrophe -- particularly if their share of the premium is substantial. Bush advisers counter that the marketplace will respond to this new pool of potential buyers with new low-cost policies.
Mr. Gruber, who recently analyzed the tax credit approach in general for the journal Health Affairs, said of such arguments: "This is the field of dreams approach -- if you build it, they will come. But it is hard to imagine that they'll come up with a product that costs $2,000 that is valued by families. You're talking about shaving two-thirds of the cost off a health insurance policy. How will you do that and still have a good product?"
There are other criticisms of the tax credit approach. For example, Henry Aaron, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, is one of several experts who worry that such an approach will end up creating incentives for employers to get out of the health insurance business.
But one of the most pervasive criticisms in health policy circles is that tax credits are not the most efficient way to reach the low-income uninsured. Mr. Gore's defenders assert that government programs like Children's Health Insurance are far more cost-effective and reliable.
"The truth is, the right answer is probably some combination," Mr. Gruber said. "Pay for the insurance for the guys at the bottom, subsidize the insurance for the guys in the middle, is probably the right combination, but it's too expensive in the current political climate. If I had to choose, I would choose spending money for the guys at the bottom, because that's just a much more efficient use of public dollars."
But that points to an underlying division between the two parties, less dramatic, perhaps, than it was 35 years ago when the Democrats were pushing through Medicare, but still real.
"The Bush philosophy is let's expand private insurance and give more people the opportunity to use private insurance," said Mr. Goodman, the adviser to Mr. Bush. "The Gore philosophy is let's expand government programs. Government plans haven't worked very well in the past."
But many Democrats consider government programs like Medicare to be crowning achievements, even though the failure of the Clinton effort to provide universal health insurance has forced their party into smaller-scale policy initiatives.
Whether the voters appreciate all these distinctions is another matter. "They're just very confused," Mr. Blendon said. "They'd like something done about this, but we've tried to say 'choose among the various plans' and they're all over the place."
For example, a survey by Mr. Blendon in December found roughly similar levels of support for three different approaches to the uninsured: expanding programs like Children's Health Insurance, providing tax deductions and credits to use for insurance and requiring employers to provide health insurance for their workers, which was a centerpiece of the failed Clinton plan.
Still, after mounting an effective assault on rival Bill Bradley's health care proposal in the primaries, the Gore forces are battle-tested. As they make their case, Democrats clearly hope to focus on Mr. Bush's health care record.
Christopher Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, asserted that "the Bush philosophy" had done little for Texas, which fares poorly on a variety of health care measures, including the number of uninsured.
The new Bush proposal, Mr. Lehane said, is "an irresponsible plan akin to giving someone who needs surgery a Band-Aid."
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, "On each of these issues, where Republicans try to move back in our direction, the question always is can we make clear a real and important difference between what Democrats are for and what Republicans are for?"
That will be a "more nuanced debate," Mr. Garin said, but a very real one. And as Democrats know from their own rueful experience, when it comes to health care, the truism holds: the devil is in the details.

HEADLINE: Orange Juice Tariff Hinders Trade Pact For U.S. and Brazil

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA with SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
If the universe holds a more ideal place for growing oranges than Matao, it has yet to be discovered. The mix of sun, soil and revitalizing rain in this section of southeastern Brazil so perfectly suits citrus that the trees planted in vast plantations across rolling red hills almost bow to the ground with oranges waiting to be picked.
Nobody grows or squeezes more oranges than Brazil, where orange trees now outnumber people and 400,000 workers rely on oranges for their livelihoods. 
 Since most of the 170 million people in Brazil are not in the habit of drinking orange juice, all but 1 percent of the juice is exported. Much goes to the United States, where Americans are the globe's biggest consumers of orange juice, drinking 68 million glasses every day.
In a world of open borders, this pairing of abundant supply and growing demand should come close to free-trade nirvana. But Washington has imposed heavy tariffs on orange juice from Brazil since 1987. And Clinton administration officials, otherwise considered free traders, are currently conducting a review to determine whether to extend tariffs when they expire next month.
America's reaction to Brazil's prodigious output has become a sore spot in hemispheric relations, an unexpectedly emotional issue that has stymied trade negotiators, riled American citrus growers and infuriated every Brazilian who has anything to do with oranges.
"When we sit down at the negotiating table with American trade representatives they treat it as a joke and say, 'We have orange juice here for you today,' " said Regis Arslanian, head of trade policy for Brazil's embassy in Washington. "It has become such an emotional issue for us because we really think these tariffs are absurd."
Brazilians point out the inconsistencies in American tariffs and charge that the levies on juice are protectionist, plain and simple, just like similar duties imposed on rolled steel, shoes and other goods from Brazil. While 92 percent of American tariffs fall below 10 percent, those on juice from Brazil range as high as 63 percent, which adds about 30 cents to the price of a gallon of juice in American supermarkets.
Growers in Florida -- the heart of America's citrus industry -- say the tariffs are needed because Brazilian growers do not have to meet health and safety standards as demanding as those in the United States, which makes juice production cheaper there. Some American growers also say Brazil subsidizes growers, and claim that some Brazilian growers employ children in the groves.
The child labor charges rankle in Brazil, especially since President Clinton lumped Brazil in with Pakistan and Guatemala when he criticized the use of child labor in a December speech. Brazilian officials refuted the president's claim, which referred to the shoe industry. And Brazilian juice exporters say children do not work in the groves.
Orange juice tariffs are also complicating United States efforts to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (F.T.A.A.) by the year 2005. Not surprisingly, given the controversy over orange juice, Brazil's current priority is reviving the Mercosur trade pact with Argentina and other South American countries, not entering a sweeping new agreement with the United States.
"We are not terribly anxious to negotiate a F.T.A.A.," said Rubens Antonio Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador to Washington. "We have taken part in all working groups, but this doesn't mean that we are willing to accept everything that the Americans put forward."
American trade officials said orange juice tariffs would not be lowered or eliminated unless a broad trade agreement was reached with Brazil. That happened with Mexico after implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"We attach a great importance to our large and growing relationship with Brazil," said Regina K. Vargo, a deputy assistant secretary in the Department of Commerce. "But we could find our way over some of these longstanding difficulties if we could be engaging a little sooner in talks for the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas."
A decision on extending the orange tariffs another year is scheduled to be made next month. No one expects them to end, but in what could be a sign of weakening government support, two members of the International Trade Commission issued a dissenting opinion in a recent review of the policy, arguing that American orange growers no longer need to be protected.
But American growers say the tariffs are all that saves them from absolute ruin. They claim that the large shipments from Brazil have forced down prices for fresh oranges to less than half what they were a decade ago. "Eliminating the special tariff would be akin to suicide for our industry," said Andrew W. LaVigne, chief executive officer of the Florida Citrus Mutual, a cooperative representing 11,500 citrus growers in Florida, where most domestic juice is produced. "That would literally put our guys out of business."
It was American growers and processors, often working together in cooperatives, who got Brazil into the orange juice business about 40 years ago. After one of the freezes that regularly devastate Florida's citrus crop, the Americans encouraged Brazilian farmers to convert coffee plantations to orange groves. The Americans thought the newly planted groves in the state of Sao Paulo would give them insurance against future freezes.
The Brazilian groves were so spectacularly successful that by the early 1980's they were outproducing Florida's own groves. California and Texas also grow oranges, but the varieties there are more suited to eating than squeezing into juice. Most of the Brazilian juice is boiled and turned into a highly concentrated liquid that can be frozen into a concentrated slush, which is later blended with water and sold as 100 percent orange juice from concentrate.
By 1985, Brazilian concentrate made up 45 percent of the American market, with no limit in sight.
Florida growers fought to limit the inroads of Brazilian juice producers. Through heavy advertising and marketing, Florida growers linked orange juice and Florida in the minds of American consumers.
Some American producers also developed a higher-priced category of juice called not-from-concentrate, which is heated only enough for pasteurization and never has the water boiled out of it. The high cost and logistical challenges of transporting fresh orange juice 4,000 miles from Brazil to the United States have kept Brazil out of the premium market.
Florida growers also filed formal complaints against Brazil with the International Trade Commission in the mid-1980's. The commission determined that Brazilians were selling juice in the United States for less than they did in Brazil, or dumping frozen concentrate in the United States. The first antidumping order was issued in 1987, and they have continued ever since.
The tariffs on imported juice helped American growers regain some lost market share. In 1998, local production accounted for 64 percent of the domestic market of orange juice concentrate, while Brazilian supplies accounted for just 12 percent.
Despite the barriers to entering the United States market, Brazilian growers have continued planting trees and redoubled efforts to export more juice to Europe.
In addition, some big Brazilian companies have purchased processing plants in Florida. These companies now control enough of the processing industry in Florida to influence prices for bulk juice from concentrate, which they buy from growers in either Florida or Brazil. Often, the effect is to lower prices paid for concentrate from Florida.
"The gains from going transnational are many," said Ademerval Garcia, president of Abecitrus, a trade organization representing Brazil's major orange juice exporters.
But moving into a competitor's market can backfire. Early this year workers at a plant in Auburndale, Fla., which had been purchased by a Brazilian company, went on strike for six weeks to protest unfair labor practices. The plant had been owned and operated by Minute Maid, a division of Coca-Cola, until it was sold to Cutrale Citrus in 1996. Cutrale is one of the largest orange juice producers in Brazil and a longtime supplier to Minute Maid.
"For 30 years prior to the sale to Cutrale, that plant had no strikes, no complaints, no accidents in which any workers were killed," said Carin R. Zelenko, assistant director of the office of corporate and strategic initiatives at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has represented plant workers for 30 years.
Since the plant was sold, one worker has been killed in an accident and Cutrale's efforts to increase production have led to deteriorating health and safety conditions and a failed state food safety inspection, Ms. Zelenko said.
Hugh W. Thompson, president of Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., said the charges were unfounded. He accused the union of spreading false information to strengthen its negotiating position for coming contract negotiations. "We have spent more than $30 million on these plants in the last few years and we will spend another $35 to $40 million over the next three to five years," Mr. Thompson said. "Conditions are better now than when we bought these plants."
Besides Cutrale, the other Brazilian company to enter the United States market was Citrosuco Paulista, which acquired a plant in Lake Wales, Fla., in 1997.
Adding to the tension between Brazil and the United States is the entrance into the Florida market of two other big companies. Louis Dreyfus, a French commodities company, recently purchased a processing plant in Winter Garden. And Cargill Inc., the large American commodities company that processes oranges in Brazil, has taken over plants in Frostproof and La Belle.
Along with the big Brazilian processors operating in both Florida and Brazil, these companies can regulate how much juice they take from each country depending on whose prices are lower, said Philip F. Lesser, director of economic and market research for the Florida Department of Citrus.
Together, the four big concerns have enough capacity to process about 30 percent of American orange production. In Brazil, these same four dominate more than 80 percent of the market.
To local growers like Charles F. Roper, whose family owns 1,800 acres of trees in Winter Garden, hemispheric tensions and global politics simply boil down to more difficult days.
"It's sort of been inevitable that competition would come in from somewhere else," he said. "It's part of being in a world market."

Stock Market Turmoil Hurts Online Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
The recent Wall Street sell-off has shaken consumer confidence, at least among online consumers, according to a survey to be released today.
NPD Group, a research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., surveyed 5,000 Internet users nationwide online, and gauged their confidence in the overall economy and local job markets. It also asked consumers and assess their own familiess' financial health and to forecast their households' online spending for the next three months.
Respondents said they planned to spend less money on purchases made over the Internet in the coming months, although NPD said that at least some of the expected downturn might be attributable to seasonal swings in online categories like books and music. 
 The respondents, surveyed on and immediately after April 14, the day of the stock market's steepest recent drop, reported the lowest confidence in the economy since the monthly study began in January.
Using January as a benchmark of 100, the confidence index was 95.8, down a half-point from the March poll.
And yet, while respondents indicated that their own families' financial situations were slightly worse than in March, they tended to say they were better off than at the start of the year.
The gap between respondents' assessment of the overall economy and their own families' situations, may "confirm the wealth effect" that economists like the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, have cited, in the view of Karl Irons, NPD's president of online research.
"People really do think they're wealthier than they are, and that they're insulated from the economy," Mr. Irons said. BOB TEDESCHI

HEADLINE: UNIONS DENY STAND OVER TRADE POLICY IS PROTECTIONISM

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
The American labor movement, while waging its biggest battle ever against trade liberalization, is trying to fend off charges from many economists, business executives and members of Congress that it has re-embraced protectionism.
Many critics assert that labor's across-the-board fight against trade expansion measures, including the China and Africa trade bills, represents a crass effort to protect American jobs by preventing imports from increasing. 
 Insisting that they have jettisoned their past protectionism, union officials say they oppose these trade initiatives only because they fail to protect the rights of foreign workers.
With its power magnified in a campaign year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 68 member unions, has been by far the most powerful voice against the China trade bill, helping sway scores of Democrats, including Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, to oppose it. The Senate is expected to pass the China bill easily. But lawmakers say that largely because of labor's aggressive opposition, the vote in the House, expected next month, is now too close to call.
"Labor's been both obstructionist and protectionist," said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican who is one of his party's leaders on trade issues.
The China bill, which would normalize trade relations with China, and speed that country's entry into the World Trade Organization, is hardly the only trade battle labor is waging. In Seattle last December, unions sent more than 30,000 people into the streets to help persuade World Trade Organization ministers not to initiate a new round of global talks aimed at removing barriers.
Labor's outspoken opposition is complicating matters for the Africa trade bill, on which both houses are expected to vote next month, and which would reduce tariffs and quotas on imports from some of the world's poorest countries. In addition, labor played an important role in persuading the Clinton administration to water down a World Bank proposal that aimed to increase exports from poor countries by having rich nations eliminate tariffs and quotas on some goods.
In addition, labor has blocked, for three years running, Congress's efforts to make it easier for the administration to negotiate extending the North American Free Trade Agreement to other countries.
With President Clinton eager to make trade liberalization part of his legacy, labor's resistance to the trade measures has irritated the Clinton administration. One senior official said that "the indiscriminate nature of labor's opposition to trade exposes a protectionist grain within the labor movement."
But labor leaders insist that they are neither protectionist nor reflexively opposed to increased imports, as many unions were in the early 1980's. Back then, many unions called for quotas and other protections when the strong dollar and surging imports hobbled the steel and auto industries.
Nowadays, union leaders assert that they are open to trade expansion measures so long as those measures include core worker protections, like the right to form labor unions and a ban on child labor.
They deny that these concerns are protectionist. "We really have learned from the past that we have to have core labor standards in our trade agreements if they're going to benefit workers in the United States as well as workers in the countries that are our trading partners," said John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president.
To be sure, one reason the unions are worried about lax labor standards overseas is that they make it attractive for multinational companies to move operations to low-wage production sites.
They fear, for example, that the China deal will encourage many American companies to move production operations to China and then export their goods to the United States. Unions say this happened with the North American Free Trade Agreement, and they fear that such an exodus of production would cause a loss of American jobs and increase the trade deficit with China, which is expected to exceed $60 billion this year.
Labor leaders also dislike the China deal because it would end annual trade reviews, which labor favors as a way to pressure China over violations of worker and human rights.
When 10,000 union members mobbed Capitol Hill two weeks ago to lobby against the China deal, they repeatedly talked about how China has imprisoned labor leaders who protested harsh conditions or nonpayment of wages.
Mr. Sweeney has been pressured to take a tough stance on trade by a handful of powerful unions especially vulnerable to imports: the Auto Workers, Steelworkers, Teamsters and apparel and textile workers.
Many corporate leaders argue that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is actually undermining the interests of American workers by opposing the China trade agreement. In business's view, the accord, which calls for China to remove many trade barriers, will increase American exports and thus create jobs for American workers.
"Labor is being isolationist and myopic," said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "If you take a blank piece of paper and draw a line and write on one side the things that the U.S. had to do for China, it would be empty, but if you write on the other side everything China had to do to remove barriers to American goods and services you'd cover the paper top to bottom."
Clinton administration officials say the agreement is designed to spur American exports, not an exodus of American factories to China. Pointing to the economic boom and record low unemployment, several economists criticized labor for failing to recognize that even with the exodus of many factories to Mexico, the nation's economy -- and workers -- can flourish.
James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, said labor's opposition to the China deal is in no way protectionist. "We believe in fair trade," he said. "We hope that China buys all kinds of products from the United States. We want to see an explosion of trade with China, but we don't want to have it one-sided the way it is now."
Many labor leaders share the view that trade liberalization measures help business, but not workers. But administration officials and business leaders take issue with that view, pointing to the many studies showing that expanded trade raises living standards around the world and is pivotal to improving the lot of workers in the poorest countries.
Some trade experts argue that the labor movement remains, at heart, protectionist but has grown more sophisticated in its language and tactics. They say labor's insistence on blocking trade agreements unless they include workers' rights provisions can in effect be a protectionist brake on freer trade because there is little prospect other countries will accept such workers' rights language.
"The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has really successfully packaged its public presentation," said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. "They're saying, 'No, no, we would love to have this bill if it contained fundamental labor and environmental standards.' But I don't think they're looking for a solution. They're looking for continued obstacles."
Union leaders say that in resisting trade bills that do not include workers' rights, they are being no more protectionist than corporate lobbyists who vow to oppose trade agreements unless they protect intellectual property rights.
Labor's hostility to the Africa trade bill has come under heavy fire, with many lawmakers, business leaders and economists questioning how labor could oppose a bill aimed at increasing exports from the poorest continent. One of the bill's most vocal opponents is the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, which fears that the bill will produce a surge in apparel exports.
Mark Levinson, the union's chief economist, said his union opposes the bill not for protectionist reasons but because it lacks worker protections and is skewed toward business by requiring African nations to take business-friendly steps, like cutting corporate taxes, to qualify for tariff reductions.

HEADLINE: Looking for Ways to Foil the ID Thief

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Stacy Sullivan (Op-Ed, April 17) requests that credit card companies "take simple precautions to identify their customers." It is not only the companies that fail to protect against fraud, however.
I am amazed and disheartened in stores when the clerk does not flip the card over and check my signature against the one I signed on the receipt. This neglect of a simple security check costs all of us millions in fraud and, therefore, in increased interest rates. 
 I recently received a replacement card and forgot to sign it. A clerk pointed out (after the transaction was completed) that the card was unsigned and asked me to provide proof of identity. Surely, a cursory check of a driver's license should not be enough to let me walk away with the purchased goods and the credit card?

HEADLINE: Persistent and Severe, Drought Strikes Again

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
Tornadoes, hurricanes and floods are the stuff of television drama; they make people sit up and take notice. Not so with drought. It is a far more subtle weather catastrophe that "sneaks up on you" and consequently commands little awe or respect, says Dr. Donald A. Wilhite, a Nebraska climatologist who is an expert on the subject. He calls it the Rodney Dangerfield of natural disasters.
Although it might not stir the emotions, in an average year drought is responsible for about as much economic damage as floods and hurricanes combined. Nor is it a rare phenomenon, as many people erroneously believe. Instead, it is a persistent and permanent feature of weather and climate, severely affecting some part of the United States almost every year. 
 So it is that in 2000, much of the country's midsection and a broad swath of its southern tier from Arizona to Florida -- roughly a quarter of the territory of the contiguous 48 states in all -- is already experiencing a moderate to severe drought with the peak months for drought still ahead. If long-range forecasts of below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures are accurate, conditions may well get worse.
As a new growing season begins in the Iowa-Nebraska-Illinois breadbasket, severe deficiencies of soil moisture are creating a potential new threat to farmers' chronically sagging fortunes. The water level of the Great Lakes is approaching all-time lows; not since 1965 have Lakes Michigan and Huron been so low. The prospect looms of huge financial losses in agriculture and recreation. And as always, drought raises the risk of wildfires.
So experts are plumbing the past and investigating today's changing climate as part of an effort to understand drought better and to gauge whether longer and more severe droughts may lie ahead.
For instance, could another Dust Bowl or an even worse drought be in the nation's future? Based on scientists' analyses of tree rings, ancient soils and other evidence, the answer is almost certainly yes. Many experts believe that with the world's climate warming as it is, droughts will become more frequent and severe. But apart from that, and regardless of whether humans are responsible for global warming, there is plenty of evidence that big, damaging droughts are inevitable. The only question is when they will come.
A 1998 study by federal scientists, for instance, found that droughts as widespread and severe as that of the Dust Bowl of the 1930's, when 65 percent of the country was affected at the drought's peak in 1934, have occurred once or twice a century over the last 300 to 400 years. A decade-long drought, the study found, occurs about once every 500 years.
More recent analyses of tree-ring data have identified a 16th-century megadrought that affected much of the continent for years, far outstripping any drought of the 20th century in persistence and severity. It was during this drought that the first English colony in America, at Roanoke Island in North Carolina, disappeared, and experts now believe the drought is what killed it off.
The report, by Dr. David W. Stahle, a tree-ring analyst at the University of Arkansas, Dr. Edward R. Cook, an analyst of ancient climates at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and six colleagues, appeared in the March 21 issue of Eos, a scientific publication of the American Geophysical Union.
Megadroughts lasting a century or two are known to have occurred in what is now California over the last 3,500 years. Droughts of similar severity have also been implicated in the downfall of the empire of the Maya in Central America a millennium ago; the Akkadian empire (the world's first) in Mesopotamia 4,200 years ago (that drought lasted 300 years) and several pre-Inca cultures in South America.
But it does not take a megadrought to bring disaster, and the emerging record of past dry spells contains several smaller ones that would surely devastate much of the United States if they materialized again. In the 20th century, major droughts in the 1950's and in 1988 were second only to the Dust Bowl. The tree-ring studies showed that comparable droughts materialized in the 1750's, 1820's, 1850's and 1860's.
The worst drought in recent years came in the summer of 1988, when a combination of intense heat and widespread moisture deficiency baked more than a third of the country for weeks. It destroyed at least half the crops on the Great Plains, lowered water levels in the Mississippi River so much that barges ran aground and created the conditions for a summer-long run of forest fires in the West. The most famous engulfed great swatches of Yellowstone National Park in that area's biggest conflagration in at least 200 years.
All of this makes it abundantly clear that drought is a standard feature of climate, not an exception to the rule.
But disaster planners often do not see it that way, and consequently pay more attention to other threats like floods, says Dr. Wilhite, who directs the National Drought Mitigation Center, a research and planning organization at the University of Nebraska.
If that is so, one reason may be that drought is rarely a cause of death or destruction of buildings, although drought-associated heat waves often send mortality temporarily skyrocketing. (Summer heat makes drought worse by speeding evaporation of moisture; and when there is no more moisture to evaporate, the sun's energy goes entirely into heating the land, which in turn makes the air above it even hotter.)
Another possible reason for a relative lack of urgency about drought is that it is a creeping phenomenon. "It's hard to know when you're in a drought," Dr. Wilhite said. "When do you ring the bell?" As things stand now, he said, people "essentially don't become aware of drought and the dimensions of its impact until they're in the middle of it; at that point, there's not a lot you can do about it."
According to figures compiled by Dr. Wilhite's organization, drought costs the nation $6 billion to $8 billion a year on average, compared with $2.4 billion for floods and $1.2 billion to $4.8 billion for hurricanes. The worst droughts easily outstrip the worst floods and hurricanes; for instance, the 1988 drought exacted a toll of about $40 billion, while the Mississippi Valley floods of 1993, the worst of the century, cost $28 billion at most, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the most expensive on record, caused $25 billion to $33 billion in damages.
Damages might be reduced by better planning, Dr. Wilhite said. For example, farmers might switch to drought-resistant crops, and water conservation measures could be planned before a drought occurred instead of in a crisis.
Soil management and tillage practices have improved since the Dust Bowl days, when vast expanses of topsoil simply dried up and blew away, and to some extent the improvements might ease the impact of a comparable drought today, he said. But "some things you can't do anything about," he said, including depletion of aquifers and the dropping of water levels in reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams.
What does the future hold?
Over the last 25 years, the earth's average surface temperature has risen at a rate equal to about 3.5 degrees per century. Mainstream scientists believe it will continue to rise at that rate in the 21st century if emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide are not reduced.
A warming atmosphere has two effects related to precipitation, experts say: it causes more moisture to evaporate from the oceans and fresh waters, thus producing heavier rains. Scientists at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., have detected a clear trend in that direction.
But when it does not rain for a long time, a warmer atmosphere also intensifies drought by making more moisture evaporate from the land, faster. No trend toward increased drought has been detected over the last century, said Dr. David R. East erling, a researcher at the Climatic Data Center. But he said that eventually, in the interior of the continent, drought could win out over increasing precipitation if the atmosphere warmed enough.
Global warming could also affect the size and frequency of forest fires. A recent study of charcoal layers in Yellowstone, reflecting the last 17,000 years of fire history there, found that the number of fires peaked before 7,000 years ago, a time when summers were warmer than now.
The implication is that while fires would become more frequent in a warmer climate, they would also become smaller because less fuel, in the form of dead trees and forest litter, would have a chance to build up, said Dr. Cathy Whitlock, a geographer at the University of Oregon who was a co-author of the study. The other authors, also at Oregon, were Dr. Sarah H. Millspaugh and Dr. Patrick J. Bartlein. The paper appeared in March in the journal Geology.
A longtime expert on wildfire in the West, Dr. William Romme of Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., said the study suggested that "if the warming trend over the last century continues, as it appears it will, we can expect some really dramatic changes in fire behavior." It is likely, he said, that more frequent fires will allow less fuel to build up, in time making big conflagrations like that of 1988 less probable.
As for drought itself, some scientists believe, the frequency and severity of future dry spells could increase as a result of natural, periodic oscillations in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures on a scale of decades. The Stahle-Cook paper in Eos suggests that the 16th-century megadrought could have been caused by a prolonged cooling phase in some areas of the Pacific.
Back-and-forth oscillations in the Pacific temperatures alter atmospheric circulation patterns that deliver moisture to North America. One phase, which favors development of the phenomenon known as La Nina, is associated with drought in much of the United States. That phase has prevailed for the last two years -- La Nina years -- and some scientists predict that it will predominate in the decades just ahead.
For that matter, Dr. Easterling said, the big drought of 1988 was "pretty well tied" to La Nina. So was last summer's severe drought in the Middle Atlantic region and Northeast, many scientists believe. And so is this year's developing drought across the southern tier and midsection.
So far, the drought of 2000 has been most clearly manifest in the Great Lakes region. A combination of lower precipitation and high temperatures over the last three years, coupled with relatively little snow, has reduced stream flows in the region to well below normal.
In the lakes themselves, there has been "an unprecedented drop" in water levels over the last two to three years, said Dr. Frank H. Quinn, senior research hydrologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Lakes Huron and Michigan, which are really one body of water, have dropped about three feet, the biggest such drop in 140 years of record keeping, ending a 30-year run of above-average levels.
This has some benefits: "We will have the best beaches in 35 years and considerably less erosion," Dr. Quinn said. But in a region whose economy is in so many ways tied to the lakes, he said, there will also be large negative effects: the region's billion-dollar water recreation industry is likely to be hit hard, as many marinas no longer have enough water to hold boats. Lake freighters will not be able to load to full capacity. Less forceful water flows will reduce hydropower production downstream of the lakes.
The drought has not yet really pinched the midcontinent agricultural regions, since the growing season is only beginning, Dr. Wilhite said. Nor have the high evaporation levels of late spring and summer set in, not to mention the normal summertime increase in demand for water. The squeeze is likely to come, Dr. Wilhite said, if and when long-range forecasts of abnormal warmth and dryness materialize in the next three months.
The most recent observations show that much of the southern tier from Arizona to Florida is also in a severe drought, but the latest forecasts call for normal rainfall in most of that swath over the next three months.
But the forecasts can and do change from month to month. So for those in the dry regions, it is a time to prepare, watch and wait.

HEADLINE: American Express Reports Profit Rose 14%in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Express Company, the world's biggest charge card issuer and travel agency, said yesterday that its first-quarter profit rose 14 percent as it earned more fees from issuing cards and selling mutual funds.
American Express said its net income rose to $656 million, or $1.44 a diluted share, compared with $575 million, or $1.26 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $5.26 billion from $4.52 billion. 
 Analysts had expected the company to earn $1.42 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Shares of American Express, which is based in New York, rose $7.0625, to $150.0625.
The company, led by Harvey Golub, the chairman and chief executive, and his heir apparent, Kenneth I. Chenault, the president, continues to benefit from the 10-year economic expansion that has fueled consumer spending and kept inflation and unemployment in check. That has bolstered the company's card and financial advice businesses.
"They're benefiting from a very strong U.S. economy and strong U.S. spending," said Maitland Lammert, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Company in St. Louis. "They're expanding their client base."
Earnings from its card and travel unit increased 15 percent, to $416 million, as the company took in more fees and issued more cards.
American Express, best known for its green and platinum cards, introduced a computer chip-embedded blue credit card for United States consumers last year, striving to give the 150-year-old company an updated image for the dot-com generation. Analysts say the extensive advertising for the blue card, including a free Sheryl Crow rock concert in Central Park in New York, helped sell its other products.
The company added five million cards over the last year, and ended the quarter with 47.9 million cards in force.
Its financial advice business had earnings of $245 million, up 15 percent, as stock market gains and sales of investments like mutual funds helped the company collect more fees on the assets it manages for customers.

HEADLINE: 500 Years Later, Brazil Looks Its Past in the Face

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, April 24

 BODY:
It was envisioned as a feel-good patriotic festival like the American Bicentennial. But the Brazilian government should have known that its plans to mark the 500th anniversary of the landing of the Portuguese were doomed when an irate Indian chief marched into Congress earlier this month, drew his bow and arrow and threatened to kill the Senate president.
Sure enough, the yearlong commemoration got off to a bumpy start on Saturday, when military police officers used tear gas, nightsticks and rubber bullets to disperse 2,000 Indian-led demonstrators taking part in a "march of the excluded" in Porto Seguro, the focal point of the official celebrations. 
 More than 140 people were arrested and at least a dozen were injured in the clash. And today the director of the Indian affairs bureau resigned in protest over the government's stand in the whole affair.
"What happened today was the same thing that took place when Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived here," Nailton Pataxo, a leader of the Ha Ha Hae tribe, said Saturday. "He came, looted everything and used violence against indigenous peoples." Mr. Pataxo's tribe has been demanding that the government return traditional lands now occupied by ranchers.
Cabral was the leader of the flotilla that on April 22, 1500, sighted land in what is today the northern state of Bahia. The first landing party went ashore the next day, led by a Polish Jew who was the expedition's interpreter and whose languages included Arabic and Hindi. On April 26 the rest of the crew disembarked at the site known today as Santa Cruz Cabralia to erect a cross and offer thanks in the first Roman Catholic Mass on Brazilian soil.
Leaders of Brazil's 300,000 Indians have vowed to "resist" the commemorations of those and other events scheduled for coming days, and they are not the only ones complaining. Black groups have been marching to protest what they say is the marginal role to which Afro-Brazilians have been relegated.
And the Movement of the Landless, a leftist peasant group, is marking the anniversary with a campaign to occupy 500 ranches and farms that it contends are lying idle.
As the self-styled "country of the future," bursting with outsized dreams and ambitions, Brazil is not in the habit of scrutinizing its past. "Every 15 years Brazilians forget everything that happened in the past 15 years," is the way a political satirist, Ivan Lessa, once put it.
But the 500th anniversary has forced a process of self-examination, and many Brazilians do not particularly seem to like what they see.
"I am ashamed of Brazil," the country's most famous personage, the soccer star Pele, said in a newspaper interview this month, denouncing what he called "the diversion of government funds, thievery and dishonest politicians."
Though the country has largely bounced back from the crisis that threatened to sink the economy last year, glaring problems remain -- including urban violence and the concentration of income and land ownership in relatively few hands.
One result is an identity crisis. "Brazil is marking 500 years without knowing what it is," said a banner headline that ran in the daily Jornal do Brasil over the weekend.
Indeed, in the last year the best-seller lists here have been dominated by books that cast a critical look at Brazilian society and history. Ranging from biographies of Emperor Pedro II and other historical figures to trenchant analyses of social inequalities, such works been snatched up in record numbers by a public that in the past has not shown much of a commitment to buying books.
"I think Brazilians want to know why things have not turned out well, why Brazil hasn't worked," said Eduardo Bueno, the author of three recent books on early Brazilian history that have sold more than 500,000 copies. "Life is complicated, money is scarce, a feeling of citizenship is lacking and people sense that the answer lies in history, that perhaps things went wrong from the very beginning."
That is not the tone that the minister of tourism and sports, Rafael Greca de Macedo, sought to impart when he wrested control of the celebration from the more intellectual types at the Foreign Affairs Ministry. His goal, he says, was a series of events that would be "attractive, cheap and have popular appeal," helping the country's 170 million people build a positive self-image.
"You can't view history with a perspective of remorse," Mr. Greca said recently at a news conference here for foreign reporters about the anniversary celebration. He described Brazil as "a land of ethnic peace," praising its remarkable cultural and racial diversity and arguing that Indians had cause to be grateful for "their inclusion in Brazilian society."
Still, there have been complaints that the $20 million Mr. Greca has spent, some of it on concerts and the construction of a soccer museum, should have gone elsewhere. "Brazil would be much better off if the president had applied the money consumed in this insipid commemoration to building 500 schools and 500 hospitals," Artur Xexeo wrote in his column in Jornal do Brasil on Friday.
Back in the mother country on the other side of the Atlantic, a similar divide has emerged. Although President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal, who is here for this week's commemorations, has dismissed complaints about the colonial period by arguing that "we are responsible only for our own time," Portuguese intellectuals have taken a more negative view.
"The discovery was not a dialogue of cultures, nor an encounter of peoples," Jose Saramago, the novelist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, wrote recently. "It was violence, depredation and conquest."
Taking a cue from such declarations, the Roman Catholic Church here is about to issue an unusual mea culpa. At a weeklong conference scheduled to begin on Wednesday, the country's more than 300 bishops are to sign a statement asking forgiveness of Indians and blacks for sins the church committed against them during the colonial period.
"Many times the church's envoys were more allies of the conquistadors than the Gospel," Msgr. Marcelo Carvalheira, head of the committee that is drawing up the statement, said in explaining the need for the document. "The philosophy was conquer first and then catechize."
With the national mood so somber and contentious, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has shown signs of increasing exasperation. "The 500th anniversary festivities shouldn't be an invitation to a wake," he said last week. But in the face of the protests, the president's itinerary in Bahia has been reduced, and he is no longer scheduled to attend the commemorative Mass on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: The Mini Rebellion Is Over. Long Skirts Reign.

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
One recent morning, Becky Michaels, who handles advertising at a Midtown publishing house, left her Upper West Side apartment in the kind of look that hadn't called to her in many months: a skirt that sat somewhere in the mezzanine section of her thigh, not in the orchestra. Her husband, a musician, asked if she intended to go to the office "like that." Ms. Michaels, who had wavered about putting the skirt on in the first place, found herself feeling uncomfortably low-rent for the rest of the day.
For nearly as long as there has been a "Style With Elsa Klensch," designers have stood in front of television cameras trying to promote modern fashion as a laissez-faire enterprise. Hike your skirt up to your sciatic nerve; let it graze your Achilles' tendon. It doesn't matter; anything goes. But, of course, anything does not go. 
 For the better part of the last eight years, short skirts and dresses -- micro-minis, minis, garments with hemlines resting anywhere north of the knee -- have been rare sightings on the world's most influential runways, like Prada's. Even designers like Alessandro Dell'Acqua, once known for revealing skirts, have shown noticeably fewer of them lately. What runways and their ambassadors -- fashion editors -- have earnestly legislated instead is a length just at or below the knee.
Real women haven't necessarily abided. Until not too long ago, among the many women who don't read Vogue as carefully as if it were a warning on a can of paint stripper, shorter skirts turned up defiantly, just as flat shoes and other looks the fashion establishment considers passe managed to do. But now, it seems, working women are indicating that they would like to keep their legs more or less to themselves.
Jeffrey Kalinsky, the Atlanta retailer who last year opened a New York boutique, recently recalled that his customers used to fight him "tooth and nail" on the sophisticated knee length he encouraged. Shoppers, he said, would ask to get the skirts hiked up. He would try, often unsuccessfully, to caution them against it. He would offer them these words, he said: "If you go this short, it's going to look like Talbot's." But two years ago, Mr. Kalinsky noticed that women had stopped asking him to hem their skirts.
At shopping environments a little less rarefied than Mr. Kalinsky's, Henri Bendel, for example, sales of short skirts started to slip late last year. Ed Burstell, the store's fashion director, said that as a result, the store carries far fewer above-the-knee skirts than it once did. The style "could have the connotation of looking cheap," Mr. Burstell suggested, adding, "There are other ways you can convey sexuality."
New hemline opinions tend to raise the kind of questions that other shifts in taste lack the history and symbolism to force. One theory long promulgated by fashion watchers is that hemlines rise in boom times (the 1920's, the 80's) and fall during less economically vital years (the early 70's). The current abandonment of shorter lengths contradicts that idea.
But more important, what, if anything, does the shift represent? The triumph of fashion's dictatorial strain? The true death of the suit (with which short skirts were often associated) as a professional costume? Or perhaps something deeper, a weariness of bringing a "go ahead and objectify me" brand of feminism to the office? That is, a reluctance to display too much, after a protracted national conversation, in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, about what does and doesn't constitute sexual misbehavior at work.
Kathy McCarver Root, a photography editor at Us Weekly, said she stopped wearing short skirts to her Manhattan office in the last year because "I feel a little bit uncovered." Shannon Luckoski, 26, an administrative assistant in Atlanta, said her instinct to abandon short skirts was validated on a recent evening when she wore an animal-print version to a bar and found the hand of a former colleague on her thigh.
At a recent dinner shared by about 10 professional women, all in their 20's or early 30's, at an East Side restaurant, the talk turned to the fact that none wore short skirts anymore, not even at night. What was surprising was how many used words like "inappropriate" and "sluttish" to describe how they now felt in clothes they once wore without hesitation.
Later, Kerry Bernstein, who is 27 and works in marketing at a corporate investigations firm, said that while she was recently packing up clothes for the Salvation Army, she was shocked to discover skirts that fell to midthigh, ones she breezily wore to work two years ago, but would never wear today. "You don't want to think about men as you walk out of an office checking you out," she said.
Olivia Douglas, 30, a commercial real estate executive, said she had sent all of her short skirts to Goodwill, including one she was wearing when she met her husband at a wedding four years ago.
At Ann Taylor, arguably the nation's iconic purveyor of career clothing, the skirt suit -- or the interview suit, as it is known in retail parlance -- has had a noteworthy past couple of years. Calhoun Sumrall, a vice president and design director at the store, said that three or four years ago, the skirt length for the standard Ann Taylor interview suit was 19 inches, not too far above the knee on a woman of average height. It later dipped to 21 inches and now rests at 22 inches. Mr. Sumrall pointed out that while shorter lengths do well as part of the store's more casual collections, the best-selling length sits below the knee at 24 inches.
"The majority of women embrace a style long after avant-garde designers present it," he said.
Where showy skirts have received their greatest play of late is affixed to the waist of Julia Roberts in "Erin Brockovich," which is based on the story of a real-life single mother who didn't have much time for the fantasy of fashion magazines. Erin Brockovich set about uncovering deadly corporate malfeasance in three-inch heels and skirts that appear no wider than a Post-it note. Jeffrey Kurland, the film's costume designer, had most of the clothes made, in part because the streetwalker style Ms. Brockovich favored in the late 80's, when the movie is partly set, weren't so easy to come by.
Mr. Kurland has spent much of his career observing urban habits in the service of dressing characters that populate Woody Allen movies. He theorized that women have been moving subconsciously away from provocative lengths ever since Americans began speaking more openly about sexual harassment, which is to say, since the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.
This is the sort of argument that Ally McBeal, champion of the uber-mini, might have had little tolerance for early on in her television life. Last season, Ms. McBeal, the angst-ridden lawyer, was held in contempt of court during one episode for wearing a skirt that barely reached past her hips. She was furious at being condemned for her choice, but as the episode progressed, Ms. McBeal came to see her brash attempts at postfeminist expression as a kind of trouble-making self-involvement, which made people around her uncomfortable.
This season Ally has often shown up at work in pants.

InvestorsFind Vulnerability In Microsoft

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Since it first sold shares to the public 14 years ago, Microsoft has become more than a software company.
As it turned in steady increases in profit and revenue quarter after quarter, year after year, Microsoft convinced an entire generation of investors that no price was too rich to pay for a leading technology company. Sure, Microsoft's stock price always seemed expensive relative to its current earnings. But a year or two later, those earnings were much higher, and so was Microsoft's stock. 
 No more.
For the first time in more than a decade, investors have had to confront the reality that even Microsoft sometimes misses its mark. And they are not happy.
Microsoft shares fell more than 15 percent yesterday after investors digested the company's earnings report for the quarter ended in March and realized that operating profit was short of analysts' estimates, although net income was slightly ahead of expectations thanks to gains on its investments. In addition, Microsoft encouraged analysts to cut their earnings and revenue estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in June, as well as all of fiscal 2001.
The disappointing news on earnings was compounded by reports yesterday that the Justice Department may try to resolve its antitrust case against the software maker by splitting Microsoft into two or more companies. With many technology stocks in a monthlong swoon, jittery investors shed Microsoft shares with extreme prejudice. By day's end, Microsoft had fallen $12.3125, to $66.625, in heavy trading, with more than 155 million shares changing hands. The decline shaved close to $70 billion off the company's market valuation, a drop larger than the total market capitalization of General Motors.
Microsoft's fall set off a rout in many technology stocks, with the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index closing yesterday at 3,482.48, down 161.40. That puts the index at its lowest level since a 9.7 percent plunge 10 days ago left it at 3,321.29. Page C18.
Despite the plunge, Microsoft's problems are not necessarily bad news for the rest of the technology sector. Worldwide technology spending remains strong and other big technology companies, including Intel, have reported first-quarter earnings well ahead of analysts' expectations.
"Almost across the board, technology spending appears to be extremely robust and healthy," said Michael Manns, senior portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management, which invests $7 billion.
But United States companies are spending less money on desktop computers and more money on high-end servers that they can use for crunching numbers in databases and running business-to-business Internet sites. Sun Microsystems, a maker of servers, benefits from this shift at Microsoft's expense, said Chris Mortenson, a managing director of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
"For the last year we've been moving to a more server-centric environment," Mr. Mortenson said. "That is taking away from spending on the desktop."
Like other Wall Street analysts, Mr. Mortenson said most of Microsoft's slide yesterday came because of fears that its growth had slowed -- not because of the Justice Department's antitrust case. Mr. Mortenson said he did not think a Microsoft breakup would be good for the company's investors, but he noted that the lawsuit will take years to resolve and that no one knows the outcome.
Jeff Applegate, a longtime bull on technology stocks and chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, agreed that the antitrust case is less important to Microsoft's future than the shift in technology spending away from personal computers. "I've viewed the legal stuff, the antitrust issue, as more of a sideshow, and to me the real issue is can these guys migrate their business from a PC-centric to an Internet-centric world," Mr. Applegate said.
Microsoft's earnings report last week offered cause for concern on that score. The company said that its sales in the three months ended March 31 were $5.66 billion, up 23 percent from their 1999 level. But most analysts were predicting a much stronger increase, to $5.9 billion. Most of the shortfall came from lighter-than-expected sales of the company's Windows operating system software, with sales to business customers especially poor, analysts said. That crimped Microsoft's operating margins, which were down slightly compared with 1999.
While Microsoft's profits rose 23 percent compared with the 1999 quarter, to $2.4 billion, or 43 cents a share, much of that increase came from unexpectedly large gains in Microsoft's investments in other companies. Microsoft's operating profits were actually 2 cents short of analysts' expectations, the first time Microsoft has disappointed Wall Street since March 1989.
In addition, Microsoft told analysts that its revenue and profit growth would stay slow throughout this year and into 2001. While the company regularly talks down its future prospects, analysts said that this guidance was more conservative than usual, especially since it came after a soft quarter.
Still, investors would be wise to keep Microsoft's troubles in perspective. Most companies would be thrilled to have operating margins near 50 percent and a cash and investment hoard that tops $40 billion. And Mr. Applegate noted that since the rally in technology began in early 1993, there have been seven previous periods when technology stocks significantly underperformed the market, he said. Each time, they have eventually regained their lead.
"It's not like this has never happened," Mr. Applegate said. "It's typically a poster child which stumbles."
But Microsoft's success has made it more than just another technology company. Its gains have coincided with a decadelong economic renaissance in the United States, and an enormous bull market in technology stocks. Microsoft's growth taught many investors that technology could be enormously profitable. Then the even speedier ascent of Cisco Systems, the leading manufacturer of networking equipment, turned advocates of GARP, or growth at a reasonable price, into fans of GAAP -- growth at any price.
Now Microsoft's earnings shortfall has highlighted the downside of paying top prices for growth companies. It offers proof, as if any were needed, that no company can compound its earnings to infinity and that even the best-managed business sometimes falls victim to forces beyond its control.
"I don't have much sympathy for people who pay 100, 110 times earnings for companies like Cisco and Sun Microsystems," said Scott Black, president of Boston-based Delphi Management and a longtime value investor. "These are very fine companies. But trees don't grow to the sky."

HEADLINE: A Vietnam Premonition

 BODY:
As the nation reflects this week on the meaning of the Vietnam War 25 years after the fall of Saigon, a few fateful words of Lyndon Johnson's tumble across the decades to remind us that a senseless conflict might have been avoided. On a May morning in 1964, as Johnson was weighing whether to expand American military involvement in Vietnam, he confided in a conversation with Senator Richard Russell that he did not really know why Washington should go to war in Southeast Asia. Referring to Sgt. Kenneth Gaddis, who was one of his valets, Johnson said he was troubled by the idea of sending this father of six children to war. "And what the hell are we going to get out of his doing it?" Johnson asked himself. "And it just makes the chills run up my back."
Even so many years later it is hard not to be saddened and angered by Johnson's failure to follow that simple impulse. His comments, recorded by the White House and published a few years ago by Michael Beschloss in a compendium of Johnson tapes entitled "Taking Charge," captured a larger truth that still rests uneasily on the American soul. No compelling national interest was served by waging war in Vietnam, and the men who directed the war, including Johnson and his secretary of defense Robert McNamara, knew it at the time. More than 58,000 American servicemen lost their lives in a land of negligible political and economic importance to the welfare of the United States. The idea that Communism would advance inexorably across Asia if Ho Chi Minh was victorious in Vietnam was the hallucination of men numbed, and trapped, by the liturgies of the cold war. 
 The same men also violated a cardinal principle of politics and warfare by drafting citizens for combat without first building strong public support for their cause. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, approved by Congress in 1964 after the Pentagon reported that United States naval vessels had been attacked by North Vietnam, was a flimsy license for committing the country to a land war in Asia.
As opposition grew, and demonstrations against the fighting spread across the country, Johnson and his aides failed to recognize that a divided democracy cannot sustain a foreign war without doing grievous damage to itself and its principles. By the time Johnson realized the harm he had done, his political career was wrecked and the domestic achievements of his presidency had been overshadowed by his reckless spilling of American and Vietnamese blood.
The physical wounds of those who fought bravely in Vietnam healed long ago, but the war will always loom large in their lives, as it does in the political memory of the nation. It changed America in innumerable ways, for better and for worse. It undermined a generation's faith in the judgment and truthfulness of its military and diplomatic leaders. But above all, it taught us that the United States must not commit its soldiers to protracted combat in the absence of clear security interests, and that future wars cannot be fought without the support of the American people.
For these and many other reasons, the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington is different from the other monuments where America honors its fallen soldiers. The starkness and simplicity of the memorial, with the names of each soldier etched in polished black granite, reminds visitors that no victory is celebrated on this spot, no noble cause honored in memory of those who sacrificed their lives.
The monument instead commemorates the needless sacrifice of troops who were betrayed by a president who prosecuted a war he did not believe in for a goal that he could not define in public speeches or private conversation. That, more than anything, is what the nation must remember this week, and that is why the words of Lyndon Johnson still sting.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Index Tumbles Again, Hurt by Microsoft Results

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks had another rocky session yesterday, as the aftershocks of Microsoft's most recent earnings report reverberated through the Nasdaq market. 
 Microsoft, which reported results from its third fiscal quarter after the market closed on Thursday, was battered, falling 12 5/16, or 15.6 percent, to 66 5/8. It was the biggest loss in the company's share price since Oct. 26, 1987, a week after the stock market crashed.
The slide was a huge contributor to the 161.40 point, or 4.4 percent, decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which closed at 3,482.48. A late rally in many Nasdaq shares pulled the index off its lows for the session. Still, Microsoft was responsible for more than 41 points of the Nasdaq's drop.
Investors moved into other sectors of the market as they exited Microsoft and other technology stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average managed to rise, even though Microsoft is a component of the blue-chip indicator. The Dow closed at 10,906.10, up 62.05 points, or 0.6 percent. Gains in financial stocks like American Express, which reported strong earnings; General Electric; and J. P. Morgan outweighed weakness in Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard.
Rising prices for drug, chemical and consumer stocks helped to limit losses in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at 1,429.86, down 4.68 points, or 0.3 percent.
But the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was battered. The Russell, which has been dominated by the performance of a relatively small group of technology and biotechnology stocks, fell 13.30 points yesterday, or 2.8 percent, to 468.54.
"Even in the midst of the decline in technology over the last six weeks or so, I don't think investors have reconciled the fact they were overweight technology at the expense of everything else," said Jonathan Oleksy, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "We are seeing genuine interest in sectors like drugs, chemicals, banks and utilities. Technology will still ultimately command a large weighting of a person's portfolio. But by the time you wring out this excess ownership more of this rotational activity will have gone on."
With the Nasdaq market now down 31 percent from its peak on March 10 and 14.4 percent for the year, some analysts said they were beginning to look for signs that technology stocks are forming a bottom.
"The Nasdaq market is now just about as oversold relative to its two-month moving average as it was back in 1987," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: "We are getting close to a level where I may actually do a little buying myself, in Microsoft and in technology in general. If you are underweight technology, I would put some cash to work if the Nasdaq composite got to 3,250."
There is little question that Microsoft's stock has been harshly treated: so far this year, the stock is down 43 percent. Among Standard & Poor's 500 companies, the decline has dropped Microsoft into fourth place in terms of market capitalization. It now trails General Electric, Cisco Systems and Intel.
And it has put a major crimp in the carrying value of Bill Gates' holdings. Based on the most recent data on Microsoft shareholders, the decline in the stock since the start of the year has wiped out nearly $40 billion in paper assets from Mr. Gates's portfolio.
Microsoft was far and away the most actively traded issue yesterday. Nearly 157 million Microsoft shares changed hands, the third highest ever for an American stock. Trading in Microsoft was about three times that of the next most active issue yesterday, Cisco Systems. Cisco fell 1 11/16, to 63 7/16. The stock traded as low as 59 1/4.
On the whole, however, traders said business was fairly quiet. European markets were closed in observance of Easter Monday.
Among Dow stocks, American Express rose 7 1/16, to 150 1/16, after it reported first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's forecasts.
Merck, which also reported solid earnings, gained 2 3/16, to 71 15/16. And McDonald's rose 2 7/8, to 38 11/16.
Big chemical companies like DuPont and Dow Chemical gained. DuPont rose 1 3/4, to 56. And Dow Chemical was up 3 5/8, to 109.
Along with Microsoft, Exodus Communications was the biggest decliner on the Nasdaq market. Late Thursday the company, a manager of Internet sites, reported a loss that was wider than expected. Yesterday the stock was hammered, falling 25 3/16, to 82 1/2.
"If we didn't see this terrific rotation that is going on, I would be much more worried," said David Williams, manager of the $1.2 billion Excelsior Value and Restructuring fund at the United States Trust Company. "As long as the rotation continues, the market can probably move higher."
 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Fall
(By Reuters) -- Treasury bonds and notes fell yesterday in thin trading, getting little help from safe-haven buying as technology stocks fell sharply while bond market players braced for strong economic data expected later in the week.
Price movements yesterday were exaggerated by the paucity of dealings. Trading was thin as American markets reopened after the holiday weekend, while Europe was still closed.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32, to 105 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.87 percent from 5.83 percent on Thursday.
This Thursday, the market will get a double dose of economic data, which is expected to be robust. Those figures would keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on May 16.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.579	97.096	High Rate	5.62%	5.74%	Investment Rate	5.78%	5.99%	Low Rate	5.57%	5.68%	Median Rate	5.61%	5.73%	Total applied for	$29,134,315	$29,466,888	Accepted	$15,318,315	$14,282,888	Noncompetitive	$1,349,950	$1,588,373	
 
Both issues are dated April 27, 2000. The three-month bills mature on July 27, 2000, and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 26, 2000.

HEADLINE: Boston Bank Says It Has Won Board Seats at Carver Bancorp

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
A Boston bank that has been waging a long-running battle over Carver Bancorp in Harlem said late yesterday that a court decision had given it two seats on the board of Carver, a financially troubled institution that is the largest black-run bank in the country.
Two executives of the Boston Bank of Commerce, a black-owned bank that is one of Carver's largest shareholders, ran for Carver's board at a tumultuous shareholder meeting in February; they were defeated by a narrow margin, 30,000 of the 1.7 million votes cast. The executives, Kevin Cohee and his wife, Teri Williams, have challenged the election on several grounds. 
 Yesterday, the Delaware Chancery Court issued a ruling invalidating about 86,000 votes that were cast in favor of the incumbent directors, David R. Jones, the bank's chairman, and David N. Dinkins, the former mayor.
"The judge ruled that Teri and Kevin are on the board," said Robert Patrick Cooper, general counsel of Boston Bank. "They look forward to sitting at the next board meeting."
But Carver executives believe the ruling is technical in nature and may appeal it, said Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for the bank. "It does not say they can go on the board," she said.
A trial on the other issues raised by Boston Bank is scheduled to begin next month in Delaware, where Carver is incorporated. The main issue in the case is whether Carver improperly sold shares to friendly Wall Street firms to stuff the ballot box rather than to strengthen the bank's financial position.
Yesterday's ruling is the latest twist in what has become a bitter fight over the future of the bank, which was founded in 1949.
The insurgents have criticized the bank's new president, Deborah C. Wright, for her lack of banking experience; though she once worked on Wall Street, she was more recently the president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development agency.
Ms. Wright and her supporters have, in turn, criticized Boston Bank as an interloper without the community ties that the bank needs. They note that Mr. Cohee has proposed merging Carver with his institution, a plan that he says he has abandoned.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAID TO WANT MICROSOFT BROKEN INTO2 COMPANIES

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
The Justice Department intends to ask a federal judge this week to break Microsoft into two companies to bring about competition in the software industry, officials and others aware of the government's deliberations said today.
The proposal comes less than a month after settlement talks between the government and Microsoft broke down and a federal judge found Microsoft in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws. 
 But even though the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, ruled that the company was a predatory monopolist, there is no assurance that he will accept the proposed remedy.
Microsoft called the idea "a radical and extreme example of government regulation that would be bad for consumers and for the high-tech economy." A spokesman, Mark Murray, added, "There is no basis in the evidence presented in this case for this sort of radical remedy."
Several people with knowledge of the Justice Department's plan said it called for one company to retain the Windows operating-system business and the other to take the rest of Microsoft's operations, including software programs like Word and Excel, Microsoft's Web browser and its Internet businesses.
The result would be about a 60-40 split of Microsoft's estimated $23 billion in revenue this year, with operating systems being the lesser share. While in some ways the plan would create two monopolies in place of one, the premise is that their incentives would differ and that they would therefore behave differently. News analysis, Page C1.
The Justice Department's inclination to seek a breakup of the company was reported today by The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and USA Today.
As recently as last week, officials said the 19 states that joined with the Justice Department in the case appeared to be seeking remedies short of a breakup. Now that the states have been briefed on the federal plan, they generally support it, several officials said.
But it is not clear whether the states will endorse the plan in full or formulate a plan of their own by Friday, the deadline set by the judge. It also remains possible that the states will fail to agree among themselves, in which case they are to submit a proposal based on the opinion of the majority.
The broad idea behind the Justice Department's plan is to create incentives for increased competition among operating systems and in related businesses. One reason Windows has no significant competitors is that Microsoft generally does not create software for non-Windows operating systems, with the exception of Apple Computer's.
Microsoft Office, the suite of programs that includes Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations, commands more than 90 percent of that business, known as application software. So an operating system on which Office cannot run stands little chance.
But Microsoft argues that a new applications-software company would have no more incentive to write for smaller operating systems than is now the case. Mr. Murray, the Microsoft spokesman, said, "There is no evidence that would lead anyone to believe that Office stands as the linchpin for resolving all of the government's concerns."
Because any breakup proposal would probably be stayed pending appeal, the government plans to ask for several interim restrictions on Microsoft's behavior, to remain in force for three years if a breakup plan is ultimately approved and carried out, and 10 years if not.
As part of these so-called conduct remedies, Microsoft would have to publish a standardized price list for Windows so that it could not raise the price for companies that do not go along with Microsoft's requests.
Microsoft would be forbidden to strike exclusive contracts with other companies, as it did with Internet service providers that in past years were asked to feature Microsoft's Web browser and no others.
Microsoft would also have to make available the codes that allow other companies to write programs for Windows without discrimination.
And the company would not be allowed to build certain new applications into Windows, like Web browsers and media players, without also offering a version of Windows that does not provide access to that new application. Computer makers would get a discount if they asked for Windows without the new feature.
Microsoft calls most of these ideas excessive, beyond the scope of the evidence presented during the trial, and notes that these conduct remedies might be stayed pending appeal, along with the breakup proposal.
It was Microsoft's decision to build a Web browser, Internet Explorer, into Windows four years ago that prompted the government's suit. The decision assured that, over time, Internet Explorer would be installed automatically on nearly all of the world's personal computers, driving the market leader of the time, Netscape, to a marginal position today.
Under the new government plan, the applications software company would retain possession of Internet Explorer, meaning that Microsoft would have to create a stand-alone version -- something the company has adamantly refused to do.
The applications-software company could license Internet Explorer back to the Windows company -- but only once. When the time came to upgrade the browser, each of the new companies would have to do that on its own, thereby creating competition in the browser business.
The government would also ask for strong anticollusion rules for the new companies, and they would stay in place indefinitely. Those rules have not been described.
One individual close to the situation stressed that the Justice Department had settled on it for several reasons. First, it does not fragment the operating system, an approach that could have led to incompatible computers and programs.
Under this plan, the government would also not be required to maintain long-term, constant, intrusive monitoring of Microsoft, which both Microsoft and the courts would probably find objectionable.
It would be left to Microsoft's leaders to decide which of the new businesses would carry the name Microsoft and retain the key executives. And other details, including how to divide Microsoft's $17.8 billion cash reserve, would be decided later.
People close to the talks said the investment firm Greenhill & Company, which the Justice Department retained in December to study the financial impact of proposals to resolve the case, had not yet put a value on the separate businesses that would result from the breakup plan.
While the government position could change in modest ways over the next few days, officials said this fundamental plan was unlikely to be altered. Neither Microsoft nor the government shows any indication that it might try to settle the case before the remedy phase. Microsoft remains supremely confident that it will prevail on appeal.
After the plaintiffs submit their proposals, Microsoft will have until May 10 to respond. Judge Jackson has scheduled a hearing for May 24.
The Justice Department has been studying various remedy ideas for more than a year and had wanted to offer a structural remedy of this sort during the settlement talks that began in November and ended early this month. But Microsoft refused even to discuss the idea.
With the talks over, the Justice Department moved quickly back to discussions of structural remedies, and one official said Attorney General Janet Reno had approved the current approach.
Justice Department officials first shared their proposal with some of the state attorneys general who are partners in the suit on Thursday and Friday and asked them for help and concurrence. Both state and federal officials said the federal plan was modified in some ways as a result of discussions with the states.
A senior state official said the Justice Department "has been receptive and respectful of our point of view." But one knowledgeable official also said that while the government intends to enlist as many of the states as it can in its plan, it will file it with Judge Jackson by Friday regardless. Judge Jackson has said he would prefer a single remedy proposal from the plaintiffs but would be willing to accept two.
Until last week, the states had been promoting less severe remedies, even though many of them personally preferred the idea of breaking up Microsoft, several officials said. Concerned about their prospects on appeal, and about public opinion, among other issues, the states had been planning to ask only for conduct remedies.
Over the last several days, however, opinions began to change. Conduct remedies require strong enforcement mechanisms to remain effective, and the states were having trouble finding mechanisms they were certain could work. "The more we considered the conduct remedies," a state official said, "the more we saw that they would necessitate constant oversight and intrusion on Microsoft, and nobody was comfortable with that."
And then, last Wednesday, The Washington Post published an interview with Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, in which he said the company had done nothing wrong and saw no reason to alter its business practices.
Some of the attorneys general, working that very day on enforcement mechanisms, "saw this as a real slap in the face," one official said. With that sort of attitude, he added, "'we knew enforcement would be ongoing and difficult."

HEADLINE: Insurgents Win Control of CUNY's Faculty and Staff Union

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
A group of insurgents calling themselves the New Caucus won control of the faculty and staff union at the City University of New York yesterday, and their leader pledged to push for more money for the university and for the union members.
The New Caucus won 14 of the 20 elective slots on the executive council, including the presidency, and may have won as many as 17, said Frank R. Annunziato, executive director of the union, the Professional Staff Congress. He said that the votes on three slots were very close and that some ballots had not yet been counted because of eligibility questions. 
 The union's newly elected president, Barbara Bowen, said she planned to press for more public investment in the university as well as for a better contract for union members. "For the first time, we will see what an active academic union can do in the huge battle over CUNY," she said in an interview.
"It's about rebuilding the City University," she added. "It's about stopping the erosion of professionals at the university. It's about bringing democracy and activism to the labor movement."
Of the nearly 10,000 active and retired professors and professional staff workers eligible to vote, about 6,000 returned their ballots, which were counted yesterday by the American Arbitration Association.
Dr. Bowen, who teaches at Queens College, is a former union organizer who went on to earn a doctorate in 17th-century English literature. She beat Richard J. Boris, a professor of political science at York University, who assumed the presidency in late January, when Irwin Polishook, president since 1976, retired.
"Our members voted for change," Dr. Boris said yesterday evening, adding that he wished the new leadership well.
Dr. Bowen, 44, said she helped found the New Caucus five years ago because she wanted a more aggressive union.
Her union experience began right after college, when she was a full-time organizer for apple pickers and tobacco growers in western Massachusetts. Even after she enrolled as a graduate student at Yale University, she remained active in union work, helping to organize the university's clerical and technical workers.
One quick test of the new leadership will be renegotiating the union contract, which expires on July 31. Dr. Bowen said CUNY professors have lower salaries and heavier workloads than professors at universities like the State University of New York and Rutgers. Without being specific, she said she planned "to engage the whole power of the membership to get a fair contract."

HEADLINE: In Search of Foreign Policy Respect, Bush Crosses Bridge Into Mexico

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, April 24

 BODY:
Eager to assure voters that he is not a foreign policy novice, Gov. George W. Bush went campaigning in Mexico today. Foreign soil may be an unusual place to win votes, but Mr. Bush seemed more in search of respect.
It was a short trip, about 400 yards across the Rio Grande into the Mexican scrub desert just west of this border city, and Mr. Bush did not stay long, about two hours. 
 In that time he dedicated the eight-lane, $128 million World Trade Bridge and shared a stage, and compliments, with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
"In the past there have been walls of divide between Mexico and the United States," Mr. Bush said to a crowd of a few thousand people, mostly Mexicans. "We must, we must be committed to raise the bridges of trade and friendship and freedom."
For Mr. Bush, the international stage, even one within eyesight of Texas, offered a chance to burnish his foreign policy credentials after some stumbles in the Republican primaries.
Mr. Bush, who has trumpeted his experience in working with Mexico, said the opening of the bridge was an example of the growing economic ties between the United States and Mexico.
Today, at a ceremony after a ribbon cutting on the bridge, Mr. Zedillo credited Mr. Bush with understanding Mexican culture and working as Texas governor to improve Mexican-American relations. "He's a great friend of Mexico," Mr. Zedillo said.
The growing closeness between officials in Mexico and Texas was largely attributable to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has made Los Dos Laredos -- as the border cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo call themselves -- a choke point for 1.3 million truck crossings last year.
The World Trade Bridge is the fourth international bridge in the Laredo area.
In promising to push aggressively for free trade in this hemisphere, Mr. Bush, who has assiduously courted Hispanic voters, said he would tear down trade barriers from Alaska to "the tip of the Cape Horn."
In arranging this international photo opportunity, Mr. Bush nearly got mired in some tricky local politics. The bridge actually opened on April 15, in a ceremony whose host was Mayor Betty Flores of Laredo, a Democrat and friend of President Clinton.
Citing a scheduling conflict, Mr. Bush declined to attend that gathering, as did Mr. Zedillo after originally indicating that he would. Ms. Flores had said she was "disappointed."
How disappointed was she? The Bush campaign learned last week when the mayor initially declined to allow the governor's motorcade to cross the new bridge for the ceremony in Mexico. Ms. Flores said the international permit for the bridge specifically allowed commercial traffic only except for emergencies.
She suggested the governor's entourage use one of the other bridges or simply walk across. Or, she said, maybe he could just drive a truck.
"He could ride in a big rig," she said in a telephone interview on Friday. "Think about it. The Teamsters will love it."
But a weekend of telephone calls, including calls from Texas officials to the State Department, broke the impasse, and on Monday, the governor's car drove across the bridge.
Ms. Flores, who said she had not initially been invited to speak, did so, and made certain to thank the politician that Mr. Bush hopes to replace, President Clinton.

New Attack on Iran Media That Back Reform Efforts
Courts in Tehran suspended 12 publications favorable to President Mohammad Khatami's reform movement. Reform leaders appealed for calm. The action, on Sunday, was the latest by conservatives since reformers overwhelmingly won parliamentary elections two months ago. Many conservatives blamed their poor showing on the energetic, outspoken press, which has blossomed since Mr. Khatami's election in 1997. A1
 
Defending U.S. Arms Policy
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright defended the decision to develop a new national antimissile defense system. In a speech at the opening of an international conference to review a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, she also rejected calls for a quicker elimination of nuclear arms. A6 

Chechens Ambush Russians
A rebel force attacked a Russian military convoy just days after Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the secessionist southern Chechnya region, was reported to have ordered guerrilla commanders to suspend combat operations so that peace talks could take hold. Chechen officials said up to 80 Russian soldiers had been killed; Russian officials reported 15 dead. A6
 
Tourists Are Taken Hostage
Masked assailants carrying automatic rifles and a rocket launcher stormed one of the world's top diving resorts late Sunday, on Sipadan Island in eastern Malaysia, and took away 20 hostages, about half of whom were foreign tourists. An American couple escaped. A Philippine separatist group that is holding 27 captives in the Philippines took responsibility. A14
 
Malaria's Cost to Economies
A study by Harvard University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that malaria had hurt African economies more than was realized. Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, the study found that the disease cut 1 percentage point each year from the annual growth rates of those economies. If malaria were eliminated in 1965, the report said, Africa's annual gross domestic product would be $400 billion now, rather than $300 billion. A10

Albright Overhauls Security After Loss of Computer
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, citing "inexcusable and intolerable" security lapses, stripped her intelligence office of its right to police itself, reassigned two diplomats and ordered supervisors to re-examine security procedures. The action came as the F.B.I. investigated the loss of a laptop computer said to contain highly sensitive files. A1
 
Sorting Out Elian Situation
The dispute over Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to order a raid to seize Elian Gonzalez in Miami was intensified by comments from the White House and from Congress, and by the release of documents from the final round of negotiations. A1
 
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said he was beginning a preliminary inquiry into the decision to use force. Most Democrats rallied around the administration. A20
 
Immigration lawyers say the fact that Elian is now in the custody of his father probably weakens prospects for his being granted asylum. A20
 
Democrats' Fund-Raiser
The Clintons and Gores appeared together at a Manhattan event that raised $2.2 million for the Democratic National Committee. A18
 
Challenging 'Blanket' Primary
The Supreme Court heard arguments on California's primary system, in which voters of all party affiliations receive the same ballot on which they can make any set of choices, without regard to party. A21
 
Judge Allows Davidian Claims
The federal judge presiding over the wrongful-death lawsuit of the Branch Davidians denied the Justice Department's request to throw out most of the plaintiffs' claims. 18

HEADLINE: Energy Secretary Asserts Blackout Threat Is Rising

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 24

 BODY:
Raising the specter of widespread blackouts, the United States secretary of energy said today that the nation's electric system might fare worse this summer than it did in 1999 because of a rocky transition to deregulation when demand for power is booming.
In meetings with government officials, corporate executives and customer advocates here and in Hartford, the secretary, Bill Richardson, called for new steps at the state and federal levels to line up customers who would be willing to be unplugged on the hottest summer days in exchange for appropriate payment, and for identifying the backup generators that some hospitals, factories and big companies maintain for emergencies and using them on days when the demand for electricity peaks. 
 "We're worried as a nation, despite a hugely booming economy, about problems in our electricity grid," Mr. Richardson said at a forum at the New Jersey Institute of Technology this afternoon. Mr. Richardson had a similar appearance in Hartford this morning and had scheduled one in New Orleans this evening. He plans to hold another, in Sacramento, on Friday.
Taking note of blackouts last summer, he said: "Fortunately, we were able to avoid a widespread systems failure, this time. But we may not be so fortunate in the future.
"Things may get worse before they get better. That's especially alarming in light of the National Weather Service prediction of a long hot summer in 2000."
But representatives of the region's electricity suppliers -- Consolidated Edison, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (the parent of Public Service Electric and Gas) and General Public Utilities -- all said that they had made extensive investments since last summer and would be ready for hot weather this year.
And in Hartford, Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said that state officials expected Connecticut's largest power generator, the Millstone 3 nuclear plant, to be in service this summer; last year, it was sidelined because of management problems.
But Mr. Rowland, who was the co-host of the session in Hartford with Mr. Richardson, said the public should be aware that conservation would be required on peak demand days. And in Newark, E. James Ferland, the chairman, president and chief executive of P.S.E.&G., said that New Jersey could face shortages "if there are problems in the Midwest and we are required to help."
Not everyone agreed with Mr. Richardson's short-term steps. "Turning on old dirty diesel generators that are the standby backup generators is going to be an environmental disaster," said Nathaniel Greene, an electricity expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, who was one of 19 panelists at the 90-minute session here.
The experts suggested a variety of reasons that the difference between electric supplies and peak demand had become uncomfortably small. One is that New England, New York and the Middle Atlantic states are all in various stages of deregulation.
Under the old system, the monopoly utilities generated power, transmitted it over their own lines and sold it to their own customers, but now some utilities have gotten out of the generating business while dozens of other companies have gotten into it. Under the deregulated system, electricity is bought and sold wholesale, hour by hour or minute by minute.
One difficulty, according to several participants, is that the new system has not provided proper incentives to companies to build new transmission lines.
Scott Weiner, a former head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy and now a senior vice president of Sithe Northeast, an independent power producer, said that the deregulated system was not "sending price signals that allow for the construction of new capacity and shoring up transmission systems."
Although New England runs low on spare capacity on peak days, he said, some companies are taking generators out of that region and shipping them elsewhere in the country to make larger profits.
The session was moderated by Kurt Yeager, the president and chief executive of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that has complained recently that deregulation has cut investment in research and development. In a recent report, the institute said that the electric system was in the worst condition it had been since the great northeast blackout of 1965.
The Northeast, however, has advantages over other parts of the country. The six-state New England region is centrally controlled, allowing better coordination of supply and demand; New York State's grid is also highly integrated, as is a region called PJM, covering most of Pennsylvania, all New Jersey, Delaware and the District of Columbia, most of Maryland and part of Virginia.
The integration, according to experts, helps induce independent generators to build, providing new supplies and enhancing competition to lower prices. One task for the federal government is to encourage electric companies elsewhere in the country, notably in the South and Midwest, to tie themselves together.

Agency Revenue Was Up Last Year

BYLINE: By David Barboza 

 BODY:
Revenue and billings for agencies increased by double-digit percentages last year from 1998, according to the 56th annual Agency Report by the trade publication Advertising Age. The rise was fueled by spending for dot-com campaigns, the strong American economy and robust merger and acquisition activity.
Revenue increased 21.7 percent, to $31.2 billion, from $25.6 billion in 1998, Advertising Age reported, as billings rose 19 percent, to $235.5 billion, from $198 billion. The Omnicom Group in New York remained the world's largest agency in revenue in 1999, at $5.7 billion, up 13.5 percent from 1998, followed by the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, at $5.1 billion, up 14.6 percent, and the WPP Group in London, at $4.8 billion, up 16.2 percent. 
 Ranked by billings, Interpublic remained first, at $47.2 billion, followed by Omnicom, at $45.6 billion, and WPP, at $37.1 billion.

HEADLINE: The Census and the Question About Race

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "The Census' Race Problem" (Op-Ed, April 19), Dawn Stover writes that the idea of race lacks scientific legitimacy. She concludes that Americans should list themselves as "human race" in the 2000 census.
Historians refer to the social construction of race. But this does not mean that race lacks historical importance. Blacks seeking a mortgage, encountering the police or hailing a taxi cannot simply declare themselves members of the human race and expect to be treated accordingly. Racial categories, while unscientific, have been used to distribute economic resources and political power in an unequal manner. 
 If the census stopped asking about race, we could not compare black and white unemployment, life expectancy or family wealth. Racial statistics remain essential to reveal how far we have progressed from our racialized past, and how far we still need to travel.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE INSIDER;
A Gore Adviser Who Basks in the Shadows

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
There is only one member of Vice President Gore's staff close enough to call him Al.
It is Leon Sigmund Fuerth, Mr. Gore's longest-serving aide, who has acted as his elder adviser on national security matters for two decades. The two men know each other so well that, like an old married couple, they can communicate through a grimace or a glance. 
 The relationship goes back to 1980, when Mr. Fuerth, a staff member on Capitol Hill, tutored the young congressman from Tennessee nine years his junior several hours a week for more than a year on the arcana of arms control. Since then Mr. Fuerth has exercised an important influence on Mr. Gore, whose world view blends a belief in a strong defense, the elevation of issues like illness and the environment to the top of the national security agenda and a moralistic impulse to punish dictators. Mr. Fuerth has often stiffened his boss's spine, from pressing early on to use strikes to constrain Serbian forces from ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo to taking an uncompromising line against Iraq, Iran and North Korea, which Mr. Fuerth has referred to privately as "giant zits on various parts of the body."
Yet for all his influence, including membership in the cabinet-level Principals' Committee that advises the president on foreign policy, the onetime foreign service officer labors largely in the shadows. He rarely gives speeches or interviews. He has written no great tomes. He likes to work alone. At one point he announced at a news briefing that his goal was to remain "nameless, faceless and odorless"; at another he told aides that his ideas "belong to the vice president."
Mr. Gore praises that approach as positively quaint and has hinted that he may name Mr. Fuerth as national security adviser in a Gore administration.
"He has a keen intellect, a strong character, absolute integrity and excellent instincts," Mr. Gore said in a telephone interview. "There is a certain quaintness to his insistence on taking as little credit for anything he can possibly push off to others, quaintness in the sense not that it is odd. In fact, I wish it were more common. In today's world that quality is all too rare."
Asked about Time magazine's prediction last year that Mr. Fuerth was "a cinch" to be national security adviser in a Gore administration, Mr. Gore at first stuck to his rule not to discuss potential advisers. But then he added, "If I were to break that rule for anybody, it would be for Leon."
Certainly quaintness is not a word that springs to mind in describing former national security advisers Henry A. Kissinger or Zbigniew Brzezinski. And when asked what Mr. Fuerth would be like in the job he once held, Mr. Kissinger replied, "I'm afraid I don't know the man."
Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have already begun to criticize the vice president and his top national security aide by criticizing the performance of the Clinton administration. "A hallmark of the Clinton-Gore foreign policy has been ad hockery and case-by-case actions lacking in strategy," said Robert Zoellick, an under secretary of state in the Bush administration. So despite Mr. Fuerth's passion for anonymity, he inevitably will be drawn into the spotlight in a presidential campaign in which Mr. Gore is increasingly contrasting his foreign policy experience with that of Mr. Bush.
And that could be uncomfortable for the 61-year-old Mr. Fuerth, who has spent his entire career inside government and has never had to develop an ear for politics. By contrast, Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, who is known as Sandy, knows how to shape foreign policy to fit politics. "Sandy came to the job as a political pro and had to master the foreign policy part of it," said Leslie Gelb, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations who has known both Mr. Berger and Mr. Fuerth for years. "Leon came to the White House as a foreign policy expert and he now has to master the politics."
Early in their relationship, Mr. Gore created a division of labor that both insist suits them fine. He told Mr. Fuerth to provide advice on what was good for the country and "leave the politics to me."
(On Super Tuesday, when it became clear that Mr. Gore would secure the Democratic nomination, Mr. Fuerth was not in Nashville celebrating and didn't want to intrude by calling; he sent a note of congratulations instead.)
But that division means that Mr. Fuerth can sometimes be out of the political loop. In an interview on March 30, for example, Mr. Fuerth was asked how his boss would resolve the case of the 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez. "The administration's position and the vice president's position consistently are to navigate where the boy's best interests are," Mr. Fuerth said. "And in our system, the courts are the best place to get this task done."
At almost the same time, Mr. Gore was proposing a legislative solution that could have allowed the boy to remain in the United States. By Mr. Fuerth's own admission, he was unaware that Mr. Gore had decided to change course that day.
And there can be a downside to avoiding politics. It was Mr. Fuerth who told Mr. Gore that the much criticized fund-raising luncheon at a Buddhist temple in 1996 posed no problem from a foreign policy standpoint, instead of looking at it from a larger legal and ethical perspective. (The National Security Council, by contrast, warned that Mr. Gore should proceed with "great, great caution.")
While Mr. Gore at times has devised idealistic solutions for global problems, Mr. Fuerth tends to takes a darker view that stems from a deeply rooted belief that the world is a dangerous place. As a young man, Mr. Fuerth said he was so terrified by the 1960 classic "On Thermonuclear War" by Herman Kahn that he was reluctant to start a family.
Mr. Fuerth's vacuum-cleaner mind and his tenacity when he is convinced he is right can make him a formidable opponent in the decision-making process. "Contrarian" is a word often used to describe him.
One "contrarian" episode came in the fall of 1995, when he opposed a proposal by Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief negotiator on Bosnia and now the American ambassador to the United Nations, to suspend most economic sanctions against Serbia on the eve of peace talks in Dayton. Mr. Fuerth arrived at a crucial White House meeting armed with fold-out charts illustrating various sanctions and why none of them should be lifted without a reciprocal action by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. The sanctions stayed in place. "A very creative and idiosyncratic intellect," is how Mr. Holbrooke describes Mr. Fuerth.
Still, his hard line has not always prevailed. He fiercely opposed -- unsuccessfully -- Mr. Clinton's decision in 1998 to waive sanctions against three foreign companies that were big investors in Iran's energy sector, arguing that preventing investment in Iran was more important than offending the European Union.
Over the years, Mr. Fuerth has often given his boss the ammunition to take tougher, and counterintuitive, stands on national security. During Mr. Gore's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for president in 1988, Mr. Fuerth helped him formulate an uncritical pro-Israeli line. Mr. Gore even criticized the Reagan administration for trying to push Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to go along with a peace initiative that called on Israel to withdraw from land it occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace with its Arab neighbors. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Mr. Fuerth provided Mr. Gore, then a senator, with a three-inch-thick binder explaining why he should break with other Senate Democrats and vote in favor of going to war. (He did.) In 1991, Mr. Fuerth helped draft a speech in Senator Gore's name in which he advocated the removal of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the ruling Baath party leadership and the compilation of a war crimes file against them.
Early in the administration, Mr. Fuerth used his perch as head of an interagency process to institute sanctions against Haiti, Serbia and Iraq. He has persuaded the administration to embrace a complicated, controversial and expensive plan to transport Caspian Sea oil and gas through a route that will avoid Russia and Iran.
As manager of the binational commissions that Mr. Gore created with Russia, South Africa, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Mr. Fuerth has tackled unconventional issues that sometimes slip through the cracks. But both he and the vice president have been criticized for being slow to accept mounting evidence from the intelligence community of the level of Russian corruption.
Mr. Fuerth can sound downright eloquent when discussing issues about which both he and the vice president feel passionately, like the AIDS epidemic in sub-Sahara Africa. "If you get something which can burn out the heart of a generation, what is the difference if they're dying of disease or war?" he said. "They're dying! And people will not flourish, people will not live out their lives or make their full contributions. Societies will be destabilized. A generation of orphans will be created. So if you need an analogy to warfare, it's the consequences of war without the explosion."
Yet at other times, Mr. Fuerth's innate caution can make him difficult to decipher. When asked at a recent press breakfast what Mr. Gore would like to change about defense strategy, Mr. Fuerth replied: "I think his view is that the two major contingency strategies have served us very well, and it is possible to see exactly where the vice president has been in the Cabinet Room with the president and the others at moments when we have had to ask ourselves whether if we move a carrier from one place to the next, we are opening ourselves up to adventure by one opponent or the next."
Mr. Gore, nevertheless, relies on Mr. Fuerth for both data and analysis, which he often delivers in a constant stream of hand-written, humor-laced, policy-filled billets-doux during meetings, meals and even receiving lines. The note-passing became so disruptive during the president's cabinet meetings that protocol was abandoned and Mr. Fuerth was given a permanent seat at the vice president's immediate right.
Before every bilateral meeting with foreign officials, Mr. Gore gets the benefit of Mr. Fuerth's deeply detailed knowledge of policy, detailed in thick briefing books and then distilled on a stack of four- by six-inch cards.
Some years ago, when an aide urged Mr. Gore to dispense with the cards, suggesting he did not really need them, the vice president was said to reply that he did not want to hurt Mr. Fuerth's feelings. Mr. Gore now says that if he ever said such a thing, it was in jest and that in fact, he does need the cards.
Unlike Mr. Gore, Mr. Fuerth did not grow up privileged. His father, who drove an ice cream truck, died when Leon, an only child, was 8; his widowed mother went to work in a dry cleaning shop.
After majoring in English at New York University, Mr. Fuerth entered the ir Force as a second lieutenant. Back at the university, he began a doctorate in Russian history, but joined the foreign service when his wife, Lynn, had their first of two sets of twin girls and he needed a job.
Eleven years later, he went to work for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. When Mr. Gore moved to the Senate, he took Mr. Fuerth with him.
Mr. Gore describes Mr. Fuerth as a cross between "a rabbi and a stand-up comic." But many outsiders don't see his lighter side. His gruffness earned him the nickname Metternich on the Hill years ago and Darth Vader more recently in the corridors of the State Department.
Some people insist that too much work and too little staff account for his irritability; others say it stems from deep shyness. Said Toby T. Gati, who came to respect Mr. Fuerth when she was the National Security Council's Russia expert: "He's not a mother figure. He's not a father figure. He's a patriarch."
Part of Mr. Fuerth's image problem is his body language. He has a habit of casting his glance downward, staring at his tightly folded hands. The posture is so much a part of his persona that Mr. Gore parodied it at a party to celebrate Mr. Fuerth's 60th birthday a year ago.
After Mr. Fuerth suffered a mild heart attack in March 1999, he changed his lifestyle sharply, shedding 45 pounds and embracing a tough exercise regime. At his 60th birthday party a few weeks later, Mr. Gore had this advice for him: "We all want to say, 'Relax!' "
Indeed, he is trying to do that, even reaching out more to a class of people with whom he never felt comfortable: the Washington press corps.
Certainly Mr. Fuerth has come a long way from the briefing during Mr. Gore's 1997 China trip in which he inadvertently referred to the press corps as "clutter." "I have been adjusting my approach," Mr. Fuerth said, in an effort to "break down the wall I had put up."
Some of Mr. Fuerth's colleagues speculate that he may be better suited in the job of, say, director of central intelligence or secretary of defense than of national security adviser, which has typically required extensive public diplomacy and the ability to compromise.
But Mr. Fuerth has something that no other national security expert does: an intimate relationship with Mr. Gore. And Mr. Gore may just want to keep the man he calls "a great friend" close to his side, doing what he has always done -- keeping him informed, passing him notes, feeding him ideas, making him laugh and always, always giving him the credit.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
White House Foursome Swaps Familiar Roles

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Bill Clinton may be president, and Al Gore may be vice president, but, as Tony Bennett put it, "the best is yet to come."
The song seemed tailor-made for a Democratic fund-raising gala last night in Midtown Manhattan where political ambition was unbound, both for Mr. Gore, who wants to be president, and for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who aspires to move on from the first ladyship to the Senate. 
 The Clintons and the Gores revived their 1992 bus-touring foursome for the evening, bringing in $2.2 million for the Democratic National Committee.
Tipper Gore introduced Hillary, Hillary introduced Bill and Bill introduced Al, just like old times, except this time Al was on top. He was presented as the ranking guest of honor, he spoke last and he gave the longest speech. And Mr. Clinton praised him most extravagantly.
"I feel absolutely comfortable putting the future of my daughter and the grandchildren I hope she'll give us in his hands," the president told more than 1,000 people who paid more than $1,000 each for a dinner of filet mignon and a chance to see the Fab Four at the Sheraton Towers on Seventh Avenue at 53rd Street.
The committee set up two reception rooms at the hotel, one with Mr. Clinton and one with Mr. Gore, and guests who had given or raised $25,000 each shuttled between them before sitting down to dinner.
With the help of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, the party raised $26 million in the first quarter of this year toward its 2000 goal of $100 million. About two weeks ago, they raised $2.8 million from roughly 100 contributors in Hollywood.
Guests last night included Lauren Bacall, the actress; Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of President John F. Kennedy; Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the Kennedy historian; Sam Waterston, the actor; Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the Miramax unit of the Walt Disney Company; Larry Rockefeller, a Republican and New York environmental lawyer; and Martha Stewart, the doyenne of home and hearth.
They were joined by several New York politicians, including Carl McCall, the state controller; Representative Anthony Weiner of Brooklyn; and Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general.
The Clintons and Gores dispersed themselves at different tables throughout the vast ballroom but spent much of the night circulating and schmoozing. Seated with Mrs. Clinton was Bernard Schwartz, the chairman of the Loral Space and Communications Corporation, a major Democratic donor and friend of the Clintons. Loral is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into the export of satellite technology to China.
If there was any question that the Gores were separating from the Clintons, they all did their best to erase that impression as they passed around the compliments, waxed nostalgic about their eight-year public relationship, and Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore embraced in a big bear hug.
Mrs. Gore called Mr. Clinton one of the party's "greatest presidents ever." She said Mrs. Clinton "embodies all the best values of the Democratic Party" and "knows how to achieve results."
Mrs. Clinton, who delivered a campaign-like stump speech, said the nation's current economic success would not be possible "if this administration had not kept faith with you."
She said she and her husband were feeling nostalgic because they had just held their last Easter-egg roll at the White House. She raised a few eyebrows when she added that they had been "thinking about everything that has happened since 1992," but Mr. Clinton raised more when he made a glancing reference to his impeachment.
Mr. Clinton said that some previous presidents had complained about how hard the job was but that they had nothing on him. "Most of those guys haven't had as tough a time as I have," he said. "I don't know what the heck they're talking about." He and Mrs. Clinton laughed.
Mr. Clinton praised his wife, saying she would be "a worthy successor to Robert Kennedy and Pat Moynihan." And of her speech delivery, he said approvingly, "I think she's getting the hang of it, don't you?"
But the president saved his most extravagant praise for Mr. Gore. He said he wished he had "half the experience coming into office" as Mr. Gore has and "he has performed in an absolutely stunning manner."
And in a voice and words suffused with unusual intimacy, Mr. Clinton said he could vouch for the vice president. "I probably know more about him than anybody but Tipper," the president said. "I know what he likes and what he can't stand. I know what he loves, I know when he's having a bad day and how he deals with it. And by the way, he knows the same about me."
Mr. Gore said that Mr. Clinton's comments were "by far the most generous introduction I've ever had." He praised Mr. Clinton for demonstrating "the capacity to bring us all together" and said "his legacy will endure."
And as he repeated much of his campaign stump speech, he warned: "Everything flowing from the vision of Bill Clinton is instantly at risk if the other party is put in charge of economic policy."
The event caused considerable traffic gridlock across New York. The president and Mrs. Clinton arrived together from Washington on Air Force One but then left in separate motorcades. Mr. Gore arrived later on Air Force Two, and Mrs. Gore arrived separately. The foursome presented a such a heightened need for security that the director of the Secret Service traveled with the Clintons on Air Force One.

HEADLINE: Rent Proposals Raise Specter Of Big Increases

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The agency that decides rent increases for the one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City is considering major changes in its formulas that could theoretically raise rents 8.5 percent for a one-year lease and 12 percent for a two-year lease. Rent increases that size have not been seen since the era of double-digit inflation two decades ago.
But the head of the agency, the Rent Guidelines Board, said that the final figures this year were unlikely to be that high. 
 Another option being explored, for example, could raise rents 6 percent for a one-year lease and 10 percent for a two-year lease. Even that would far exceed the levels authorized in the last three years, which were 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease.
"Don't get hung up on the numbers," the board's chairman, Edward S. Hochman, said in an interview. "The odds of it being either of those two sets of numbers, 8.5 and 12 or 6 and 10, are quite limited. There will be variations."
The board now imposes rent increases based partly on an index of landlords' operating costs compiled by the board. One of the proposed changes in the formula would expand the index to include the effect inflation has on the landlords' operating income. Another would take into account how their operating income is affected by tenants who renew with two-year leases. A third change would exclude from the calculations the additional income that landlords collect in accordance with a 1997 state law entitling them to charge up to 20 percent more to the next tenant after a vacancy.
In an annual rite of spring for New Yorkers, representatives of landlords and tenants clash over the rent increases in debates at the board's public hearings, with cheering and jeering audiences. One side or the other -- if not both -- can be counted on to complain about being shortchanged.
But the debate is likely to intensify this time, with both the rent increases and the complex method of calculating them being discussed.
The proposals, which Mr. Hochman outlined in a memorandum to the board, will be made public at a board meeting today. No immediate decision is expected, however. The board's preliminary vote on the maximum rent increases is scheduled for May 8, with a final vote on June 22. The new rates will go into effect on Oct. 1.
Spokesmen for the landlords said that the board's methods were long overdue for revision. "There were some old rules of thumb that were really inappropriate," said Jack Freund, the executive vice president and chief economist for the city's largest residential landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association. "They just didn't take into account things like two-year leases and inflation. The board's price index doesn't measure everything, like the fact that buildings are getting older and need more maintenance."
The proposals, however, drew a howl of protest from tenant leaders. "Outrageous," said Michael McKee, a co-director of New York State Tenants and Neighbors, an advocacy group. Landlords are already benefiting from excessive rent increases that are yielding record income, he said. At a time of low inflation, "there is certainly no need for any rent increase," he said, much less a need for a big one. Mr. McKee speculated that the giant increases being threatened would be scaled back to make Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani "look like a hero in an election year."
Mr. Giuliani, who appoints the rent board members and its chairman, is running for the United States Senate.
Mr. Hochman denied any political motives, saying, "The numbers are the numbers."
Mr. Hochman said he wanted the board to end its practice of debating which of three different formulas to follow, "two of which were pretty lousy, pretty inaccurate." Instead, he said, "I want to have the best formula and then fine-tune that."
Mr. McKee called the proposals "a grotesque change in methodology." He said that "all the methods are flawed and are set up to justify a rent increase, whether it's really needed or not."
Tenant leaders are also worried that as rents rise, more apartments will reach a $2,000-a-month rental threshold that can lead to deregulation of those apartments.
Besides reviewing the formula itself, the rent board is dealing with actual increases in income and costs. The board's annual price index of operating costs to be released today shows a hefty 7.8 percent increase.
Mr. Hochman blamed taxes, which he said rose 5 percent, and fuel oil for heat and hot water, which jumped 54 percent. "This created havoc," he said. Another element, yet to be factored in, is the recent contract settlement for the building workers' union.
"We have to produce rough justice," Mr. Hochman said. "We have to protect tenants against aberrational increases and still make the owners whole. It's a balancing of the equities."
From the owners' point of view, Mr. Freund said: "Rent increases are going to have to be significantly higher than they have been in the last three years. We had a low inflationary environment, and that has changed. Costs have gone up, and they have to be passed along. Someone has to pay for it. A lot of people are doing quite well out there. Remember, the median rental stabilized apartment is $650, so when we're talking about a percentage increase, even if it's high, you're not looking at big dollars. Not a lot of people will get excited by that."
But Mr. McKee said that basing permanent rent increases on temporary spikes in fuel oil prices was illogical and unfair and had proven costly to tenants. "The last time this happened was in 1996," he said. "Fuel prices started dropping almost as soon as the decision was made for 5 and 7 percent rent increases, and prices dropped to lower than they were before, but the rents were locked in forever."
A rent board study released two weeks ago showed that in 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, landlords recorded the highest net operating income and lowest cost increases of any year since the city began tracking those numbers nine years ago.
But Mr. Freund said: "Don't forget that owners took a real hit in the late 70's and early 80's. Only now are they getting back to where things were before."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Aiding an Indian Village With an Electric Chair

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
When a poor Indian village in the state of Kerala learns of a wonderful American product that will make life better and put the village on the international map, what could that item possibly be? A modern sanitation system? A medical clinic? A supercomputer? Think again.
What the people naively believe will bring them glory and elevate one of them into a national hero is an electric chair, or "electronic chair" as it's called in Murali Nair's dryly devastating movie, "Throne of Death." One of its benefits, an ambitious local politician promises, will be to enable all those seeking painless final exits from life to leave peacefully whenever they choose. Thanks to the generosity of the United States and the World Bank, he announces, it won't be long before every Indian village has its own electronic "throne of death." 
 The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum on a double bill with a touching Senegalese film, "The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun," is all the more scathing for keeping its tongue firmly in its cheek. Instead of being directed as a comedy, this satire of political corruption and public credulousness poses a work of lyric realism. As the camera moves in for dreamy close-ups of the faces of Krishnan (Vishwas Njarakkal), the "lucky" villager who will be the first to mount the throne, his wife (Lakshmi Raman) and their young son (Jeevan Mitva), they radiate the spiritual glow of downtrodden innocents in a Satyajit Ray film.
Gaunt and white-haired, Krishnan struggles to eke out the meagerest of livings as a laborer. His family is so poor that when he buys his son a rubber ball, it is a dangerous extravagance. Eventually facing starvation, Krishnan is reduced to stealing coconuts from his employer's property and is arrested. While in jail, he is indicted for an unsolved political murder (although no evidence exists connecting him with the crime) and sentenced to die. Krishnan meekly accepts his fate. What becomes a major issue in a local election isn't the injustice of his sentence or the corrupt legal system but the manner of Krishan's imminent execution. The villagers organize vigorous demonstrations supporting the more humane electrocution instead of hanging.
The movie suggests that the ceremonial pomp surrounding capital punishment in India is as grotesque as it is in the United States. As Krishnan is served an elaborate final dinner, you wonder if it's the only decent meal he's ever eaten. "Throne of Death" may be the first film to present a wrongful execution as a "happy" ending.
Djibril Diop Mambety's fable "The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun" also finds sunshine amid abject misery. The final film by Mr. Mambety, who died in 1998, this portrait of an indomitably spirited beggar girl wobbling on her crutches through the streets of Dakar is described in the end credits as a prayer for the world's street children.
What could have been a soggy mess is redeemed by Lissa Balera's tough but luminous portrayal of the little girl, Sili. Hitching a ride to Dakar from the city's rural outskirts, where she lives with her blind grandmother, she takes a job hawking newspapers on the streets. The only girl in a swarm of ragged, predatory boys who threaten her at every turn, Sili exhibits an extraordinary self-possession. After a miraculous windfall, she is accosted by a suspicious policeman who wonders how she came by such a large sum. Instead of running away, she leads the officer to the police station and pleads her case with his superior, demanding an apology. It is only one of several personal triumphs.
 
Both "Throne of Death" and "The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun" wonder how it is possible for the human spirit to transcend abject poverty and injustice, and both come up with the same answer. It has to do with a mysterious thing called faith.

HEADLINE: The Price of Health Care

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is not evident, as one expert states in your April 21 front-page article, that home health care is cheaper than inpatient care.
The national average hospital occupancy ratio is about 65 percent. Having armies of home care workers traveling to geographically disparate locations to visit patients requires more resources than would be needed to care for the same patients, if they were concentrated at half-empty hospitals. 
 And quality of care can be more effectively assured in a hospital than in a home care setting, where health workers cannot easily be supervised.
Careful economic analysis is apt to show that the cost of home care typically exceeds that of inpatient care at half-empty hospitals. The added cost can be justified only if home care yields patient and family a commensurately higher quality of life.

HEADLINE: Who Were We in Vietnam?

BYLINE: By Walter A. McDougall; Walter A. McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and University of Pennsylvania professor, was an army artilleryman in Vietnam.

 BODY:
Twas in another lifetime, full of toil and blood," began Bob Dylan's "Shelter from the Storm" in 1974, when "blackness was a virtue, and the road was full of mud." The fall of South Vietnam 25 years ago seems to me a scene from another lifetime.
I had returned from Vietnam in 1970, earned a Ph.D. in history at the University of Chicago, and just received a job offer from Berkeley (the letter was dated April Fool's Day). I was as sick of the war as anyone and eager to "open up that Golden Gate." But news that the North Vietnamese had launched an invasion more akin to the blitzkrieg of Poland than to a Maoist "people's war," and had overrun my old base camp 30 miles up Thunder Road from Saigon, turned my heart to lead. 
 I could not deal with it any more than I had the death of my mother a few years earlier, so I repressed it until, in 1994, a former student invited me to lecture on Vietnam to his prep school students. Thanks to him, I dredged up and purged all my anger, disillusionment, fear and pity -- for myself and the Vietnamese -- and promptly worked up a seminar on the war that I have taught ever since.
No one disputes Vietnam's manifold effects on America. Richard Nixon presided over replacement of the draft with an all-volunteer (and increasingly mixed-gender) force and reduction of the voting age to 18. The Vietnam syndrome and the public's aversion to casualties inspired the strict Weinberger-Powell guidelines for the commitment of forces abroad. Congress attacked the so-called imperial presidency through the War Powers Act, C.I.A. hearings and the movement to impeach Richard Nixon for abuses committed in the name of national security. A loss of trust in the presidency ensued, and the media became adversarial. Yet the turmoil at home also allowed Nixon to pursue the Silent Majority and Southern strategies that paved the way for Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, and our policies are still perturbed by what candidates did, or did not do, back in the 60's.
Vietnam also completed the integration of the armed forces and launched the careers of thousands of African-American officers and noncommissioned officers, as well as others who returned home to work in law enforcement, government and the professions. The Pentagon itself addressed racial tensions so well after 1975 that the military became a model for civilian institutions.
The war's primary economic effect was "guns and butter" budgets that helped to spark the inflation of the 1970's and hooked the federal government on deficit spending until the 1990's.
But the deepest long-term effect on America may stem from the rich and undeserved contributions made to American life by the Vietnamese refugees who quietly went to work restoring blighted neighborhoods, building businesses and sending their children to college.
The lessons of the war, by contrast, are still up for grabs, as demonstrated by the flow of new books. Was the military derelict in its duty when it promised, then pretended, to win the war, or did arrogant civilians order the military into battle with one hand tied and no clear goals? Was the American effort in Vietnam a sin, a blunder or a "necessary war"? Should it stand as a warning against state-building projects in strange and violent settings, like the Balkans? Or did Vietnam's school of hard knocks teach Americans to do peacemaking and state building right?
Drawing lessons from Vietnam remains a political enterprise. It is also a deeply psychological one for those who designed the war and for the baby boomers who were obliged to wage, resist or just run from it. No one wants to admit being wrong back then, and all want to believe that what happened back then proves they are right today.
Still, post-cold war historians have revealed certain facts that Americans need to digest. One is that there was nothing inevitable about Ho Chi Minh's rise to the status of icon. He spent his mysterious years in Moscow and China doing virtually nothing useful, and was little regarded in the Indochinese Communist Party. What made possible his "triumphant return" in 1941 was Vietnam's premature uprising against the French in 1940 and the decimation of its Communist leadership.
We know, too, that Ho promoted the broad-based Viet Minh movement not only to rally the masses against the Japanese and the French, but also to co-opt or eliminate rivals. To be sure, he was a puppet of no one, least of all Vietnam's old nemesis, China. But when Hanoi decided in 1959 to approve armed struggle against Ngo Dinh Diem's regime in Saigon, Ho personified the third world "national liberation movements" that Khrushchev and Mao vowed to support and Kennedy was determined to thwart.
It is easy to chastise Americans for backing the French and then replacing them as patrons of South Vietnam. But we did, and great nations are responsible for their acts. That is why the most shameful aspect of all is how the United States, having adopted the non-Communist Vietnamese, betrayed them repeatedly. The first time was in 1963 when President Kennedy's men sanctioned the overthrow of Diem because he was an authoritarian patriot who refused to play puppet. If they were intent on judging the Saigon regime by different standards than they did South Korea and Taiwan, then they should have pulled out.
Instead, the Johnson administration not only took over the war, but chose means -- search and destroy missions in the South and calibrated bombing in the North, without any effort to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- that were as ineffective as they were destructive. Then Lyndon Johnson just washed his hands of the mess after Tet 1968, when he halted the bombing, begged for peace talks, gave Hanoi time to recoup from the devastating losses suffered by Viet Cong cadres and bequeathed to his successor 540,000 demoralized American troops who knew we "weren't in it to win." That was America's second betrayal of the South Vietnamese.
When Paul O'Dwyer, a New York Democratic Senate candidate, told the 1968 Democratic convention that Democratic voters had registered "an indictment" against the war, it was over so far as doves were concerned. But the people who voted for Nixon and George Wallace were not tired of fighting; they were tired of losing. What is more, Nixon and Henry Kissinger hoped to salvage America's global posture through the China Opening, and soon suspected that the Chinese wanted Americans in Southeast Asia. Beset on their northern frontier by Soviet armies and rocket divisions, the Chinese were loath to see Vietnam unite under the tough pro-Soviet regime in Hanoi. So instead of blaming the Democrats and "bugging out" in his personal interest, Nixon determined to withdraw gradually. That did him in. He was a war president held to peacetime standards of governance, and when Congress cut off aid to Saigon after the 1973 Paris Accords, it was voting for defeat, not for peace. That was America's third betrayal.
A bright student from New York taught me that. Throughout the semester he had criticized United States involvement in Vietnam until, in the penultimate class, he suddenly changed his mind. Later I asked him wryly, "Who are you?"
He asked what I meant, and I referred to his flip-flop. He blushed, then said, "Nixon was right!" About geopolitics? No, he said, about honor: maybe we shouldn't have been there, but having created South Vietnam, urged its people to fight for 10 years at the risk of exile, prison and death if they lost, and done so much damage to their country, how could Americans just desert them? He even likened it to turning our backs on the Holocaust.
Who are you? It seems Americans will be answering that question for some time to come, with that other lifetime on their minds.

HEADLINE: Erle Cocke Jr., 78, War Hero Who Led American Legion

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Erle Cocke Jr., a decorated World War II soldier who was the national commander of the American Legion in 1950 and 1951, died on Sunday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 78.
The cause was cancer. 
 Mr. Cocke, at age 29, became the youngest person to command the American Legion, the country's largest veterans' organization.
A native of Dawson, Ga., Mr. Cocke graduated from the University of Georgia in 1942 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army infantry. He worked his way through the ranks, becoming a rifle company commander, a battalion executive officer and then a battalion commander.
He was wounded three times, was captured by the Germans and escaped three times. He narrowly escaped being executed by the Waffen SS after he was captured the third time, with his unit, in 1945.
Mr. Cocke and several others had escaped but were recaptured by SS troops. They were ordered executed, and he was left for dead among a group of American soldiers shot in a German village by a firing squad.
Hours later, a villager, Lukas Walters, found him and hid him in a barn. A farmer, Karl Bart, tended his wounds until he was rescued. Mr. Cocke would spent 14 months in 27 hospitals, 11 in the United States. He underwent 17 major operations.
His former division commander, Maj. Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe, said later that Mr. Cocke had "displayed courage of the highest degree, enthusiasm and excellent judgment."
He left the service as a major after receiving the Silver Star, the Purple Heart with three clusters, the Bronze Star and the French Croix de Guerre.
In 1999 he said: "I would have apologized the rest of my life if I had not been in World War II. I owed my government that much. That was my opportunity to contribute."
After the war, he earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University.
He was a farmer and railroad executive when he was elected commander of the Legion. He was outspoken in the post, urging more than once that the Soviet Union be expelled from the United Nations.
Mr. Cocke headed a Legion drive to oust Secretary of State Dean Acheson and a campaign to have all members of the Communist Party in the United States arrested and tried for treason.
He also called for an end to the nation's foreign economic aid program.
In 1951, when President Harry S. Truman relieved Gen. Douglas MacArthur of command in Korea and the Far East, Mr. Cocke came out in support of the general's proposal to use Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Taiwan to open a second front against the Chinese Communists on the mainland. Mr. Cocke also backed MacArthur's demand for the authority to bomb Chinese bases in Manchuria.
Later that day Truman canceled a meeting with Mr. Cocke. Some days later, Mr. Cocke, in a speech at a Legion convention in Florida, contended that soldiers, not "swivel-chair politicians or striped-pants diplomats" should make the United States' war decisions.
Nonetheless, Truman would later appoint Mr. Cocke to be a consultant for the Defense Department. President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Mr. Cocke an alternate representative to a session of the United Nations General Assembly. He also held a World Bank post in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and was a friend of President Jimmy Carter.
Mr. Cocke was active in Democratic politics, was a brigadier general in the Georgia National Guard and was president of the lobbying firm Cocke & Phillips.
He is survived by his wife, Madelyn; three daughters, Elise C. Cocke, Jennifer C. Carpenter and Carolyn C. Whitsett; six grandsons; and a sister, Alice C. Cofield.

HEADLINE: Shares of 3M Are Hammered Despite 19% Gain in Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, April 25

 BODY:
Shares of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 3.7 percent today after the company said that its profit in 2000 might fall short of analysts' highest estimates.
Although 3M's first-quarter profit rose 19 percent, beating expectations, marketing expenses are expected to offset a one-time gain. 
 "Now you've got management putting a damper on expectations," said Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. The extra profit "everyone was counting on isn't any good."
The stock fell $3.5625, to $93.8125. It had risen 20 percent the last year.
The company said in a conference call that full-year per-share profit would rise 12 percent to 14 percent compared with earnings in 1999, when it earned $4.21 a share from continuing operations. The company is expected to earn $4.68, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Estimates ranged from $4.60 to $4.80 a share.
In the first quarter, profit from operations increased to $455.4 million, or $1.13 a share, compared with $384 million, or 95 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.3 percent, to $4.05 billion from $3.78 billion. Wall Street estimates were $1.08 a share.
3M had a first-quarter gain of $31.6 million, or 8 cents a share, from ending a marketing agreement with Hoechst of Germany, which made net income $487 million, or $1.21 a share.
That gain will be offset by marketing spending expected in the rest of the year, the company said.
It receives more than half its revenue outside the United States and has benefited from rebounding economies in Asia and Europe. It is also selling more industrial products in the United States.
Robert J. Burgstahler, the company's chief financial officer, said the company expected to earn $3.60 a share -- "at the very top end" -- for the rest of the year. Added to the $1.21 a share it earned in the first quarter, per-share profit in 2000 would be $4.81 at most.
"That range today reflects some of these concerns," Mr. Burgstahler said. "We have been overcoming all of those and are delivering."

HEADLINE: City Presents Labor Proposals But Union Says It Is Insulted

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Seeking to push citywide labor negotiations forward, the Giuliani administration presented its first formal contract proposals yesterday, but the union local that received the proposals, one that represents school safety officers and Housing Authority workers, called the proposals an insult.
The city's labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, who has been overseeing the city's labor negotiations, presented a package that called for no across-the-board pay increases, with all raises coming instead in the form of individualized merit pay. The city also called for the workers to pay part of their health insurance premiums; the city now covers 100 percent of those premiums. 
 The city made those proposals in talks yesterday with representatives of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 18,000 city workers. On March 2, that union local became the first union of municipal workers to present its demands in this year's round of negotiations.
Nicholas Mancuso, the union's chief negotiator, denounced the city's demands. "This proposal is an insult," he said. "We are taxpayers and we are not going to be treated like beggars."
Mr. Mancuso attacked in particular the city's merit pay proposal. "We will not entertain the idea of merit pay as a condition for a new contract," he said. "Merit pay is retrogression to a political patronage system."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has repeatedly defended his merit pay proposal, saying the best way to encourage city workers to be more productive is to give raises to those doing the best work.
In the proposals that the local presented in March, it called for across-the-board wage increases substantially higher than the inflation rate and a cash bonus to compensate workers for the three-year wage freeze that they took as part of their old contract.
The union local represents school safety officers, police officers at city-owned hospitals and more than a dozen categories of Housing Authority workers, including maintenance workers, superintendents and heating technicians. For some of those workers, their contract expired on Dec. 31, while for others, it expired on March 31. The union's workers earn from $20,000 to more than $40,000 a year.
Local 237 officials said yesterday that they would hesitate to bargain again with Mr. Hanley, the labor commissioner, unless some of Mr. Giuliani's City Hall aides were on hand.
While many union officials have praised Mr. Hanley's professionalism, they say they believe that it will be hard to make significant progress in contract negotiations unless Mr. Giuliani sends top aides to join the commissioner at the table.
In yesterday's talks, the city requested a five-year contract. Local 237 and other municipal unions are seeking a three-year contract.

HEADLINE: They Can Get It for You Resale;
Secondhand Stores Moving Into the Retail Mainstream

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Shopping secondhand stores, once the passion of an eccentric minority, is becoming a mainstream activity.
In addition to the determined scavengers who have long hunted for vintage dresses and side tables at flea markets, some consumers are now looking to the resale industry as a cheaper way to buy everything from computers to designer jeans to Sub-Zero refrigerators. 
 Heightening demand is the fact that the industry has worked hard to transform itself, with many store owners adopting sophisticated marketing techniques, building chain operations and adding stores in affluent suburbs. Determined to shed their image as dank backwaters for the down and out, stores that sell used goods have installed better lights, dressing rooms and even coffee bars.
Internet auction sites like eBay have also given new exposure and high-technology chic to the age-old practice.
As a result, sales at pawnshops, antique stores and secondhand shops have been growing nearly twice as fast as other retail. In 1997, the last year for which the Census Bureau kept comprehensive numbers, Americans spent some $12 billion on merchandise bought at these secondhand stores, about a 30 percent jump from 1992, after adjusting for inflation. Census estimates, which will not be confirmed until 2002, suggest that the industry grew 23 percent, to $17 billion, last year.
The census does not list sales by category of used merchandise, but antiques sold by auction -- that is much of high-end antique furniture or art purchases -- are excluded.
While sales of secondhand goods amounted to only a little more than 2 percent of all dollars spent on general apparel, merchandise and furnishings in this country last year, the growing demand for used goods still represents a sea change in the way Americans perceive castoffs. And the heady growth is all the more surprising because it comes at a time when consumers can afford to buy new.
"The used-product business has really evolved to a mainline retail business," said Ted Manley, president and chief operating officer of Grow Biz International Inc., which runs six chains of used-goods stores, including Once Upon a Child and Play It Again Sports.
Over the last decade, traditional retailers have trained consumers to expect to find lower prices just about everywhere for just about everything. Discounters like Target and Kmart have grown at the expense of department stores and have lured upper- and middle-income customers with low prices on Martha Stewart pool furniture or embroidered tops.
As buying cheap has become synonymous with smart shopping, almost-new merchandise has also gained new cachet. "Just over the past five years, the increase in the acceptability of buying used has been amazing," said Christa Weil, author of "Secondhand Chic" (Pocket Books, 1999). "I used to slink around doing it and now friends brag about buying secondhand."
She points to her best friend, who after years of mocking her for shopping secondhand, bought her wedding dress from a thrift shop specializing in vintage gowns.
And while discount stores are still known for what are frequently second-rate goods, secondhand stores are gaining reputations for high-quality merchandise at low prices.
"I like nice things; I'm not a blue-light special person," said Pat Bolar, a homemaker who shops for secondhand designer wear at One More Time in an upscale neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio.
The boom economy has supplied secondhand stores, whether charitable or for-profit ventures, with enormous amounts of high-quality merchandise. As Americans grow wealthier, they are more likely to replace barely used sofa sets or cull from their closets the Gucci pants worn once to a wedding last year. Sporting goods, like high-quality tennis rackets bought with the best intentions, find their way to the used-product stores as well.
"Some people get tired of things very quickly," said Jane Strauch, owner of Patrick's Consignment Store in Pacific Grove, Calif. In January, for example, a local resident consigned a cherrywood jewelry chest that still had the protective plastic from the factory on it.
Also, areas of this market are increasingly being fueled by the rapid obsolescence of high-technology gear. The resale personal computer business barely existed a decade ago. Now industry experts estimate that it exceeds $5 billion a year, as businesses, in particular, race to keep up with newer gadgets and the increases in computing power each year. (Purchases by businesses directly from other businesses, which account for the bulk of the $5 billion computer resale market, are not included in the census's used-merchandise category.)
Consumers and businesses are mixing and matching their computer hardware. "We sell to a very broad base of customers," said Taylor Bond, until recently president of the 210-store used-computer chain Computer Renaissance. That chain is also under the Grow Biz umbrella and had $150 million in sales last year.
"Because our stores offer both new and used systems," Mr. Bond said, "we often build a nice, new customized system for mom and dad and then the kids will get refurbished machines, because they are the last people the parents want playing on the new system."
The used-music business is also exploding. "Vinyls would wear out, but the compact disc won't wear out absent physical abuse," said Jerry Grizzle, chairman and chief executive of CD Warehouse, a 360-store chain that sells used discs. "The technology gave validity to the used-music market."
But perhaps the biggest change in the secondhand business has been the revamping of the stores themselves. In recent years, businesses ranging from tiny thrift stores to giant nonprofit charities to pawn shops have upgraded store design, layout and organization of goods. Goodwill Industries International, for example, has added coffee bars to a half-dozen stores and has begun putting couches in its used-book areas so customers can loll about.
"The retail market is much more competitive, so we have to do everything we can to attract and retain customers," said Christine Bragale, the charity's spokeswoman, exhibiting the kind of consumer-first attitude that would make a Barnes & Noble manager envious.
Throughout the nonprofit sector, secondhand stores are sweeping away dust bunnies and adding overhead lighting. And, if anything, the changes have been more drastic in the for-profit sector. Grow Biz is just the largest of several corporations that have tried to organize and invigorate the resale business by bringing the levels of customer service and inventory display that shoppers associate with chains like the Gap.
Although most of Grow Biz's stores are independent franchises, they follow standard policies on returns and guarantees of service. Revenue for the corporation and its associated stores were $650 million in 1999.
That is a decrease from previous years, because Grow Biz has not been successful in all of the resale areas it has entered. For instance, it was forced to sell off its music and games franchises and the company turned from a profit to a loss in 1999.
Traditionally, resale businesses have been hard to organize nationally because stores buy goods piecemeal from local sellers who bring in castoffs. Advances in data-organizing software are making it easier, however. The CD Warehouse system tracks customer purchases at each store, ranks recordings' popularity with customers and assigns prices to them accordingly. Secondhand goods have also flourished in the new retail medium of the Internet. The explosion of used-goods auctions taking place at popular online sites from eBay to Yahoo to Amazon.com have made purchasing used memorabilia the cutting edge of chic, something that owners of secondhand-goods stores think only redounds to their own good.
"EBay and everything on the Internet has helped our industry," said Alexandra Carroll, the departing president of the National Association of Resale and Thrift shops. "It keeps us on the mind of our customers. The Internet has been a boon."

HEADLINE: Level of Consumer Confidence Is a Bit Weaker This Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence weakened in April for the third consecutive month, suggesting there could be some slowing of the spending that has fueled the nation's growth.
But Americans' expectations about future business and job opportunities remained strong, and economists said they expected this would cause the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee to raise interest rates the sixth time since June 1999 when it meets on May 16. 
 The Conference Board, a private research group, reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index dipped to 136.9 in April from a revised 137.1 the month before. That was down sharply from the record 144.7 registered in January and was the lowest since October.
Still, the reading was stronger than Wall Street analysts had expected becuase of the recent instability in the stock market.
In a separate sign of economic strength, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose 1.5 percent in March, the second consecutive monthly gain despite rising mortgage rates.
Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center, said market volatility "clearly had little, if any, impact on consumer confidence."
While consumers rate current economic conditions less positively than they did last month, their outlook for the next six months had improved, she said. "The boost in optimism, coupled with tax refunds, should continue to fuel spending," she said.
The consumer confidence figures, based on a survey of 5,000 United States households, provide clues on consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy. The index compares results with its base year, 1985, when it stood at 100.
The economy's strength has prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for fear that too-rapid growth could cause inflation.
Economists said that both reports supported expectations that Fed policy makers would raise rates again when they meet next month. But the slight cooling of confidence has reduced fears the Fed will be more aggressive by raising rates a half- point instead of a quarter-point.
The latest report indicated that the Conference Board index measuring consumers' expectations for the next six months rose to 108.2 in April from 106.8 the month before. An increased number of those surveyed predicted better business conditions and stronger job opportunities.

HEADLINE: Nobel Economists Back China's Joining Global Trade Group

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
A group of 13 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter today that backs China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. But the letter, released in a ceremony with top Clinton administration officials, was at least as notable for what it left out.
The four-paragraph letter, endorsed by 149 economists including the Nobel laureates, makes no mention of what the White House has called its top remaining legislative and foreign policy priority: persuading Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relations. The omission was conspicuous. As the administration has stressed many times, Congress has no say in whether China joins the trade body. Congress votes only on whether to elevate the trade ties, a step that is necessary if American companies are to benefit fully from China's membership in the W.T.O. 
 Clinton administration officials said the letter did not mention the vote because the administration sought to attract support from a broad array of economists. Some economists might not have agreed to sign the letter if it explicitly mentioned a political issue before Congress, the officials acknowledged. The officials said that they thought most of the economists who signed the letter personally support permanent normal trade relations, but that some do not and that others felt uncomfortable taking a political stand.
Qualms about delving into politics did not stop 200 corporate chief executives from endorsing permanent normal trade relations in a letter released earlier this month. And a group of former Treasury and State Department secretaries spanning five administrations explicitly backed the Clinton administration's position on the vote this month. So did 47 governors in a letter released in late March.
The White House released the economists' letter in high-profile fashion, kicking off the final month of an intense effort to persuade wavering lawmakers in the House to back permanent trade ties. The vote is expected in late May and the tally in the House is considered too close to call.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers; Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council; and Martin N. Baily, chairman of the council of economic advisers, were on hand to present the letter to reporters. Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also came to Washington to speak in support.
"It's a once-in-a-generation event that Bob Solow and Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson and Merton Miller are signing a letter on the same side of a major public policy issue," Mr. Summers said. He was referring to four of the Nobel-winning economists who signed the letter but have often taken opposing positions on other economic issues.
The lack of a clear stand on the issue before Congress also comes at a time when the administration is under scrutiny for its lobbying efforts on behalf of increased trade with China. A complaint from Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican who opposes making China's trade status permanent, prompted the General Accounting Office to open an investigation this month into whether the administration violated legal restrictions on lobbying Congress when it set up a White House "war room" to coordinate the campaign. That investigation is continuing.
When first asked why the economists' letter made no mention of permanent normal trade relations, Mr. Sperling said the administration had to abide by legal restrictions on what it could urge outsiders to say on a matter before Congress. But Mr. Sperling and other officials later said that explanation was incorrect.
They said that there were no legal restrictions at issue in choosing whether to mention the Congressional vote in the letter, and that it was drafted well before the G.A.O. began its investigation. The letter did not mention permanent normal trade relations because the administration was seeking support from a wide spectrum of economists on the left and right, some of whom might not want to weigh in publicly on a Clinton administration legislative priority, they said.
"The economists all believe that it's important to have open trade," said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying campaign on the China vote. "But they want to stay out of the political fight."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
BroadRally Lifts Nasdaq To 6.6% Gain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices staged a broad rally yesterday, with the Nasdaq composite index recording its third-biggest percentage gain.
The increase continues the wild gyrations in prices that have occurred during April, and it came just a day after the technology-heavy Nasdaq index was battered on worries about Microsoft, the industry's bellwether company. 
 Three of the 10 biggest daily percentage gains in Nasdaq history have occurred this month, but so have four of its largest declines.
"This is kind of manic behavior," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "I think it will be a feature of the market for some time to come. Institutions are struggling to determine what sort of valuation metrics they are going to use on technology stocks."
The Nasdaq opened the session strong and moved higher as the day progressed. At the close, the index was up 228.75 points, or 6.6 percent, to 3,711.23. The strength was extremely broad-based; 96 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index rose.
Other market indexes posted big gains, although not as large as Nasdaq's. Led by technology stalwarts like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M., the Dow Jones industrial average gained 218.72 points, or 2 percent, to 11,124.82. It was the first time the Dow had closed above 11,000 since April 12.
The stocks comprising the Standard & Poor's 500 index had an extremely good day: the index rose 47.58 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,477.44. Of the stocks in the index, 415 rose in price, while 74 declined.
And the small stocks that make up the Russell 2000 index rallied. The index gained 20.49 points, or 4.4 percent, to 489.03.
Traders and analysts were at a loss to identify the catalyst for yesterday's rally. It is especially curious since financial markets will be asked tomorrow to digest important information on inflation and the economy. Traders and investors normally become cautious in advance of such reports.
Moreover, the strong performance in stocks came on a day when market interest rates rose sharply.
"Could this be another bear trap or sucker rally?" asked Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. "There is a possibility for that. But I think we can carry through a little bit more because no one expects it."
Tomorrow, the government is expected to release first-quarter employment cost and gross domestic product data, numbers that will carry weight at the Federal Reserve Board. Fed policy makers are widely expected to approve another increase in short-term interest rates next month.
Concerns about interest rates seemed far from the minds of most investors and traders yesterday, because buyers far outnumbered sellers.
On the New York Stock Exchange, roughly twice as many stocks rose in price as fell.
Stocks in the Dow average that shone were led by Intel, which climbed 8 7/8, to 125. Hewlett-Packard gained 7, to 139 5/16. I.B.M. was up 5 7/8, to 112 3/8. Microsoft rebounded from a sharp 15.6 percent sell-off on Monday to rise 2 3/4, to 69 3/8. And General Electric closed at 165 3/4, a new high, after rising 3 3/4.
Other big winners on the Nasdaq included Qualcomm, which rose 5 5/16, to 104 15/16; JDS Uniphase, which jumped 13, to 93 5/16; and Sun Microsystems, which closed at 93 3/4, up 6 1/8.
Procter & Gamble and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing were two high-profile stocks that lost ground. P.& G., which was battered last month after it issued a profit warning for the rest of its fiscal year, fell 6 3/16, to 64 5/16, after it released results for its third quarter.
3M fell 3 11/16, to 93 13/16, after it said profits for all of this year might fall short of Wall Street's rosiest estimates. The diversified manufacturer issued that warning as it topped earnings estimates for the first quarter.
"Every 48 hours more stocks are oversold than overbought," said Bill Schneider, head of equity block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "We are in a range-bound, 48-hour trading cycle. It must drive people to take a lot of Mylanta. But people are not as threatened by volatility as they used to be."

Bond Prices Are Down
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell on concern that reports later this week will show that the economy did not slow much and that inflation accelerated in the first quarter.
Bond investors are concerned that economic growth "is going to come in at a higher number than is sustainable," said Dave Weigert, who helps invest $25 billion in fixed income at Aeltus Investment Management in Hartford. He has put new capital in cash to reinvest as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. "Those numbers will clarify in people's minds that the Fed does need to move at least two more times and maybe three" this year, after five rate increases since June, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 28/32, to 104 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.93 percent from 5.87 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Management Tells Workers There Will Be No Breakup

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
As some industry executives declared that a government move to break up Microsoft could inject new competition into the software business, Microsoft's top management confidently assured its 34,000 employees yesterday that there was no chance the company would be split up.
And to further calm any anxious workers, Microsoft told them they would all receive new stock options to shield them financially from the recent slide in the company's stock price. 
 The assurances followed reports that the government would ask the federal judge presiding over the antitrust case against Microsoft to break the company in two. In Washington yesterday, the leaders of the Justice Department's antitrust division were summoned to the White House, where they gave President Clinton's economic advisers a detailed briefing on the case and their remedy proposal, which is to be submitted by Friday.
In the face of the government's apparent hard line, Microsoft's leaders were defiant. In a lengthy e-mail message yesterday morning to Microsoft employees titled "Bullish About the Future," Steven Ballmer, the president and chief executive, expressed unabashed enthusiasm for his company's business prospects.
"This company, which has done so many great things for consumers and for the American economy over the last 25 years, will not be broken up," Mr. Ballmer said. "No matter what the newspaper headlines say, absolutely nothing in the current case justifies breaking us up."
William H. Gates, the chairman, went even further in defending Microsoft's conduct, which Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled earlier this month was "predatory" and illegal. In an interview on the public television program "Nightly Business Report," Mr. Gates said, "It's important to understand that Microsoft is very clear that it has done absolutely nothing wrong."
The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft contend that the strength of their case and the unbending stand of Microsoft's management require strong remedies. The Justice Department's proposal, according to people close to the situation, calls for Microsoft to be split into two companies -- one with its operating-system business and one with its Office software and most other operations. It also calls for restraints on Microsoft business practices.
Under the government plan, each of the two companies would have an effective monopoly. Windows holds nearly 85 percent of the market for PC operating systems, and its Office programs, like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations, command more than 90 percent of their markets. But the government believes that creating separate companies would foster increased competition in the industry.
"That remedy would represent a big change in the software landscape," said Larry Augustin, president and chief executive of VA Linux Systems.
His company sells computer work- stations and data-serving computers that run on Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix operating system. Linux has gained ground as a robust operating system mainly used on so-called servers -- the hub machines in computer networks that send Web pages or other data to users' desktop machines. But most people use Microsoft's Office programs on their desktop machines, and Microsoft does not make a version of Office that runs on Linux, a rival to Windows.
As a separate company, the Office business, Mr. Augustin said, would have a powerful economic incentive to make its Office programs run smoothly on Linux. "Office on Linux would make Linux a very viable desktop operating system -- a real desktop alternative to Windows," he said.
Bob Young, chairman of Red Hat, a Linux company, agreed that the government's plan would orobably accelerate the advance of Linux. "There is no question that Microsoft's monopoly inhibits the ability to compete in parts of the market -- specifically on the desktop," he said.
Venture capitalists, who finance new companies, were guardedly optimistic that the government's plan, if approved by the court, might foster somewhat more competition. "If this happens, the effect would probably be to increase competitive product offerings -- and that's no small thing," said Richard Kramlich, general partner at New Enterprise Associates, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
Like many Silicon Valley executives, Mike Homer, an investor in start-ups who was formerly an executive vice president at Netscape Communications, the Internet pioneer whose upstart challenge to Microsoft was the focus of the antitrust case, said that much would depend on precisely how the government plan was carried out and enforced.
"It would probably make the world safer for some software companies," Mr. Homer said. "But the devil is in the details in all the conduct remedies."
Gordon E. Eubanks Jr., a veteran software industry executive who testified on Microsoft's behalf at the antitrust trial, said he did not think the industry would suffer from the remedy proposed by the government. The government, he noted, stopped short of the most sweeping remedy proposal that had been discussed in recent months of creating perhaps three competing Windows companies. As long as that step was not taken, he said, the industry would not be threatened by what he called a destructive fracturing of the Windows technology standard.
"And potentially, you could get more competition in desktop applications software with this approach," he said.
He said the government seemed to be focusing on the desktop software market, where Microsoft has already won. But the big future growth, he added, is not in PC software but in so-called post-PC computing on the Internet, where the new access devices will increasingly be television set-top boxes, hand-held computers and "smart" cell phones.
"The irony of this is that Microsoft has never been weaker in recent years," Mr. Eubanks said. "The future is Web-based computing, and that is not where Microsoft's core competence is."
Indeed, Wall Street's concerns that PC growth is slowing and that Microsoft is not making the transition to the post-PC era of computing fast enough have been perhaps the main reason -- more than the breakup proposal -- that the company's shares dropped so much on Monday.
Following Microsoft's report of disappointing revenue growth after the stock markets closed last week, several Wall Street analysts issued warnings early Monday.
To bolster the morale of its workers, Microsoft yesterday issued new stock options to all its employees priced at Monday's closing price, $66.625, compared with a recent high of just under $120 a share last Dec. 30. The one-time additional stock grant for workers, Mr. Ballmer told employees, will equal the size of the options each had received since last July. (Unlike most corporate executives, Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates, both multibillionaires because of their Microsoft holdings, do not receive stock options.)
"I think the grants since July will have value long run," Mr. Ballmer wrote, "but I want to pre-empt undue concerns by awarding these new grants that will let people see returns much sooner." Microsoft's stock rebounded slightly yesterday, closing at $69.375.
As Mr. Ballmer was reassuring his troops, officials, including the Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, were conferring at the White House on the Justice Department's approach to the antitrust case and its potential economic impact.
President Clinton did not attend the briefing, and the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr. Clinton "properly believes this should be handled at Justice." Another White House spokesman said the meeting lasted one hour and 40 minutes, and the White House team asked only "clarifying questions."
Another official said the White House advisers did not try to change the Justice Department's strategy.
Beyond that, officials from both the White House and the Justice Department said little and did so with carefully chosen language. Mr. Summers appeared ill at ease at a news conference as he explained the reasoning for the afternoon meeting.
"What is being discussed is an economic issue," he said, "and I think there's a feeling that it's appropriate to have a briefing on issues that clearly have important economic ramifications," namely the proposed breakup of Microsoft, one of the nation's most important companies with $23 billion in revenue last year.
Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser, said the White House had received a similar briefing at the start of the government's case against Microsoft and believed another one was appropriate now, near the end. But he, too, said the meeting was simply "an informational briefing."

HEADLINE: Negotiators Report Progress Over Strike by Nyack Nurses

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NYACK, N.Y., April 25

 BODY:
Officials representing both Nyack Hospital and nurses on strike said today that they were moving closer to a settlement of the four-month-long walkout. After the announcement, the nurses canceled a protest rally that they had planned for tonight.
Neither side would say what had led to the breakthrough in the talks. Negotiators for the hospital in Rockland County and for the nurses' union met for 20 straight hours before stopping for a break around noon today. Talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday at 3 p.m. 
 "We are very optimistic and continue to be so, but we don't want to say anything that could jeopardize the negotiations," said Nancy Kriz, a spokeswoman for Nyack Hospital.
On Monday, the deadline that the hospital had set for the nurses to return or face permanent replacement, the talks had seemed hopelessly deadlocked. Only four nurses went back to work, and two nurses quit, said Mark A. Genovese, a spokesman for the New York State Nurses Association, the union that represents 33,000 nurses statewide.
"We stuck together," said Eileen Duffany, a surgical intensive care unit nurse who spent several hours today picketing in front of the red-brick hospital. "I've been here for 20 years now, and I'm not going to let them take it from me. We want to go back, but we want to go back with a good contract."
The hospital has begun the process of recruiting nurses to replace those on strike, but no nurses have been fired, Ms. Kriz said. Even if replacements are found for each position, the striking nurses will be placed on a waiting list to get their jobs back once the strike is over, Ms. Kriz said.
On Dec. 21, all but 26 of the 450 nurses at the small community hospital went on strike over staffing, proposed changes in sick time and the hospital's effort to switch to a merit pay system. Since then, about 30 nurses have resigned, while others have taken temporary jobs at other local hospitals or agencies or gone on unemployment.
This is the third strike since 1993 for Nyack Hospital's nurses, Mr. Genovese said. In 1993 they went on strike for six and a half hours after contract negotiations took longer than expected. In 1995, they struck for 26 days after the hospital sought to replace 12-hour shifts with 8-hour shifts. Ultimately, some departments' shifts were shortened while others remained 12 hours.
Throughout the current strike, the nurses' union has contended that nurses are responsible for too many patients at once and have to work so much overtime that the quality of care is in jeopardy. The hospital says that staffing is adequate and that nurses were required to work overtime on only 44 shifts out of 85,000 in all of 1999.
Since the strike began, Nyack Hospital has used temporary nurses provided by an agency in Colorado.
"We have had no curtailment of any services or any facet of the operation," Ms. Kriz said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Gains in European Stocks Being Swept Away by the Sinking Euro

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Americans who have invested in European stock markets this year have been dealt a cruel blow by the euro, which seems to be on a relentless decline.
On the surface, the market news from across the Atlantic is good. While the major American equity indexes are down or flat for the year, some prominent European stock indexes have posted gains. Germany's benchmark DAX index has climbed 4.63 percent in local-currency terms, France's CAC has risen 6.08 percent, and a key Italian gauge is up 6.42 percent. 
 But the euro, the single currency introduced last year for 11 European nations, plunged more than 2 percent yesterday, bringing its decline for the year to 8.5 percent and souring those stock returns for Americans. When the European gains are translated into dollars, the DAX is down 4.24 percent, the CAC is off 2.92 percent and the Italian index is 2.61 percent lower.
The story is not a new one. A 13.8 percent decline in the exchange value of the euro in 1999 ate into European equity returns. But European stocks rose so sharply at the end of last year that American investors still came out well ahead. For example, a 39.1 percent surge in the DAX was tempered to a 20.3 percent rise in dollar terms. The 51.1 percent moonshot by the French index in euros became 30.7 percent in dollars. And in Italy, the 22.3 percent rise in euro terms was translated into a 5.7 percent gain.
But the euro's drop yesterday raised questions again about how low the currency can go. It settled in New York at 92.08 American cents, down from 93.98 cents on Monday and $1.0062 at the end of 1999. The average value this year is now 98 cents -- below the psychologically important level of $1, or parity.
Admittedly, the euro's decline this year is a little less than the 9.2 percent fall in the comparable period in 1999. And investors have said that the further the euro falls, the more likely it is to have a good rally -- eventually. But that hope has been dashed before. And those are pretty weak positives for a currency that was once seen as a challenger to the dollar.
With yesterday's decline, investors were reminded that the factors that have been conspiring against the euro are not going away soon. One is the strength of the American economy, which is proving more attractive to investors than are conditions in Europe.
A report released yesterday by the Conference Board showed that Americans' expectations for the next six months were better than expected, and it pointed to continued strong consumer spending. The report also indicated that this month's stock market gyrations, most notably the Nasdaq composite's 25 percent plunge in one week, had not dampened consumers' spirits.
Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at Fleet Global Markets in Boston, said that before yesterday "people still had hope that confidence in the United States would come off some with the volatility in the American stock market."
"You would have thought," he said, "that the euro would have done well, given the plunge in the Nasdaq and the volatility in the U.S. market."
The stock volatility does not appear to be driving away European investors. Since the Nasdaq reached its closing high on March 10, it has fallen 26.5 percent, with 15 days of moves of at least 3 percent up or down. Some might have pulled their money out of stocks and returned to the euro, driving the currency higher. But over the same period, the euro's value has lost 4.5 percent.
If European investors held on to American blue chips, they have profited. When the United States stock performance is translated into euros, the Nasdaq index is flat for the year while the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks are up 9.9 percent and the Dow Jones industrials, up 5.7 percent.
"If the stock market and the economy are not going to slide, the dollar, and American interest rates, are going to continue to climb," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. The dollar, he said, has rallied against the Japanese yen in the last few days and American interest rates have shot higher in the last two weeks.
Despite the euro's accelerating decline, Mr. Fand considers it unlikely that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates to support the currency when officials meet tomorrow. Reports from Germany yesterday showed that inflation had eased, he said, so any rate increase would look like an attempt to defend the euro and invite speculative selling to test the central bank's resolve.

HEADLINE: Once Scorned, Far West 42nd St. Is Now Much in Demand

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Jules Demchick, the developer, is doing what even a few years ago would have been unthinkable: building a 17-story corporate office tower in a neighborhood of low-slung warehouses, lumberyards, parking lots and a horse stable on the far west end of 42nd Street, near the Hudson River.
For 50 years, developers have scorned the four long blocks of 42nd Street west of Eighth Avenue, which have everything from a bus terminal to a few lonely apartment towers. But now, with the resurgence of Times Square and the demand for office space and housing at a peak, an area long derided as scruffy may be entering a taller, more-affluent phase. 
 Mr. Demchick, president of the J. D. Carlyle Development Corporation, is beginning to demolish a single-story brick building on the north side of 42nd Street, just east of 12th Avenue, and an adjacent stable that is home to the Police Department's mounted patrol. He plans to erect a 565,000-square-foot office building on the site that he believes will attract some of the media companies, accounting firms and other businesses looking for offices around Times Square.
His project sits across the street from where the developer Larry Silverstein is building a 40-story brick-and-glass complex with 921 rental apartments. And there are a half-dozen other residential or commercial projects planned along 42nd Street at every intersection from 12th to Eighth Avenues.
Behind the shift is the rapid expansion in recent years of Wall Street, communications and dot-com technology firms, all of which have gobbled up much of the available office space in Midtown and have pushed into more industrial areas like the garment district and the far West Side of Manhattan. As a result, the Midtown vacancy rate has dropped below 6 percent and developers are building where no corporate tenants could be found a few years ago. That trend, developers say, is also increasing demand for housing nearby.
"For decades, developers and city planners have struggled to extend the boundaries of development from east to west along 42nd Street," said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who is a former city economic development official. "The biggest hurdle was crossing Sixth Avenue. Despite the naysayers and false starts, it finally appears that the two-mile stretch from river to river will be anchored at both ends."
Mr. Demchick, whose company owns 3.5 million square feet of office and retail properties, as well as 5,000 apartments, bought the property on 42nd Street nearly two years ago and, until two weeks ago, had planned to build a 49-story, glass-walled condominium.
But Mr. Demchick's company is used to holding on to property, not selling it. After talking with Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairwoman of Insignia/ESG, a commercial broker, Mr. Demchick said he became convinced that Carlyle could quickly build an office tower on the same site with the large floors and fiber-optic lines that would attract the corporate tenants that can no longer find adequate space in Midtown. While average rents have crept above $50 a square foot a year, he said that he could offer space in a new building for $45.
"I'd like to say that we're smart, but it's really market driven," said Mr. Demchick, whose partner in the project is the Feinberg real estate family. "I don't want to be out there selling apples when people are buying pears."
The demand for office space is so strong today that Mr. Silverstein is also considering building an office tower on his site between 11th and 12th Avenues, instead of a second 40-story apartment house.
At the southwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, the Ruben real estate family and Vornado Realty Trust plan to build a million-square-foot tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal, although the project has been hampered by disputes within the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Across the street, the owners of a parking lot are selling the parcel for what will probably be another million-square-foot office tower.
Those office projects, coupled with the Reuters, Ernst & Young and Conde Nast towers in Times Square, have prompted other developers to plan for new apartment towers on the once-undesirable western end of 42nd Street. Even in the best of times, the neon lights of Times Square rarely illuminated the factories, freight yards, warehouses, stockyards and tenements on 42nd Street.
In the 1950's, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the West Side Airlines Terminal were built west of Eighth Avenue. Still, in 1962, the editors of The New Yorker described the new Sheraton Motor Inn at the northeast corner of 12th Avenue and 42nd Street as "a startlingly classy pioneer in a somewhat declasse neighborhood." The hotel, which is now a consulate for the People's Republic of China, sits next to Mr. Demchick's site.
More than 25 years later, the handful of apartment towers built in the neighborhood during the 1980's real estate boom were left gasping for tenants when a recession hit.
This time it is going to be different, developers say. The boom in office construction in Times Square is feeding a demand for housing.
Harold Fetner, president of Sidney Fetner Associates, is planning to build a tower with 264 apartments at the southwest corner of 42nd Street and 10th Avenue. The developer Daniel Brodsky expects to begin construction in June of a 40-story apartment building, with 264 apartments over five theaters at 42nd Street and Dyer Avenue, the thoroughfare between 9th and 10th Avenues. And Douglas Durst is planning yet another apartment building at the northeast corner of Ninth Avenue and 42nd Street.
"We're filling in the blocks," said Kenneth M. Miller, vice president of the Gotham Organization, which two years ago opened the New Gotham, a luxury apartment house with 374 apartments between 10th and 11th Avenues, and 42nd and 43rd Streets. "It's becoming more mainstream, instead of out on the edge. Slowly but surely, the West Side will be anchored by a significant residential community."

HEADLINE: A Bug That Can Fell a Horse;
Fighting Mosquitoes' Threat to Thoroughbreds

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
In the feverish world of horse racing and breeding, mosquito season is about as welcome as a hurricane at the Preakness.
Especially this spring, given the prospect of a repeat of the West Nile virus -- which killed seven people and nine horses in New York last year, including a retired racehorse who was to breed thoroughbreds. The possibility that the mosquito-borne illness could destroy a multimillion-dollar celebrity like Fusaichi Pegasus, the Kentucky Derby favorite who spent four days training at Aqueduct before winning the Wood Memorial there on April 15, has track officials more hyper than in-bred thoroughbreds. 
 So, these days, there are some rather strange goings-on at Aqueduct and Belmont Park, both near the epicenter of the outbreak in northern Queens and both part of an industry that contributes more than $1 billion annually to New York State's economy.
Take the chickens at Belmont, the nation's largest track, on the Queens-Nassau border. Once welcome to spend all their days scuttling around the stables and barns there, they now have a $5 bounty on their heads and are being rounded up by the hundreds.
Horsemen brought chickens to Belmont soon after the gates opened in 1905 to calm the high-strung thoroughbreds by lending a barnyard feel to the stables. But erstwhile friends, the fowl, now known to help spread West Nile, are being trapped in padlocked coops and tested for the virus. So far, almost 500 have been shipped to a farmer upstate, racing officials said.
While kicking out the chickens, Belmont officials are bringing in fish. After investigating the behavior of various species to find some that eat mosquito larvae, racing officials last week dumped 4,000 goldfish and catfish into the two lakes in the main track's infield, and into a duck pond near the grandstand.
Then there was the pesticide deal with the Native American chief. Racing officials spent $10,000 on a latex chemical called Ultracide produced by the man's company, Native American Enviro-Tech. They were told it would kill the bugs but not harm the horses. But the state has blocked the use of Ultracide because it is not registered in New York.
The obsession with mosquito control at the two tracks is no surprise, given the routine frenzy surrounding the health of horses. In addition to the nine horse deaths, on a cluster of farms near Riverhead on Long Island, the virus infected 16 other horses, including 2 thoroughbreds that were racing at Belmont and another horse that raced at Yonkers.
At the track, a cough or a sneeze is cause for alarm; wobbling, twitching and circling, symptoms of West Nile infections in horses, sends veterinarians and trainers into red alert.
"The stars of this sport are the horses," said Francis J. La Belle Jr., a spokesman for the New York Racing Association, which owns and operates New York's three largest tracks, at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga. "We go nowhere without them."
Horses, like humans, can recover from West Nile, which can be deadly if it leads to encephalitis, swelling of the brain. Infections can range from what looks like a minor flu to serious neurological illnesses; but three racehorses that were infected with the virus last year recovered, and, so far, two have gone on to race, according to the veterinarians who treated them. (Some horse owners take out health insurance that could cover illness or death from West Nile, but others do not, experts said.)
Officials at both Queens racetracks are also dropping doughnut-shaped "mosquito dunks" made of larvicide, which kills the eggs, into other bodies of standing water that are mosquito breeding grounds. They are also setting up mechanical mosquito traps across the 430-acre Belmont property, and the Nassau County Health Department plans to set up a mosquito-trapping station there to catch the bugs and test them for West Nile, officials said.
Amid all this, it is still unclear whether West Nile will reappear in the New York City area or spread to Long Island again. Recent tests on hibernating mosquitoes in Fort Totten, Queens, near the epicenter of the 1999 outbreak that infected 69 people, confirmed that the virus was still alive there. And In Westchester, a dead bird tested positive last month for the virus, raising fears that West Nile will reemerge this summer.
"You wouldn't even want to think about it," said John Dowd, a trainer, who was working with 10 horses at Aqueduct before the races there last Thursday. Among Mr. Dowd's charges that day were some racehorses, like Wires Crossed and Critical Thinker, worth up to $10 million.
Farm managers, particularly those on the East End of Long Island, where the virus struck last year, and other horse breeders said they were taking precautions similar to those at the racetracks, including using the mosquito dunks in standing water. Several said they were planning to stable their horses at night, spray them with pesticides and keep them in barns at dusk and dawn, peak mosquito hours. A few breeders said they were considering stabling their horses in upstate New York or in other states.
Jeff Raine, who manages the Big E farm in Jamesport, N.Y., where two horses, including a thoroughbred brood mare, succumbed to West Nile last year, said he was doing everything he could to prepare for mosquito season. The 120-acre breeding farm is owned by Robert Entenmann of the baked goods company, and is home to 15 horses that serve as Mr. Entenmann's private breeding and racing stock.
"I've had nightmares about it recurring," said Mr. Raine, who had to put to sleep the brood mare, Terroir, a retired racehorse who ran at Aqueduct and Belmont a year before she was sent to the Jamesport farm to breed. "We're very concerned about what's going to happen this year."
Terroir's illness was the first confirmed case of equine West Nile in last year's outbreak, said Dr. John Andresen, the veterinarian who treated her and diagnosed her as having the virus. Government scientists are using genetic material from Terroir for research on a possible vaccine, he said.
At Belmont and elsewhere, state officials are testing the blood of chickens, which carry the virus but do not get sick from it, for signs of West Nile. Chickens can spread the virus to horses if mosquitoes bite infected chickens and then bite horses. But horses, "dead-end hosts," cannot spread the disease to other horses or species, experts said.
A group of chicks from Belmont who were tested recently showed no sign of exposure to the virus, said Dr. Neil Cleary, a veterinarian with the racing association who treated one of the two Belmont racehorses who was infected with West Nile but recovered.
State agriculture officials said that since the outbreak, they have conducted blood tests on horses in the Riverhead area and across Long Island to determine how many were exposed to the disease, possibly making them immune. Results released so far showed that of 69 horses tested in the Riverhead area, 20 were exposed to the disease but did not get sick. The incubation period is up to seven days, so those horses would not be at risk for infection, veterinarians said.
It is still not known why the virus struck that cluster of Long Island farms, 60 miles from the Queens epicenter of the outbreak. But several experts said they suspected West Nile was carried to Riverhead, on the tip of the island, by birds.
Dr. Andresen and other veterinarians who have studied the virus since last year's outbreak, the first time West Nile was detected in the Western Hemisphere, said the newness of the disease here made it difficult to understand the risks and to calm nervous breeders and horse owners.
"It leaves the vets in a quandary," said Dr. Howard Flynn, president of the Long Island Veterinary Medical Association, who runs a clinic in Medford, N.Y. . "This is brand-spanking new around here, and that's part of the problem."
Only one other documented outbreak of the virus caused as many deaths among horses as the Long Island one, a 1996 outbreak in Morocco. It killed 42 of 94 horses confirmed to be infected, said Dr. Peter Timoney, director of the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. A smaller outbreak occurred in Tuscany, Italy, in 1998, Dr. Timoney said.
Dr. Timoney and other veterinarians said that only a few outbreaks of West Nile had occurred among horses since the virus was first detected, in Uganda in 1937. But they said they were concerned about the high mortality rate among infected horses. Almost half the horses with confirmed cases -- 9 of 25 -- either died or were so sick they had to be put to sleep, a mortality rate far higher than the 4 or 5 percent rate for humans.
"Statistically we haven't seen a major occurrence of this disease in horses," Dr. Timoney said. "Still, think about the stakes: these Kentucky Derby hopefuls. If that one animal becomes seriously infected and dies, that's one hell of an economic loss."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Third Force In Race For Senate

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
JOHN CLIFTON faces certain obstacles in getting elected to the Senate, like persuading his mother to vote for him. But there may be no other candidate who can simultaneously appeal to such disparate blocs of voters.
Mr. Clifton is a Navy veteran who wants to slash the Pentagon's budget. He is an African-American who opposes government-mandated affirmative action, and a social worker in Bedford-Stuyvesant who wants to reduce government spending on social services. He is an advocate of drug legalization whose job involves helping drug addicts kick their habits. He is a beneficiary of the welfare system -- his mother received checks while she raised him -- who would like to dismantle it. He supports conservative gun owners upstate and sympathizes with liberal critics of police brutality downstate. 
 As Mr. Clifton puts it in his campaign literature: 'I am running against the Nanny State and the Police State, Hillary's Big Sister and Rudy's Big Brother philosophy and policies."
It would be hard to find a more determined contrarian in the state, but there are limits even to Mr. Clifton's contrariness. He does not challenge the conventional wisdom (shared by his mother) that his party affiliation makes him an underdog.
Mr. Clifton, the treasurer of the state Libertarian Party, is seeking the Senate nomination at his party's convention in Yonkers on Saturday. Victory would not guarantee much in November -- the Libertarian candidate for Senate last year received barely 8,000 votes. Mr. Clifton's supporters in the party hope that he'll do better, if only because his unusual background will attract attention. New York City has rarely been fertile soil for libertarian politicians.
Mr. Clifton, 41, grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood in Jamaica, Queens, and studied at the Parsons School of Design and the New School for Social Research. Then he served in the Navy as a technician on ballistic-missile submarines, and returned to New York to do social work with the homeless and the mentally ill.
He is now a case manager for a nonprofit group, Services for the Underserved, working with mentally ill patients in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The group is financed in part by city, state and federal government agencies -- precisely the sort of financing that Mr. Clifton would like to reduce.
"I'm in favor of social services," he said. "There are people who need therapy and other help. But I'd like to see programs like ours supported in the main by private donors. I'd rather see a system of voluntary cooperation instead of the compulsion we have now."
How does that idea appeal to his bosses? "I've discussed it with them," he said. "I've suggested that we might be better off privatizing so that we didn't have to beg each year from politicians. But the argument has more or less fallen on deaf ears."
Mr. Clifton would also like to dismantle the public welfare system. "The fact that my family benefited from it doesn't make it right or necessary," Mr. Clifton said. "It's legalized theft from taxpayers." He said that his mother could have relied instead on private charity, and that it was a mistake for black politicians to fight for expanded welfare benefits.
"African-Americans are suffering from a modern version of the 19th century plantation syndrome," he said. "Just as slaves stayed on the plantation even after they were freed, African-Americans have become dependent on the welfare state and the Democratic Party and are afraid to try alternatives. They've concentrated on seeking political empowerment instead of economic and cultural empowerment, as other ethnic groups have done."
That view is not shared by his mother, Maggie Clifton, who still lives in Jamaica, Queens, not far from Mr. Clifton's home in Rochdale Village. "I know welfare's not a good thing," she said, "but I don't know what I would have done without it. There was no husband to help me with three children. I could have gotten a job, but I thought it was better to stay home for the children. I can't understand why John says poor people don't need the government."
Mrs. Clifton said she was hesitant to vote for her son (she's leaning toward Hillary Clinton), but not because of his policies. "I'd vote for him if I thought he could win," she said, "but I'm afraid it would be a wasted vote."
Mr. Clifton hasn't given up on her. "What I'll do," he said, "is keep telling her, 'Mom, a vote for the Bill of Rights is never a wasted vote.' "

Renault to Sell Truck Unit To Volvo and Focus on Cars
Volvo is acquiring the truck unit of the French automaker Renault in a $1.5 billion deal that will create the world's second-largest maker of trucks and buses behind DaimlerChrysler.
The agreement, which came the same day that banks in South Korea agreed to sell the bankrupt Samsung Motor to Renault, signals Renault's intention to shift its focus away from trucks and commercial vehicles and to concentrate on the automobile business. Page C4. 

Competing Bid Made for Champion
International Paper offered to buy Champion International for a combination of cash and stock worth $6.2 billion, or $64 a share, just two months after Champion agreed to a lower bid from the Finnish paper giant UPM-Kymmene. Stockholders clearly expect a bidding war. Shares of Champion surged $12.8125, to $64.25, while International Paper fell $2.75, to $37.25. Analysts say the company's assets alone are worth more than $70 a share. C2.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Says Top Goal Is Steady Reduction of Nation's Debt

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Laying out his economic vision more fully than ever, Vice President Al Gore offered himself yesterday as a fiscal conservative and steward of the Clinton administration's economic formula and prosperity.
His primary goal, he said, was to reduce the national debt year by year -- barring an emergency -- and to set it on a course for complete elimination by the year 2013. 
 He pledged to use the Social Security surplus and savings in debt payments to shore up the retirement program. He also promoted tax cuts to help parents save for college tuition, job retraining, health insurance and long-term care and, for businesses, research and development. The total cost of the tax cuts over 10 years, aides estimated, was $250 billion to $300 billion.
His purpose, Mr. Gore said, was not only to maintain the nation's prosperity, but also to maintain consumer confidence in the economy.
"Moving purposefully to a debt-free America will be one of the best ways to sustain and increase the confidence that is the foundation of our present and future prosperity," he told more than 1,000 business, labor and civic leaders who are members of the Association for a Better New York, at the Hilton New York in Manhattan yesterday morning.
"We have to make America debt-free before the baby boomers retire, so we can pay our obligations to them in the form of Social Security and Medicare," he said, crystallizing a central tenet of his candidacy.
And though John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was in the audience, Mr. Gore pledged an "aggressive" fight to open new markets, like China, to promote free trade.
With Mr. Sweeney sitting near him, Mr. Gore acknowledged that his views on China trade diverged with those of "many of my supporters."
Mr. Sweeney, who was briefed on Mr. Gore's remarks before they were delivered, said unions would continue to back Mr. Gore despite differences on trade.
"Trade is the most significant area of disagreement," Mr. Sweeney said after the speech. "But this was just one piece of a comprehensive economic policy, 90 percent of which we would solidly support."
Mr. Gore sounded familiar themes of the Clinton formula. But he made his first extended remarks tying his presumptive Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, with Mr. Bush's father, President George Bush, and painting both with the same brush of fiscal irresponsibility.
"We fell prey to the politics of illusion during the decade of amazing deficits," Mr. Gore said, referring to the Reagan and Bush administrations. "Now we have to avoid the politics of illusion in the decade of amazing surpluses."
"This is a test of our memory," he said. "Have we forgotten the dangers of irresponsibility? Have we forgotten the virtues of responsibility?"
Mr. Gore developed his economic strategy with President Clinton's top economic advisers -- Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Secretary; Robert Rubin, the former Secretary; and Gene Sperling, chief of Mr. Clinton's economic council. As a result, the Gore vision mirrors the Clinton approach of the last seven years, a period that extended a slow recovery into the longest economic expansion in the nation's history.
"If we stick with a disciplined fiscal policy and if we earn and maintain confidence through our decision-making," Mr. Gore said, "then low interest rates and capital costs will do more to promote growth and create jobs than deficit spending could ever achieve. This is the new understanding of our economic reality that has been patiently built up over these last seven years."
At the same time, Mr. Gore declared Mr. Bush would shatter that confidence and said that the governor's tax-cut plan was "politically driven," overly generous to the wealthy and would drive the nation into inflation and recession.
In criticizing Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore invoked President Bush, saying that his tenure was marked by "budget busting, runaway tax policy, runaway spending, without the responsibility to pay for it and without the basic respect for the American people to give even the barest indication of how the cost would be met."
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said that Mr. Gore's speech revealed just how mired he was in old-style partisan attack politics. Mr. Bush, he said, spent the day with Democrats, underscoring his bipartisan approach to problem-solving.
"Al Gore today exaggerated and distorted the governor's balanced-budget proposal," Mr. Fleischer said. "According to economic experts, Governor Bush's tax proposal will cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, $800 billion less than Gore claims. A new analysis of the Gore budget shows he has proposed $1.9 trillion in new spending on bigger government. Gore's spending plan is nearly 50 percent bigger than Bush's tax cut."
Mr. Gore said later that he was not attacking Mr. Bush as much as pointing out their differences, and that he would continue to do so. "Discussing the substance of the proposals made by him and made by me is a classic and healthy way to present the choice" that confronts the nation, Mr. Gore said in an interview with National Public Radio.
Mr. Gore's speech set the foundation for a series of addresses he intends to deliver in the next couple of weeks as he seeks to contrast his proposals with those of Mr. Bush.
It also represented a new beginning of sorts for Mr. Gore, who laid out most of his policy proposals during his primary contest against former Senator Bill Bradley.
By contrast, Mr. Bush has spent much of the last month offering fresh proposals daily, as Mr. Gore drew little attention, other than criticism over his call for a less active government role in the Elian Gonzalez case.
Yesterday, Mr. Gore came roaring back, not with any sharp departure from previous positions but with a comprehensive discussion of his view of the economy, the linchpin of all his other proposals.
He dismissed the governor's recent speeches, which have moved him toward the political center, as "his post-primary search for rehabilitation."
Concerning President Bush's economic policy, Mr. Gore could not have been more derisive.
"Confidence in America's economic policy-making was shattered," he said. "It lay in ruins. We had to get used to foreign leaders coming here and beginning their state visits with lectures on the fundamentals of economic policy and what a disaster America's economic policy was.
"We didn't get a dose of economic realism until August of 1993 when President Clinton and I fought for and won an economic plan built on the bedrock of fiscal responsibility."
Later, in the interview with National Public Radio, Mr. Gore was less quick to claim credit for the nation's soaring economy. "My task as I see it is not to try to get credit for what's happened but rather to present a vision for what will happen and what can happen if we keep our prosperity going," he said.
During his speech, Mr. Gore gave a strong endorsement of the bill for permanent normal trade relations with China, legislation that is headed for a showdown this spring.
"I will continue to do all I can to build support in Congress for it," Mr. Gore said. He has been reluctant to assert support for the agreement publicly because labor, which has endorsed him, so strongly opposes it.
"I understand their concerns," he said. "And I believe that trade must be a way to lift up living standards around the world, not drag standards down here at home."

HEADLINE: Administration Using Study To Push Elderly Drug Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Prices for the 50 drugs most frequently used by older Americans increased last year at nearly twice the rate of inflation, a study to be issued on Wednesday at the White House says.
The study found a similar trend over the last six years. 
 President Clinton planned to cite the data in arguing that drug costs constitute a growing burden for the elderly and that Congress should pass legislation to reduce the burden.
The Democratic leaders of Congress, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, intend to join Mr. Clinton at the White House. The three will press Republicans in Congress to reach a compromise and make drug coverage available to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.
The study of the top-selling drugs was done by Families USA, a consumer group, and by the Prime Institute at the University of Minnesota, which specializes in the economics of prescription drugs.
The institute is one of the nation's leading centers for research on pharmaceutical economics and has been tracking drug prices since it was established in 1991.
A White House official said the administration was giving its imprimatur to the study because "it's consistent with our findings."
But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group, took issue with the report, which she described as "a political study by Families USA."
Government statistics suggest that the wholesale prices of prescription drugs rose less than did the wholesale prices of most other finished goods in 1999, Ms. Cottrell said.
Representatives for several drug companies did not deny increasing their prices, but said their products still offered excellent value.
The study makes these points:
*Prices of the 50 top-selling drugs used by the elderly rose an average of 3.9 percent from January 1999 to January 2000, or nearly twice the overall rate of inflation in that period.
*Prices for 16 of the 50 drugs rose at least three times the rate of inflation.
*In the last six years, prices for the 50 drugs most often used by the elderly rose an average of 30.5 percent or double the inflation rate for that period.
Ronald F. Pollack, who is executive director of Families USA and a co-author of the study, said, "Increasing numbers of elderly Americans will find prescription drugs unaffordable unless they gain access to drug coverage through Medicare."
The study said that new drugs to treat conditions afflicting the elderly often cost more than the drugs they replace. While the new drugs may be more effective, they also increased the share of an elderly person's income devoted to buying drugs, the study said.
The report said the price of Synthroid, a synthetic thyroid hormone, rose four times as much as the Consumer Price Index last year, while the price of Premarin, an osteoporosis drug, increased five times as much as the index, and the price of Pravachol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, three times as much as the index.
Veronica M. Apostolico, a spokeswoman for the Knoll Pharmaceutical Company, which makes Synthroid, said: "This product represents an excellent value. It costs only 30 cents a day. It's the least expensive of the top 10 most frequently dispensed prescription drugs in the country."
Audrey Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes Premarin, said: "The percentage price increases are not as important as the daily cost. Therapy with Premarin costs a patient less than 60 cents a day. That's a small price to pay for preventing osteoporosis, which costs the U.S. health care system $10 billion a year."
Patrick D. Donohue, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, which makes Pravachol, said, "This product is moderately priced, compared with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, and it has tremendous medical benefits."
Moreover, Mr. Donohue said, "Singling out this drug doesn't tell the whole story. If you look at our full portfolio of drugs, you'll see that the average price rose less than the Consumer Price Index in the last six years."
As drug prices rise, the study said, the demand for discounts by hospitals and health maintenance organizations increases, and this in turn tends to push up prices for individuals who are unable to get such discounts.
The difference in drug prices paid by people with and without insurance to cover drug costs has widened in the last three years, the report said.

HEADLINE: Administration Proposes Changes in Work Rules for Truck Drivers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
To cut the number of deaths caused by sleepy truck drivers, the Clinton administration today proposed major changes in limits on working hours written in 1937.
But the draft rules, the government's third try at comprehensive change since 1976, were immediately criticized by safety advocates and the trucking industry. 
 The rules would be based on a 24-hour cycle instead of the current 18. And they would require some trucks to carry "black boxes," which the police could use to determine whether drivers were complying.
For long-haul drivers, the rule would set a maximum workday of 12 hours, with 10 consecutive hours off for sleep, and another 2 hours of breaks at other times, in blocks of at least 30 minutes. The current law limits drivers to 10 hours on and calls for 8 hours off. The new rules, then, would let drivers work two hours longer in a shift, but reaching 60 hours would take a minimum of five days, compared with four days under the current limits.
In addition, the rules would require a two-day "weekend," although that could come on any consecutive days.
"This will allow drivers to eliminate any sleep deficit they have built up," said Julie Anna Cirillo, the acting deputy administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency created last month within the Transportation Department to improve truck safety.
A 90-day public comment period will begin soon, and Transportation Department officials said they were determined to complete work by the end of the year. If a final rule is not published by mid-January, a new administration could start anew.
But officials conceded that achieving consensus might be impossible. "You won't find anyone who supports this draft," said Kenneth R. Wykle, the federal highway administrator, whose agency is also part of the Transportation Department. Each party will object to a different part, Mr. Wykle said.
He was right. At the industry's main lobbying group, the American Trucking Association, Walter B. McCormick Jr., the president, said in a statement today that if the rule took effect, the industry would need "as many as 180,000 additional drivers and trucks" to move the current volume of freight.
"D.O.T.'s proposal would force today's sophisticated e-commerce, point-and-click, just-in-time delivery systems back into old economy inefficiencies," Mr. McCormick said. He predicted that "warehouses would bulge with goods as the freight backlog ballooned due to massive shortage of trucks and drivers."
But Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a watchdog group, said that lengthening the maximum work shift was a mistake. "Most research shows that after eight hours, the capacity to drive safely is drastically reduced," she said. But she said moving to a system based on 24 hours instead of 18 was sound.
Not all truckers agree. Keith S. Herzig of Willington, Conn., who owns three trucks that mostly haul cargo to Scranton, Pa., and back, said that at busy times he and the four drivers who work for him work to the current maximum, 10 hours on and 8 off, for several shifts in a row.
"When you become a professional truck driver, you don't naturally have a normal life, where you go to work at 8 a.m. and you're off at 4 in the afternoon," he said in a telephone interview. "You adapt to sleeping when you need to sleep, and working when you need to work."
Under the Transportation Department proposal, drivers in Mr. Herzig's category, people who stay within six hours of their base and return there at the end of each shift, would be allowed to work up to 12 hours, and then would have 12 hours off. But Mr. Herzig said that having a minimum break that was four hours longer than the current system's would cut his revenue in busy seasons.
Mr. Herzig said he had driven 1.5 million miles, accident-free, over 20 years, and had learned to sleep when time was available to do so.
Moving to a 24-hour system was recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board last year. So was the installation of data recorders, which the department said today would simplify paperwork for the trucking companies and drivers, and reduce fraud.
The requirement for recorders would be phased in, with smaller companies having later deadlines. But as an inducement to install them, companies would not be allowed to extend their drivers' shifts until the recorders were in place.
Some drivers have objected to the recorders as violations of their privacy or a sign that the government does not trust them. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater said today: "We don't think it assumes that they're guilty. We think we're using technology to enhance the safety and efficiency and reliability of the transportation system."
The Transportation Department estimates that the new rule would cost the industry $3.4 billion over the next 10 years. But it would prevent approximately 2,600 crashes a year, reducing deaths by 115 and serious injuries by 3,000, the department says. In 1999, according to government statistics, there were 5,203 truck-related fatalities.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Florio Carries Big Baggage And a Lead

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: METUCHEN, N.J.

 BODY:
THE motorcycle club meeting was a collection of Harley hats and shaved heads, a suit jacket or two amid much leather, and one head of chemically assisted bright red hair. One sticker on the wall read "Support the Clinton Agenda," the C made into a hammer and sickle. Another read, "I'm a motorcyclist and I vote." The evening's featured speaker had an old boxing scar on his left cheek and brushed-back black hair, and wore a black mock-turtleneck shirt and dark pants.
"My story's about second chances," he told the 25 bikers. "My story is about opportunities. My story, I like to think, is about hard work." 
 This was not one man's painstaking tale of overhauling an aging Yamaha. This was Jim Florio, once the smelly cheese of New Jersey politics, trying to roar back out of the sunset on a mission that looks at once daring and driven.
His lead sizable, if shrinking, as the Democratic primary for United States Senate approaches, Mr. Florio is trying to turn to his favor all that is stacked against him. And there is much. He portrays the $2.8 billion tax increase that upended his governorship as a necessary policy that he explained poorly to voters. He says his cash-starved campaign is actually an opportunity to engage in the "retail politics" of smallish campaign stops rather than slick television ads. Powerful Democrats in northern New Jersey are supporting his wealthy opponent, Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, simply because, Mr. Florio says, Mr. Corzine is a "walking A.T.M. machine" financing all their political ambitions.
But if Jon Corzine is a sugar daddy, Jim Florio is the vegetable man. He plies voters with policy the way parents push peas on children. There's a reason voters, and other politicians, sometimes find him arrogant: He was always more skilled at convincing himself which policy was correct than at than at bringing the people along.
When Mr. Florio was leaving Congress for the governor's office in 1990, he was asked what he would miss about Washington. Ignoring the cherry blossoms, he said, "the hearing process," meaning Congressional hearings.
Wrapping up a talk at a church lunch in Trenton on Monday, Mr. Florio said, with some excitement, that he wanted to mention one more thing. "Electric deregulation," he said. You could have heard an ohm drop.
After the talk, Nancy Orhun, who was there with her husband and young children, said, "I thought he did a pretty good job" as governor, but then added, "there was that toilet paper thing."
Toilet paper became a symbol of protest against Mr. Florio's tax measures, which, among other things, expanded the sales tax to include toilet paper, a change that was later repealed. Anger over taxes demolished Democratic power in Trenton, and Mr. Florio is still trying to outrun the shadow of that time.
I WAS governor for four years," Mr. Florio told the American Bikers Aimed Toward Education group here. "As I suspect you know, it was not pleasant all the time." Not waiting to be asked, Mr. Florio confronted the tax issue, saying he had faced an unexpected budget shortfall and a court ruling demanding increased education spending.
On the stump, Mr. Florio remains the familiar mixture of policy enthusiast and pugnacious campaigner. Like a practiced lounge act, he performs a medley of his greatest hits -- toxic waste clean-up, gun control, securing Social Security -- and then unfurls his high-school-dropout-makes-good autobiography before delivering a few zingers at Mr. Corzine.
With the primary six weeks away, Mr. Corzine's $1-million-a-week television campaign is turning negative today. His new commercial, titled "Remember," portrays Mr. Florio's tenure in Trenton as a time of tax increases and a faltering economy.
The election may hinge on whether voters care to remember those years. But surely Mr. Florio does, just as he remembers all the tough elections he has had since running for the State Legislature from Camden County in the late 1960's -- on his way to 16 years in Congress. He is now 62, a grandfather, professor, lawyer and even radio talk show host. So why is he back on the stump -- underfinanced, shunned by many party leaders, about to be the target of his opponent's treasury?
What is it that he wants back? His good name? The hearing process?
"Redemption is to go to heaven," he said, sitting on the steps of the church the other afternoon. "I'm planning on going to the Senate."

HEADLINE: Mayor Surprised About Possible Higher Rents

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expressed surprise yesterday that the city's Rent Guidelines Board was considering proposals that could set off sharp rent increases for the residents of one million apartments covered by rent stabilization laws.
The mayor, who appoints the board members, called the projected figures "very, very high" but said he had not taken a position yet. He also emphasized that the board had not made a final decision, and he urged the public not to be alarmed. 
 The board's chairman, Edward S. Hochman, has proposed changes in methodology that could lead to increases of 8.5 percent for a one-year lease and 12 percent for a two-year lease. An alternative version calls for increases of 6 percent for one year and 10 percent for two years.
Such increases would be the highest in two decades and drastically higher than in recent times. In five of the last six years, the board has adopted increases of 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease.
Asked if he supports increases as high as those in the proposals, the mayor said at a news conference: "I think those increases sound very, very high. They were not discussed with me in advance. I had no knowledge of them. So anybody reading them should just calm down and wait. It was a leak of information that at least I didn't know anything about until I heard about it this morning, late last night I guess."
Mr. Giuliani also said, "The thing that was leaked yesterday to the press was not leaked with my knowledge or with the knowledge of City Hall, so nobody should read into that that we've made any decision or any choice about it."
Although by law the mayor has no official role in the annual rent increase decisions, tenant leaders say the Giuliani administration exerts pressure on the board it appoints.
"We've known for a long time that City Hall dictates the rent increases that the rent board promulgates," said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York Sate Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, an advocacy group. "I think they're trying to come up with something like 5 and 7 percent, which would be really excessive, but try to make it look like less because it's not 8.5 and 12 percent."
Earlier yesterday, the rent board had its first internal skirmishes over this year's rent increase proposals, at a meeting that lasted all morning, but no votes were taken.
One member, Agustin Rivera, opposed two of Mr. Hochman's proposals, which landlords favor. The board now imposes rent increases based partly on an index of landlords' operating costs compiled by the board. One proposal would grant inflation-indexed increases in net income for landlords, besides their existing allowances for higher operating costs. The other proposal would exclude from the calculations of landlords' income the 20 percent rent increases that can be charged to the first tenant after a vacancy.
One number that provoked dispute was the 54.8 percent increase in fuel oil prices. A designated tenant representative on the board, Jeffrey Coleman, said that granting a permanent rent increase based on a temporary surge in price would be wrong. But a landlord representative, Harold A. Lubell, said: "We shouldn't pooh-pooh that the numbers are significant. We can't just ignore that."

HEADLINE: Slaying Shows Police Efforts Are No Cure-All for Cabbies

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
When a livery cab driven by Jose R. Olivares veered out of control and slammed into a building in the Bronx late Monday, it contained all the elements of a string of crimes that has confounded the police.
Mr. Olivares was dying, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the right side of his head. With him in the cab, a silver Lincoln Town Car that had no bulletproof partition and no security camera, were four teenagers who the police said had tried to rob him after he picked them up on the street. He had let one of the passengers get in the front seat beside him. A loaded .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol that the authorities said was used to shoot him was found tucked behind Mr. Olivares's back. 
 Mr. Olivares, 37, was the eighth livery cabby to be slain this year, the latest in a series of crimes that have mobilized the Police Department and drawn condemnation from community leaders and city officials. The four teenagers were charged in the killing last night. But in the details surrounding Mr. Olivares's death is an illustration of just how hard these crimes are to stop.
Even though the Police Department has deployed hundreds of officers each night on cabby-protection assignments, the officers remain frustrated enough that Police Commissioner Howard Safir faced a bank of television cameras yesterday and appealed to the drivers to take steps to protect themselves. "If you don't have a partition, please do not pick up hails, because you put yourself in great danger," Mr. Safir said. "And certainly do not let anybody in the front seat of your automobile."
In short, the authorities said yesterday, Mr. Olivares's death shows that no single response can protect the cabbies from those who stalk them.
In recent weeks, the police have increased the number of decoy cabs and have begun using the Street Crime Units to make random stops of livery cabs, in the hopes of deterring the killers. But the authorities said yesterday that two elements were still needed to complement their efforts: more safety equipment in the cabs, and changes in cabby behavior.
The death of Mr. Olivares, the authorities said, underscored the importance of both.
Unlike yellow medallion cabs, livery cabs are prohibited by city regulations from picking up passengers on the street, and police data show that more than 80 percent of the robberies this year and six of the eight killings occurred after drivers broke the rules. And yet, in addition to picking up passengers assigned by dispatchers, as they are allowed to do, drivers like Mr. Olivares have continued to stop for fares at the curb, even at night, and even as the homicide tally has been rising.
Moreover, although the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission passed a regulation last week requiring livery drivers to outfit their cars with partitions or security cameras by the middle of May, local glass shops are backlogged by as much as four weeks to meet the sudden demand. Mr. Olivares had a bulletproof partition on order, but even if it had been installed, it would not have protected him from a passenger he had allowed to ride beside him.
The Police Department's message, however, must contend with the realities of transportation in poor neighborhoods and the economics of the livery-cab industry, which all but assure that the drivers will continue to defy the rules.
"The drivers are serving under-served minority neighborhoods," said Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. "They are minorities serving their own people because yellow cabs won't go into these neighborhoods, and because they need the money to put food on their families' tables. When they see someone who wants a ride, they are going to pull over and pick them up. It's going to continue happening."
Given these circumstances, and given the fact that the police have already stepped up their efforts, Mr. Mateo and city officials are holding out hope that the partitions, once installed in the roughly 46,000 livery cabs operating in the city, will slow the rate of killings.
Crime data suggest they might. In 1994, the Taxi and Limousine Commission passed a regulation requiring the fleets of yellow medallion cabs to install approved partitions in their vehicles. Since then, the yellow-cab homicides have virtually stopped. There were nine in 1993, none in 1994, and then one each year through January 1997. Since then there have been none. Yellow cab robberies have also plummeted, from 723 in 1994 to 181 last year.
Direct comparisons are impossible because livery cabs tend to serve neighborhoods that are more crime prone than those served by yellow cabs, and because overall crime rates have been falling since 1994, but officials say these statistics still suggest that partitions could help.
Allan J. Fromberg, spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said the statistics were compelling enough that the commission was urging drivers to opt for partitions over the cameras. "We are strongly, strongly encouraging the partitions," Mr. Fromberg said. "Just by virtue of the fact that they are tried and true over the years."
Another element in the cabby-protection effort was proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday at Shea Stadium. Mr. Giuliani said that ideally the livery cabs would not pick up street hails, but absent that, the city could create so-called green-light zones in which cabbies with partitions could pick up passengers.
These green-light zones, which Mr. Mateo has been pushing in meetings with city officials, would be selected along busy corridors, and would in all likelihood overlap areas where the police are concentrating their efforts. The mayor said he had asked the Taxi and Limousine Commission to consider two or three pilot zones.
"Obviously it would be safer if the livery-cab drivers did not pick up street hails," the mayor said, adding, "We are also realists."
While city officials talked policy, police officers continued to ponder what other factors had caused the killings to increase. William H. Allee Jr., the chief of detectives, said yesterday that detectives did not believe that the killings had been committed by a serial killer or were part of a gang initiation, as some people had speculated last week.
"Other than the fact that most of these appear to have started as street hails, this doesn't seem to have a pattern," the chief said.
Beyond that, the reasons for the increase in killings remain a mystery. The police have said they are puzzled because the rate of livery-cab robberies has not changed in three years, and has remained constant this year as the rate of homicides has surged.
So theories abound. Mr. Mateo and some Street Crime Unit officers said last week the killings might have increased because officers on patrol had been less aggressive since the public outcry last year over the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo.
Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey said yesterday that killings might be on the rise because an inexperienced group of criminals had begun robbing cabs. "You get young people committing crimes with guns in confined spaces, and it is going to turn awful a lot of the time," he said. "Sometimes the people with guns are as nervous as the drivers who are getting robbed."
Some police officials also said that the increase in killings could merely be a statistical blip, for which no explanation would ever emerge. "It might be a blip, but blips can cause big problems," a senior supervisor said. "We're in the business of saving lives, so blips need to be dealt with."

HEADLINE: Two Families, Joined by a Death and Questions of Why

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
John Rivera struggled yesterday afternoon to understand how his son could have crossed over from hanging out with the wrong people to becoming one of them.
Hours earlier, at 10:15 p.m. Monday, yet another livery-cab driver -- the eighth in the city this year -- had been killed, just blocks from Mr. Rivera's Bronx home. 
 Hours later, Mr. Rivera's son, who was a passenger in the cab, was in police custody.
While each of the driver slayings, this one included, offered its own poignant tale of a life violently snatched, this one also may tell of a life indifferently given away.
The police said John Rivera Jr., 19, the son of working-class parents who pushed him toward rectitude, was one of four people involved in the slaying of the driver, 37-year-old Jose R. Olivares.
His father said he hoped it could not be true. "He's not like that; he's not that kind of person," Mr. Rivera said before his son had been officially charged. "I hope he didn't do it."
While Mr. Rivera worried yesterday, another Bronx family grieved for Mr. Olivares, including his sister Gladys, 34, and his three sons: Felix Jose, 9; Jose Renaldo, 12; and Jose, 18.
Ms. Olivares, one of the dead man's nine siblings, said in an interview at her Bronx home that her brother had lived with her for the last three months because he had separated from his common-law wife, Maritza.
Mr. Olivares, a driver for Excellent Car Service, always told people that he was taking extra precautions, his sister said.
"I don't pick up hails, I don't load more than two people in a car, and if I do there has to be a child involved," she remembered him saying.
But Mr. Olivares apparently broke his rule against picking up people who hailed his cab on the street. Just blocks from his home about 10 p.m. Monday, he stopped his car at East 170th Street and the Grand Concourse to let in a young woman and three young men.
A short time later, the police said, as Mr. Olivares was headed west on East 150th Street, one of the passengers shot him in the back of the head with a .380-caliber pistol. The silver 1996 Lincoln Town Car jumped the sidewalk and slammed into an apartment building, injuring all of the passengers, the police said. The car hit the side of 255 Morris Avenue with such force that it crashed through part of a brick and cinder block wall and knocked in a large heavy red metal door.
The gun was found behind Mr. Olivares's back.
All the passengers were trapped in the car, allowing the police to detain them for questioning.
And last night, the younger Mr. Rivera, his girlfriend, Jasmin Valentin, 16, and two of his neighbors at 3050 Park Avenue -- Norberto Hernandez, 16, and Ramon Anaya, 18 -- were charged with second-degree murder, attempted robbery and weapons possession, said Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office.
Mr. Anaya and Mr. Hernandez were critically injured in the crash, and were in stable but guarded condition at Lincoln Hospital last night.
Mr. Olivares drove a cab only in the winter, and was set to switch to his summer job driving a beer truck in a few weeks, his sister said, adding that their mother had called from the Dominican Republic on Monday to say that she had had an odd feeling and was worried about him.
Fernando A. Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, said yesterday that Mr. Olivares had emigrated from the Dominican Republic a decade ago.
"One of the things that the family is asking themselves today is why him, a man that worked 15 hours a day, a man that worked to support his children, support his family, support his mother back home?" he said.
"They don't know how they're going to tell their mother that her son is going back in a box, in a wooden box, as if he was freight," said Mr. Mateo, who held a news conference at the accident scene.
Mr. Mateo praised the recent efforts by the Giuliani administration and the Police Department to respond to the recent spate of livery killings, by financing partitions and security cameras for some of the city's 41,000 livery drivers, and by setting up a police task force to prevent robberies and killings. But he called on the police to do more, particularly to increase patrols.
Mr. Olivares's car, which he had rented for about three years from the owner, Ramon Brito, 45, had no bulletproof partition to protect the driver. Mr Brito said yesterday that he was scheduled to have one installed on May 30, the earliest date he could get.
The elder Mr. Rivera said that he and his wife, Nydia, had seen their son on Monday night around 9, in the building's lobby. He told them he was going to play basketball.
Mr. Rivera was laid off from his job overseeing the loading dock at Salomon Smith Barney in February. So yesterday, while his wife went to her job as an administrative assistant in Manhattan, using work to distract her from worry, he sat at home, watching the news and awaiting word from the police. He had not yet been able to speak to his son.
It was not, he said, that his son had never been in trouble: he had been arrested twice for smoking marijuana in the back of the building. But as the father saw it, his son was a good kid influenced by bad peers.
"He knows right from wrong," Mr. Rivera said.
After learning at 10:30 last night that his son had been charged with murder, Mr. Rivera seemed to be in shock.
"I need to talk to them," he said haltingly, referring to the authorities. "I don't know what to say right now."
The younger Mr. Rivera was unemployed, and he had dropped out of the High School for Graphic Arts in Manhattan. But he had artistic talent, as evidenced by a scrap of graffiti his father showed, and he planned to start classes toward his general equivalency diploma next week.
Johnny Rivera had reached the age where a firm voice and a daily lecture could no longer corral him, his father said, but that did not stop the elder Mr. Rivera from trying.
Each day, Mr. Rivera said, he would lecture his son about hanging out with the wrong people. Each day, including Monday, he said, his son answered, "They're just my friends; they're not going to do anything."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Finding Drama in Life, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
A lot of advice gets handed out in the thoroughly engrossing new staging of August Wilson's "Jitney," a play written two decades ago but never before seen in Manhattan. Some of that counsel, on subjects from how to treat a woman to how to get ahead in a white man's world, is sensible; some of it is crazy. But there's one bit of wisdom that you're especially glad the play's characters don't heed: "Don't put your business in the street."
As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays on the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where personal business is always on public parade. In this splendidly acted production, which opened last night at the Second Stage Theater under Marion McClinton's direction, the storefront window of the gypsy cab company that gives "Jitney" its title seems to stretch right up to heaven. 
 You feel as if any conversation, no matter how confidential, has got to include the scarred streetscape that pushes intrusively against the glass with tall-tale vividness in David Gallo's wonderful set. The breath of the city fills the room whenever the office's rotary pay phone rings, which it does with jangling frequency, and whenever a driver comes back from a job.
Real life, whether comic or tragic, is the best show in town in the Hill District. Mr. Wilson's characters get as much of a thrill from sitting in the audience of observers, kibbitzing and criticizing and retelling local dramas, as they do from being the major players. Set in the 1970's, "Jitney" could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality, and it is rendered with such stylish detail, that a complete urban symphony emerges.
"Jitney," which Mr. Wilson has described as the work in which he discovered his dramatist's voice, has been much rewritten since it was first produced in Pittsburgh in 1982. (This latest revision has been seen, with some variations, throughout the country over the past several years.) It still hasn't found its perfect shape. Its sentimental ending feels hammered on, with the nails showing, and a couple of the work's pivotal confrontations have a whiff of assembly-line melodrama.
Yet under Mr. McClinton's sensitive and democratic direction, which treats all the performers equally as both soloists and members of a chorus, "Jitney" holds its audience in charmed captivity for its two and a half hours. And for those unfamiliar with Mr. Wilson, the author of masterworks like "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," it offers a perfect introduction to a writer who never created a character who (to borrow an image from "Joe Turner") didn't have his own individual song to sing.
By Wilson standards "Jitney" is slim on plot. It is a rare work from this author that introduces a loaded gun, as this one does, and then doesn't use it. The principal sources of tension come from the threat that the makeshift taxi company may be shut down by the city, and from the implosive relationship between Becker (Paul Butler), who runs the company, and his son, Booster (Carl Lumbly), who has just finished serving a 20-year prison sentence.
The reciprocal guilt and needs of father and son, which Mr. Wilson has explored more subtly in subsequent works, are among the less persuasive aspects of "Jitney." What gives the play its extraordinary verve is how the characters define themselves -- and by extension, the hardscrabble world in which they exist -- through bristling dialogue and tasty anecdote.
In the first scene alone, two drivers return from jobs with stories that summon an entire ethos. Turnbo (Stephen McKinley Henderson), the company yenta, describes having driven a passenger who has just stolen his grandmother's television set; Youngblood (Russell Hornsby), the youngest of the drivers, speaks of having seen a woman known as Cigar Annie, who has just been evicted from her house, standing in the middle of the street cursing everyone from God to the gas man while holding up her skirt.
Doub (Barry Shabaka Henley), the quietest member of the group, offers an explanation for Annie's behavior that cuts through the lewd joking of the other men: "She was raising up her dress 'cause that's all anybody ever wanted from her since she was 12 years old."
These two stories, and the varied reactions to them, establish what twirls the world of "Jitney": economic anxiety and sexual attraction, both of which breed endless complications. The issue of whether anyone is fool enough to lend the alcoholic Fielding (Anthony Chisholm) the grand sum of $4 creates the play's first moments of conflict.
And the war, or alternately the armed truce, between men and women is manifested in everything from the usual lover's quarrels (which also involve money) between Youngblood and Rena (Michole Briana White), the mother of his child, to the story of the crime of passion that sent Booster to jail. The variations on the theme, which include a glorious monologue about a girlfriend's hex, delivered by Willis Burks II as a numbers runner, are delicious, always sparked by some skewed detail that turns the familiar into the memorable.
Mr. Wilson brings the same open-ended eloquence to both meandering monologues and terse chains of phrases. (Booster on his first day out of prison: "I don't know what to think. People going everywhere. All up and down. Dogs and cats.") The performers individualize that language with the personal rifflike deliveries of jazz artists.
These are all performances to savor, from the mannered rasp and baroque gestures of Mr. Chisholm's hard-drinking, slow-moving Fielding to the bass-voiced, anchoring authority of Mr. Butler's superb Becker. The ensemble members, who also include Leo V. Finnie III as a hotel doorman, have developed a feeling for one another's rhythms that usually comes only with long acquaintance.
The respect for both personal idiosyncrasy and a harmonic whole is confirmed in the production's every detail: from Susan Hilferty's expertly varied costumes to Donald Holder's emotion-enhancing lighting. And in the play's final scene, every time you think the dialogue is heading toward a foregone conclusion, Mr. Wilson spins it in another, perspective-changing direction.
Whether debating the subject of who is prettier, Lena Horne or Sarah Vaughan, or erupting into a fistfight, the inhabitants of "Jitney" nearly always act in exactly the way they speak. You seldom think of one of them, "Well, he wouldn't do that," which is less often true in theater than you might imagine.
If this is a play in which a significant artist was just learning how to make his characters talk, you rarely sense any corresponding uncertainty of tone in the current version. Mr. Wilson, Mr. McClinton and their excellent band of actors make us feel that we have known these people -- with whom we have spent only a couple of hours, after all -- for most of our lives.

HEADLINE: Rightist in Canada's West Has Eyes Set on Ottawa

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta, April 20

 BODY:
In Canada, a social welfare nation that has more tax collectors than soldiers, Stockwell Day has commanded a fiscal revolution in his province in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains.
Mr. Day, the treasurer of Alberta, has eliminated the province's net debt, cut provincial income taxes to the nation's lowest levels, and plans next January to put into effect Canada's first flat tax on income -- 11 percent. 
 "You could calculate your income tax on the back of your business card," said Mr. Day, an athletic 49-year-old who has a knack for being photographed playing volleyball, in-line skating or practicing tae kwon do kicks in a T-shirt with sleeves rolled up to display his biceps.
Now Mr. Day wants to bring his conservative revolution to the rest of Canada, hoping that next year he will become prime minister, only the second one from western Canada in nearly four decades.
In the past, such western dreams foundered on the rock of Ontario, a powerhouse province whose districts account for slightly more than one-third of the 301 seats in Canada's House of Commons.
In the last elections, in 1997, the Liberal Party won only 38 percent of the nationwide vote, but it won almost all of Ontario's seats because the conservative vote, also 38 percent, split neatly between the two right-wing parties.
But after a decade of stagnating spending power, rising taxes and a brain drain to the United States, Canada's frustrated conservatives are showing a greater willingness to unite. One month ago, the Reform Party, originally a western protest movement, voted to convert itself into a new national party, the Canadian Alliance.
Canadians complain that, largely because inflation brought people into higher tax brackets, average disposable incomes slipped to about two-thirds of American incomes, and some economists think they will drop to half American levels by the end of the decade. Canada's maximum capital gains tax, 38 percent, is almost double the American rate, discouraging investment.
The emigration of skilled workers to the United States has doubled from the rates a decade ago.
"We are tired of the brain drain," said Rod Love, a campaign adviser here for Mr. Day. "We are tired of our kids going to the States because of the high taxes." Referring to Ontario's traditional reluctance to embrace candidates from the nation's western "periphery," he added, "Central Canadians have gotten to the point where they say, 'If a western Canadian can fix it, we don't care if the next leader is from Tierra del Fuego.' "
So far, the two major candidates for leading the new party are both Albertans: Mr. Day, and Preston Manning, an owlish 57-year-old member of Parliament who founded the Reform Party 13 years ago. Although Mr. Manning is endorsed by half of the Alliance's 58-member parliamentary delegation, party supporters complain that in three national elections the Reform Party under Mr. Manning's leadership has failed to make electoral inroads in central Canada. In an Environics Research Group poll completed in mid-April, Canadian Alliance supporters backed Mr. Day over Mr. Manning 43 percent to 30 percent.
But on April 27 an Ontario candidate intends to throw his hat in the ring to lead the new party. He is Tom Long, a 41-year-old strategist who devised the two victories of Ontario's Conservative Premier, Mike Harris, in votes by provincial legislature members. The conservative political machinery in a province with four times Alberta's population comes with Mr. Long's candidacy.
"Long's presence is a huge asset for the Alliance, whether he wins or not," said Sid Noel, a political science professor at the University of Western Ontario. Joe Clark, western Canada's last Prime Minister, would be left behind in the merger, presiding over a shrinking rump of the Progressive Conservative Party.
With two months to go until the leadership vote, it seems unlikely that any candidate will win with 50 percent on the first round. Most political analysts predict that the future leader of Canada's right will emerge in a second ballot, on July 8.
If elections in Prince Edward Island on April 17 are any indicator, the Liberals' seven-year grip on power in Canada is slipping. There, in the smallest of Canada's 10 provinces, Progressive Conservative candidates won 26 of the provincial Legislature's 27 seats, up from 19 before.
With national elections believed to be one year away, the Alliance offers a conservative alternative to a nation often seen as being on an ideological plane with Scandinavian socialism.
In a nation where the top 12 percent of tax filers pay 57 percent of the tax revenue, the Canadian Alliance platform calls instead for a 17 percent flat federal tax and faster repayment of the federal debt.
Mr. Long's fiscal creed is "flatter, simpler, and lower taxes." Speaking to a founding conference of the Alliance, he said, "Trusting the Liberals to deliver real tax cuts would be like shipping lettuce by rabbit."
On social issues, the Alliance wants to toughen sentencing and parole requirements for criminals and curb the expansion of timber and fishing rights for Canada's aboriginals. Reform Party politicians have generally favored the death penalty, opposed gun control and opposed extending marriage rights and job discrimination protection to homosexuals.
One of the first politicians to appreciate the potential of the Alliance was Prime Minister Jean Chretien, 66, a Liberal who hopes to win re-election to a third term. Last month, he attacked Mr. Day as "an extreme conservative."
"We don't want a party that is very much in the hands of the fundamentalists of the right," he said in a veiled reference to Mr. Day, a former lay pastor at an evangelical church in Alberta. Referring to Alliance calls for a national referendum on abortion, he added, "Canadians do not want a party that threatens a woman's right to choose."
Apparently in response, Mr. Day seems to be trying to cultivate an image of tolerance. "Any church, any synagogue, any mosque, any casino, any beer hall, any dance hall where there are Canadians who want to talk about an agenda of respect, I'll be there," he said when announcing his own campaign.
On a recent visit to Montreal, he praised a cooking show host who campaigns against antigay prejudice, saying, "My beliefs don't stop me from respecting people who think in a different way, or who adopt a different life style."
A few days later, Mr. Day was on the nation's front pages, recalling that, 30 years ago, he smoked marijuana -- and inhaled. Mr. Day, who lived and went to high school in Montreal and is the only French speaker of the major leadership candidates, also appears to want to soften his party's anti-Quebec image.
But to some, Mr. Day is trying to camouflage deeply held right-wing views. "By Quebec standards, Mr. Day, with his antiquated views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty, looks even more alien," Lysiane Gagnon, political columnist for the Montreal newspaper La Presse, wrote this week. "Quebec's politics are anything but religious, and evangelical ministers belong to another world."
Michael A. Phair, a city councilman in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, agreed. "His view of the world that we live in is very narrow," said Mr. Phair, one of Alberta's few openly gay politicians.
Last month, on his first campaign foray to Toronto, Mr. Day was greeted by a small group chanting: "Stockwell Day go away. Anti-choice. Anti-gay."
But as Mr. Day looks beyond his home district of Red Deer to the national stage, he plays down earlier conservative social stands, sometimes saying they are issues that should be decided in national referendums. His Web site biography emphasizes his political experience: 14 years in the provincial legislature and provincial ministerial portfolios in labor, social services and treasury.
While 30 percent of Americans describe themselves as born-again Christians, only 10 percent of Canadians do. Consequently, in this highly secular country, Mr. Day's biography makes no mention of his evangelical beliefs and religious work. He describes himself as "someone willing to take on the forces of political correctness in speaking for the silent majority."
While liberal journalists try to sink his candidacy with past statements on homosexuality and abortion, Mr. Day has proved to be skilled at reinventing himself. During the 15 years he spent between college and politics, he worked as a deckhand on his father's fishing trawler, cut trees as a lumberjack in British Columbia and drove heavy oil-field equipment in the Northwest Territories.
He has honed his skills as a persuasive speaker working as an auctioneer, a drapery salesman and, once, as a chicken peddler, selling from the back of his father's car. Although he is a college dropout, he recently gave a 21-page statistics-laden budget speech, without notes.
"Say this about Stockwell Day," Robert Lewis, editor of the nation's leading newsweekly, Maclean's, wrote recently. "Not since Pierre Trudeau dove into a swimming pool during an election campaign has an aspiring federal leader looked so good with his shirt off."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 29, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about Stockwell Day, a conservative politician from Western Canada who hopes to become prime minister next year, misstated the precedent for Western Canadians. If elected, Mr. Day would be the fourth in nearly four decades, not the second. The article also referred incorrectly to Joe Clark, a former prime minister who would be left out of a proposed merger of conservative parties. He was not the last prime minister from Western Canada; Kim Campbell of British Columbia was, in 1993.

An Otter Webcam, With Plenty of Cavorting

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN 

 BODY:
Jeannie and Glenn Chambers have a day-care center of sorts operating in their Columbia, Mo., home. Their charges wrestle on a rug, climb on a plastic play set and cavort in a pool.
They also sleep in a box and eat off the floor, but the child welfare authorities will not be knocking anytime soon. The Chamberses are ardent conservationists, and their charges are two river otters, Splash and Slide, which they are raising as part of an educational campaign. 
 Web surfers can catch the animals at play via National Geographic's ottercam, www.nationalgeographic.com/ottercam. There are two cameras available at the site, one indoors and one outside, and visitors can zoom and pan both of them. Nimble mousework is required, though, as the otters move fast.
The site also features video clips of otters in the wild and a map showing where the otters are found in North America (and where they are being reintroduced). There are also electronic "otter postcards" ready for sending, and plenty of links to other sites containing lesson plans for teachers and other educational material about the animals.

COLOMBIA: PEACE AIDE QUITS
The government's top peace official resigned after rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia threatened to step up a longstanding campaign of extortion and kidnapping against the rich. Peace Commissioner Victor Ricardo, left, denied his decision was linked to death threats from rightist paramilitary gangs. But he voiced outrage at a communique announcing that the rebels would begin abducting millionaires and executives of companies worth more than $1 million who refused to pay tribute to the 17,000-strong rebel force.

MEXICO: U.S. OBSERVER DEPORTED
Ted Lewis, the director for Mexico of the San Francisco human rights group Global Exchange, was detained by immigration agents in Guadalajara and deported. Mr. Lewis was organizing 40 foreign professors to study election conditions before the July 2 presidential balloting. The autonomous Federal Electoral Institute had approved his credentials as an election observer. Sam Dillon (NYT) 

CHILE: PINOCHET HEARING
An appeals court opened a hearing into arguments about whether it should strip Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his legislative immunity as a senator before he can stand trial for human rights violations that occurred during his rule between 1973 and 1990. The three-day hearing is only the beginning of what promises to be a long legal battle. If General Pinochet loses his immunity, defense lawyers are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.

The speaker of Parliament, Yildirim Akbulut, is his most prominent opponent. Stephen Kinzer (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: SELF-DEFENSE DISPUTE
The Conservative leader William Hague called for a radical overhaul of the law of self-defense after a public outcry over the murder conviction of a Norfolk man who shot an intruder at his farm. Chief Constable Crispian Strachan of the rural Northumbria police said the law permitting use of "reasonable force" worked well enough and that Mr. Hague's idea would generate American levels of violent assault and killing in Britain.

Vorontsov, has been rebuffed by the Iraqis as he tried to reopen an investigation into Kuwaiti prisoners still missing after Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990. Mr. Vorontsov, whom Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations appointed in February, reported to the Security Council that he is still seeking a meeting with the Iraqis.

ZIMBABWE: OPPOSITION WARNING
The leader of Zimbabwe's opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai, left, said his Movement for Democratic Change, which saw two more of its supporters killed Tuesday in political violence, would not stand by and watch as government loyalists continued to attack its members. At least five backers of the new opposition party have died in the last 10 days in attacks by people claiming to be supporters of President Robert Mugabe's ruling party. The opposition has urged its members to observe the law. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
'Remember' Florio, Foe Says

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:

 This 30-second commercial, titled "Remember," was released yesterday by Jon S. Corzine in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate from New Jersey. It is being broadcast by television stations in New York and Philadelphia.
 
 PRODUCER Shrum, Devine & Donilon. 

 ON THE SCREEN The ad begins with unflattering close-up pictures of Mr. Corzine's opponent, Jim Florio, the former governor, giving a campaign speech with a scowl on his face. Because the speech is shown in slow motion, Mr. Florio appears to be shouting. Subtitles amplify the script: "$2.8 billion tax increase," "280,000 lost jobs." The ad then cuts to now-familiar scenes of Mr. Corzine, smiling genially, greeting and talking with a counterman and patrons at a diner.

THE SCRIPT Narrator: "Remember? When Jim Florio was governor? A $2.8 billion tax increase; 280,000 lost jobs; 200,000 more people without health insurance. Auto insurance rates out of control. New Jersey's economy left in shambles. Do we want to go back to that? Jon Corzine is a new voice for New Jersey. Welcome to the future. Jon Corzine. Democrat for Senate."
 
 ACCURACY Mr. Florio was governor from 1990 to 1994, during a brutal nationwide recession. Soon after taking office he forced a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, to increase aid to needy school districts. Mr. Corzine says that during such a deep recession, the tax increases were a terribly wrongheaded move.
 The ad's reference to 280,000 lost jobs is identical to a claim Christine Todd Whitman made repeatedly in defeating Mr. Florio in 1993, but in fact, the decline in nonfarm employment from January 1990 to August 1993 was 205,300 jobs, according to federal statistics. While the ad's claims about the number of people without health insurance and skyrocketing auto insurance rates are accurate, it is impossible to say to what degree Mr. Florio's administration was to blame.
 
 SCORECARD With this commercial, Mr. Corzine begins what his campaign has long promised: a direct assault on Mr. Florio's record. Mr. Corzine, a relative unknown, still trails the former governor in the polls. But Mr. Corzine's advisers say that when voters are reminded of Mr. Florio's tax increases, which set off a "Dump Florio" movement that swept him and hundreds of other New Jersey Democrats from office, they view Mr. Corzine much more favorably. For good measure, Mr. Corzine's ad casts him as the Democratic candidate of "the future," while linking Mr. Florio to New Jersey's unpleasant economic past. Meanwhile, Mr. Florio's underfinanced campaign has broadcast no ads and remains unable to respond in kind. DAVID M. HALBFINGER

Union Wins, And 15 Lose Their Jobs

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
EVERY workday for the last 12 1/2 years, Melida Thomas has been going to her job at 80 Centre Street in Lower Manhattan, to the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, where she is one of 15 clerical workers.
In this office, which reviews city decisions about welfare and food stamp eligibility, she files, enters facts into the computer, looks up names and addresses. 
 By all accounts, Ms. Thomas and her co-workers do their jobs well. And they are about to be fired. A union has fought for 13 years to make the system work. The union finally won its argument. So these 15 workers lose.
Here is what happened. The state began, in 1987, to fill clerical jobs in this office with temporary workers hired through private employment agencies. The 15 workers have been on the job from 4 to 13 years.
Theoretically, people working in state offices would be members of the Civil Service Employees Association. But that would mean 15 more people on the state payroll, receiving benefits and a living wage.
Ms. Thomas, who is 49 and has two children, does not get vacations or sick leave, and her health insurance is Medicaid. "When we don't work, we don't get paid," she explained. "They promise us they will make us state workers. But they keep on extending the time."
The smaller its work force, the more government saves. Ms. Thomas and most of her co-workers earn $7.50 an hour and work 40-hour weeks. That's $300 a week before taxes -- $15,600 a year; the employment agency also gets fees from the state.
Equivalent unionized jobs pay $22,650 to $28,000 a year, depending on a worker's experience and other variables. The union workers get at least a week off every year, paid holidays and, after six months, medical and dental benefits and a pension.
Expensive. So until now, the state took advantage of a provision in its agreement with the union that permits the hiring of temporary workers, short term. Of course, 13 years is not short term. The union went to court. In February 1999, the parties settled: the 15 jobs would be unionized.
Obvious solution. But most of the 15 workers (who learned about the settlement just last month) had never taken the Civil Service test, and those who did last year failed. Maybe it's because they are all Hispanic, not fluent in English, suggested Stacy Kaufman, an administrative law judge who works with them.
"But they are doing the jobs," she said. "They are devoted. Each does the job extremely well. They work right next to people earning more. They've proven very competent to do their jobs."
Daniel D. Hogan, spokesman for the office in Albany, agreed: "These people have been in their jobs a long time, working in a tough area for us, and did a good job. We definitely feel for them."
But the state has no choice, he said. "We have to let them go. We think it's a shame."
Stephen Madarasz, a union spokesman, said, "Obviously we don't want to see anybody put out of work, but sometimes circumstances aren't black and white."
Several of the 15 workers took the Civil Service test again in February. They don't know the results yet, but even if they pass, they will probably not be hired.
"The way the union rules are, it will be hard for them to get into state employment," Mr. Hogan said. "There are other people on waiting lists who scored well on the Civil Service tests. It's a pretty tough situation for them."
THE workers will probably be let go soon, he and others said.
Asked why they didn't take the test earlier, several workers said they didn't understand that they had to be civil servants; after all, they were working steadily, some for years. "Nobody was talking to me about the test before," said Carmello O'Neill, 54, a messenger with the office for the last six years who once worked in a hotel kitchen. Before that, he was on welfare.
Mr. O'Neill, who came here from Puerto Rico and has three children, says he will look for another job, but is worried about finding himself on welfare again. "I don't want to go back."
Ms. Thomas says that if she loses her job, she will go on unemployment and look for a job.
The administrative law judge, Ms. Kaufman, said she understood the need to unionize the jobs, but was concerned about the workers: "This is exploitation by the state and the union. We're asking for an exception to policy."
Not likely, said Mr. Madarasz, the union spokesman. "We don't want to be cold about it, but we don't have an obligation to people who are not members of our union."
And that is how the system works.

Guyana Airline Owner Scents New Growth in Old Backwater

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Guyana

 BODY:
Flying over this country's bountiful rain forest in a noisy propeller plane seating nine people can unnerve the most seasoned traveler. And what if the pilot shows up wearing sneakers and a T-shirt?
"Not in this company, mister," said Gerald Gouveia, the owner of Roraima Airways, an upstart Guyanese airline. After Mr. Gouveia saw the unsettling effect such attire could have on foreign visitors, he decreed a dress code for his pilots: tie, slacks and black leather shoes. 
 "Even if we must sweat," said the 44-year-old executive, clad in such clothing because he sometimes pilots his company's planes, one hot day here in Guyana's capital.
Mr. Gouveia is one of the more outspoken business executives in Guyana, the only English-speaking nation in South America. Working to discard more than two decades of isolation after independence from Britain in 1966, Guyana's economy has slowly become more capitalistic over the last decade, and people like Mr. Gouveia are leading the way.
He got his start in aviation in the armed forces, where he spent 15 years, eventually rising to chief pilot of the army air corps. During that time he got some experience working under pressure after the mass suicide late in 1978 of more than 900 followers of Jim Jones, the doomsday cult leader who constructed a city, Jonestown, in Guyana's interior.
"The smell of the place was disgusting, but there I was -- flying the world's media into the middle of nowhere," Mr. Gouveia said in lilted Guyanese English that resembles the accent of Jamaica. "What a rush!"
After leaving the military, Mr. Gouveia moved north, like many of his countrymen, to Canada, where he worked as a flight instructor in Montreal.
In fact, more Guyanese still live outside the country than in it, leaving the population at little more than 700,000. The largest communities of Guyanese abroad are in Toronto and in New York, where as many as 130,000 people are largely concentrated in Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and Jamaica, Queens; and in Crown Heights and Flatbush, Brooklyn.
Although the financial stability to be found in North America was attractive, he returned to Guyana in the early 1990's to work for Golden Star, a Canadian mining company, organizing their transportation for a large gold-mining operation in the interior.
Then, in 1992, elections brought in a government perceived as more favorable than its predecessor to private investment. So after some market-friendly changes, like the privatization of the national telephone company and the awarding of a concession to a Malaysian concern for a large-scale timber operation, he started his own airline eight years ago.
Mr. Gouveia called it Roraima Airways after Mount Roraima, the remote peak that serves as the backdrop of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's adventure novel "The Lost World." It is also where the borders of Guyana, Brazil and Venezuela meet, a region of economic potential if Guyana chooses to forge stronger ties with its South American neighbors.
With that idea in mind, Mr. Gouveia initiated the first regularly scheduled flights between Guyana and Brazil, linking Boa Vista, a city in the upper reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, to Georgetown. But lack of passenger demand on the route soon made Roraima Airways drop it.
Mr. Gouveia attributed this lack of demand to concern among some Guyanese government officials over the possibility of their small country becoming a mere appendage to its neighbor to the south, with 170 million people.
Recently, though, progress has been made in strengthening Guyanese ties with Brazil with the forming of a tourism and trade commission headed by Mr. Gouveia. Although he is still critical of what he calls foot-dragging, he said that "Guyana is realizing that much of its future is linked to better Brazilian relations."
Commonly called Gerry, or Captain Gerry, Mr. Gouveia is known for his blunt criticism of Guyana's government. The country's politics remain polarized by race issues, and though people from different racial backgrounds mix freely on the streets of Georgetown, they tend to vote along ethnic lines.
Still, a vibrant democracy has emerged, enabling people to express their views. Since 1992, the Indo-Guyanese majority, descended from people from the Indian subcontinent, has governed the country, after more than two decades of rule by Afro-Guyanese -- those descended from Africans.
Mr. Gouveia is a member of still another minority, the Portuguese, descended from laborers from Portugal who came to Guyana more than a century ago.
Mr. Gouveia's biggest feud with the authorities came a year ago, after he acquired the country's first civilian helicopter. With the new machine, he hoped to organize tourist expeditions into rain forest lodges and to fly supplies to mining camps.
But soon, the army began competing with him, using its helicopters to organize sorties into the interior. And because the army did not pay taxes on fuel, it charged less, eventually squeezing Roraima Airways out of the helicopter business.
"Gerry's a little bitter about the helicopter issue," said Moses Nagamootoo, the minister of information. "But we're a very poor country. We encouraged our army to get into things like farming, or to use their helicopters to make a little extra money. What harm is there in having an army that is not in dire straits?"
Facing such obstacles, Mr. Gouveia does not expect to become another Richard Branson anytime soon. His fleet comprises three small planes, none of them jets. And his company is smaller than the country's two other airlines, Guyana Airways and Trans-Guyana. Still, that does not stop him from thinking big.
"We've got it all in Guyana for a big air travel market -- the preserved natural beauty, the natural resources, the exports," he said, counting on his fingers the nation's production of rice, sugar, timber and gold. "It takes a crazy capitalist like me to get off the sidelines and make sure we don't lose this chance."

HEADLINE: After 2 Months of Declines, Durable Goods Bounce Back

BYLINE: NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com 

 BODY:
Orders for big-ticket durable goods bounced back in March after two consecutive months of declines, the government said yesterday. The number was helped by a substantial rebound in transportation orders after Boeing reached a contract agreement with 17,000 striking engineers.
Orders for durable goods like appliances, vehicles and aircraft jumped 2.6 percent in March, compared with a revised decline of 2 percent in February and a 1.9 percent decline in January, the Commerce Department reported. 
 The report, showing growing capital spending by businesses, is the latest indication that the economy continues to enjoy robust growth.
"Competitive pressures are forcing businesses to maintain high levels of capital spending, and strong global growth spells strong demand for U.S. capital goods since over 40 percent of all U.S. exports are capital goods," said Anthony Crescenzi, market analyst and chief executive of fixed-income and economics analysis at the Bondtalk.com Web site.
The report comes a day before the government releases its preliminary estimate of economic growth in the first quarter. Economists expect the report to show that the economy grew at a 6 percent annual rate in the quarter, after the fourth quarter's torrid 7.3 percent pace.
Though the rebound in large part reflected a 1.8 percent jump in transportation orders, other sectors also showed healthy growth in orders. Orders for electronics and electric equipment were up 9.7 percent, while those for primary metals rose 0.5 percent. Within the transportation sector, orders for civilian aircraft were up 10 percent, after falling 25.9 percent in February.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders were up 2.8 percent in March, and excluding military-related goods, orders rose 3.7 percent.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment, which include personal computer orders, fell 2.1 percent in March after dropping 3.8 percent the month before.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Investors Retreat Fearing the Release of Inflationary Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated yesterday as investors stepped lightly ahead of important economic data, overshadowing the positive effect of solid profit reports.
Although analysts said news of a 2.6 percent increase in March durable goods orders was not inflationary, the trend irked Wall Street a day before the report on gross domestic product, which is expected to show that the economy is still moving along at a rapid pace. 
 "There is a little bit of profit taking and a little bit of nervousness as we go into Thursday's number," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. "The durable goods number was a little stronger than expected. That shows continued strength in the economy. That is not what you want to see right now."
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 179.32 points, or 1.61 percent, to 10,945.50, a day after closing with a 218-point gain.
Interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks pressured the gauge after climbing higher for several sessions. American Express fell 3 3/8, to 154 5/8, and J. P. Morgan & Company slipped 3 3/8, to 134 9/16.
The Dow's manufacturing and consumer products names also moved lower, with Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing off 4 7/8, to 88 15/16, and Procter & Gamble down 3 3/4 at 60 9/16.
Technology stocks weakened despite pockets of strength in the computer chip and Internet sectors. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 81.14 points, or 2.19 percent, to 3,630.09, after surging 6.6 percent on Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.45 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,460.99, and the Wilshire 5000 index ended down 158.76 points, or 1.17 percent, at 13,449.27.
Before the market opened, the Commerce Department reported that orders for big-ticket items like airplanes and industrial machines picked up 2.6 percent in March, much higher than the 1.8 percent expected by economists polled by Reuters.
That pressured stocks as Wall Street awaited what market players said was more important economic data expected today, with reports on first-quarter wage data and gross domestic product, a crucial barometer of overall economic growth.
"It's very important because it shows you if this trend continues," Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said of the data due today.
Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of an uptick in inflation, with Federal Reserve policy makers set to meet again on May 16 to consider whether to raise interest rates. The Fed has increased short-term rates five times, by a total of 1.25 percentage points, since last June in an effort to keep inflation in check.
The pullback in the Nasdaq yesterday was largely expected by technical analysts who doubted that Tuesday's rally had legs, noting that the gauge had not bottomed out and should retest the lows hit during the slide of the last month.
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he saw resistance at the 3,800 to 3,850 levels for Nasdaq. If the gauge broke those barriers, it would again find resistance at around 4,100 to 4,200, Mr. McCabe said.
"This whippy action of the market is enough to break any investor's neck," said Robert Dickey, technical analyst at Dain Rauscher. "The difficult task is determining whether the market is still in a correcting period, or if it has bottomed and is now turning more bullish again.
"On the Nasdaq, the pattern is still that of lower highs and lower lows, which by definition is a downtrend," he said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices fell yesterday on concern that five interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve had not slowed the economy enough to keep inflation from accelerating.
"With expected strong inflation numbers tomorrow, that's drawing the market's focus back to the economy" and away from trading off the stock market, said Dawn Baillie, who manages $1 billion at John Hancock Funds in Boston. Ms. Baillie has reduced her Treasury holdings since March to 60 percent to 65 percent from 70 percent to add higher yielding government agency and mortgage-backed debt.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.93 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Circles Slightly Closer to Military Ties to U.S.

SERIES: VIETNAM TODAY -- This is part of a series exploring aspects of Vietnam, 25 years after the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Last November, on Veterans Day, Maj. Joseph M. Gaines of the Air Force circled the airfield at Hue, in central Vietnam, and then landed his military cargo plane filled with emergency supplies of plastic sheeting, blankets and water bottles.
On one level it was a standard relief mission, intended to help flood victims, and it was over in less than 12 hours. But it was also a milestone: Major Gaines and his team were the first uniformed members of the United States armed forces to undertake a mission in Vietnam since the last few American troops pulled out in 1975. 
 The visit represented the quandary that confronts Vietnam 25 years later: that the victor of the war now needs the loser to build the security and prosperity that have so long eluded it.
"The U.S. is the No. 1 country we want to help us in security issues, in military issues and in economic issues," said Le Van Bang, Vietnam's ambassador to the United States. "But the war is always in the background."
Despite the passage of time, Vietnam has remained reluctant to allow any American troops back into the country. Hanoi recently refused another American offer to help remove land mines and unexploded ordnance, saying it feared that too many American soldiers would be seen around the country and be heckled.
It is just as possible that they were afraid that American soldiers would be given a hero's welcome, like the one that greeted Major Gaines.
"When we touched down I stepped out, and people came up to me to give me flowers, stuff to drink," the major said. "They were really happy to see us."
He was just 14 when Saigon fell to Communist forces on April 30, 1975, ending a war that killed three million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans.
Major Gaines's mission opened the way to the first visit to Hanoi by an American defense secretary: William S. Cohen went to Vietnam last month.
An impoverished nation with a shrunken army, Vietnam needs the access Washington could give it to the modern training and equipment that would put it on an equal footing with its more prosperous neighbors in Southeast Asia.
With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Vietnam lost its oldest military ally and patron, leaving it weak and alone as it faces a possible confrontation with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
But although the United States lifted a trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994 and the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1995, Vietnam has yet to approve a trade agreement and has hesitated at establishing fuller military-to-military relations, which might include regular port calls, weapon sales, training at top American military war colleges and joint exercises.
"We want to have full normal military relations, but we aren't ready yet," said Ambassador Le.
For its part, Washington would like to see Vietnam safely ensconced in an informal security community with the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a goal often articulated by Adm. Dennis Blair, the commander of United States forces in the Pacific.
Apart from Vietnamese resistance to dealings with the American military, China has warned against any military partnership between Washington and Hanoi that might suggest a threat on its southern border.
Pentagon officials insist that they would never jeopardize relations with China to get closer to Vietnam, which today has little strategic importance for the United States. But that assessment could change.
"Good relations with Vietnam will be important if China ever got aggressive, but those are things we don't want to talk about," said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution.
Even if barriers remain, Major Gaines's breaching of the one last fall represents a significant accomplishment, one that took 20 years to achieve, as well as $500 million and the disparate efforts of American veterans.
In the aftermath of America's military defeat, it became a point of honor and a political requirement in Washington that neither diplomatic nor military relations could be opened with Hanoi until questions about missing Americans were resolved. But it was that search that ultimately proved to be the key to opening the door between the American and the Vietnamese militaries.
In the late 1970's, President Carter explored the possibility of opening diplomatic relations, but he gave up when Vietnam asked for the equivalent of war reparations. During the 1980's there was no question of negotiations, because President Reagan was convinced that Hanoi still held American prisoners.
But there were other, unofficial contacts. Bobby Muller, an early leader of Vietnam Veterans of America, whose anti-land-mine group was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997, went to Hanoi in the 1980's to press for an accounting of the American missing. He got a cold response until he met face to face with the men he had fought against.
"No one could raise the theme of reconciliation without the veterans who paid the price of the war," said Mr. Muller, a paraplegic. "The veterans wanted relations, and we knew it was incumbent upon us to extend a hand of friendship and move on."
In 1988 Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and himself a Vietnam veteran, was sent by President Reagan to persuade Vietnam to help in the search for America's missing.
General Vessey's first breakthrough was at a meeting with Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the legendary hero of Vietnam's wars against France and the United States. In a private meeting in 1988, the former enemies fell into an animated, two-hour conversation that "covered the waterfront," according to General Vessey.
They talked about how the war had been fought, the high cost in human lives and what could be done to bring the countries together again.
"After that conversation I sensed an almost immediate improvement in relations with the government," General Vessey recalled.
Since that meeting the Pentagon has sent 100-member teams every other month to Vietnam -- though not in military uniform -- to scour the countryside for the remains of Americans. So far, 554 remains of military personnel have been identified, and the missions have concluded that there are no live American prisoners held by Hanoi. About 1,400 cases are left to be investigated.
In 1991 Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, led a Senate committee to report on the missing in action. A veteran who became a national antiwar figure, he teamed up with Senator John McCain, the conservative Republican from Arizona and a former prisoner of war.
"I was driven by the sense that we really needed to end the war," Senator Kerry said. "We Americans were acting and behaving as if the war was still going on and Vietnamese were holding Americans as prisoners." The committee determined that there were no live prisoners, and four years later the two senators flanked President Clinton when he announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Hanoi.
From the Vietnamese perspective, the Pentagon has opened up its considerable trove of maps, documents and other archival material to help Hanoi find the more than 200,000 Communist soldiers it still lists as missing.
For the Vietnamese military, the problem is not only to find its missing. Since the end of the cold war, the country's economic plight has forced it to reduce its armed forces by more than half, from 1.2 million to 480,000.
"In the past few years the Vietnamese armed forces have gone through a harsh change," said Capt. T. McCreary of the Pacific command. "They have moved to self-defense completely, to a small armed force that's not bad and can still defend the country and territorial waters."
The search for the missing in action has developed into regular exchanges of American and Vietnamese officers and military officials and invitations to Vietnamese officers to attend seminars and conferences in the United States -- though not training or access to modern equipment.
It also created the spirit that made Major Gaines's relief mission possible, and that, in turn, led to the defense secretary's visit.
Mr. Cohen promised the Vietnamese government help in dealing with issues left over from the war, including joint research into the effects of Agent Orange, the defoliant that American forces sprayed from the air across the south during the war, which has been blamed for many health problems and birth defects.
He also helped persuade the Vietnamese to reopen negotiations on a trade agreement with Washington to open up Vietnamese markets, said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative.
"The United States believes that the security of both of our nations can be enhanced by working together," Mr. Cohen told the Vietnamese.

HEADLINE: Knight Errant Or Erring? Sotheby's Tale

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Sometimes fairy tales do not have happy endings, even for knights in shining armor. That lesson should come as no surprise to A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall magnate who has made a second career out of rescuing companies in distress from the arms of unwelcome suitors.
Nobody, however, could have dreamed up a tale like that of Sotheby's, the venerable auction house that Mr. Taubman saved in 1983. As if by magic, it recovered and prospered under Mr. Taubman's reign as chairman. It hit a rough patch in the early 1990's, along with the rest of his empire. Then, Sotheby's rebounded once more -- until federal investigators intervened. 
 Mr. Taubman, 75, resigned in February as chairman and is now stepping down as a director of Sotheby's, with his armor tarnished. The Sotheby's story threatens to overshadow a life that might well qualify as a Horatio Alger story come true.
Government prosecutors are investigating whether, in 1995 and perhaps as early as 1992, Sotheby's conspired with its chief rival, Christie's, to split business and fix commissions. Christie's has as much as acknowledged antitrust violations by entering a government program that promises leniency to the first conspirator in antitrust cases to confess. Scores of customers who contend that they were grossly overcharged have sued both companies.
And fingers are being pointed at Mr. Taubman. Prosecutors have been told that he and the former chairman of Christie's dreamed up a commission-fixing scheme and ordered their executives to carry it out, according to people involved in the case. No one, however, has been charged, and much about the investigation remains murky.
Mr. Taubman, while declining to be interviewed, has adamantly denied any wrongdoing.
His son Robert was to replace him as a director at a shareholder meeting that was set for today in London. But the meeting was suddenly postponed on Tuesday because the company's largest outside shareholder, Ronald Baron, objected to the continuing Taubman influence. Mr. Baron's firm, Baron Capital Management, owns about 38 percent of Sotheby's; the senior Mr. Taubman still owns about 22 percent of Sotheby's and has so-called supervoting rights that give him control of the board.
This is not the first time that Mr. Taubman's knight errantry has landed him in trouble. His rescue of the Washington department store chain Woodward & Lothrop cost him hundreds of millions of dollars and ended in bankruptcy in 1994. Macy's, the department store in which he had a major stake, also went bankrupt, in 1992. And he went into New York City real estate in the late 1980's just before the local economy swooned.
Nationally, the early 90's recession hurt his department stores and shopping malls and slammed Sotheby's, where auction sales, and profits, plunged. In 1992 Mr. Taubman began trying to raise cash, selling some of his depressed Sotheby's stock, some artworks and, eventually, a major stake in his malls. All this occurred during the period now under investigation by prosecutors.
But whatever the financial pressures he faced, Mr. Taubman's friends and business associates say they cannot believe that he would have done anything illegal.
"I don't recall a single instance in which anyone has said that he cut a corner or did anything inappropriate," said Richard A. Manoogian, chairman of the Masco Corporation in Detroit. "I just can't believe that Sotheby's was that important in the overall scheme of things that it would be the one area in which he would do something improper."
The son of immigrants from Germany (his A. stands for Adolph), Mr. Taubman studied architecture at the University of Michigan but never graduated from college. In 1950, he borrowed $5,000 and began building on a small scale, a bridal shop here, a shopping strip there.
Over the next two decades, the shopping centers grew bigger and grander until they turned into glossy regional malls. Peter Linneman, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said that it was Mr. Taubman who "took the shopping center from a sort of schlocky product in the 1950's and 1960's into very creative and exciting places of business and of suburban activity."
He became famous in the business world for his good eye, his attention to detail -- and his bluntness. Leslie H. Wexner, founder of the Limited, tells the story of the first time they met when Mr. Taubman summoned him to Detroit in the early 1970's.
They climbed aboard a helicopter and visited one mall after another. Over lunch, Mr. Taubman ordered Mr. Wexner to fix up his stores, which he called "a blight on my shopping centers." Mr. Wexner says now that he was "really mad," but eventually realized that Mr. Taubman was right.
It was not until Mr. Taubman reached his 50's, though, that he developed a reputation as an investment whiz after putting together what turned out to be one of the real estate deals of the century: the purchase of the Irvine Ranch, then being developed in Southern California.
Mr. Taubman was invited by some members of the Irvine family to come in as a white knight and rescue the 77,000-acre property from the Mobil Corporation, which had won a bidding war for it. He assembled a band of his rich friends, who bought it for $337 million in 1977. When they sold out six years later, Mr. Taubman and his friends had scored a profit of more than $400 million.
That was where the cash came from to buy Sotheby's, the English auction house, which was founded in 1744. Having expanded too rapidly in the late 1970's, it was forced after an art market slump to fire half its staff and it started losing money. A pair of American corporate raiders began to buy up shares, sending shudders though the ranks of the titled gentlemen and Old Etonians who had always run the place.
Mr. Taubman, once again, looked like a white knight. He may have been another rich American businessman, complete with a perpetual tan, constant cigar and a beautiful young second wife, but at least he wasn't a breakup specialist. And he had artistic connections. A collector himself, he had been a Sotheby's customer, a force at the Detroit Institute of Arts and a patron of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Asked to bid by Sotheby's directors, Mr. Taubman once again put together a group of friends, including Mr. Wexner, to buy the auction house and take it private.
The new owners were surprised to find how antique Sotheby's practices were, Mr. Wexner said. Records were kept on file cards and legal pads, the London offices were a rabbit warren, and nobody could explain exactly how the business operated. "It was incredibly goofy," he said.
Mr. Taubman did not simply drag Sotheby's into the computer age. He also used his retailing talent to change the very nature of the business. Sotheby's clients were no longer art and antiques dealers, they were the collectors -- the shoppers -- themselves.
"It was a chance for people to get involved with the auction social swim," recalled John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman of Salomon Brothers. "The old money dominated the sellers, and the new money dominated the buyers."
To get buyers and sellers in the door, the company added more cocktail parties, glossy catalogs and blockbuster auctions of celebrity collections like those of Andy Warhol and Claus von Bulow. Selling art, Mr. Taubman famously said, was not too different from selling root beer. (And he knew; until 1994 he owned the A & W restaurant chain.)
Not everyone was pleased. Dealers, in particular, said that the art world was being commercialized and that the auction houses were now competing with them.
And there were missteps, some involving a rapidly expanding lending program. Sotheby's was embarrassed when it became known that in 1987 it had put up about half of the record-setting $54 million an Australian financier paid for a Van Gogh painting. The buyer promptly defaulted; Sotheby's eventually resold the painting. And it stopped lending to buyers without other collateral.
Still, Mr. Taubman's methods seemed to work, and his timing was good. The art market rebounded, and sales began to soar. Profits rocketed, too; Sotheby's, which had lost more than $6 million in 1984, earned almost $113 million in 1989.
Things were so good that Sotheby's sold shares to the public again, in May 1988. Mr. Taubman made millions of dollars on the sale and still owned about half the company's increasingly valuable stock.
His takeover of Sotheby's turned Mr. Taubman into a mover and shaker in New York's social scene, a paradoxical position for a gregarious man who nevertheless had always said he cherished his privacy. His wife, Judy, was on the cover of Town & Country magazine; his perfectly appointed homes in New York; London; Palm Beach, Fla.; Southhampton, N.Y.; and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., attracted attention.
He endowed government-studies programs at Harvard and Brown, donated millions to the University of Michigan and the Detroit Institute of Arts and was active in Jewish philanthropy.
As the 1990's began, real estate tanked. Mall sales slumped. And the art market went into a recession as the rich suffered from a global downturn. Sotheby's shares lost two-thirds of their value in 1990. Auction sales dropped, and so did profits, falling to less than $4 million in 1992. It was that year, prosecutors have been told, that Sotheby's and Christie's may have began to collude; it is certainly the year that they raised the commissions they charged buyers, by exactly the same amount.
Mr. Taubman's friends repeatedly say that it would be out of character for him to have done anything improper, no matter what his financial difficulties.
There appear to have been some. In 1992, Mr. Taubman was trying hard to raise money. He sold a third of his stake in Sotheby's, even though the share price was low, and he had borrowed against much of his remaining stake.
He tried to sell stock in his malls, a deal that was completed the following year and brought in a lot less money than originally hoped. The transaction was complicated because Mr. Taubman and his family had earlier borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from the giant corporate pension funds of AT&T and General Motors, secured by a stake in the shopping centers. The G.M. pension plan ended up owning so much of Mr. Taubman's company that in 1998 it swapped its shares for 10 of his malls.
Despite all these pressures, Mr. Taubman remained the model of a modern mogul, with all the lavish living that entails. Indeed, he partly inspired a major character in a modern sort of fairy tale, Dominick Dunne's novel "People Like Us." In the book, about the clash of old and new society in New York, the Taubman-like character is a rich trader who ends up in jail. (Some details were so apt that Mr. Taubman demanded changes by Mr. Dunne.)
But not entirely apt, Mr. Dunne says now. When he wrote the book, he said, he had watched Mr. Taubman only from afar; they have since met and he has grown to like Mr. Taubman. "I have never heard of a stain on his reputation," Mr. Dunne said. "Sure he's a tough guy; if you're going to be a billionaire, you've got to be a tough guy."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Children smart enough to get into elite schools may not need to bother.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Four economic analysts -- Professor Krueger, J. Bradford DeLong, Jeff Madrick and Virginia Postrel -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
YOUR son or daughter has just been accepted to both the University of Pennsylvania and to Penn State. The deadline for decision is May 1. Where should he or she go?
Many factors should be considered, of course, but lots of parents and students are particularly interested in the potential economic payoff from higher education. Until recently, there was a consensus among economists that students who attend more selective colleges -- ones with tougher admissions standards -- land better paying jobs as a result. Having smart, motivated classmates and a prestigious degree were thought to enhance learning and give students access to job networks. 
 But is it true?
A study that I conducted with Stacy Dale of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, "Estimating the Payoff to Attending a More Selective College" (available online at http:// papers.nber.org/), has unintentionally undermined this consensus.
It is easy to see how one could think that elite colleges enhance their graduates' earnings. According to the College and Beyond Survey, data collected by the Mellon Foundation, the average student who entered a highly selective college like Yale, Swarthmore or the University of Pennsylvania in 1976, earned $92,000 in 1995. The average student from a moderately selective college, like Penn State, Denison or Tulane, earned $22,000 less.
The problem with this comparison is that students who attend more selective colleges are likely to have higher earnings regardless of where they attend college for the very reasons that they were admitted to the more selective colleges in the first place.
Trying to address the problem, earlier studies compared students with similar standardized test scores and grade point averages who attended more and less selective schools. But this approach takes account of much less information than admissions committees see. There is no guarantee that all the relevant differences among students have been held constant.
This problem is known as selection bias. More selective schools accept students with greater earnings potential, and students with greater earnings potential are more likely to apply to more selective schools.
To overcome the problem, Ms. Dale and I restricted the comparison to students who applied to and were accepted by comparable colleges. Some students chose more selective schools; some less selective ones.
College selectivity is based on the average College Board score of the freshman class. We used data from the College and Beyond Survey of 14,239 full-time workers who had been freshmen in 1976. Their earnings were surveyed as of 1995. Although the data came from only 30 moderate to highly selective colleges, results are similar if a smaller, but nationally representative sample, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, is used.
Our research found that earnings were unrelated to the selectivity of the college that students had attended among those who had comparable options. For example, the average earnings for the 519 students who were accepted by both moderately selective (average College Board scores of 1,000 to 1,099) and highly selective schools (average scores greater than 1,275), varied little, no matter which type of college they attended.
One group of students, however, clearly benefited from attending a highly selective college: those from lower-income families -- defined approximately as the bottom quarter of families who send children to college. For them, attending a more selective school increased earnings significantly.
Restricting the comparison to those with similar choices helps solve the selection bias problem because these students were equivalent in the eyes of the admissions committees.
More important, students who applied to equally selective schools revealed that they had similar aspiration levels and self-confidence. If the comparison is restricted to students who applied to equally selective schools -- regardless of whether they were admitted -- attending a more selective school is still unrelated to earnings.
Although the selectivity of a school does not appear to influence the typical student's economic success, our analysis finds that the resources schools devote to instruction, which are related to tuition costs, do influence it.
No study is definitive. Here's one unresolved issue in ours: Why did 40 percent of students turn down the most selective school that admitted them? Although it is possible that those with greater earnings potential chose a less selective school from their menu of choices, this seems unlikely.
There are several reasons that college selectivity might have little impact on post-college careers. First, even elite colleges have diverse student bodies, and it is possible for apathetic students at elite schools to find other apathetic students with whom to play Nintendo and guzzle beer. By contrast, a good student can get a good education almost anywhere.
Second, about a third of college graduates earn higher degrees, whose prestige is often more relevant to professional or business success than undergraduate degrees.
Third, a student who goes to Penn State instead of the University of Pennsylvania, is more likely to end up near the top of the class. Employers and graduate schools may not adequately adjust for the competition.
My advice to students: Don't believe that the only school worth attending is one that would not admit you. That you go to college is more important than where you go. Find a school whose academic strengths match your interests and which devotes resources to instruction in those fields. Recognize that your own motivation, ambition and talents will determine your success more than the college name on your diploma.
My advice to elite colleges: Recognize that the most disadvantaged students benefit most from your instruction. Set financial aid and admission policies accordingly.

The average 1995 earnings of workers who were college freshmen in 1976 were $22,000 more for those from highly selective schools than those from moderately selective schools. But except for students from low-income families, those accepted at both types of colleges had similar earnings no matter which they attended.

Isles' New Ownership Hopes to Reinvent the Team

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
A new chapter in the epic of Islanders ownership began yesterday when Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar vowed to revive a storied franchise tainted by losing records, slashed payrolls and one former owner who sits in jail.
Wang and Kumar, the chairman and president, respectively, of Computer Associates International of Islandia, N.Y., are paying $187.5 million to three owners led by Howard Milstein, whose reign featured $40 million in losses, a brief abandonment of Nassau Coliseum and dwindling crowds at home games. 
 "We want to make the New York Islanders the world-class sports franchise that our community deserves, wants and needs," Wang, 55, said. "This is no easy task. We are not medicine men promising a very quick cure."
They insisted that they have no deal with SMG, the Nassau Coliseum's tough landlord, to modify the team's unfavorable lease, and have not analyzed deeply the possibility of a new arena to replace the creaky 28-year-old Coliseum.
"We are not committed to building anything anywhere," Kumar said.
SMG has not talked to Wang or Kumar, said Wes Westley, SMG's president, but to another Computer Associates executive. "I've tried to send indications that we'll be cooperative," Westley said.
Wang and Kumar's purchase, which requires National Hockey League approval, is not a guarantee of free spending, even for a team with the league's lowest payroll.
"Whether you have to have a bigger payroll, less payroll, I don't know," Wang said. "Just because you may have the lowest payroll doesn't mean you have the worst team."
But Mike Milbury, the Islanders' general manager, who had to shed numerous high-priced players to accommodate the team's losses, sounded hopeful. "It's nice to know that we'll be able to compete with our colleagues and know that the money will be there for a free agent if it makes sense," he said.
Kumar and Wang gently chided the Rangers, the league's freest spenders, and Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which owns the Rangers. "It's been demonstrated," Kumar said, "that having the highest payroll in the league doesn't buy you much either."
"Ooh, that's mean to Chuck," Wang said, with a gleeful smile.
Wang said that Dolan, a friend, gave him a Rangers umbrella and that he nearly brought it yesterday. "Wrong umbrella to take to this conference," Wang said.
"We wish him well, but we won't be going to any more Rangers games," Kumar said of Dolan.
"We'll go to Rangers games," Wang said, "but root for the Islanders. And we're going to have the better team."
Wang and Kumar, 38, share a jovial relationship. They also present one of the sports world's most diverse pair of owners: Wang was born in Shanghai and Kumar was born in Sri Lanka.
They are also hockey novices. Basketball is their preference. Kumar said he has read seven hockey books lately, including "Hockey for Dummies" by John Davidson, the Rangers' TV analyst.
The arrival of Wang and Kumar, whose Computer Associates stock is worth $2 billion, is a balm for fans who reviled the Milstein group's running of the team and scorned Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former United States Senator who advises SMG, sits on the Computer Associates board and is on retainer to Milstein (for non-Islanders issues).
"I'm totally elated," said Robert Ceparano of the Save the Islanders Coalition. "This is the end of a surreal ride. This couldn't be better."
In 1997, John Spano agreed to pay John Pickett, then the Islanders' owner, $165 million for the team and its cable television contract. But Spano was later sentenced to prison for bank and wire fraud, having illegally obtained loans to buy the team. Then Milstein, who acquired the team with his brother Edward and Steve Gluckstern, feuded with Gulotta in 1998 over a county promise to ease the way to build a new arena. And the Milstein group's austerity payrolls angered fans.
The last piece of the team's sale to Wang and Kumar occurred Tuesday, when Milstein settled financial and legal issues with Class B shareholders, who include the Picketts. The Picketts will receive an unspecified payment from Wang and Kumar if a new arena is built within 10 years.
Wang and Kumar resisted two previous attempts to interest them in buying the Islanders, but their pursuit accelerated with D'Amato's guidance.
D'Amato privately supported Wang and Kumar for the past three months to counter the only other bid, from a group led by Bob Gutkowski. "I knew this group could do something Mr. Gutkowski could not," D'Amato said.
Wang said: "When we first looked at it, it just didn't make any economic sense. But the counsel from the senator was, 'You can't look at it as a business.' He said, 'It ain't going to make money the same way your business does.' And once we stopped looking at it as a business, it was easy then."
Wang and Kumar said the team would be an extension of their charitable involvement, mostly in children's causes. But they are paying a steep premium for a losing team because of the lucrative Fox Sports New York cable contract.
"I don't think we overpaid," Kumar said. "We're paying fair value. We're paying for the legacy, the demographics and the future franchise potential."
The Devils recently cost the YankeeNets $175 million. Last year, the Penguins sold for about $75 million; the Blues for $100 million, and the Lightning for $110 million, 10 months after selling for $117 million.

HEADLINE: Corzine Attacks Florio's Lead by Attacking His Tax Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 26

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine dropped any pretense of remaining above the fray today in his campaign for the Senate from New Jersey, as he began running a new television commercial attacking his opponent, Jim Florio, for raising taxes as governor in 1990 during a deep recession.
Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, still trails the much better-known Mr. Florio in the polls. But Mr. Corzine's advisers have long maintained that he can narrow Mr. Florio's lead, or even pull ahead, merely by reminding the voters of his rocky four years as governor, and particularly the $2.8 billion tax increase, which gave rise to "Dump Florio" bumper stickers that can still be seen on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
Still, the harsh tone of the ad, complete with a grainy close-up of a frowning Mr. Florio in slow motion, represents a departure for Mr. Corzine, who had presented himself as a reluctant combatant since entering the Senate race. In November, for example, he said that he would not bring up Mr. Florio's 1990 tax increase, though he did not object when his aides and supporters did so.
Of course, neither Mr. Florio nor just about anyone else expected that Mr. Corzine would leave Mr. Florio's greatest vulnerability unexploited much longer, particularly now that the Corzine campaign has begun running commercials at a cost of more than $1 million a week. And in recent weeks, as the former governor has braced for the inevitable onslaught, the Corzine campaign has seized on every possible justification for mentioning the tax increase.
Mr. Florio had less than $1 million in the bank on March 31 and is not likely to broadcast his first commercial until the last week in May. So he has been trying to taint Mr. Corzine's ad campaign in the so-called free media -- the newspapers -- while inoculating himself against it. On Tuesday, for example, he said that if he were elected, his first legislative proposal would be campaign finance reform with strict spending limits for federal candidates, and likened Mr. Corzine to a "walking A.T.M. operation."
But he has also been defending the 1990 tax increase, which increased aid to the state's poorest school districts, as an example of courageous leadership, albeit poor salesmanship.
That, however, was enough for Mr. Corzine to claim that Mr. Florio had, in effect, asked for it. "Jim Florio has extended an invitation to Jon Corzine and everyone else in New Jersey to talk about his tax increase," said Steven Goldstein, a co-manager of the Corzine campaign. "Invitation accepted."
The new ad reminds voters of the economic troubles that plagued Mr. Florio's administration. "New Jersey's economy left in shambles," a narrator recalls. "Do we want to go back to that?"
Aides to Mr. Florio called the ad mudslinging and said it neglected to mention that New Jersey, like the rest of the nation, was in the throes of a recession that began before he took office. "It's a desperate attempt to find blame where it doesn't exist," said Jim Lanard, a Florio spokesman.
The ad also omitted any mention of Mr. Florio's reasons for raising taxes, Mr. Lanard said. "This ad reflects Jon Corzine's opposition to equal educational opportunities for everyone, his opposition to property tax relief, and his opposition to a balanced budget that is required by the New Jersey Constitution," he said.
But Mr. Corzine himself asserted that the tax package should have been avoided or mitigated at all costs. "I think raising taxes in the middle of a recession is not one of the smartest things ever promoted as public policy," he said. "Certainly not record levels of increases."
Political analysts said they had been wondering when before the June 6 primary Mr. Corzine would get around to taking on Mr. Florio more directly.
"I've always said this was a contest between Florio and anti-Florio," said Gerald M. Pomper, a professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "I think Corzine has probably established himself as a credible alternative, with all of his advertising and endorsements. So attacking Florio is probably tactically the right thing to do, because it's taking the basic issue that's there and highlighting it."

THE ISSUES
 
SUPPORTER OF BATTLE FLAG SWITCHES
Last week, it was Senator John McCain who changed his mind and said the Confederate battle flag should no longer fly atop the South Carolina Capitol. This week, Mr. McCain's best-known supporter in the state, Representative Lindsey Graham of the Third Congressional District, ventured the same opinion, saying he now supports the State Senate's proposal to remove the flag and put a smaller version on a Confederate monument in front of the Capitol. But Mr. Graham, a flag supporter who had urged Mr. McCain to stay away from the issue in the South Carolina primary, lest it cost him votes, added a qualifier to his change of mind. The flag, he told The Associated Press on Monday, should stay where it is if the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People continues its economic boycott of the state. Still, said Mr. Graham, who has his eye on a Senate seat, the flag is eventually going to come down. David Firestone (NYT) 

SIERRA CLUB WEIGHS IN
The Sierra Club has begun an $8 million television and radio campaign aimed at 17 House and Senate races. The commercials, mostly praising Democrats, are focused on tight races in which the club believes it has the best chance to make a difference. The commercials will be combined with other campaign efforts, the club officials say, including mass distribution of voter guides and fliers. The officials say they also plan to run presidential campaign commercials that criticize the environmental record of Gov. George W. Bush in Texas and may throw in advertising that praises Vice President Al Gore. The club has not made public where it got the money to pay for the advertising campaign and under federal tax and election regulations is not required to do so. B. Drummond Ayres Jr.(NYT)
 
THE MONEY
 
BUSH TOPS $78 MILLION
Continuing his record fund-raising pace, Gov. George W. Bush pulled in an additional $6.4 million in campaign donations in March, bringing his total for the race to $78.6 million. But at the same time, new campaign finance figures show, he spent $10.2 million and ended the month with $6.8 million in the bank. Vice President Al Gore pulled in $4.4 million in March, bringing his total fund-raising for the campaign to $40.4 million. He spent $4.7 million and ended the month with $3.8 million on hand. Mr. Gore has aggressively used the Internet as a campaign financing tool, raising slightly over $1.1 million online through Feb. 15. By comparison, Mr. Bush has raised $350,000 online. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, remains the most successful online presidential fund-raiser, pulling in $4.3 million electronically, followed by former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey with $1.7 million. Leslie Wayne (NYT)
 
THE STATES
 
RACE FOR NEBRASKA SEAT As the May 9 primaries approach for Nebraska's open United States Senate seat, fund-raising figures for the two leading Republican contenders show that in the first half of April, Secretary of State Scott Moore raised more than twice as much as Attorney General Don Stenberg -- $51,000 to $24,000. For the year, Mr. Moore now leads Mr. Stenberg $224,000 to $144,000 in fund-raising. But polls have Mr. Stenberg running ahead in the race itself, and over all in the campaign he has raised more than Mr. Moore -- $399,000 to $224,000 -- in part because he started a year earlier. Still, Mr. Moore now says he has the momentum in the contest on the basis of his latest fund-raising effort. On the Democratic side, former Gov. Ben Nelson faces no serious opposition in his nomination quest and, despite a late entry in the race, is well ahead of both Republicans in money raising, having taken in $129,000 in the first half of April, for a total of $763,000 for the campaign. More to the point, he also leads both Republicans in the polls. The incumbent senator, Bob Kerrey, a Democrat, is retiring. Pam Belluck (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Retiree With High Drug Bills Lends a Hand to Gore

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., April 26

 BODY:
Shirley Kindle, a 65-year-old retired clerical worker, played a bit part in Al Gore's presidential campaign today, but it was enough to win her over to the vice president's side.
Ms. Kindle needs a dozen prescription drugs each month for diabetes and other ailments. All told, they cost more than $500 a month, which is more than her Social Security check. To keep up her regimen, she has borrowed money from her family, although, like many other elderly people on fixed incomes, she sometimes skips certain drugs altogether because she cannot afford them. 
 She likes Vice President Gore's proposal that Medicare cover the cost of prescription drugs. And so today, after a magazine, to which she had written a letter about the high cost of prescription drugs, arranged with the campaign for a "photo op," she posed with Mr. Gore at Pelton's Drug Store here to illustrate her problem.
Usually, she shops around at different pharmacies in her hometown, and she had already bought her drugs for the month. But to accommodate the vice president's presidential campaign, she and her son drove 40 miles from her home in Ansonia to East Hartford, and she re-enacted her purchases at Pelton's, a quaint family pharmacy.
Still, the drug store filled a dozen orange prescription bottles with pills, rang them up at the cash register and declared to the assembled cameras that her total came to $506.34, more than her monthly Social Security check of $496.
The event was part of a coordinated effort with the White House to demonstrate their concern that drug prices are soaring out of control and that they are more attentive than the Republicans to the real-life needs of the elderly.
Mr. Gore said only that Mrs. Kindle was helping him to illustrate a larger problem and that "as a courtesy" she had "aggregated" her purchase at Pelton's.
In any case, Mrs. Kindle said she did not mind being a prop in the campaign, even after several calls from Gore aides who were fretting that she might be overcome with "stage fright."
She is registered as an independent. But as she and her son sat in a hallway outside the vice president's holding room at a center for the elderly, she said she decided then and there that she would vote for him.
"The Democrats usually handle the issues that I believe better pertain to the average citizen," she said.
Her son, Joe, 31, who had taken time off from his job as an apprentice optician to accompany his mother, said that he was a registered Republican but that Mr. Gore had won him over, too. "It's amazing how he's taken an interest," he said. "This is something that's important to me because it's important to my family. He definitely has my vote."
Mr. Gore used the event to promote his proposal for offering the elderly a prescription drug benefit through Medicare, costing $200 billion over 10 years. He also took a jab at the drug industry, calling it "out of control."
"They're going to the point where the margins are way out of line with what most other industries and most other lines of business believe is normal and adequate," he said, "and they're using the market power to dictate prices that are way above what the competition would set them at."
This month's Fortune magazine reports that the pharmaceutical industry has yielded the highest profits of the nation's top 40 industries. But it also notes that the industry's stock prices are off considerably, and that this has been the source of considerable concern at the drug companies -- that any Medicare plan to offer a prescription drug benefit would ultimately constrain drug prices and cut into profits. The drug industry worries that whatever it might gain in new consumers who buy drugs because they are covered under a government plan, it would lose in profits because the government would pay less than the prices the companies charge now.
At the White House today, President Clinton issued a study saying that prices of the drugs most widely used by older Americans had increased more than consumer prices in general. The study, by Families USA, a consumer group, said prices of the 50 top-selling drugs used by the elderly rose at nearly twice the overall rate of inflation from January 1999 to January 2000.
Mr. Clinton said a proposal outlined recently by House Republicans did not go far enough. He said it would "do nothing" for those with annual incomes below $50,000.
Mrs. Kindle and her husband, Joseph, 70, a retired painter with a union pension, earn less than half of that amount.
"We created Medicare in the first place because we knew it was wrong for our parents' basic health to be decided by their wealth," Mr. Gore said.
His plan would allow those ages 55 to 65 who have no health insurance to buy into Medicare, providing free coverage for low-income recipients and some benefits for those who would pay $44 per month.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival, contends that the Gore plan would force families into a bureaucratic government program. Mr. Bush instead offers low-income families a refundable tax credit to buy private health insurance.

Amgen Wins Early Ruling In a Drug Patent Dispute
A federal judge in Boston ruled that two companies, Transkaryotic Therapies and Aventis, had infringed on an Amgen patent covering its leading drug, an anemia treatment for patients undergoing kidney dialysis or chemotherapy for cancer.
The ruling, at a pretrial hearing, was an early victory for Amgen, but analysts differed on how significant it was because the trial will proceed, with Aventis and Transkaryotic having a chance to prove that Amgen's patents are invalid. Shares of Amgen jumped $2.9375, to $57.25. Transkaryotic fell $4.125, or 17 percent, to $28. Page C6.

Most States Back Microsoft Split
A majority of the 19 states that have sued Microsoft in the antitrust case plan to back the government's proposal to break the software giant into two companies. But several states plan to file minority opinions -- something the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, has said he does not want. Some of the states may still be persuaded to join the majority.

The Energy Department's plan to hire a British company to solidify liquid radioactive waste that has been leaking from storage tanks in Washington State stumbled when the energy secretary said an increase in the company's price estimate was unacceptable. C4.
 
Orders for Durable Goods Up 2.6%
Orders for big-ticket durable goods bounced back in March, rising 2.6 percent, after two consecutive months of declines, the government said. The number was helped by a substantial rebound in transportation orders after Boeing reached a contract agreement with 17,000 striking engineers. C27.

Working to discard decades of isolation after independence from Britain in 1966, Guyana's economy has slowly become more capitalistic, and people like Gerald Gouveia, the owner of Roraima Airways, are leading the way. Mr. Gouveia is one of the more outspoken executives in Guyana, the only English-speaking nation in South America. C4.
 
Amazon Loss Widens as Sales Grow
Amazon.com said that it lost $308 million in the first quarter, five times its loss a year earlier, but that its sales rose 95 percent, beating forecasts. Excluding the cost of stock options, merger costs and some other items, Amazon lost $122 million, or 35 cents a share, which was a penny less than expected. C2.
 
Viacom Posts 69% Rise in Earnings
Viacom, owner of the MTV cable channel and the Blockbuster video chain, said that its first-quarter profit increased 69 percent and that the Justice Department had given approval to the proposed acquisition of CBS. C11.

HEADLINE: 67.1% of Americans Own Their Homes, a Record High Level

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The percentage of Americans who own their homes rose to a record 67.1 percent in the first three months of the year, as ownership among blacks and inner-city residents also climbed to all-time highs, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Homeownership among blacks rose to 47.8 percent, from 47.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the department said. Ownership in the nation's central cities increased to 51.2 percent, from 50.9 percent. The nation's overall homeownership rate in the fourth quarter of 1999 was 66.9 percent. 
 In March, sales of previously owned houses rose 1.5 percent, to an average annual rate of 4.83 million. And sales of new homes in February were higher than expected, at an annual rate of 919,000 for the month.
Mortgage interest rates on fixed loans have declined from a mid-February peak, according to Freddie Mac, the No. 2 buyer of home loans. The contract rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 8.12 percent last week, down from 8.38 percent in the week ended Feb. 19.
The report said 45.7 percent of Hispanics owned their homes during the first quarter of this year. Still, minority and inner-city ownership rates lag behind those of whites, H.U.D. said. In the first quarter, 73.4 percent of whites were homeowners.

HEADLINE: THE ELIAN GONZALEZ CASE: COUNTING THE COST;
Castro Emerges as Conflict's Clear Winner

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 26

 BODY:
At the corner of Flagler Street and 22nd Avenue, a procession of cars filled with teenagers, salsa music blaring, crawled slowly across the intersection with Cuban flags fluttering from radio antennas and a big American flag flying upside down, in scorn.
In Little Havana, in the days since Elian Gonzalez was taken from his Miami relatives' home in a blur of tear gas and armed federal agents, upside-down flags and disdain for the United States are fashionable. 
 As a city, "we are more divided than we have ever been," said Max Castro, the senior research associate at the Dante B. Fascell North-South Center at the University of Miami, and an expert on the exile community.
Almost everyone involved in the case lost something in the five-month standoff and the three-minute raid on his relatives' home, say legal, immigration and political experts, including his Miami family, the exiles who made Elian a symbol of freedom, the two mayors who sided with the exiles over the government, and -- because of the nature of the raid -- the government itself.
And the clear winner, said the experts, is the man exiles here see as the devil himself. "Fidel Castro has taken great advantage," said Osmel Lugo, a political dissident jailed in Cuba until 1999.
It is not that Mr. Castro did very much to profit from the case. Others, even those who hate him most, did his work for him, said experts on Cuba and the exile community.
The exiles and the family that could not bear to give up the child, no matter how well-intentioned their refusal, gave Mr. Castro material to prop up his sagging revolution and have turned American support from their cause.
And Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Mayor Joseph Carollo of Miami, though they may have heartened many of their constituents by siding with the exile community against the government, stumbled on the national stage.
"The clear losers are the hard-liners in the Cuban exile community who conducted themselves in such a way as to antagonize and alienate U.S. public opinion," said Wayne Smith, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington who served as a diplomat in Cuba.
"They seemed to believe they could take the law into their own hands, defy the law, defy the federal government, and get away with it."
Few people doubt, political and immigration experts said, that Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and the boy's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez both loved Elian and were heartbroken when he was taken. But, even if a last-minute compromise was close, as the Miami family and others said, the family clearly had little credibility with a frustrated Attorney General Janet Reno.
"Lazaro Gonzalez said a number of times they would have to take the boy by force," Mr. Smith said. "Well, they did. I think U.S. public opinion was turned off by them."
Despite criticism that the government used excessive force in the raid, Americans have overwhelmingly approved of it in poll after poll.
A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll released on Monday showed that 60 percent of respondents approved, and 62 percent believed that the Miami relatives would not have turned the boy over peacefully if the agents had not been armed.
Only 28 percent of respondents said that Congress should hold hearings on the raid, and only 25 percent said they believed that Elian should remain in the United States.
Mr. Penelas and Mr. Carollo had, before and after, harshly criticized efforts to remove the boy, refused to let their police help in the effort and made speeches that left no doubt they would not cooperate with the government, drawing condemnations from around the country.
So, in a startling snub, federal officials did not alert them to the raid, apparently because those officials felt they could not trust them. For the top elected officials in an American city to be so ignored is unusual, said political experts.
"The government just went around them," said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University.
If the two mayors plan to seek office only in South Florida, where Cuban-Americans remain the dominant cultural, political and economic force, they probably did not hurt themselves, political experts agree.
Mr. Carollo, in a city dominated by Cuban-Americans, "solidified his position," said Dario Moreno, an associate professor of political science at Florida International University.
But, said political experts, television images of smoking tires and trash bins burning in the streets and the police scuffling with violent demonstrators may halt any larger political ambitions at the Miami-Dade County line for both mayors.
Mr. Penelas, the young mayor of Miami-Dade County, had seemed destined for a political career beyond Miami, but was condemned by dozens of editorial pages around the nation, and by whites, blacks and other Hispanics in his own county. "He hurt his political career," Mr. Moreno said, though he added that it was too soon to write the mayor's political obituary.
Both mayors have said over and over they did what was right, what the majority of constituents wanted. But in doing so they ignored almost everyone except Cuban-Americans.
"Some people really became invested in Elian remaining here," Mr. Castro, the researcher, said. "Other people felt alienated, felt the city was being taken over by one case."
The long-standing power in the Cuban exile community, the Cuban American National Foundation, and its chairman, Jorge Mas Santos, tried but failed to broker a deal for a more peaceful transfer of Elian.
And, the foundation had a less visible presence at street level than the much less powerful Movimiento Democracia, led by Ramon Saul Sanchez. Mr. Sanchez was slammed in the head by a rifle butt in the raid.
"At this point it means that they, the hard-liners, do not have the monopoly on Cuban policy, do not have the influence they had," said Mauricio Font, director of the Cuba Project at the Graduate Center of City University of New York. But Mr. Mas Santos said the Elian case helped the exile's fight, because "people now have a better understanding about what life is like in Cuba. Fidel's tyranny had been exposed."
Gov. Jeb Bush, who insisted that family court should settle the issue, had no real presence in the case and should not be affected much by it one way or another. Political experts said Mr. Bush, a Republican, was supportive of exiles but was not bloodied because he was never a real factor in how the drama played out.
But votes, power and public opinion aside, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, seems to have won the ultimate battle, for the child.
The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit is expected to rule on May 11 on the Miami relatives' appeal of a lower court ruling that Elian, at 6, is too young to ask for a political asylum hearing.
Experts on immigration law and child psychology say that, with a 6-year-old boy, whoever exercises influence over him will ultimately win the custody battle, which is really what the asylum hearing is about.
"The power of persuasion is now in the hands of the father," said Pamela Falk, a professor of immigration law at the City University of New York. That, Professor Falk said, was why the government had to act so drastically to remove Elian from the Miami family.
The Miami family lost a child. Elian's father was without his son for five months. And Elian endured a nightmare when armed agents took him from the home and into the chaos of the street outside.
Fidel Castro, in a time when he needed a shot of power, has it now.
"Every three or four months, Fidel has a speech and talks about the same thing," Mr. Lugo said.
Elian's story has given him a passionate topic that appeals to the nationalism of the Cuban people.
He will talk about it, experts on Cuba said, forever.

HEADLINE: Clearest Picture of Infant Universe Sees It All and Questions It, Too

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
Scientists yesterday released the clearest pictures yet taken of the infant universe, before stars and galaxies had formed and when space was filled with hot turbulent gases. The images confirm one major prediction of the leading theory of the explosive birth of the universe, but they failed to reveal another crucial feature that scientists had hoped would buttress that theory.
It is uncertain how sharp a revision, if any, will be needed to account for the new evidence. 
 The images -- actually imprints of sound waves that cause ripples in the cosmos' temperature -- were collected using a balloon-borne telescope named Boomerang by a multinational collaboration led by Dr. Andrew Lange of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome.
The images, released at a NASA briefing yesterday, are being published today in the journal Nature.
"They're essentially snapshots of the universe when it was 300,000 years old," said Dr. Wayne Hu, a cosmologist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who wrote a separate commentary on the results in Nature.
In trying to understand how the universe came about in what they believe was a giant explosion, called the Big Bang, some 13 billion years ago, scientists focus on ripples, or variations, in the temperature of the primordial gas. These can be used as a measuring stick to gauge the large-scale geometry and overall contents of the universe.
The size of the ripples observed by the Boomerang experiment indicates that the universe contains just the right amount of matter and energy to make space "flat," meaning that parallel rays of light never cross or diverge, just as predicted by the reigning "inflation" theory of how the Big Bang started. A preliminary analysis by Boomerang and other experiments first revealed that flatness last fall.
To the untrained eye, the images in question resemble little more than ill-defined blotches. And in fact, the very notion of measuring ripples from the Big Bang or determining whether space is curved or flat is likely to baffle most lay people. But for cosmologists, the measurements provide an unparalleled opportunity to test their theories, which are built largely upon abstract mathematical models, against something they can actually detect in the real world.
"Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the earliest moments of creation, passed its first, very important test," said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago.
A number of cosmologists were surprised by what the new images were expected to reveal but did not: fainter ripples of smaller size on the sky.
Just as an organ pipe resonates with its main note and higher harmonics, the early universe should have contained the smaller ripples, according to inflationary theory. Scientists had regarded Boomerang as the first experiment that could see the smaller ripples, but it did not produce clear evidence of them.
The mixed results have turned the images into a sort of cosmic Rorschach test, with some scientists seeing confirmation of existing theories, and others seeing the first dark hints that those theories are -- if not entirely wrong -- at least in need of serious revision.
"Whatever you do, you're going to have to kill one of the holy cows of cosmology, throw away one thing that people believe a lot in," said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Lange cautioned that the team was presenting only 5 percent to 10 percent of its data in the Nature paper and that the theoretical implications were still subject to revision. But cosmologists said that if the higher harmonics did not eventually emerge clearly from the data, all bets would be off.
"That, I think, would require a radical revision of cosmology as we know it," said Dr. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton University.
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, the gravity of all matter and energy in the universe can warp space and bend light rays. Generally speaking, this means that initially parallel light rays eventually cross or diverge. Only in a "flat" universe, containing a precisely defined amount of matter and energy, do the rays remain parallel.
That precise amount is predicted by inflation, a theory first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Inflation predicts that during the Big Bang a tiny mote of space became drastically stretched by fields of energy that are predicted by advanced theories of particle physics. Minute fluctuations in the amount of energy in different places would eventually have generated sound waves, or ripples, in the primordial gases.
Radiation, or light, emitted from those gases in the early universe arrives billions of years later at Earth still retaining the imprint of the sound waves. These imprints can be compared to theoretical calculations of the early universe.
Their apparent sizes on the sky give a measure of whether the radiation from them traveled to Earth on straight or curved lines, giving a gauge of cosmic geometry, as if an optician was trying to estimate the power of a lens by measuring the size of newsprint seen through it.
Because the Boomerang experiment saw the most pronounced ripples at about 1 degree on the sky, as expected for a flat universe, "this is looking like a big triumph for inflation," Dr. Tegmark said.
But Boomerang was also designed to look for some of the more subtle predictions of the theory. To study the cosmic radiation, the experiment used 16 ultracold detectors that look like tiny spider webs, said Brendan Crill, a collaborator at Caltech.
The detectors were placed in an instrument package and carried to 120,000 feet, high above the warm glow of most of Earth's atmosphere, by a balloon during a 10-and-a-half-day flight in Antarctica beginning in late December 1998. The radiation fell on the detectors, which heated up and cooled down by fractions of a degree as they were directed toward warmer and cooler parts of the cosmic ripples.
"It's kind of like holding the back of your hand into the sun," Mr. Crill said. "You can detect the light by feeling your hand warm up."
Each of the 16 detectors made 54 million separate measurements during the flight, said Dr. de Bernardis, a principal investigator of the experiment at La Sapienza, the main campus of the University of Rome.
Yesterday's briefing presented a fraction of the data that has so far been subjected to the analysis required for precise conclusions, according to Dr. Richard Bond, a Boomerang collaborator at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Toronto.
"The buzz on the street is going to be that there is no second 'Doppler peak,' " as the harmonics are known, Dr. Bond said. But with more data to be analyzed, he said, it was too soon to say whether there was a discrepancy with inflation.
If the peaks fail to appear, however, cosmologists said that revisions to the theory ranging from mild to radical might be necessary.
One solution, the scientists said, would be to adjust what seem well-established ratios in the universe of ordinary matter, dark or unseen matter, and a kind of static energy permeating space called the cosmological constant. Such adjustments would mean other astronomical observations are somehow wrong.
Or, Dr. Paul Steinhardt of Princeton said, the energy could be something else entirely: a bizarre, flowing substance called quintessence.
Still another possibility would be that inflation did not produce structures in the early universe after all. Dr. Spergel said he still considered that possibility a longshot. But he said most cosmologists expected the Boomerang measurement "would fit bang-on the standard model. But it didn't. This will make things interesting."
Dr. Turner of the University of Chicago said that "this could be the thread that unravels the whole tapestry." He added, "That's not where I'm betting."

HEADLINE: A New Campaign Approach for Mrs. Clinton: The Town Meeting

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: AMHERST, N.Y., April 26

 BODY:
Answering questions on topics ranging from economic growth and agriculture to health care and the fate of Elian Gonzalez, Hillary Rodham Clinton held the first of a series of town hall meetings tonight that her aides said would be a new way of bringing her campaign directly to New Yorkers.
Appearing relaxed, with her hands frequently clasped in front of her, Mrs. Clinton stood to respond to questions from an audience of 350 students, faculty members and residents at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The first hour was broadcast live on CNN, but she continued to take questions for 40 more minutes. 
 For the most part, she offered responses that have become part of the stock of her campaign appearances. At the outset, for example, Mrs. Clinton faced the question that has been frequently raised, when Wolf Blitzer, the program's moderator, asked her to respond to criticisms that she was a carpetbagger.
"For more than 30 years, I've worked on issues concerning children and families," Mrs. Clinton said. "Those are the concerns of my lifetime. As I've visited with thousands of New Yorkers, those are their concerns. To me, it's a commitment to continue a life's work."
She also said that, if she won the Senate race, she would not run for president in 2004 and that, if she lost, she would continue to make New York her home. Some conservative groups and her Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, have said that Mrs. Clinton is using the Senate campaign as a stepping stone to be president.
"I am going to serve my six-year term as senator," she said. "I owe it to the people of New York. I want to help make things happen in the state. That's what motivates me."
In many instances during questioning, Mrs. Clinton was able to showcase her growing knowledge of the state's characteristics, rattling off, for example, the names of highways or companies in western New York.
She repeated her proposal to make the cost of college tuition tax-deductible up to $10,000 and reiterated her support for creating a national program that would offer scholarships for students who agreed to teach upon graduation in schools facing a shortage of teachers.
Asked whether her views had changed from her first years in the White House, when she championed a health care plan that critics called nationalized medicine, she said she had learned from those days, "and I'm now from the school of smaller steps."
She then listed several measures she favored, including prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients and having more children and more of the underinsured covered by health care plans.
Mrs. Clinton reiterated her support for abortion rights, but also said she could support legislation backed by President Clinton that would outlaw a procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion, except in cases where the woman's health or life was at stake. She said that Congressional Republicans have refused to let that legislation come up for a vote.
She also reiterated her support for Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to use armed law enforcement officers to enter the home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives. Mrs. Clinton said, "I think everyone would agree that it was unfortunate that that kind of activity had to take place." But then she added, "I understand the concern and the frustration of the Justice Department when faced with continuing recalcitrance."
Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly criticized the Clinton administration this week for its handling of the situation, calling the agents who took the boy last Saturday "storm troopers."
Even before the meeting began, Mr. Giuliani's aides were attacking it, asserting that the crowd and questions had been fixed to spare Mrs. Clinton from any difficult moments, pointing to an article in The Buffalo News that suggested the event had been carefully controlled. "Her whole campaign is so heavily scripted and staged that Mrs. Clinton's handlers must be confident that tonight's event is safe," said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager.
But Mr. Blitzer said in an interview before the show that Mrs. Clinton had not requested, and CNN would not have permitted her to have, any control over what questions would be asked or who would be admitted to the hall.
Mr. Blitzer said that CNN reviewed questions from audience members only to ensure variety and to avoid repetition, and screened the audience to make certain that it included only registered voters who lived in New York.
"Mrs. Clinton has no ideas what the questions are," Mr. Blitzer said. "She has had no role in this whatsoever."

HEADLINE: The Cost of Medical Innovation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Drug Makers Reap Profits on Tax-Backed Research" (front page, April 23), which focused on the Pharmacia Corporation, said that "there are other, unseen, partners in the creation of Xalatan: the American taxpayers," who supported research on this glaucoma drug with $4 million from the National Institutes of Health but "have reaped no financial return on their investment." 
 In the marketplace, companies place research and development bets every day, losing most and winning the few that presumably improve the quality of life for many of us. Why not apply this logic to the national institutes' allotments for university research?
When profits are clearly exorbitant, as they are for Xalatan, the N.I.H. could be reimbursed by the company, at inflation-adjusted rates. Those taxpayer dollars could then be recycled for other worthy recipients.

HEADLINE: Hopes Are Raised, Then Dashed, Over Stalemate at Port Authority

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
It looked yesterday as if the yearlong impasse that has hobbled the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey might finally ease a bit, as board members from the two states gathered for their monthly meeting. Thick ring binders of agenda items were placed around the table, and privately, agency officials had said that the annual budget -- already four months late -- would come up for a vote.
But while the commissioners huddled in a closed session before the meeting, agency staff members swept into the room and began frantically removing items from the binders. After starting 40 minutes late, the board met for 10 minutes, approved only minor items and then bolted as a group from the room without explanation. 
 Later, New Jersey representatives said that their New York counterparts had reneged on an agreement to pass a budget, while New York officials disputed that there ever was any such agreement.
Regardless of which version is correct, the day's events at the agency's headquarters in the World Trade Center left bitterness among board members and aides to the two states' governors. And those developments may have raised new hurdles to ending the impasse over the allocation of agency money. The stalemate has blocked agreement on a number of major initiatives that both sides privately agree are crucial to the port system and the region's economic development.
Reacting to the abbreviated meeting, Rick Mroz, counsel to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, said that aides to Gov. George E. Pataki who serve on the board had engaged in "bizarre behavior" and had caused a meltdown in the negotiations that were intended to end the impasse.
Charles A. Gargano, Pataki's appointee as vice chairman of the Port Authority board and the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, countered that that there had been no budget deal and that Mr. Mroz's indignation amounted to a smoke screen for New Jersey's "unconscionable" refusal over the last year to approve projects favored by New York.
The Port Authority board has not approved any major projects since last June. At the heart of the dispute is New York's contention that New Jersey will get much more than its fair share of Port Authority resources if the agency approves a 30-year lease to the Maersk Sealand shipping line. The lease is meant to ensure that the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey remains the major Northeast cargo port.
New Jersey representatives have countered by refusing to allow votes on projects New York badly wants: efforts to sell or lease the World Trade Center and lease air rights for development atop the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown.
The board's failure to approve a spending plan for this year does not completely hobble the port agency, the chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, said. A resolution adopted last year when the board approved its $3.1 billion budget for 1999 authorized the executive director, Robert E. Boyle, to continue contractual commitments and spend money on continuing operations. Major projects like the port lease and the privatization of the World Trade Center do not figure in the annual budget and must be approved separately by the commissioners.
Mr. Eisenberg. who was appointed by Governor Whitman, said: "Still, I was disappointed that we were not able to move the budget forward yesterday. But I also believe that there is positive dialogue that is continuing that will bring this to a successful conclusion."
Nevertheless, former governors of the two states have lamented the impasse and called it an embarrassment to the region and the port agency, which in its 79-year history had developed a reputation for efficiency and rising above politics and provincialism. As recently as a week ago, Democratic Senators Daniel P. Moynihan of New York and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey wrote to both governors, voicing their concerns about the long-term effects of the standoff.
They warned that "this rancorous and unproductive" period in the agency's life threatened to make the regional port "an unattractive place to do business."
Mr. Gargano, Mr. Pataki's appointee, denied New Jersey's claim that New York board members had no objections to the budget when the meeting agenda was being set earlier in the week.
He said New York members wanted to look at a five-year capital spending plan for the agency and get a sense of the balance in spending between the two states over time. There was no such balance, he said, in the proposed one-year budget that has been pending before the board.
"For this year there is a lot more spending in New Jersey than in New York," he said, "and a lot less income from New Jersey than from New York. We didn't reject the budget out of hand. We just wanted to see a five-year spread."
While agency officials insist that all of their spending benefits both states, a Port Authority study of spending since the agency was created in 1921 showed that 45 percent went to projects within New York and were seemingly more beneficial to it while 27 percent was spent in New Jersey. The remainder was spent on projects that the study deemed of regional benefit.
Mr. Gargano and other New York representatives dispute this accounting.
Mr. Mroz, Governor Whitman's aide, said that New Jersey was also willing to examine longer-term spending, but he said he was suspicious of the New Yorkers' motives, given their actions over the last five months of the impasse, including holding up votes of most actions and even boycotting a board meeting.
"This has been the classic M.O. of the New York commissioners, and it has continued to befuddle us on what will settle the impasse, short of giving New York a windfall from agency revenues for no reason," he said. "It is bizarre and it is no way to do business."

 BODY:

ASIA
 
CHINA: NO PAROLE FOR RESEARCHER -- The Chinese government rejected a request for medical parole for a Chinese-born Stanford University researcher who has been jailed in Beijing since 1998 on charges of revealing military secrets, a Hong Kong human rights group said. Hua Di, a former Chinese weapons scientist who is serving 15 years, has a rare form of breast cancer that strikes men. A Beijing Court recently ordered that Mr. Hua be retried, saying that his conviction was based on "unclear facts." Elisabeth Rosenthal (NYT) 

VIETNAM: CRITICISM FOR McCAIN -- A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Phan Thuy Thanh, called remarks by Senator John McCain regarding his war-time imprisonment in Hanoi "a sheer distortion of the facts that deeply hurt the feelings of the Vietnamese people." Mr. McCain toured the so-called Hanoi Hilton, where he was held for five and a half years, with his 13-year-old son on Wednesday, and said that he still bore his guards "ill will" for killing some American prisoners there. (Reuters) --
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: AUTO AMNESTY -- Congress passed a bill allowing owners of some two million American-registered cars brought illegally into Mexico to register them in Mexico, for a fee. The bill awaits Senate consideration. President Ernesto Zedillo criticized lawmakers who voted for the law as pandering to owners of illegal vehicles two months before general elections. But his government recently decreed a similar measure legalizing American-registered pickup trucks, most owned by governing-party supporters. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
PERU: POSSIBLE BERENSON REVIEW -- Without promising to release her from prison, the opposition presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo held open the possibility of a legal appeal for Lori Berenson, the American convicted four years ago of helping the Tupac Amaru guerrillas. In New York, Mr. Toledo said that under judicial reforms he favors, Ms. Berenson's lawyers would be allowed to present evidence that she was judged unfairly. Ms. Berenson's parents say she was convicted in a sham proceeding. Anthony DePalma (NYT)
 
CANADA: CONTEST TO LEAD RIGHTIST PARTY WIDENS -- Tom Long, a conservative strategist from Ontario, Canada's most populous province, joined the race for the leadership of the new opposition conservative party, the Canadian Alliance. Mr. Long promised to cut taxes as part of a campaign to reverse Canada's brain drain to the United States. The first round of balloting for party members is June 24. James Brooke (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: PHOTOGRAPHER HELD -- An Associated Press photographer was arrested after the police said he matched the description of a person seen leaving the scene of a firebombing at the country's only independent daily newspaper. His lawyer said the photographer heard the blast, went to investigate and then went to get his cameras. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: WITHDRAWAL COSTS -- Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon and redeployment along its northern border will cost about $250 million, a senior Israeli official said. That does not include the cost of relocating and compensating officers of the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army, said Amos Yaron, director general of the Defense Ministry. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL NEXT WEEK -- A court set May 3 as the opening date for the trial of two Libyans accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Prosecutors had asked for more time to study new plans presented by the defense, but the judges refused, noting that the trial was postponed twice before. The Libyans will be tried under Scottish law in the Dutch city of Zeist.
 Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: TALKS ON HOME RULE -- The Prime Ministers of Britain and Ireland, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, will meet next week in London with Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant political leaders in what a 10 Downing Street spokesman called an "intensification" of the effort to gain agreement on restoring home-rule government to Belfast. Britain suspended the power-sharing assembly in February, blaming the Irish Republican Army's failure to begin disarming.
 Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: HESELTINE BOWS OUT -- Michael Heseltine, 67, the high-profile Conservative politician who served as deputy prime minister under John Major from 1995 to 1997 but never fulfilled his fierce ambition for the premiership itself, will not run for re-election next year after 35 years in Parliament. Known as Tarzan for his flowing hair and robust oratory, Mr. Heseltine led the 1990 Tory revolt that toppled Margaret Thatcher but then failed in his bid to succeed her. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
TURKEY: REFORMIST CANDIDATE HOLDS LEAD -- The reformist presidential candidate favored by political party leaders, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, finished far ahead of other candidates in the first ballot in Parliament, but fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority. He is still considered likely to be chosen. A second ballot is scheduled for Monday. Stephen Kinzer (NYT)
 
ITALY: GEARING FOR KEY VOTE -- Prime Minister-designate Giuliano Amato stressed economic growth in a speech before Parliament in anticipation of today's confidence vote. He did not mention the environment, a sensitive topic since one Green leader, former Environment Minister Edo Ronchi, declined on Wednesday to enter Mr. Amato's shuffled cabinet after the environment post was awarded to another party. Approval of Mr. Amato's government hangs on a few votes. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

HEADLINE: When Will Stocks Really Crumble? After the Dollar Does

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE money managers panicked. The people bought.
That is the real story of the wild month that ends today. After the worst week in Nasdaq history ended two weeks ago, Wall Street braced for a wave of selling that did not arrive. Instead, there was a rebound. 
 That has happened time and again in recent years. Just as market fundamentalists take heart from the collapse of highflying stocks and proclaim that value now matters, the fall ends. The bears are vanquished.
If that pattern is repeating -- as I believe it is -- the most interesting question for investors is how they will be able to tell if the next plunge, whenever it comes, is the real thing or just another buying opportunity.
The answer is: Check the dollar and the economy. One or both of them are likely to get into trouble before the stock market suffers a prolonged downturn.
Why? Because professional money managers really don't matter much in the current environment. They can move money from stock to stock, but they cannot stay out of stocks for very long. The pressures to be fully invested are too great. The managers may fear the Federal Reserve, which is more likely than ever to raise interest rates after the report yesterday that consumer spending is rising at the fastest rate since 1983. But their customers are not worried. The Nasdaq market fell yesterday morning because professional investors feared rising interest rates. But the amateurs were buying, and soon prices were up nicely.
American investors are certain that stocks are the best long-term investment. That lesson, learned over many years, will not soon be unlearned.
A recession would operate on many investors as margin calls operated on some during the Nasdaq swoon this month; it would force selling by people who needed to raise cash. The selling would be slow and prolonged, bringing a gradual market erosion rather than a crash. The stock market would follow the economy down.
The other group of investors worth watching is foreigners, particularly Europeans. If they were not eager to invest in this country, the huge trade deficits caused by all that consumer spending would have led to a dollar crisis. If foreign investors turned negative, or even if they invested less than they are now, a falling dollar would provide a warning of stock weakness.
That is not happening now. Instead, it is the euro that is weak, despite Europe's strong current account surpluses. For a variety of reasons, few want to invest in Europe.
Europeans worried about their own currency have bought American stocks, thus pushing up our stock prices and supporting the dollar. Someday, perhaps when European investments begin to look more attractive -- or American ones less so -- the circle will reverse, and selling American stocks will damage the dollar, which will damage the stock market, and so on. The euro is likely to rally markedly at some point, to well above the current level.
In the long run, those who argue that technology stocks still reflect ridiculous optimism may be proved right. But most investors have not been scared off even as some Internet wonders have collapsed. The Nasdaq composite is down 17 percent for April, and its volatility -- measured as the standard deviation of daily percentage changes -- is the greatest in Nasdaq history, surpassing October 1987. But the Dow Jones industrial average is off less than 1 percent for the month, and Nasdaq is higher than it was in mid-December. Investor faith is still alive.

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 27

 BODY:
With the Nasdaq oscillating sharply this month, Latin America's two principal markets, the Bovespa of Brazil and the Bolsa of Mexico, have gone along for the ride.
Emerging markets have always been buffeted by instability in the United States as anxious investors pull out of what are considered high-risk positions elsewhere. But because Latin American markets have been dominated by brick-and-mortar companies, they have usually been linked to the Dow, not the technology-heavy Nasdaq. This new relationship has confounded investors, particularly now that the Brazilian and Mexican economies are booming. 
 Since the beginning of the Nasdaq swing, the Bovespa index has dropped to 15,440, after rising to a high of 19,046 in March. In Mexico, the Bolsa index has fallen to 6,844, from a high of 8,417, also in March. Some of the current downward pressure can be directly linked to the market in the United States.
"It was Nasdaq euphoria that fueled the markets in the fourth quarter," said David Chon, Latin America equity strategist for Bear, Stearns. "After running up significantly, some of the froth is now coming off of the telecom-media-technology sectors."
Indeed, the telecommunications sector, which makes up about 50 percent of the Bovespa, has led Brazil's downward trend. The shares of CRT Cellular, for example, which is controlled by Telefonica de Espana, fell from a high of 899 reais ($499.20) in March, to 609 reais at today's close. CRT is one of the cellular companies in Brazil that plans to start wireless Internet services by June.
"The telecom companies are all earning revenue from the Internet," said Julio Zeigelmann, director of equity funds at BankBoston Asset Management in Sao Paulo. "It makes sense that decreasing optimism in the Internet would affect us locally." In Mexico, Telefonos de Mexico has also taken a hit, closing today at 28.4 pesos (3.01), 22 percent below its 52-week high of 36.2 pesos on March 7.
But since technology is still a nascent industry in Latin America, most companies -- including telecommunications concerns, which are still trying to meet demand for regular fixed-line service -- are still squarely part of the traditional economy. That makes for a tenuous connection between Latin American stocks and the Nasdaq.
"This correlation doesn't have much logic," said Octavio de Barros, chief economist of BBV Argentaria in Sao Paulo. "When the market realizes that the Bovespa is not linked to the Nasdaq, we could have a rally."
Many companies in Latin America, and particularly in Brazil, are undervalued now that stock prices have fallen, with many trading below book value, according to many analysts. They say that the flight to quality that normally occurs during market turbulence should reverse once the value of Latin American stocks becomes widely known.
Quarterly reports released this week have also animated investors. On Tuesday, for example, the Mexican cement company Cemex announced that operating profit rose 22 percent in the first quarter compared with the 1999 quarter, beating analyst's expectations. The positive news follows impressive results announced last week by the Brazilian steel company CVRD, which increased profits 98 percent in the first quarter over the comparable period last year.
The earnings reports followed positive economic news coming out of Latin America. Since the Russian debt crisis in 1998 sent investors running from Latin America and forced Brazil to devalue its currency, the region has had a quick recovery. Latin America is expected to grow 3.7 percent this year, up from 0.2 percent last year, according to estimates from ING Barings.
Inflation has also shown some decline this year. The region should finish the year with inflation at 6 to 8 percent, compared with 8.8 percent last year. The International Monetary Fund recently revised its inflation target for Latin America this year to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent on strong economic activity coming out of the region.
Brazil's Congress also recently passed important legislation, the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which establishes austere spending and indebtedness limits for the local, state and federal governments. The Brazilian government has been battling large deficits for years, and indebtedness was a primary cause of investor uncertainty in the devaluation last year. The budget deficit now stands at 3.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product, but with the new law and the economic recovery, the government expects the deficit to fall to about 2 percent of G.D.P. in 2001.
In Mexico, investment activity, which has been strong this year because of ties to the United States through the North American Free Trade Agreement, is expected to slow before the presidential election scheduled on July 2.

Other Side of Tracks To Other Side of Net

BYLINE: By TOM SPOUSTA 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, April 26

 BODY:
Growing up in the projects of East Las Vegas, Claudia Meza wore black lipstick, flashed gang signs and concealed knives and brass knuckles in her baggy pants.
At age 12, she endured depression that led to a suicide attempt, which failed when her cousin walked into the bathroom. At 14, she was sent to live with a grandmother in a tough South Tucson neighborhood where she heard gunshots again, got into fewer fights but also picked up a tennis racket and, in five years earned a half-scholarship and national collegiate ranking at Grand Canyon University. 
 In June, the 5-foot-10-inch Meza will take her fearless attitude and aggressive strokes to the Rick Macci Tennis Academy in Pompano Beach, Fla., for a summer of instruction. She was invited sight unseen, discovered over the Internet in a flurry of e-mail messages between a caring high-school coach and a tennis academy searching for the next Venus or Serena Williams. "I take a deep breath every time I think about it," Meza said.
"I always believed in myself, even though I was a thug," she said recently after her last home match at Grand Canyon University. "I always felt I could be something. I just didn't know how or when it would happen."
The Macci Academy is trying to hone the skills that will make it happen someday for Meza on the international tour. "In this business, sometimes you've got to gamble," said Greg Russell, the director of coaches and technical development for the academy, which produced Jennifer Capriati. "You've just got to have a gut feeling, and seeing her background, we decided to help her. Whatever happens, happens. At least we gave her a chance."
Meza, a 20-year-old sophomore, recently cracked the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division II ranking, making her debut at No. 17 in the West. She hopes to improve on that at a tournament this weekend in Ojai, Calif.
"It's unbelievable," Meza said of her Macci invitation. "I'm still shocked, I guess, that they'd want to work with me. Tennis saved me. It gave me something to look forward to. I started a whole new life. It was a transformation, and it happened so fast."
Meza's choices had seemed to be jail or worse during a troubled home life. Her father, Amado, was in and out of jail for most of her childhood and spent little time with his family. Her mother, Maria, worked as a housekeeper at Caesars Palace to support Claudia and her younger sister, Crystal. Her mother found it increasingly difficult to control Claudia, whose problems eventually followed her home.
"They would come and break our windows and slash our tires," Maria Meza said of the gangs in an interview from Las Vegas last week. "They call and say, 'I'm going to kill your daughter, I'm going to kill you.' "
One night, a gang of about 25 young people chased Claudia to her house and stood outside yelling threats until the police arrived. Not long afterward, the family decided that Claudia should go to south Tucson.
"She had to go," Maria Meza said. "It was too much. So many fights. I was so scared. I thought she'd end up dead."
Claudia's new environment was not much different. Her grandmother, Guillerma Meza, lives near Irvington and South 12th Avenue, a flashpoint for violence in South Tucson. Early Easter morning, two separate shooting incidents within six blocks of her house left three people dead.
Guillerma's guidance, however, worked wonders on her granddaughter. Within one year, she got Claudia interested in attending church. She also thought modeling classes would help the girl's self-confidence. To help pay for those classes, Guillerma Meza traveled to Juarez, Mexico, to buy clothes in the open markets and sell them in Tucson for a profit.
"It broke my heart to see her like she was," Guillerma Meza said in Spanish over Easter brunch at her home. "I'm proud of her because we have had a struggle together. We fight hard, and I thank God for this."
Claudia, who was translating, stopped to wipe a tear from her eye, before her grandmother continued speaking.
"I can't believe how far she has gotten," Guillerma said. "I cry for joy, it's so unbelievable."
Across the table sat Stacy Haines, the tennis coach at Desert View High School, who first saw Meza's potential. Meza tried out for the team because a friend wanted her to. Rough as Meza was -- in her first high-school match, she threatened to beat up an opponent who was winning points on high, deep lobs -- Haines liked the athletic aggression she showed.
"I didn't have any strokes," Meza said. "I'd hit balls over the fence. I didn't know how to keep score or anything. I stereotyped it as a wimpy game.
"I never thought I'd do it."
On Haines, Meza said: "He was the first to actually believe in me and tell me I could do things. He made me feel worthwhile."
Haines eventually got Meza into the Tucson Racquet Club for instruction. "She didn't fit in, but she wouldn't quit," Haines said.
"Nobody in tennis has been nice to her," he added. "Part of it was probably racial, but it was also economic. Some of it was her feeling inferior, too, but she gradually got more confidence."
Meza recalled a conversation with a member on one of her first visits to the club.
"I walked by him, and he asked, 'Where are you from?' I said, 'South Tucson.' He said, 'What are you doing here?' I said, 'playing tennis.' He just said, 'Oh.' "
Haines has served as Meza's coach, defender, mentor and publicist. He initially contacted Gerry Roberts, the academy's former director of sports science and now a Macci consultant. Roberts passed the information about Meza to Russell, who sent the official invitation in March via an e-mail message.
"It's not her age, it's her motivation and how hard she works," Russell said, when asked whether Meza could overcome the late start and be successful on the tour. "The good thing about that is you don't have to teach an old dog new tricks.
"Kids who come here with an endless amount of money, and no matter what you do, you can't motivate them. Here's a kid with an unbelievable background, who's fought her way this far this fast and she really wants it. I love working with kids like that."
Meza, meanwhile, relishes the opportunity to break down stereotypes. "I have to make my people proud," she said. "There has to be somebody to step up and tell everybody they can do it."

HEADLINE: Reports Give Fed the Fodder for Higher Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The reports today that the economy is flirting with inflation were probably not enough on their own to lock the Federal Reserve into a more aggressive course of interest rate increases when it meets on May 16.
But the robust pace of growth in the first quarter and the clear warning signs of an acceleration in wage and price increases all but guarantee that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his colleagues at the central bank will seriously consider raising rates by half a percentage point rather than by the quarter-point that investors and economists have been anticipating. 
 Instead of fighting a phantom -- the theoretical possibility of a pickup in inflation -- the Fed can now point to specific if early evidence that the economy is overheating.
"The economic data make an overwhelming case for picking up the pace of tightening," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan.
Still, the Fed has tended not to change policy because of one or two economic reports. Mr. Greenspan did not mention the latest indicators in a speech today on the rural economy. But he has long preferred to change policy in gradual, consistent steps that are well telegraphed to the markets, a practice he has followed faithfully over the last 10 months in raising rates five times in quarter-point increments.
Because Mr. Greenspan has given no public indication that he is ready to raise rates in bigger steps, some analysts think the Fed is unlikely to opt for a half-point increase in May. The Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate stands at 6 percent.
Some Fed officials have also emphasized in recent months that small rate increases are the most prudent course at a time when there are so many unresolved questions about how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation.
Mr. Greenspan has expressed hope about improvements in productivity, the crucial factor in determining the economy's noninflationary speed limit. But he has also said that at some point even productivity cannot offset upward pressure on wages and prices.
"When you're in a fog, you take small steps," said Bill Cheney, an economist at John Hancock, the life insurance company. "One could argue strongly for a course of sticking to 25-basis-point increases." (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
Yet even if Mr. Greenspan sticks to his gradualist approach, he will confront pressure from other members of the central bank's policy- setting Federal Open Market Committee, some of whom have been pushing for half-point increases since February.
The minutes of the Feb. 1-2 meeting, when the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point, indicated that a few members were pressing then for an increase of 50 basis points "in order to provide greater assurance against a buildup of inflationary expectations and inflation" in subsequent months. Other members, the minutes said, acknowledged that more aggressive action might be needed if the economy continued to roar along, as it has.
The minutes of the meeting on March 21, when the Fed voted for another quarter-point increase, have not been made public.
It is unclear how many of the committee's 10 voting members would favor a half-point increase. But they are almost certain to include Jerry Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who is perhaps the most vociferous inflation hawk on the Fed. They are also likely to include Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor who has long warned that the current combination of 4.1 percent unemployment and strong growth cannot continue indefinitely without creating a cycle of rising wages and prices.
The uncertainties about the economy's capacity to grow without inflation have led to a monetary policy course that has been "somewhat more gradualist, in my view, somewhat less pre-emptive than it otherwise might have been," Mr. Meyer said in a speech several weeks ago. He added, pointedly, that "there are limits to monetary policy's tolerance for above-trend growth and for further labor market tightening."
Before making its decision, the Fed will have several more sets of economic data to consider, including a report on job creation and unemployment next Friday and the report on the Consumer Price Index, which will be released on the morning of the Fed meeting on May 16.
Another wild card for the central bank is the stock market. A stabilization or rebound in the market in coming weeks could add to pressure on the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. Should the market turn down again and stay down, it could help dampen consumer spending and overall demand, reducing inflation pressures.

HEADLINE: 300 People, 14 Dead, Found Stranded on Isle in Bahamas

BYLINE: By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
NASSAU, the Bahamas, April 27 -- Fourteen Haitians died and 264 others were stranded on an uninhabited island for an unknown period of time after their overloaded 50-foot boat broke down at sea about 200 miles southeast of here, United States Coast Guard officials said today.
Bahamian and American vessels participated in the rescue effort, which began on Wednesday evening after passengers on three sailboats passing nearby spotted hundreds of dehydrated and weak people on Flamingo Cay. They radioed Bahamian authorities, who in turn requested the help of the United States Coast Guard, which maintains ships and helicopters in the region for drug interdiction and rescue operations. 
 Dozens of the weakest Haitians were rushed by helicopter to the nearest clinic, about 70 miles away at Georgetown, Exuma, while the others were evacuated from the barren island late today aboard the Royal Bahamas Defence Force vessel the Bahamas.
Michael Minns, who owns a market and a small marina in Georgetown, was among the first to be notified about the emergency on the island, and helped coordinate the rescue efforts at the request of the Bahamas Air Sea Rescue Association. He said that throughout Wednesday night, he fielded anxious mayday calls from the sailors who discovered the people on the island.
The calls quickly became urgent when a doctor who had been aboard a passing boat stepped ashore to tend to them, whom he described as being in desperate condition. When the first 11 of the most seriously ill reached the one-doctor clinic at Georgetown, he thought they were headed for the morgue.
"Some of them were comatose," he said. "I thought they were dead. They had on very little clothing, some were in their underwear and they were covered with dust and dirt. None of them could walk. Most had trouble even holding their heads up."
Mr. Minns said the 11 recovered after being given intravenous fluids, but communication was difficult, he said, because they only spoke Creole. He said 11 others arrived later that night. Authorities are unsure how they became stranded, but they assume they were being smuggled to the United States.
"'We don't know whether the vessel sank or it just dropped them off," said Petty Officer Gibran Soto, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami. "There was no vessel nearby, and we don't know how long they were there."
Mr. Minns said he provided food and water from his store to be taken to the Haitians today. He said he had heard unconfirmed reports from some people involved in the rescue that the boat's engine had broken under the strain of its load, and that it might have drifted for as long as six days.
"The boat drifted to the shore and they were stuck," Mr. Minns said. "They were on a small, dry cay without much to protect them."
Because the Haitians were discovered in Bahamian territory, Bahamian authorities will have the responsibility of repatriating them to Haiti.
This is the largest such incident of intercepted or stranded immigrants, but it is hardly the first. Haitians have long come here to seek work in menial jobs in gardening, construction or housecleaning, fleeing the poverty and violence that has crippled their homeland for years. Others slip into the Bahamas looking for another smuggler to take them to the United States, paying a price that is dear, and sometimes deadly, for the privilege of packing themselves into rickety and creaky boats. In 1995, smugglers threw 100 Haitians overboard to lighten a boat headed for the Bahamas. All were believed to have drowned.
Political repression, violence and searing poverty have led Haitians to flee in great numbers. Last year the Coast Guard intercepted 480 Haitians trying to enter the United States, and 1,437 in 1998. The discovery of this latest group comes at a time when Haiti is confronting election-related violence as it prepares for next month's parliamentary elections, which have already been postponed several times.
Haitians are fearful that the violence, which has already claimed, among others, the life of a prominent radio commentator, will only increase as it heads towards presidential elections later this year. All the while, the nation has been at an economic and political standstill, with no legislature, almost no investment and even less foreign aid, and a devastated social and physical infrastructure.
Bahamian authorities told the Reuters news agency that several hundred Haitian immigrants were intercepted in Bahamian waters in recent weeks. Anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 Haitians live illegally in the Bahamas, a nation of 700 islands that is home to 280,000 people.
"We are being engulfed," a Royal Bahamas Defence Force senior commander, Raymond Farqhuarson, told Reuters.
Mr. Minns said that he receives distress calls from Bahamian seamen who discover stranded Haitian vessels about every six weeks.
"It's constant," he said. "Some vessel with a broken engine, lost in the water. They put a whole lot of people on board and not enough food and water. They have no navigation aids, or even a compass."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Dynamism, Put to Work for Livery Drivers

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
"DO people think I'm a media hound? Really?" Fernando A. Mateo asks, just shocked. "But it's all about good issues, right?"
Mr. Mateo has been popping up everywhere recently as president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, representing livery drivers, who, unlike their yellow-cab comrades, routinely work the poorer neighborhoods in the boroughs other than Manhattan. 
 On Monday night, the eighth driver this year was killed. Early Tuesday, Mr. Mateo began fielding calls from reporters, politicians, the police, drivers. He demanded investigations. Safety measures. On Wednesday, he moderated a panel of Latino and black leaders about inner-city crime. And organized yesterday's funeral procession.
As it happens, Mr. Mateo, 42, neither lives in the city nor drives a livery car. Dominican-born (in this lifetime; he believes in reincarnation), he is a 10th-grade dropout who became a millionaire, lives in the Westchester suburb of Irvington and has an assistant who often chauffeurs him.
With three businesses and a foundation, he hardly needs to be consoling yet another family in raw grief until 3 a.m., only to be awakened two hours later by reporters. Yet stoked by adrenaline, outrage and, yes, all that attention -- "it's like an addiction, you know?" -- Mr. Mateo, who, a few years ago, unveiled the mediagenic Toys for Guns exchange, has given the mostly immigrant drivers visibility.
As a consequence, the city pledged $5 million for safety partitions. Moreover, Mr. Mateo has negotiated an affordable health care plan for 8,000 members, who are largely self-employed.
And attention is again being paid to Mr. Mateo, a short, piston-powered, fast-fuse charmer whose son calls him Jackhammer.
On Tuesday, the day after the killing, he was furiously working two cell phones. He put V.I.P.'s on hold, told the major news organizations to call back in 10 minutes and the minor ones in 30. His businesses -- carpets, sidewalk restoration -- had to fend for themselves.
"Is Charlie there?" he said, calling Representative Charles B. Rangel's office. "Hello, Bob!" he said over the phone to Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney. Senator Charles E. Schumer returned his call and got blasted with Mr. Mateo's blunt entreaty for federal resources.
Mr. Mateo, more polished and political than he was years ago, when he was known in the downtown projects as the relentlessly hustling Freddie the Carpet Guy, still excels in sizing up his customer: "Senator! At the press conference I'll say I just spoke with you and that you're going to try to do something. You'll hear that everywhere, all over the news! Thank you, senator."
HUNDREDS of livery drivers gathered for the South Bronx news conference. Mr. Mateo spoke in English, then Spanish. As drivers chanted "Justicia! Justicia!" Mr. Mateo, in suit and tie, clambered atop a sawhorse, clung to a street pole and articulated their sorrowful anger. He revved them, he calmed them. His performance was dynamic, eloquent, canny.
The impulse to be center stage has always been with him. When he was 5, his mother sent him, the youngest of nine, to parochial boarding schools in New England while his father toiled in a city bodega. Lonely, he learned self-reliance and to propel himself forward.
The family's finances foundered, and he went to a public high school before dropping out to apprentice as a floor installer. At 17, he had a storefront on Avenue A and a wife. (He has three children and has been with his second wife, Stella, who runs his trench-building company, for 20 years.) By the 1980's, he had moved Carpet Fashions to two glass palace showrooms and had become a carpet installer to the stars.
In 1989, he felt his marker had come due: in the Dominican tradition of "la promesa," he had promised to give back if his business flourished. He taught floor installation to nonviolent inmates at Rikers and persuaded other tradespeople to do so. The program was respected; his profile was emerging.
During the recession, his own fortunes tumbled. Pushy, proud, hard-headed, he fought back in the 90's by diversifying his businesses.
A casual conversation with his son near Christmas in 1993 inspired the gun-swap program. It would vacuum 3,000 guns off New York streets and be widely imitated. Mr. Mateo -- Oprah! Peter Jennings! -- became a media hero.
When, in the natural course of events, he became old news, he slipped into depressed seclusion. Stella and the kids dragged him out, shouting, "Your family thinks you're important!"
Recently, he butted heads with politicians in the Dominican Republic over absentee ballots. That and his leadership of the livery drivers -- they approached him -- have raised his profile, especially among New York Latinos, some of whose officials view him with wary admiration. A Republican, he is coy about a future in politics.
"There's nothing I've wanted that I haven't gotten," Mr. Mateo said with an exuberant earnestness. "I always thought I'd meet the president. Clinton invited 2,000 people to the White House for the signing of his crime bill. I sat in the audience thinking, 'I should be up on that podium!' Then I saw empty chairs behind him.
"I'll never let an opportunity go by when I can seize it. So I said to the Secret Service, 'Excuse me, sir,' and I stepped up and stood next to Janet Reno. Afterwards I shook his hand and said, 'Mr. President, thank you for having me here!' "

Rate Increase Fails to Halt Euro's Slide Against Dollar

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 27

 BODY:
The European Central Bank raised interest rates today for the fourth time in six months but Europe's common currency, the euro, again defied its guardians and plunged to another record low against the American dollar.
The rate increase, from 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent, would normally tend to support the euro's value. But in a display of the gloom that now envelops the currency, the euro sank to less than 91 cents from 92.33 cents before closing in New York at 91.01 cents. 
 "The euro is now in uncharted waters, and you don't know how far it will go down," said Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.
Since its debut at the start of 1999, when it was worth $1.17, the euro's value against the dollar has slid about 21 percent.
Parity with the dollar, which once seemed to represent an unthinkable decline in the euro's value, now looks to many traders like an impossibly high target, at least for the next several months.
Until recently, the decline of the euro was more of a political embarrassment than an economic problem. Indeed, the weak euro has provided a major lift to European exporters by making their products cheap in terms of dollars and creating windfall currency profits from sales in dollars. But European officials have become increasingly concerned that the euro's weakness will fuel inflation here by raising the prices of imported goods.
The euro's plight has even begun to alarm some of its most ardent supporters. Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, has long contended that the new currency would be a powerful challenger to the world dominance of the dollar.
But this week, Mr. Walter argued that European central bankers should intervene if the euro's value slips meaningfully below 90 cents. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, he argued that European central bankers ought to sell their reserves of dollars, which now total about $250 billion.
"Why shouldn't they sell now?" Mr. Walter said. "It would simultaneously make an impression on international speculators and support the euro."
Adopted by 11 European countries at the start of 1999, the euro is on its way toward creating a single European economy as big as that of the United States. Though the countries will continue to have their own national currencies until 2002, their monetary policies are now locked together under the control of the European Central Bank.
But the euro has been anemic ever since its birth, and the problem has become more acute in the last several weeks. The German mark is worth about 46 American cents, its lowest level in 14 years.
The European Central Bank said its primary concern today was about inflation rather than exchange rates.
But inflation is closely linked to the weakness of the euro, which has started to drive up import prices.
Most economists and currency strategists had been expecting today's action, and most say that the central bank will raise rates at least once more in the months ahead.
Far more puzzling is why the euro continues to fall so sharply in value.
Economic growth in the 11-nation euro zone is expected to reach 3.4 percent this year, its fastest pace in years, and employment is climbing rapidly for the first time in a decade.
Inflation, meanwhile, is lower in Europe than in the United States. Investment and employment are both accelerating, and Europe has a big trade surplus while the United States has a mammoth trade deficit.
Yet the United States continues to grow faster. The United States Commerce Department reported today that the American gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter. Beyond statistics, the mystique associated with American technology has made the country a magnet for foreign direct investment.
Most economists had been forecasting that the euro would climb by the second half of 1999. Then they predicted it would appreciate in the first few months of this year.
Jesper Dannesboe, a currency strategist at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said part of the euro's most recent distress stems from the grievously optimistic views of many international fund managers.
Convinced last fall that the euro would recover after tumbling to $1.06 from $1.17, fund managers started buying euros and selling dollars.
But the United States and the dollar both defied expectations, as American growth accelerated rather than slowed, and direct investment continued to pour into the United States from around the world.
"By the end of the fourth quarter, international fund managers were massively overweight on the euros," Mr. Dannesboe said. The result is that investors are looking at any rise in the euro as a chance to sell their holdings, he added.
The difficulties were compounded earlier this month, after the Nasdaq market plunged.
Many investors viewed the turbulence in American stocks as a new reason for believing that European assets and the euro would become a safe haven. But that did not happen. When the euro barely budged against the dollar and then the Nasdaq market bounced back, the pressure to sell euros intensified further.
The entire life of the euro has left economists and currency traders bewildered. Ralf Schneider, an economist at Dresdner Bank, noted that the violent currency swings are hardly unprecedented.
Between 1980 and 1985, the dollar nearly doubled in value against the German mark -- the currency that continues to be at the heart of the euro. The mark went to $3.45 from about $1.70, largely because the American economy underwent a powerful growth spurt between 1983 and 1985. By 1988, the exchange rate moved back to about $1.70 a mark.
"This shows that growth differentials are very important," Mr. Schneider said. "My argument is that the euro has done better than the D-mark would have."

HEADLINE: Whitman Ends Plan to Shift 900 to Suburb From Trenton

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 27

 BODY:
Agreeing with critics who said the state was ignoring its own guidelines for so-called smart growth, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today abruptly canceled a plan to move more than 900 state revenue workers from the capital to a neighboring suburb, even after the government had spent $3 million on preliminary construction of a new office building.
Trenton, like many other medium-size New Jersey cities, has been largely bypassed by the boom in the state's economy, and the governor said today that her administration would consider locations in cities for state offices before making such decisions from now on. "Keeping state jobs in cities is our first priority," she said. "That's smart growth." 
 Mrs. Whitman's action came a day after Trenton officials said they had completed $54 million in financing for what would be the city's only hotel -- this has long been the only state capital without one -- including $5 million in a no-interest loan from the state.
The mayor of Trenton, Douglas H. Palmer, expressed mixed feelings about the governor's decision, saying he was pleased that state workers would remain in the city but concerned that a move to another location within Trenton might ultimately remove another property from the city's tax rolls.
"We have to work out some of the details, and look at potential sites that would make sense for the state and for the city," he said. "It's important that while we welcome jobs staying in Trenton, we also look at losing ratables. It's not a tradeoff I'd like to make."
Officials in Hamilton Township reacted angrily to the news, saying they had cooperated with the State Treasury Department for more than a year on the project, in which the Division of Revenue was to have closed three office buildings in Trenton and moved to a new $55 million complex it would have shared with the state police.
"We've devoted a lot of time, effort and hours in assisting the state in fast-tracking this project out of the belief that it would be good not only for the community but for the whole state," said Glen D. Gilmore, the mayor of Hamilton, who said he learned of Mrs. Whitman's decision from reporters. "The governor just wakes up one morning and pulls the rug out from under us."
Mr. Gilmore, a Democrat, added, "This project has wasted not only our resources but the state's."
But Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the governor, said that, although the site had been excavated and a gravel road had been built, no foundations had yet been laid. She said the $3 million spent so far might not be a complete loss, depending on what the state eventually decided to do with the site.
In recent weeks, the proposed move had galvanized environmental advocates and business executives. The president of the New Jersey Builders Association wrote in an op-ed article that it was hypocritical for the state to ignore its own planning guidelines while expecting developers to adhere to them.

THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE HELPS PARTY, TOO -- Less than 24 hours after criticizing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for headlining a Washington fund-raiser that brought in a record $21.3 million for the Republican Party, Vice President Al Gore held bookend fund-raising events yesterday in Pennsylvania, helping the Democratic National Committee raise more than $1.2 million. Over lunch in Pittsburgh and then dinner in Philadelphia, Mr. Gore boasted about the Clinton administration's economic record and accused Mr. Bush of advocating a "don't worry about tomorrow" plan of "risky" tax cuts. James Dao (NYT)
 
THE POLLS
 

BOREDOM SETS IN -- The drawn out, sometimes hectic system for nominating and electing a president neither broadens the public's understanding of campaigns nor encourages involvement in them and in the end leaves many voters bored. That is the initial conclusion of the Vanishing Voter Project, a study being conducted by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. In a series of weekly polls of voter perceptions last fall and this spring, the center queried voters about what political stories and issues they were following each day, if any, and how much, if any, they were discussing politics daily. The finding: Public interest and involvement in the campaign was very low throughout late 1999, built during the spring caucuses and primaries and then fell off sharply, and has remained very low since it became clear in early March who the nominees would be. Sixty percent of respondents said the nominating system was too hectic and drawn out and should be reworked. (NYT)
 
BUSH AHEAD IN OHIO -- A new presidential preference poll of Ohio voters by the University of Cincinnati -- Ohio is considered a state that could go to Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore -- has Governor Bush leading Vice President Gore by 8 points, about the same margin found by an Ohio State University poll taken a month ago. The Cincinnati poll, conducted April 5 through 22 and covering 531 likely voters, found Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. Gore 47 percent to 39 percent. Ralph Nader of the Green Party had 4 percent, Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party had 3 percent, and 7 percent of the respondents said they were undecided. The margin of sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 4 percentage points. In Washington State, originally assumed to be solid Gore territory, a newly released preference poll has Mr. Bush ahead by a single point, 39 percent to 38 percent, with 18 percent of the respondents undecided. The poll, conducted by Elway Research, a nonpartisan firm, surveyed 400 registered voters on April 11 and 12 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

THE CONVENTIONS
 
GROUPS ALLOWED TO PROTEST -- The City of Philadelphia reached an amicable settlement yesterday with a coalition of more than 50 groups that had said their right to public assembly would be violated during this summer's Republican National Convention. The groups initially were denied demonstration permits by the city, but yesterday it backed off and said it would guarantee them prime protest sites. "I applaud the city for reaffirming the notion that dissent is critical for a healthy democracy," said Stefan Presser, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, in withdrawing a federal lawsuit. The agreement, worked out through the office of the city solicitor, Kenneth Trujillo, allows a mass protest march along Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 30, the eve of the convention, by Unity 2000, a coalition that includes the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Organization for Women. The city also approved a march on July 29 through Washington Square, near Independence Hall, by the Ad-Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, a group of physicians and other medical professionals demanding government action on the issue.

HEADLINE: Making Nike Shoes in Vietnam;
An Elusive U.S. Trade Pact Worries Workers and Bosses

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: BIEN HOA, Vietnam

 BODY:
Nguyen Anh Ha has never heard of the trade talks between Vietnam and the United States. But Mr. Ha, a 26-year-old migrant from northern Vietnam, knows all too well the fragility of life as a factory worker in the developing world.
"I have been worried ever since I came here," said Mr. Ha, as he rested after work in his bare one-room shelter, not far from the sprawling Nike plant north of Ho Chi Minh City, where he makes $120-a-pair athletic shoes. "We keep hearing rumors that they might reduce the number of workers." 
 Nike executives insist that they have no plans to cut back their work force in Vietnam, which numbers more than 45,000 at five factories owned and operated by contractors from South Korea and Taiwan.
Yet they acknowledge that the future here of Nike Inc. has grown cloudier because of the Hanoi government's reluctance to sign a breakthrough trade agreement with the United States. The deal, which was agreed to in principle in July, has stalled since Vietnamese negotiators began quibbling over various provisions.
"We're missing out on the biggest market in the world," said Lalit Monteiro, general manager of Nike's operations in Vietnam. "Our factories here are heavily dependent on the Asian and European markets. If those markets go sour, we're going to feel it."
It is not that Nike is banned from exporting products to the United States. Nor have the attacks by critics of labor practices in Nike's Asian factories played a role in blocking American purchases. But with Washington imposing import duties as high as 35 percent on all goods made in Vietnam, Nike says it is not economical to use this country as a manufacturing center for the American market.
The company, based in Beaverton, Ore., is one of dozens of foreign and local companies in Vietnam whose fortunes would be affected by a trade agreement. And as the largest private employer in the country, it illustrates better than most the huge stakes of the deal for many Vietnamese. It also illustrates the high price a country can pay if it chooses not to accede to the demands of the global economy.
Mr. Monteiro estimated that Nike would increase the portion of its shoes made in Vietnam to 15 percent from the current 12 percent if the deal was approved. That translates to nearly 20,000 new jobs. Other American executives in this country said the company has talked about shifting as many as 40,000 jobs from its plants in China. By contrast, some doubt that Nike will stay in Vietnam without an agreement.
"I think that is a risk," said Pete Peterson, the United States ambassador to Vietnam.
Mr. Peterson, a retired Air Force pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent more than six years as a prisoner of war, has been one of the trade agreement's most dogged proponents. In addition to promoting its merits to the Vietnamese government, he has lobbied with American business -- exhorting sometimes demoralized executives not to give up on the country.
"The biggest risk for Vietnam is the missed opportunity," Mr. Peterson said. "They have to find a way to create jobs. This trade agreement would be a major job-creation vehicle."
Like trade pacts with other countries, the deal would guarantee access to Vietnamese markets for American companies. In return, the United States would eliminate the stiff extra duties on imports from Vietnam. In Nike's case, that would cut 14 percent off the average cost of a pair of shoes made here.
The proposed agreement also has some new provisions, including a requirement that Hanoi disclose government procurement contracts. Vietnamese officials protest that no other country has been asked to do this. And they note that the World Trade Organization failed to approve such a requirement at its meeting in Seattle.
In a country where, 25 years after the end of the Vietnam War, suspicion toward Washington bubbles just under the surface, some people view the deal as a way for the United States to win economically what it could not win militarily.
"The Vietnamese are driven by fear," said Thomas J. Vallely, director of the Indochina program at the Institute for International Development at Harvard University. "They ask: 'Is globalization destroying us? Is this a political as well as an economic move on the part of the Western world?' "
In fact, Mr. Vallely and other experts said, a trade agreement would benefit Vietnam's exports far more than those from the United States. Vietnam sells $650 million worth of goods to Americans, while United States companies export $350 million worth to Vietnam. While Nike would be able to sell its shoes here, that would be a fraction of what Nike factories could export to the United States.
Access to the American market would expand Nike's business in Vietnam by more than just the athletic shoes shipped to California, Texas or New York. Because its Vietnamese factories now export only to Asia and Europe, they are limited in the number of models they make. A model popular in the United States as well as in Europe would be made in China or Indonesia, not Vietnam.
"We're losing orders because we don't have the flexibility to ship to the U.S. market," Mr. Monteiro said. Not surprisingly, Nike produces fewer shoes in Vietnam than in China, Indonesia or Thailand.
For Mr. Monteiro, who used to work in Nike's product development division, the delay in the trade deal has been a frustrating introduction to Vietnam. And it comes as Nike seems finally to have addressed another chronic problem in its operations here: labor conditions.
Late in 1997, the company was stung by the release of a report that documented unsafe conditions at one of its biggest plants. The report, prepared for Nike by the accounting firm Ernst & Young, said the factory, also situated 25 miles from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, exposed workers to unacceptably high levels of toxic chemicals. It said 77 percent of the workers suffered respiratory problems.
Nike said it had been working to improve conditions in the factory before the report was publicized. And even the company's critics acknowledge that conditions have since improved. Dara O'Rourke. an environmental consultant who helped distribute the report to the news media, was allowed to conduct a follow-up inspection of the factory, known as Tae Kwang Vina, in March 1999.
"They felt the heat, which has motivated them to do things," said Mr. O'Rourke, an assistant professor of environmental policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "They switched away from the most toxic compounds. But they continue to work with organic solvents and glues."
Taking a visitor on a tour of Tae Kwang Vina recently, Nike officials pointed out improvements that had been made since Mr. O'Rourke's inspection. The factory, owned by a South Korean company, now uses water-based solvents, as opposed to chemicals, everywhere on its assembly line. It is introducing water solvents in the stitching area, where the leather parts of the shoes are pieced together.
Above workers' heads, powerful fans circulated the air, fans that Nike officials said had been installed since Mr. O'Rourke's visit. In noisy parts of the factory, a vast majority of workers used rubber earplugs -- addressing another of his worries.
Nike's contractors said they had been prodded to improve conditions by the storm of criticism in the United States. "I had pride in my factory," said C. T. Park, president of Tae Kwang Vina, which has more than 10,000 workers. "And then suddenly it was the worst factory in the world."
Nike has not been able to fix every problem in what are still monotonous, taxing jobs that can require handling hazardous material. Mr. Ha and two other workers in Nike's Chang Shin factory complained of runny noses, which they said began soon after they started on the job there. Their job is to press synthetic rubber into a heavy metal cast and heat it to create the contoured shape of a sole.
"Right now, I have good health," Mr. Ha said. "But in five years, I won't be able to work at this job anymore. It is too hard. I'll have to look for lighter work at another factory."
Mr. Ha works eight-hour shifts, six days a week, plus overtime, earning the equivalent of $50 a month. That is slightly below Nike's average monthly take-home pay of $55. But the company says this still compares well with Vietnam's per-capita income of $26 a month.
Labor laws in Vietnam are stricter than in many Asian countries, and Nike says it complies, or does even better, in every category. For example, the minimum age in this country for factory workers is 15. In Nike's footwear factories, workers must be 18; in its garment factories, they can be 16.
Employers cannot demand more than 48 hours a week from workers without paying overtime. But they can run their factories every day. Even so, Nike said it ordered its factories to close on Sundays.
Mr. Ha, however, said he had worked in the Chang Shin factory on a few recent Sundays. After an investigation, Nike confirmed that the plant had asked workers to do cleaning and maintenance on those days. Looking perturbed, Mr. Monteiro said he would discourage the practice.
Unlike previous Nike executives in Vietnam, Mr. Monteiro is neither secretive nor particularly defensive about the company's labor practices. He says he welcomes inspections of the factories by outside monitors like Mr. O'Rourke. "We closed down after the controversy," Mr. Monteiro said. "In retrospect, it was a mistake. But you learn and you move on."
Nike has also learned that there are some battles not worth joining. The Vietnamese government, for example, is considering whether to reduce the workweek to 40 hours from 48. The American Chamber of Commerce has urged Nike, as the largest foreign employer, to lobby against the change. While Nike holds that a shorter week would hurt Vietnam's competitiveness, it is saying little in the debate.
"I could never come out in public and ask the Vietnamese government not to have people work fewer hours," said Chris Helzer, Nike's director of government affairs. "We'd get strung up."
Besides, with the trade agreement hanging in the balance, Mr. Helzer noted that there were far worse threats to Vietnam's competitiveness.

Fresh Evidence of Growth Stokes Fear of Inflation
The United States economy turned in another robust quarter, the government reported, as new evidence emerged that today's prosperity is finally pushing up labor costs, raising fear of higher inflation.
The gross domestic product, representing the value of all goods and services produced in the nation, rose at a 5.4 percent annual rate. A broad inflation measure published with the G.D.P. report rose by 3.2 percent, mainly because of higher gasoline and fuel oil prices. And a measure of labor costs, the Employment Cost Index, rose 1.4 percent. Page A1. 

The quick pace of growth and signs of an acceleration in wage and price increases all but guarantee that the Federal Reserve will seriously consider raising rates by half a percentage point instead of a quarter-point. C2.
 
Technology Shares Lead a Rally
Technology stocks regained market leadership, rising sharply and shaking off economic reports suggesting that more interest rate increases were on the way. The Nasdaq composite index rose 143.94 points, or nearly 4 percent, to 3,774.03. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,888.10. Earlier in the session, the Dow was down as much as 197 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 3.93 points, to 1,464.92. C8.
 
AT&T Wireless Shares Rise 8%
The tracking stock for AT&T's wireless unit opened at $30.125 a share before closing up 8 percent, at $31.6875 in trading of 124.7 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. That made for the second-busiest trading day yet for an individual Big Board stock. C8.
 
WPP in Talks With Young & Rubicam
In a deal that would combine two of the world's largest advertising companies, WPP Group of Britain, which owns Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and J.

Aetna Posts 16% Gain in Profit
Aetna, the nation's largest health insurance company, said that its first-quarter operating profit rose 16 percent, helped by reduced losses at its Prudential Health Care unit and a rebound in international business, including financial services in Asia and Latin America. The results strengthen the hand of William H. Donaldson, the recently appointed chief executive, who was expected to face sharp questioning by shareholders at the annual meeting today in Hartford.

HEADLINE: Janitors, Long Paid Little, Demand a Larger Slice

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 26

 BODY:
Amid a record economic boom, janitors some of America's lowest-paid, least-visible workers -- are taking to the streets and the picket lines from coast to coast to demand a bigger share of the nation's prosperity.
More than 4,000 janitors who clean office buildings in suburban Chicago have been on strike for more than a week, demonstrating downtown and blocking traffic to demand health insurance and a raise that would lift their families out of poverty. 
 The battle spread from Los Angeles, where a three-week strike by 8,500 janitors ended on Monday after Cardinal Roger Mahony gave them his outspoken support, helping them gain a raise of 26 percent over three years.
In San Diego, 300 janitors have been on strike for nearly three weeks to press their demand for health insurance. In New York, 10,000 janitors marched on Park Avenue two weeks ago to clamor for a raise. And more than 1,000 Silicon Valley janitors have held a series of rallies to hammer home their complaint that in cleaning offices for some of the world's wealthiest high-tech companies, they earn too little to afford decent housing or support their families.
The Service Employees International Union, which represents 185,000 janitors, most of them immigrants, has tried to make them the poster child for the gulf between rich and poor. Is it fair, the union demands, for suburban Chicago janitors, cleaning buildings for people who often earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, to get only $6.65 an hour, without health insurance?
"Symbolically, we as a union want to open this century focusing on the economic divide and bridging the income gap in this country," said Andrew Stern, the union's president. "That's what all these contract disputes are about. We want to make sure these janitors gain their fair share of a booming economy and a booming real estate market."
For nearly a decade the union has maneuvered to have most contracts covering janitors expire around the same time, enabling it to create a single nationwide campaign on their behalf. Although the number of strikes by American labor has been declining for half a century, the Service Employees view this as an ideal time to call strikes: the economic boom has left building owners and cleaning contractors well able to afford large raises, the union believes, and brought low-paid workers public sympathy.
Mike Garcia, president of the local in Los Angeles, said in the aftermath of the strike there, "With Los Angeles as the backdrop, with its huge disparity between rich and poor, with all the uninsured and immigrant workers, we wanted to show that a group of workers can organize and lift themselves out of poverty if they bring enough pressure."
Many building owners, under criticism that wages remain low during a soaring real estate market, say janitors' pay is not up to them, but to the cleaning contractors. And unionized cleaning contractors often say that if they raise wages substantially, they will lose their profit margins and be undercut by nonunion competitors.
The janitors of suburban Chicago began their strike on April 18, the day after 5,500 janitors who work in downtown Chicago office buildings had engaged in a daylong strike and won a contract that will raise their pay to $12.50 an hour from $11.40 over three years. Those janitors already have health insurance.
For the suburban janitors, the main question is why the downtown janitors have better pay and benefits. Barry White, chief negotiator for the suburban cleaning contractors, attributed the disparity to the competition that these contractors, unlike those in the heavily unionized downtown, face from nonunion companies. The unionized suburban companies, Mr. White said, fear that the price of family health coverage, about $1.78 an hour, might push costs so high that nonunion competitors will underbid them for contracts.
"We think the full family coverage the union is seeking is far too expensive a benefit for people earning $6.65 an hour," Mr. White said.
Among those people is Rosa Pederosa, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant, who stood alongside hundreds of other striking janitors blocking traffic in suburban Oak Brook on Tuesday. Ms. Pederosa was excited, although also somewhat worried, about being part of a strike that seeks two things she badly wants: health insurance and higher wages. With a bugle blaring and janitors drumming on the bottoms of plastic wastebaskets, the strikers inched forward, next to an upscale mall, chanting, "Si, se puede" ("Yes, we can do it"), as Lexuses and BMW's backed up behind them.
Ms. Pederosa, who has three young children, takes home $440 every two weeks for dusting Venetian blinds at night in a luxury office tower.
"We earn very little," she said. "I don't feel comfortable working near all these really rich people. The owner and the tenants make a ton of money and dress really well, but earning $6.65 doesn't even cover expenses for my family."
Ms. Pederosa was taken to a hospital last month when she had problems breathing. Now she has two big worries: she may have asthma and, without health insurance or any wages coming in, she has to find a way to pay the $360 hospital bill and the $150 ambulance bill.
For Graciella Chagoya, things are much the same. Her 9-year-old son needed seven stitches after being hit in the head by a baseball bat. The hospital bill was $1,500, and the ambulance bill $470. Together, they amount to more than two months' take-home pay; she is trying to pay down the bill by $100 a month.
"I don't understand why they don't want to give us better wages or health insurance when I'm working so hard for them," she said.
Health coverage is the main issue in the strike in San Diego, where three janitors and the president of the local have been fasting for six days.
"We're fasting," said Mary Grillo, the president, "to focus on the choices that workers have to make every single day: Do I feed my family, or do I pay my rent, or do I take my child to the doctor? These are not civilized choices in a country like ours."
In all the disputes, the Service Employees union has worked hard to line up community support to pressure both building owners and cleaning contractors. In Los Angeles, the janitors received an anonymous $1 million gift to sustain them during their strike, and whenever they marched through the streets, workers came out of buildings, white-collar and blue-collar alike, to cheer them on.
Cardinal Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, symbolized community support by presiding over a Mass for the strikers. Describing the janitors as "faceless, nameless, voiceless," the cardinal said they deserved a share in "the wonderful fruitfulness of our economy." He praised them for making "visible in our city an invisible problem": the exclusion of many from the boom.
Labor leaders are looking for the success of the Los Angeles strike to take on symbolic importance. Their hope is that the Los Angeles janitors, by reminding the nation about the millions of people on the lower rungs, will galvanize hotel maids, hospital aides and other low-wage workers to join unions and fight for higher pay.
"Clearly the janitors won the hearts and souls and support of the overall community," said Mr. Garcia, president of the Los Angeles local. "It was definitely looked at as a David-versus-Goliath fight. We were in the right place and right time for a visible fight."

HEADLINE: Prices Spurt 3.2% As Economy Posts Another Big Gain

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
With lavish consumer spending providing the stimulus, the American economy turned in another very robust quarter, the government reported yesterday, as new evidence emerged that prosperity is finally pushing up labor costs, raising fears of higher inflation.
The inflation rate, as measured by the Commerce Department, rose to 3.2 percent in the first quarter, mainly because of higher fuel prices. But Wall Street expressed the worry that even as oil prices recede, labor costs will accelerate and keep the inflation rate rising. 
 "Either way, the economy is growing much too strongly to avoid inflation," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "There are too many little signs out there that the Federal Reserve cannot ignore. It will have to continue to raise interest rates; the increases so far have had no effect."
The fresh warning signs of an acceleration in wage and price increases raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next month. But most analysts expect the Fed to stick to a more modest quarter-point rate increase.
The stock market, reacting to the hints of rising inflation and the likelihood of more interest rate increases, plunged in the first hour or so of trading yesterday. It then bounced back as investors focused on the prospects for higher profits from the growing economy. The Nasdaq composite index rose a strong 143.94 points, or nearly 4 percent, to 3,774.03, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 10,888.10, down 57.40 points or about half a percent.
The gross domestic product, representing the value of all goods and services produced in the nation from January through March, rose at a 5.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported. Although that was down from the 7.3 rate of the fourth quarter, Americans showed no signs of tiring as the nine-year-old expansion became the longest in history.
Drawing on a variety of resources -- savings, bonuses and raises, stock options and market gains, wages from new jobs, as well as income tax refunds and more borrowing -- people piled into shopping at a pace not seen in 17 years. Showing confidence that the good times will continue, they spent most heavily on cars and trucks, but they also increased their spending on clothing, appliances, furniture, sports events, casino gambling, computers and software.
"The implication of all this is that people feel wealthier; their assets are going up in value -- their stock portfolios and their homes -- and they intend to spend more," said Robert Parker, chief statistician at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which prepares the report on the gross domestic product.
The rise exceeded the increase in spending in any quarter since the spring of 1983. Then, the nation was just bouncing back from a recession; now the expansion is in record territory. Even politicians added to the bounty. The outlays by all the presidential contenders added more than $235 million to the gross domestic product from January through March.
Business investment grew with equal abandon. Construction of houses, schools, office buildings and highways rose by 12.1 percent. Spending for machinery and equipment, mainly computers and software, was up a stunning 23.7 percent.
"Firms rushed to purchase new computers last year in the run-up to Y2K," said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Partners in St. Louis, "and in the first quarter they resumed the process of upgrading their operations."
What most alarmed Wall Street, which is always fearful that rising inflation will undercut the public's enthusiasm for stocks and bonds, was a separate report issued yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Labor Department. It said that labor costs rose at a much faster pace during the quarter -- partly from growing wages but mostly from greater company outlays for employee benefits.
The bureau's Employment Cost Index increased 1.4 percent during the quarter, up sharply from the 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Much of the latest increase results from a big rise in health insurance costs, which have gone up gradually for two years. Company outlays for health insurance rose 7.6 percent in the year that ended last month, or three times the 2.5 percent increase in all of 1998.
"If you are looking for where the potential upward pressure on prices is coming from," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, "it is energy and health insurance."
The broad inflation measure published with the G.D.P. report -- a gauge that the Fed now watches more closely than the more popular Consumer Price Index -- rose by 3.2 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter. But when energy and food are subtracted, the index was up only 1.8 percent, down slightly from the fourth quarter's 2 percent rise.
Many experts argue that with the nation now operating at close to full employment -- reflected in a jobless rate of just 4.1 percent -- the economy cannot maintain a growth rate above 3.5 or 4 percent without subjecting the country to inflationary shortages. Yet there are indications that strong economic growth is likely to continue through the current quarter, which ends on June 30, some analysts said.
They noted that cars and trucks were high on the shopping list in the first quarter, but most were bought out of back lots, which now must be replenished by lifting production as robust vehicle sales continue. Further, a strike at Boeing temporarily interrupted production at its commercial aircraft operation, which contributes significantly to the nation's output and exports.
Federal spending might also rise. It fell in the first quarter, mostly because of a decline in military spending, which had shot up in the fourth quarter.
"We were told that the Defense Department had made advance payments in the fourth quarter for services like travel" and research and development, Mr. Parker said. "Now these outlays should return to more normal levels."

Officer Explains Reasoning For Use of Armed Agents
Federal agents who staged the Elian Gonzalez raid in Miami carried automatic weapons into the house because intelligence reports had indicated that among those guarding the house were people with concealed-weapons permits, a history of violent crime or a record of anti-Castro violence, one of the officers said. A20
 
A federal appeals court put off a request by Elian's father to serve as his sole legal representative, but granted him the right to intervene in the battle over whether his son goes back to Cuba or stays here. But in a blow to Elian's Miami relatives, the court denied their request for regular visits with him and dismissed their request for the appointment of a neutral guardian. Instead, a psychiatrist and a social worker appointed by the government will monitor the boy and send the court reports on his condition and care. A20

Inflation Rises to 3.2%
The economy continued its robust growth in the first quarter, fueled by consumer spending, but inflation jumped mainly because of higher prices for fuel. Wall Street expressed concern that even as oil prices receded, labor costs would accelerate and keep the inflation rate rising. That raised the possibility that the Fed would increase short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next month, though most analysts expected it to stick to a quarter-point rate increase.

HEADLINE: The Remedy for Microsoft

 BODY:
The Justice Department is expected to propose to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson today that he break Microsoft in two -- a dramatic remedy for the antitrust violations that he recently ruled the company had committed. A breakup might seem to be overkill. But the inconvenient truth is that less drastic remedies are apt to be less effective and might involve government or court officials taking a permanent oversight role in the American software industry, hampering its evolution.
Microsoft is the latest target of antitrust laws designed to prohibit companies from conspiring by way of mergers, contracts or other forms of cooperation to reduce consumer choice. Though the laws do not outlaw monopolies, they do prohibit a single company from deliberately creating or maintaining a monopoly through anti-competitive practices rather than simply selling a product that is better or cheaper than someone else's product. The laws, which are generally stricter in the United States than in other industrialized countries, have been used with uneven results to go after industry giants like Standard Oil, Alcoa, I.B.M. and AT&T. 
 The federal proposal, which a majority of the 19 states suing Microsoft are expected to endorse, raises profound questions about the government's role in the new economy. Can, and should, laws designed to manage the emergence of industrial and natural-resource monopolies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries be applied to the technology and intellectual-property giants of the 21st century?
No one can answer that question with absolute certainty, but in our view American business and the nation's consumers would be ill served if the Justice Department abandoned the broad tradition of antitrust regulation as it has evolved over the past 100 years. That tradition teaches that government must sketch, with as light a hand as possible, the boundaries of fair competition. Microsoft insists, with some defiance, that it will defeat on appeal any attempt to restrict its marketing strategy. But it seems to us that Justice's proposal provides room for the Microsoft companies to prosper while creating enterprise space for competitors.
Judge Jackson embraced Justice's argument that Microsoft illegally entered into restrictive contracts with computer manufacturers and Internet companies that required them to favor Microsoft's browser over that of its chief rival, Netscape. The manufacturers were prevented from substituting Netscape's browser for Microsoft's browser on versions of Windows they installed on new computers. Microsoft also wrote contracts that required Internet service providers to steer customers to Microsoft's browser in exchange for favored access to Windows users. Microsoft's primary goal was to prevent Netscape's browser from serving as an alternative platform from which computer users could run word processors and other applications software, and thereby eviscerate the market power of Windows. The use of a monopoly position to insulate that monopoly from competitive challenge violates the antitrust laws.
So what is the best remedy? One approach would be to regulate Microsoft's future behavior. Under this remedy, the court would impose rules that prohibit Microsoft from entering into illegally exclusive contracts to box out its competitors. The problem with such behavior constraints is that it is hard to box a wily company like Microsoft. Justice signed a consent decree in 1994 that it thought would prevent Microsoft from wrapping its browser into Windows and selling the two as a bundled unit, but Microsoft found a way to achieve the same economic effect by cleverly designing its software. Besides, in a fast-moving industry, no one knows how to specify today the unforeseeable violations in the future.
Consider, for example, Judge Jackson's finding that Microsoft punished some computer manufacturers that cooperated with its competitors by, for example, charging them higher prices. To prohibit that behavior in the future would require the judge to anticipate all the ways that Microsoft could hassle manufacturers, such as by providing them belated or incomplete technical information. That approach would require a permanent army of officials to adjudicate every complaint against Microsoft, a task that Justice wants no part of.
Structural remedies might work better. The idea is to inject competition into the market for operating systems so that competitive pressures, not the courts, rein in Microsoft's behavior.
One option is to require that Microsoft license Windows to several other companies. Consumers could buy Windows from, say, three separate companies, each offering slightly different versions of Windows and its own brand of customer service. That proposal would create instant competition, insulating computer manufacturers from threats by Microsoft because they could always get Windows from another source. The trouble with this idea is that it could lead to fragmentation -- incompatible versions of Windows that would make swapping files between computers and lots of other everyday tasks needlessly difficult. Some economists doubt that rival companies could find customers for a version of Windows that was not backed by the technical experts working for Microsoft.
Several economists would go further and break Microsoft into three companies, each selling Windows and, perhaps, applications programs as well. This would solve the core antitrust problem by breaking apart the Windows monopoly. But this approach, like licensing, could lead to incompatible versions of Windows, and some experts believe the market might not accommodate more than one version of Windows, ensuring that two of the companies might fail. This approach would also be the most dauntingly difficult to pull off -- requiring, for example, a complicated parceling out of Microsoft personnel among the three offshoots.
Justice is choosing instead a less complicated breakup strategy. It would divide Microsoft into a company that sells an operating system (Windows) and a company that sells application programs -- word processors, spreadsheets and browsers. The idea is that the applications company would have financial incentive to make its products compatible not only with Windows but with other operating systems like Linux.
This is a plausible solution, though economists point to problems. The applications company might be unwilling to spend huge amounts to rewrite Word and other programs for operating systems that are currently used by very few people. That would still leave Windows as the overwhelmingly dominant operating system. Moreover, the company selling Windows could, after a transition period, engage in all the anti-competitive practices that Microsoft has committed in the past. But the great hope is that, by creating two powerful companies where there is now one dominant company, each will prosper, competition and innovation will increase, and the consumer will ultimately benefit. Among a set of flawed alternatives, the government's plan offers the best chance of success.

PHILIPS TO CUT 1,500 JOBS IN OHIO, MOVING WORK TO MEXICO

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
Philips Display Components, the world's largest maker of picture tubes, said yesterday that it planned to lay off 1,500 workers at a plant in Ottawa, Ohio, beginning in 2001 and move most of the work to Mexico. Philips, a division of Royal Philips Electronics, said the cuts would take place over a three-year period starting next year. The Ohio plant will remain open to make large picture tubes, but most of its work will be moved to Mexico, the company said. About 300 of the plant's 1,800 workers will remain. The plant makes 4.2 million picture tubes each year for television sets made by Philips and other manufacturers.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Booming In Size And Brio

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
More than 150 years ago, San Antonio gave Texas its enduring symbol of us-against-them pride and courage, the Alamo. Austin's moment in the sun is now. Its technology boom has generated fortunes that surpass even the staggering riches earned by the state's cattle and oil barons.
The two cities are only 80 miles apart, not much more than an hour's drive down I-35 for lead-footed local drivers, and their metropolitan areas are slowly growing together. They share the equable south-central Texas climate; close proximity to the Hill Country, an area of easy, unspoiled rustic beauty; a compactness envied by sprawling Dallas and Houston; an unhurried approach to life, and an unusual ethnic flavor, arising from the interaction of Hispanic culture with that of the early settlers from Germany. 
 Both take much of their character from modest rivers that they have turned to great effect. But no one would ever confuse them.
Austin is defined by the enormous University of Texas, with 50,000 students on a single campus, and by the state government, headed at the moment by an up-and-coming politician named George W. Bush. Plus the vast chip and computer plants just outside the city and one of the country's liveliest, most varied popular music cultures.
Willie Nelson lives here, and Lady Bird Johnson, the president's farsighted widow, who has enriched Austin, Texas and the whole nation with her beautification projects. So do Ann Richards and Molly Ivins, a pair of bright, witty women, one a former governor, the other a syndicated newspaper columnist, who find plenty of targets hereabouts for their barbs.
Austin's population has grown by a third and its work force by almost two-thirds in the last decade. But George Christian, Lyndon B. Johnson's press secretary, who was born here, said that the city retains its essential character, despite traffic jams and rocketing real estate prices.
"It's still a tolerant, casual, laid-back place, different from most of the rest of the state," he told me over a lunch of meat loaf, black-eyed peas and deep-fried pickles at Threadgill's, Janis Joplin's old hangout. "Nothing changes that."
San Antonio is older, poorer and slightly larger, with 1.5 million people vs. Austin's 1.1 million -- a margin that is shrinking fast. It is a city of fiestas, especially the nine-day Fiesta, an annual wingding every bit as flamboyant as, if somewhat less boozy than, Mardi Gras in New Orleans. This year's edition comes to a clamorous conclusion on April 30.
The city has turned its evident charms into a significant economic asset, luring dozens of big conventions every year. It earns further millions from three major Air Force bases, including Randolph Field, where many pilots were trained in World War II, and from the Army's Fort Sam Houston.
San Antonio is also much more heavily Hispanic. It is, in fact, the largest Hispanic-majority city in the country, represented in Congress for 37 years by Henry B. Gonzalez, a power on the House Banking Committee who brought home plenty of federal bacon, and now by his son Charles. Much of its modern momentum was imparted by another Hispanic politician, Henry G. Cisneros, who served as mayor from 1982 to 1990, before heading to Washington, where he served the Clinton administration as secretary of housing and urban development. He later resigned during a scandal involving a former lover.
"San Antonio," Graham Greene wrote in 1939, "is more Mexican than American -- not quite genuine Mexican (it is far too clean for that) but picture-postcard Mexican."
 
An 'Enchilada Red' Library
Neither city, in truth, can claim to be a national or even a regional cultural capital. Neither has a museum in the same league as the Kimbell in Fort Worth or a symphony orchestra that can compete with the excellent ensemble built in Houston by Christoph Eschenbach. But scratch the surface a little, and you will discover that Nelson A. Rockefeller's wonderful collection of Latin American art has found a home in San Antonio, and that the University of Texas houses one of the world's greatest troves of 20th-century manuscripts, including important items by Joyce, Shaw and Waugh.
San Antonio boasts a stunning new library designed by the Mexican master Roberto Legorreta. A series of boxes piled one on another, with a breathtaking six-story atrium, it is painted an eye-popping color known to locals as "enchilada red."
Austin's own architectural spectacular, a new building for the university's Jack S. Blanton Museum, was stalled when hidebound members of the Board of Regents raised so many objections that the architects, Herzog & de Meuron, probably the hottest firm in the world at the moment, threw up their hands and quit. The dean of the architecture school resigned, too.
For the moment, while the search for a new designer continues, the Blanton's interesting collection is split between two campus buildings, neither of them adequate. The most important holdings are the 20th-century American pictures donated by the author James A. Michener and his wife, Mari (ranging from the Ashcan School through a jaunty yellow oil by Arthur G. Dove called "Good Breeze" to Sam Gilliam and Larry Rivers), and the recently acquired Suida-Manning collection, parts of which had been on long-term loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among its notable paintings are works by Poussin, Guercino and Simon Vouet, plus a Veronese "Annunciation" showing the virgin, swathed in luminous pink, turning modestly away from the Angel Gabriel.
The Austin Museum of Art, which is still amassing a permanent collection, is moving ahead with its new building, to be designed by Richard Gluckman, the New Yorker who adapted older buildings for the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. And the small but solid Austin Symphony Orchestra and Austin Lyric Opera (13 performances of three productions this season) continue to thrive.
Residual conservatism and insularity have done nothing to inhibit the development of dozens of active theater companies in Austin. Nor has it slowed the seemingly unstoppable expansion of the popular music business here, which now extends to 810 recording artists and 150 clubs and other stages, featuring everything from rockabilly to Texas swing to Tejano. Every March, music journalists and record-company executives flock here for the Southwest Music and Media Conference, known as SXSW, to look for future stars. This year almost 1,000 acts from all over the world showed up, each allotted a mere 40 minutes to sell itself to the bigwigs.
In San Antonio, a significant effort has been made to build artistic links to Mexico and Latin America as a whole, as Ron Bechtel, a local architect and food critic, explained to me.
The commission for Mr. Legorreta, who won the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal for 1999, is one instance; another is a continuing effort by Christopher Wilkins, the music director of the 60-year-old San Antonio Symphony, to program works by Latin composers, often interpreted by Latin conductors or soloists. Works by many contemporary Hispanic artists are displayed in galleries in the old warehouse district that is anchored by the Blue Star Art Space.
 
A Converted Brewery
The strongest element in this linkage, however, must be the Rockefeller Latin American Art Center at the San Antonio Museum of Art. The main part of the museum is housed in a castellated converted brewery dating from 1904, a fine example of the city's unusually imaginative reuse of intriguing old buildings. The Rockefeller center, which includes not only the collection of the onetime New York governor but material from other sources as well, was opened in October 1998, in a well-conceived addition.
In addition to Aztec, Mixtec and other pre-Columbian art, Spanish colonial silver and altarpieces and contemporary Latin American painting, the Rockefeller wing owns a riotously uninhibited collection of Mexican folk art, including dozens of masks, an elegant crane fashioned from a gourd and brightly colored ceramic churches, trucks, trains and planes.
A highlight of the museum's other collections is Martin Johnson Heade's tiny "Passion Flowers and Hummingbirds," which a wall label aptly described as "a very private vision of the Garden of Eden." He painted it, appropriately enough, in Latin America.
Texas is full of small museums too little known outside the state, like the Ima Hogg decorative-arts collection in Houston and the Trammell Crow Museum of Asian Art in Dallas. In San Antonio, the sleeper is the McNay Art Museum, in a parklike sitting on the north side of town, where the Richie Riches of San Antonio live.
It has one of the nation's premier theater arts collections, which is augmented this spring by a special showing of treasures from the St. Petersburg State Museum of Theater and Music. The splendor of Aleksandr Golovin's costumes for "The Firebird" came as no surprise, but I was amazed to see the sketches by Kasimir Malevich done in 1913 for a production of the now-forgotten experimental opera "Victory Over the Sun," and the captivatingly witty Constructivist costumes designed in 1931 by Tatyana Bruni for an early Shostakovich ballet, "Bolt." Keen Shostakovich fan though I am, I confess I had never before encountered the ballet or Ms. Bruni.
If you go to the McNay, don't miss the permanent collection, especially the van Goghs and Gauguins, Matisse's "Red Blouse" and a memorable Redon, but also superb graphics by Edward Hopper and John Marin.
Finally, if you happen to be a circus junkie like me, you will enjoy the Hertzberg Circus Museum, which houses the 20,000-object collection of a former state senator from San Antonio. What might be called, in circus-speak, A Peerless Panorama of Posters, recalls a simpler, more credulous era: Frank Buck ("Bring 'em Back Alive"), Gargantua the Great and the Giraffe-Women of Burma! The best carries a portrait of P. T. Barnum himself -- without his name, just the words "I Am Coming."
 
High-Tech Texas
A quarter-century ago, Austin was a sleepy town, about as vibrant as Carson City, Nev., with a couple of enormous buildings -- Texas Memorial Stadium, where the Longhorns roam, and the pink granite state capitol, the largest and the most southerly in the United States, except of course for Hawaii's, with a dome that looks uncannily like the one in Washington. The political carnival inside is similar, too.
Quite a few one- and two-story cow-town buildings still stand on Congress Avenue and along the streets running off it, but that's not where the action is. The action is out along Loop 360 and Loop 1, at the region's 2,100 high-tech companies. Austin's Entrepreneurs' Association had 476 members at recent count, and the entrepreneur-in-chief has to be Michael Dell, 35, the youngest chief executive to lead a company onto the Fortune 500; the sixth-richest person in America, according to Forbes; and the richest Texan ever. No, that's not a misprint; Mr. Dell is richer than the Basses of Fort Worth and the DeMenils of Houston, and richer by far than H. Ross Perot.
He made his money by grafting an old idea to a new business: he eliminated the middleman (and avoided the inventory costs of his rivals) by building computers to order and selling them direct to consumers.
That simple scheme made millionaires of many of Mr. Dell's early employees, even secretaries and clerks, and it made billionaires of some. Aided by Federal research dollars funneled into the area by its former Congressman, the legendary J. J. Pickle, and by the talent pool at the university, new companies sprang up like wildflowers after a spring rain. Soon all of Austin was gossiping about the new "Dellionaires."
 
Spam Foo-Young
Which represents a big change, because until recently Austin was a stranger to Dallas-size bankrolls. During the 1960's, in fact, it was a counterculture center, a Haight-Ashbury with 10-gallon hats, and some of that individualism lingers.
"It's a funny, funky, outrageous town," said Ms. Ivins. "Where else do they have Spamarama? Spam with Chinese food, Spam foo-young, for goodness sake. Where else do people celebrate Eeyore's birthday?
"We do."
But Austin doesn't have bats in its belfry. It keeps its bats under the Congress Avenue Bridge, or rather they keep themselves there: 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats, who live beneath the bridge's concrete arches from March until November, streaming out at dusk to eat.
The bridge crosses Town Lake, an idyllic sliver of water formed by a dam on the Colorado River (the Texas Colorado, not the longer one farther west). By some miracle of good sense, all motorboats are banned, so the waters are roiled by nothing more modern than sculls, canoes and a poky little excursion stern-wheeler.
Austin climbs from the lake to the university, centered on the 307-foot tower of the Main Building. One of the richest state universities, the fortunate owner of extensive oil lands in the Permian Basin, U.T., as the students call it, has attracted distinguished faculty members from other campuses. Steven Weinberg, a physicist, won the Nobel Prize in 1979 and left Harvard for Austin in 1983; now "you couldn't blast him out of here with a howitzer," a friend says.
"Michigan and Berkeley are the ideals we aspire to," said James S. Fishkin, ex-Yale and now a U.T. professor of ethics and American society, with a chair improbably named for Darrell K. Royall, an old Longhorn football coach. "We're already there in some areas, and we undoubtedly have the resources to get there in most others."
At the edge of the campus stands the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, an exemplary institution of its kind, which is just one of the monuments, all well worth visiting, to the former president and his family in this area. Another is the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, where the magnificent bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis) and the Indian paintbrush are ankle deep this time of year. A third is the L. B. J. Ranch, out in the Hill Country near Stonewall, Tex., hard by the Pedernales River (which Johnson, in keeping with the local usage, always pronounced as "Purdenales").
 
Missions and Victoriana
San Antonio is drenched in history. Its Hispanic past is exemplified by the 18th-century missions along the San Antonio River south of the center, notably Concepcion, a starkly beautiful, twin-towered building that retains traces of its original frescoes, and San Jose, with exquisite Churrigueresque ornamentation around its windows and doors.
San Jose gives a good impression of the privations of life in what was then the wilderness, with its gun ports and defensive walls, and of what must have been, then as now, the pleasures of spring in the Southwest, with its feathery mesquite trees and flame-colored pomegranate blossoms.
Closer to downtown stands the King William District, full of Victorian houses built of beautifully dressed pale limestone blocks by German burghers in the mid-1800's. Once known for obvious reasons as Sauerkraut Bend, the neighborhood is remarkably intact, although some houses have been lovingly restored while others in the same block remain decrepit. It reminded me a bit of Georgetown in the late 1950's before it became compulsively chic.
Both the Steves Homestead at 509 King William, with a fine Mansard roof, and Groos house, an Italianate villa at 335, are very handsome.
San Antonio boosters will remind you that theirs is a big-league town; they are proud of the Spurs, National Basketball Association Champions in the 1998-99 season, led by a pair of walking skyscrapers named David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Me, I'm pretty excited about the Class AA San Diego Missions, and especially their mascots, the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno, a hot pepper with a baseball-shaped head.
For the average visitor, though, San Antonio is synonymous with the Alamo and the Riverwalk. The former, where 188 heroic Texans, including Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, held off 5,000 Mexicans under Santa Anna before perishing on March 6, 1836, is a shrine to the Texas nationhood that for many Texans has never ceased to exist. The Alamo itself, which was once a mission church, has a somber dignity that quiets even the hordes of schoolchildren who troop through every day. But the "museum shop" next door is a travesty that sells Alamo butter-spreaders and other equally tasteful goods.
The Riverwalk, fashioned with W.P.A. funds during the Depression, consists of paths along the downtown reaches of the San Antonio, overhung with cypresses, crossed by humpbacked footbridges, sparklingly lighted at night. Hotels, restaurants and clubs, like the Landing, where the joyously old-fashioned Jim Cullum Jazz Band toots every night, open onto it. Commercial the walk may be; resistible it isn't, not to the hardest of hearts.
 
Details of 2 Cities
 
 Austin is about 1,745 miles southwest of New York City and San Antonio is about 80 miles southwest of Austin. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:
 
Where to Stay
 
 DRISKILL, 604 Brazos Street, Austin, (512) 474-5911. A survivor from the old Austin, the Driskill was the press headquarters during the Johnson years. The old-timers wouldn't recognize it. A skillful restoration effort has wiped away the wens and wrinkles of a century, leaving a Richardsonian Romanesque landmark for all to admire. Cast-iron columns, beaten copper ceilings, stained-glass skylights, Arts and Crafts lighting fixtures and sofas upholstered in pony hides recreate the original 1886 ambiance. Double rooms: $185 to $225.
 
 FOUR SEASONS, 98 San Jacinto Boulevard, Austin, (512) 478-4500. In its way, this shining palace on Town Lake is a perfect symbol of Austin's emergence from small-town torpor into the big time. The decor is chic and Southwestern; the bedrooms come with marble bathrooms and down-soft sheets. Every service imaginable is close at hand here, from a lending library of books by Texas authors to a rental fleet of 24-speed bicycles. Car parkers, bellmen and chambermaids alike are cheerful and hyperefficient. Double rooms: $195 to $325.
 
 LA MANSION DEL RIO, 112 College Street, San Antonio, (210) 518-1000. Most hotels along the Riverwalk are cattle cars, and one has more than 1,000 rooms. The Mansion is a smaller, much more atmospheric alternative, built into the shell of an old boys' school, with an unusually friendly staff. The best rooms, with balconies, overlook the river, as does the subdued, softly lighted Las Canarias, probably San Antonio's best hotel restaurant. Double rooms: $254 to $414.
 
 MENGER, 204 Alamo Plaza, San Antonio, (210) 223-4361. Built in 1859, expanded and renovated a dozen times, the Menger embodies Texas history; Teddy Roosevelt recruited some of his Rough Riders in the cherrywood-paneled bar. You can swim in a courtyard pool shaded by a loquat tree or eat lunch beneath the palms of a second courtyard. The moderately priced bedrooms, old and new, offer modern comfort -- just "across the alley from the Alamo." Double rooms: $155 to $175; suites from $275 to $475.
 
 WESTIN RIVERWALK, 420 West Market Street, San Antonio, (210) 224-6500, is San Antonio's newest hotel (opened November 1999) and its most luxurious. Only big panes of plate glass separate the marble-floored, flower-filled lobby from the Riverwalk and the river. The 473 "Texas-size" rooms, as the hotel describes them, have large marble-top working desks, hypoallergenic pillows and in-room safes. The lounge serves a mean margarita. Double rooms: $189 to $239.
 
Where to Eat
 
 BIGA ON THE BANKS, 203 South St. Mary's Street, San Antonio, (210) 225-0722. Bruce Auden, a lean, earnest Englishman, has been San Antonio's culinary star for years; now he has a handsome, high-tech stage on which to do his thing. Open only a week when we visited, the dining room was still shaking down, but not the kitchen. Mr. Auden's sure hand with spices showed in the minced game in radicchio packets, and his meticulous timing showed in a pork loin as well as the calamari in a stew. The toffee pudding had our fellow diner Tim Zagat, the guidebook man, begging for seconds.
 
 HILLTOP CAFE, 10661 Highway 87, Doss, (830) 997-8922. Even in Texas, who would believe a onetime gas station, festooned with old license plates, game trophies and other junk, serving top-notch Greek, Cajun and cowboy food? C'mon. But there it is, out near the LBJ Ranch. The chicken-fried steak is a cardiologist's nightmare, a glutton's dream, and Miss Gladys's amazing pecan and blueberry pies take the blue ribbon for paper-thin crusts.
 
 JEFFREY'S, 1204 West Lynn Street, Austin, (512) 477-5584. Jeffrey's has grown up with Austin. The hippie atmosphere of its youth has given way to smooth service, subtle decor and superb cooking by David Garrido, a protege of Stephan Pyles, the Dallas superchef. His food is easily Austin's best, from gently fried oysters to foie gras in a puddle of fruity sauce to a tender yet robustly flavored venison chop. The lighting is needlessly dim.
 
 KREUZ MARKET, 619 North Colorado Street, Lockhart, (512) 398-2361. Here's the drill: You drive an hour from Austin or San Antonio, head into the pit room, order your sausage, brisket (a bit fatty) or shoulder of beef (very lean), barbecued over post oak. They pile it onto a sheet of brown butcher paper, along with a stack of white bread. You carry that to one of the 710 seats at communal tables and pick up pickles, raw onions and a Shiner bock beer. For this elemental feast, you get a plastic knife, no fork, no sides and no sauce. The luscious, deeply smoky meat doesn't need it; this may be the state's best 'cue, and the locals rip into it like cave men.
 
 LAS MANITAS, 211 Congress Avenue, Austin, (512) 472-9357. The food is better, or at least more authentic, at Fonda San Miguel. But the smoky, spicy enchiladas rojas and the milder enchiladas verdes at Las Manitas are Tex-Mex classics, and the scene -- the funky old lefty Austin scene -- can't be beat. Is that Bobby Ray Inman and Bob Gates, the C.I.A. honchos, dining with their wives on Formica in the second booth back? Yep.
 
 EL MIRADOR, 722 South St. Mary's Street, San Antonio, (210) 225-9444. The Trevinos have been here for 32 years, and they know what they're doing. They made their name with meal-in-a-bowl soups like menudo, with tripe, and chicken cilantro, packed with chunky vegetables. I was especially impressed by the supremely tender cabrito (goat), roasted for eight hours and liberally dusted with pepper, and ravishing sweet-potato flan (custard).
 
 HUDSON'S ON THE BEND, 3509 Ranch Road 620 North, Austin, (512) 266-1369. Ever-expanding Austin has devoured the countryside in which Hudson's sat a decade ago, but it retains the feeling of an old Hill Country ranch house. Jeffrey Blank's menu emphasizes game -- elk, axis venison, boar, quail and pheasant -- boisterously but expertly cooked; an old smoker outside is used to good effect. Try crunchy pheasant with a jicama and tomatillo salad.
 
 SILO, 1133 Austin Highway, San Antonio, (210) 824-8686. You ride an elevator up to the dining room, just as you do at the Tour d'Argent, but there the similarity ends. This ain't Paris, Hoss. Mark Bliss has plenty of lively ideas, some of them superbly executed (an eastern Mediterranean take on osso buco, with couscous and Lebanese spices), some of them much less so (chicken-fried oysters on spinach). Service is sweet but slow-witted.
 
 ZOOT, 509 Hearn Street, Austin, (512) 477-6535. Steamed clams and lamb sausage ladled over linguine in a garlicky broth are one palate-pleaser here; another is deftly cooked sweetbreads, unbreaded but nicely crusty, served on sweet-and-sour red cabbage. One tasted Portuguese, the other German, a welcome relief after a week of Tex-Tex, Tex-Mex and Mex-Mex. You'll find them in a charming cottage on the west side of town.

Nasdaq Rises Again as It Ends Its Worst Month Since '98

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rose for a second day yesterday, while completing its worst month since 1998. Qualcomm, Oracle and Intel gained.
American Express, J. P. Morgan & Company and other financial stocks dragged down the Dow Jones industrial average on concern that accelerating inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates a half-point in May to keep inflation in check. 
 "People are coming back" to the Nasdaq "knowing the earnings have been tremendous," said Guy Truicko, who helps manage $1 billion at Unity Management Inc. "Rates are going to have to go much higher to slow the economy down, and that's spooked people out of financials."
Merck & Company also weighed on the Dow industrials after a report that one of its most important drugs might face safety questions from the federal government.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 86.63 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,860.66. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 154.19 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,733.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 12.49 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,452.43.
The Nasdaq's 15.6 percent drop in April was its biggest since August 1998, when stocks plunged on concern about economic growth worldwide. This April also provided the index's worst and best one-week performances, and on April 4, it fell as much as 13.6 percent before recovering four-fifths of the plunge.
The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 3.1 percent in April, while the Dow lost 1.7 percent.
For the week, the Nasdaq gained 6 percent and the S.& P. 500 advanced 1.3 percent. The Dow lost 1 percent this week.
"The volatility is just incredible," said Don Ross, chief investment officer with National City Investment Management Company, which oversees $24 billion in Cleveland.
Some 970 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, down from the three-month daily average of 1.1 billion.
Qualcomm gained 4 15/16, to 108 7/16, and Oracle rose 2 5/8, to 79 15/16. Intel advanced 1 1/2, to 126 13/16. The semiconductor maker, at a meeting with analysts and investors in New York on Thursday, said demand for personal computers was better than expected. The company said it was increasing production by adding plants and using a more efficient chip-making process.
Microsoft, which gained 5/8, to 70 3/8 in extended trading, was the most-active United States stock. The Justice Department and the 19 states in the antitrust suit against the company filed with the judge their recommendations for remedies he should impose for Microsoft's violations. The government recommended splitting the company in two.
Merck fell 2, to 69 1/2, after reports the Food and Drug Administration is concerned about cardiac problems related to the drugmaker's Vioxx painkiller. Merck, which said it sees no signs of heart problems related to Vioxx, was the third-best performer in the Dow average this month.

Treasury Prices Gain
(By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices bounced higher yesterday, but shorter maturities suffered their fifth consecutive day of losses on fears of inflation and higher interest rates in response to recent economic data.
"The market's just moved from 25 basis points to 50 basis points," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi, referring to market speculation on the magnitude of the interest rate increase that is expected when Federal Reserve policy makers meet on May 16. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32, to 104 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.96 percent from 5.98 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Personal Income Jumped 0.7% In March, Faster Than Spending

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Americans' personal incomes rose in March at a faster rate than spending for the first time in five months, paced by wage gains and census hiring, government data showed today.
Incomes grew 0.7 percent in March after rising 0.4 percent in February, the Commerce Department said. Spending rose 0.5 percent, smaller than expected, after a February increase of 1.4 percent. 
 The income gain did little to raise the personal savings rate, which is still close to the lowest level since monthly record-keeping began in 1959. The savings rate rose to 0.4 percent from February's record low 0.2 percent.
"This speaks of a consumer that is comfortable enough not only to spend heavily but to use liberal amounts of debt to do it," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
Manufacturers were expecting additional growth, too. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said today that its index of new orders rose to 60.5 in April from 59.2 in March. The inventories index dropped to 47.4 from 58.8, a sign that factories will have to step up production. The overall index was 56.5. While down from 57.4 in March, a reading higher than 50 indicates growth in manufacturing.
Incomes in February were bolstered by stronger growth in hourly earnings and in jobs, including hiring by the Census Bureau, which has added almost 500,000 temporary workers for its count of the population. Census hiring alone added $1.3 billion at an annual rate to federal civilian payrolls.
Today's Commerce Department report reaffirmed that spending was growing at a faster pace than Federal Reserve policy makers would like to see.
"We're seeing very large increases in consumer spending in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, even taking out auto sales," Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told reporters last week. "You're still seeing a very large rate of increase we believe is beyond the rate the economy can produce."

HEADLINE: Old Wounds Slow U.S.-Vietnam Reconciliation

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 28

 BODY:
In the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the end of their war on Sunday, Vietnamese and American officials traded bitter gibes today over whose side had behaved worse during and after the conflict.
On a private visit here, Senator John McCain mounted a harsh attack on Vietnam's Communist government for everything from its ideology and economy to its corruption and the fact that it displays the hammer and sickle on its banners. 
 A government spokeswoman dug into Vietnam's well-honed arsenal of political oratory and fired back, accusing the United States of "horrendous crimes against the Vietnamese people" and Mr. McCain himself of violating "the norms of morality."
The undiplomatic exchange revealed the extent to which the resentments of the past remain alive despite the elaborate expressions of friendship with which both sides had approached the anniversary.
It underscored the continuing suspicions that have slowed the flow of normal relations and created difficulties in the conclusion of a trade accord that most economic analysts say would benefit both countries.
Though both sides today flung their charges widely, a central dispute seemed to be over who had caused the most suffering to the Vietnamese people.
"I think the wrong guys won," said Mr. McCain, a not-so-surprising statement from a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner that still had the ring of an accusation. "I think that they lost millions of their best people who left by boat, thousands by execution and hundreds of thousands who went to re-education camps."
The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Phan Thuy Thanh, gave as good as she got in a statement that was carried today in the government-controlled press. "It is the United States, initiator of the war of aggression in Vietnam, which has committed horrendous crimes against the Vietnamese people," she said.
It all started on Wednesday when Mr. McCain, a Republican from Arizona, toured a small museum in Hanoi on the location of the prison where he was held for nearly six years after being shot down as a Navy pilot in 1967. He is in Vietnam with his wife, Cindy, and son Jack, 13, at a time when a number of other veterans are visiting, many of them trying to heal wounds, make amends and lay the past to rest.
Mr. McCain, who revels in a reputation for straight talking, found it appropriate -- on what was his sixth visit to the prison -- to get angry once again at the guards who had held him. "I still bear them ill will, not because of what they did to me, but because of what they did to some of my friends, including killing some of them," he told reporters.
It was a comment, paraphrased in a photo caption in the International Herald Tribune on Thursday, that government censors carefully obliterated, copy by copy, with black marker pens.
And it seemed to infuriate Ms. Thanh of the Foreign Ministry. "It runs counter to the norms of morality that those people who brought bombs and shells to sow death among our people and wreak havoc with a country now pass themselves off as having the right to criticize their victims-cum-saviors," she said.
As if egged on by her comments, Mr. McCain widened the scope of his criticisms today, accusing Vietnamese officials of only pretending to want to improve relations.
"The object of my relationship with Vietnam has been to heal the wounds that exist, particularly among our veterans, and to move forward with a positive relationship," he told reporters as he toured Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. "Apparently some in the Vietnamese government don't want to do that."
In the last month or more, as the anniversary has approached, the Hanoi government has indulged in a mood of triumphalism, parading everything from war veterans to elephants to show how it defeated the world's most powerful nation. It is an attitude that could well get under the skin of an American veteran.
In addition, the hundreds of reporters who have gathered here for the anniversary have had little news to report so far and have pursued Mr. McCain eagerly for colorful comments. He has obliged.
"There's a difference in the attitude here of the government towards foreign investment, towards a trade agreement," he said. "I see the hammer and sickle out there on banners. I'm a bit concerned about both the policies and attitudes, and the increase in corruption in this country."
Still, Mr. McCain made it clear today that there are things in Vietnam that he does like. He took his wife and son shopping for traditional rice wine with a snake in the bottle.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
American Reporter Detained
 WASHINGTON, April 28, (AP) -- Tucker Carlson, a reporter for the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard who was covering Senator John McCain's trip to Vietnam, was detained today in Ho Chi Minh City, a spokeswoman for the magazine said. When Mr. Carlson tried to board a plane back to the United States, Vietnamese officials accused him of being in the country illegally because he lacked a proper exit visa.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE INDUSTRY;
Rivals Cheer, Saying a Breakup Would Reignite Competition in Software

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 28

 BODY:
The government's proposal to break up Microsoft and force it to adhere to a stiff set of sanctions limiting its power would reignite competition in the software industry, a variety of computer industry executives said today.
The Justice Department's plan, outlined in a 17-page filing this afternoon with Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, would create two powerful companies, one with the world's dominant operating systems, covering a variety of different types of computers, and one with a wide range of software applications and development tools. 
 Both companies, though, would be forced to adhere to strict rules intended to rein in the way they wield their power in the marketplace.
"This will give the industry the kind of start it needs to restore competition," said James L. Barksdale, who testified against Microsoft while serving as chief executive of Netscape Communications.
He said that in theory he was not enthusiastic about the prospect of a corporate breakup dictated by the government, but saw no alternative in Microsoft's case because of its repeated antitrust violations.
"Almost all of us react negatively to the idea of breaking up a company," Mr. Barksdale said. "However, this is a shock to the system that will have the overall benefit of healing and curing in the marketplace."
Other executives who are Microsoft competitors said they were guardedly optimistic. "This proposal is good for Novell," said Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell, the San Jose, Calif., maker of networking software. "For a long time there have not been any rules about how to engage with Microsoft. This proposal gives us some rules with which we can judge whether competition is increasing and openness is preserved."
Other software executives said the payoff from such a change might take years but would push the industry toward renewed competition. "In the long term this is very meaningful," said John Chen, chief executive of Sybase, the Emeryville, Calif., maker of database software, which Microsoft once invested in and now competes with. "Microsoft is on every desktop, and that has given them an unfair advantage which is not related to the strength of their products."
In addition to forcing Microsoft to reorganize into two companies within 16 months after a final court ruling, the proposal made by the Justice Department and state attorneys general would impose a variety of restrictions, including a ban on exclusive agreements with partners, a ban on the company's ability to force buyers of certain operating systems to purchase other Microsoft products as well, and a restriction on the binding of "middleware" products like browsers and e-mail programs to its operating systems.
Microsoft would also be required to install a chief compliance officer reporting to the board to insure that the company complies with antitrust laws and the court's dictates.
The reorganization and the restrictions would have a direct impact on their businesses, several Silicon Valley executives said.
"This is a good remedy and it's doable," said Mitchell E. Kertzman, president and chief executive of Liberate Technologies, a San Carlos, Calif., developer of interactive television systems. A breakup, he said, would make it possible for Liberate to sell its software to work with Windows CE on next-generation set-top boxes.
"We would love to run our software on Windows CE," he said. "If Microsoft is broken up, I expect the Windows CE guys to come knocking on my door asking me to do business."
At the same time, he acknowledged that the breakup would make it possible for the new Microsoft applications company to compete with Liberate in its current markets.
"This is what the Government intended," he said. "More competition."
In Silicon Valley, some of those most pleased with the proposed breakup were venture capitalists. For a number of years during the 1990's, Microsoft executives would travel to Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., where many venture capitalists have their offices, to make annual presentations.
Many venture capitalists who attended those presentations felt that Microsoft was in effect redlining the computer industry, telling its competitors where they had opportunities and where they would be limited by Microsoft competition.
"We're restructuring the computer industry," said one venture capitalist, who has been in close contact with the Justice Department in recent weeks as the agency worked to complete its proposal.
There was not universal confidence that the plan would accomplish its goal, however.
"There is all kinds of gobbledygook coming out of the Justice Department," said Randy Komisar, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who was a co-founder of the Claris Corporation, now called Filmaker, and was later chief executive of LucasArts Entertainment. "They are hoping that by creating an applications company as aggressive as the OS company, the new company will do things like make bets on Palm and Linux. That way they will crack open the operating system market."
It will not have an immediate impact on the computer industry, he said. "This is like Reagan's trickle-down economics," he continued. "It may work, but it won't happen any time soon."
The industry's reaction -- or lack of it -- also gave an indication that Microsoft was still an intimidating force in the computer world.
Chief executives at rivals like Adobe Systems; Filemaker, a unit of Apple Computer; Intuit; and Symantec all said they were not willing to comment on the proposed breakup.
"These are tricky waters to navigate," said Steve Ruddock, a Filemaker spokesman. "I'm not sure it's intimidation, but there are a lot of companies who work with us who also partner with Microsoft."

HEADLINE: Decline of the Euro

 BODY:
The value of the euro has plunged more than 20 percent against the dollar in the 16 months since its adoption by 11 members of the European Union. The drop, from almost $1.20 in January 1999 to about 90 cents today, upsets Europeans who find a falling currency embarrassing. A deeper issue is that some Europeans fear the euro might be on the verge of free fall, which would raise the price of imports, thereby reducing living standards and adding to inflationary pressures. To keep inflation in check, the European Central Bank might decide to raise interest rates to slow the economy. American exporters worry that a falling euro -- which means a rising dollar -- will turn Europeans away from American products.
These fears are exaggerated. Currencies rise and fall. Fluctuations of the euro are far from alarming. Indeed, the basket of currencies that make up the euro rose in value before its formal introduction. Between the summer of 1998 and now, the value of those currencies has hardly budged. The United States has been growing at a fast rate, attracting a steady inflow of European capital. Europe has grown more slowly, leading to an outflow of capital. The imbalance has more people wanting to sell euros than buy them. These trends are likely to prove temporary. 
 The impact on the United States and Europe of ordinary fluctuations in the euro-dollar exchange rate is modest. Both import relatively few goods, compared with the overall size of their economies. The impact of a falling euro on the living standards of Europeans is small. Nor does a falling euro raise import prices enough to substantially affect inflation. The danger is that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates anyway, just to maintain the value of the euro high enough for Europe to keep bragging about its new currency -- a dangerous trap for a Continent whose unemployment rates hover at more than twice the American level.
Europe appears to be making more of the euro's problems than its fluctuations deserve. Most of the Continent is recovering well. Inflation is subdued. When the euro was born, many Europeans boasted that it would challenge the dollar for international supremacy. Those hopes have been temporarily dashed. But the euro is young. As the European Union expands, so too will use of the euro. The euro is here to stay, though its value will continue to move up and down.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE COMPANY;
At Microsoft's Home Base, Vitriol and a Sense of Unfairness

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 28

 BODY:
"Very disturbing," "unprecedented," "out of bounds," "extreme" and "radical" were a few of the angry words that came out of William H. Gates's mouth shortly after the government's formal proposal today to break up Microsoft, the software company he co-founded 25 years ago and built into a high-technology giant.
"This was not developed by anyone who knows anything about the software business," Mr. Gates said. 
 Microsoft's chief counsel, William Neukom, assailed the sweeping proposal from the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general as a "regulatory death penalty," with demands that were "out of all proportion to the case itself."
And the company's president and chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, said he was "disappointed beyond belief" by the government's recommendations.
With settlement talks having dissolved in failure a few weeks ago and the judge in the landmark case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, having ruled that Microsoft illegally put its "oppressive thumb" on competitors, the company once again came out swinging today.
Its executives repeatedly said that any breakup would be a terrible thing for customers and promised that the proposal would never survive an appeals process that could well reach the United States Supreme Court.
Mr. Gates, in a telephone conference call the company arranged shortly after the government's filing became public, emphatically rejected the idea of some on Wall Street that Microsoft might be worth more broken up in parts than intact. And he said that the regulatory curbs the company wanted to place on his company would stifle innovation as the company works on its next generation of software products.
"These proposals would block us from doing new product work," said Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and now its chief software architect. "Microsoft could never have developed Windows under these rules. We couldn't have developed Windows because without the great work of the Office team and the Windows team, it never would have come together."
"This proposal," Mr. Gates asserted, "takes away any incentive for us to do new work by saying that the intellectual property has to be given away to other companies."
Across the company's campus in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, seemingly ever expanding and now up to 41 buildings, employees continued to express frustration at the way Microsoft had been depicted in court.
"The reality is not what I'm seeing played out in Judge Jackson's court," said Bruce M. Brooks, a former deputy mayor of Seattle, who is Microsoft's director of community affairs. "The reality is what I see here every day with our employees. It just doesn't square with this idea of an evil empire, a big predator."
Company leaders continued to reassure employees that Microsoft would never be broken up, and that seems to remain the prevailing opinion on the Microsoft campus.
"I believe it's more likely that we would get acquired by some other company than that we would ever get broken up," said Tod Nielsen, a 12-year Microsoft veteran who is vice president for product and business planning in one of Microsoft's major groups.
Asked what company might ever be in a position to acquire Microsoft, Mr. Nielsen replied: "That's the point. It's not going to happen."
But even as many executives said they were continuing to focus on their particular work projects and had faith that the company's legal team would prevail, the case remains an obvious distraction here.
And it is widely seen as the prime culprit in the drop in the company's stock price, which has wiped out more than $250 billion worth of market value in the last four months. From an record high of nearly $120 a share on Dec. 30, the stock recently reached a 16-month low near $65. It ended regular trading yesterday at $69.75, down 6.25 cents, then edged up after hours.
Mr. Ballmer provided employees with a big morale boost this week by announcing that Microsoft would give workers options to buy shares at about $66, allaying concerns for those who hold other options pegged to much higher market prices.
He is going on a public relations offensive, appearing in a television advertisement scheduled to be broadcast starting this weekend that is similar to one in which Mr. Gates spoke a few weeks ago.
"When I joined Bill Gates and Microsoft 20 years ago," Mr. Ballmer says in the ad, "the PC was very new. This year, three people buy one every second. Now I'm the president of Microsoft and we're still focused on innovating, delivering value and listening to customers. Technology is fueling America's economy; our next generation of software will do even more."
And in what is becoming something of a slogan for the company, Mr. Ballmer, who met Mr. Gates in college, concluded, "The best is yet to come."
While Attorney General Janet Reno today called the government's proposal "the right remedy at the right time," Microsoft said it would file its objections to the proposal on May 10. In offering a long catalog of grievances with the government's approach in the antitrust case, Mr. Gates argued that the Justice Department was trying to apply an old- economy approach in a new economic era.
"It's not, you know, a company that owns mines or resources or anything like that," Mr. Gates said. "What we have are smart people who work together as a team, and it's only by working as a team that we've been able to do our great work."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE PENALTY;
A 'Surgical' Solution

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft two years ago, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, explained in a private meeting his concept of "surgical" government intervention. In the case of Microsoft, he said, it could well include breaking up the company.
"It would be drastic surgery, but it's surgical," Mr. Klein said, according to a person who attended the meeting. 
 With its proposal yesterday, filed in a federal court in Washington, the government has formally opted for surgery, a split-up of Microsoft into two companies and a variety of restraints on its business practices for three years. But the government regards that surgery as the conservative treatment -- less regulatory and less likely to harm consumers or the industry than the alternatives.
The government proposal, supporting memorandum and affidavits from three economists, two computer experts and a pair of investment bankers are emphatically documents not only of persuasion, but also of education.
The thick pile of papers is intended to convince Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the breakup plan is likely to be the most effective and least regulatory way to ensure competition in software markets under the sway of a company that Judge Jackson has ruled is a "predatory" monopolist. And they do so by going step by step through the same arduous intellectual trek that the government and states took in recent months to arrive at such a sweeping solution to "the Microsoft problem."
The government must give Judge Jackson -- and higher courts, since appeals are assured -- the confidence to take what would be a drastic step indeed: breaking up a company that is an American symbol of technological excellence and wealth creation. It operates in a fast-moving, dynamic industry, suggesting further reason to hesitate before reshaping the software industry by court edict. "The government has put together a well-thought-out package, but this is uncharted territory," observed Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "No one can say with real assurance that this is the right answer."
Yet Judge Jackson invited a proposal of severe sanctions with his ruling earlier this month that the company repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws by using its market power to stifle competition and innovation, especially the challenge to its dominance represented by the rise of Internet software.
The Justice Department and states, in their papers, used their trial victory as the starting point of their argument. "A strong remedy is thus essential on the record of this case," the plaintiffs' memorandum declared. Without such a solution, they said, Microsoft's "actions threaten an enormous toll on competition and innovation in the computing and information technology industries."
Throughout the papers by the government and supporting experts, one line of argument that emerges is that the remedy proposed is likely to be the best because alternatives that could be worse were not taken. The government chose to recommend breaking up along functional lines: Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system business in one company, while another company would get the rest, including Word word processing, Excel spreadsheet and MSN Internet service.
But the government pointed out that it had rejected a breakup alternative that would have given the Windows operating system to two or three companies. That would have created immediate competition in the market for personal computer operating systems, in which the court determined Microsoft had a monopoly, with nearly 85 percent of personal computers running Windows. Yet there were fears in the industry and on Wall Street that such a breakup would have led to consumer confusion with different flavors of incompatible Windows and huge losses to Microsoft shareholders.
The government shunned that approach because of the risk of "efficiency losses," in the understated prose of its memorandum.
"This is the most conservative of the structural split-ups," noted Garth Saloner, an economist at the Stanford University business school.
In their supporting paper, the two investment bankers try to provide assurance to the court that the kind of breakup being proposed should not cause huge losses to shareholders. Robert F. Greenhill and Jeffrey P. Williams wrote that the government's proposal "will not result in a material decrease in market value over the intermediate to long term," studiously sidestepping any handicapping of how the stock market might react next week.
And in the long term, the breakup "could be positive" for Microsoft shareholders, who will get shares in each of the two companies, by unlocking value. The reasoning is that each of the two companies will probably be dominant in its respective market -- Microsoft productivity programs like Word and Excel hold market shares of more than 90 percent. Investors might thus prefer to hold shares in two monopolies instead of one.
Throughout the case, the government has pointed to the future. Sure, the government has said, the nation's high-technology markets look vibrant, but innovation could have been even faster were it not for Microsoft's chokehold on the software market. Innovation in Internet software like the browser, they say, could have been even faster without Microsoft's influence. Microsoft's campaign against Netscape Communications, the Web browser pioneer, was at the center of the government's antitrust suit.
The government called on Paul Romer, a Stanford University economist, to make its most forceful innovation arguments. The goal of any remedy, he argues, should be to make sure that tomorrow's upstart entrepreneurs are not discouraged from competing against Microsoft. "This remedy," he wrote, "will significantly increase the returns that outside innovators, the potential new entrants, can hope to earn if they develop and commercialize a powerful new technology like the browser."
The government has mustered a formidable corps of experts to argue the case for what it wants to do. Microsoft, of course, will have its turn to file its counterarguments, which will be that the government's proposal is dangerously extreme and not justified by the evidence in the case.
"No doubt there's a sincere belief in Justice that this can be done cleanly," said Lloyd Cutler, the former White House counsel in the Clinton administration who has filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Microsoft. "But I think this is the kind of heavy-handed regulation that Joel Klein has long said he wants to avoid, and it's very risky for the economy."
In the end, it is up to Judge Jackson. And, as was not the case in the trial, he does not have to side with the plaintiff or the defendant. His job is merely to shape what he believes to be the appropriate remedy.
"The ball is really in Jackson's hands now," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. "He's not bound by the recommendations of either side on remedies. And the result could be that his ultimate remedy does not closely resemble the proposals of either side."
 
What Happens Next
Now that the Justice Department and 17 states have asked Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to break Microsoft into two companies, the next step is up to Microsoft.
The company can respond in court on May 10, and Judge Jackson is to begin hearings on May 24 in preparation for issuing his final remedy. When that will come depends, in part, on how long the hearings last.
Judge Jackson had originally intended to issue a final ruling this summer. But Microsoft says it will ask for extensive discovery and in-court testimony. That process could take months, perhaps delaying the judge's decision until after the November presidential election.

Chart: "Reining In Microsoft"
In addition to asking that Microsoft be split up, which may not happen for a while if it happens at all, the government asked that the company's activities immediately be restricted in a series of measures called conduct remedies. They are:
 
Microsoft cannot take retaliatory action against companies or individuals that testified against it in the trial.
 
Microsoft cannot take retaliatory action against computer makers that load competitors' software on their computers.
 
Microsoft must allow computer makers to alter the Windows operating system so that the first screen users see is the manufacturer's, not Microsoft's.
 
Microsoft must provide information about how software interacts with Windows to other software companies so that their programs can be more efficient.
 
If Microsoft adds new programs or features to Windows, it must sell a version at a lower price with the features or programs hidden or removed.
 
Microsoft cannot try to divide markets in a way that would reserve part of the market for some Microsoft products.
 
Microsoft must form an antitrust compliance committee with a chief compliance officer who reports to the company's chairman and its chief executive.
 
Microsoft must publish a standardized price list for Windows that is the same for all computer makers.
 
Microsoft cannot design Windows so that it disables or compromises programs from other companies.
 
Microsoft cannot have exclusive deals with, or retaliate against, other software or Internet companies.
 
Microsoft cannot tie other software products to Windows by sales contracts.

HEADLINE: A Brazilian Convict's Path From Poverty to 'a Very Dark Place'

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
The murderer is mute, his eyes distant, as the familiar sounds of prayer and desperation rise from the world's largest prison into the inky sky of a swift tropical dusk.
It has been a long time now, more than five years of incarceration, long enough for Leandro Luis Bernardo Dias to learn the ways of this prison seething with more than 7,200 people: the suspicion, the drugs, the betrayals, the stabbings, the AIDS, the hymns that come at close of day and the cries of protest that announce the night. 
 "This is a shadowy place," Mr. Dias, 25, said, stirring from his reverie. "Fear lives inside every prisoner. Anyone who denies that is lying. Fear of the violence. Fear of this all-male darkness. Fear you will never get out. But I talk to God every day and ask him to see me through."
Faith, the other face of despair, is alive behind the high walls of Carandiru prison. It is written in the tattoos of Christ the Savior on the backs of countless inmates. Such images were held by slaves to provide protection against beatings.
Brazil's slaves have gone, but not the violence of social conflict that has pushed the number of homicides a year in Sao Paulo up to more than 8,500 -- "an undeclared civil war," in the words of Luiz Carlos dos Santos, a social worker, and a rate of killing now over 10 times that in the five New York boroughs.
Call Carandiru the underside of Brazil's startling development over the past decade. As the country has opened to the world, new possibilities have opened up for many people. But here in its economic capital, violence has also soared as the arrival of new luxury goods has made the gulf between rich and poor ever more glaring.
Mr. Dias is one of the many killers. Back in 1994, offended in an argument, he strangled a man. Then he dumped the body in the River Tiete, which crosses Sao Paulo state, regularly flooding this vast city.
"I am very determined in what I do," he said. "And I was in the murder too." Case closed. Leandro Dias has admitted killing Alirio Soares on July 28, 1994. Who could safely say no further menace lies in those sullen eyes and powerful arms, this damaged life?
But two days spent with Mr. Dias inside Carandiru, and an investigation of the murder, suggest a more nuanced story of personal redemption. This young killer's story is also one that speaks of Brazil's skewed development, its abject poverty, its social crisis and its unmistakable message that life is cheap.
Nowhere cheaper than in crumbling Carandiru itself. Here, on Oct. 2, 1992, military police officers called in to quash a rebellion massacred 111 prisoners. Years of investigation have yielded no explanation and no prosecutions. The chronic overcrowding that lay behind the uprising has not abated.
"We should have 5,000 prisoners in here, instead of over 7,000," said Mauricio Guarnieri, the director of Carandiru. "Everyone has a bed, but sometimes we have 15 to a cell. The problem is we have put up 21 prisons in Sao Paulo state in recent years, with a total capacity of 18,000, and they are all full. We cannot keep pace with the rising crime."
Carandiru, a legendary complex of seven blocks, sprawls across a central area of the world's third-largest city, home to 17 million people, 20 percent of them slum residents. Helicopters ferrying executives to work in the glimmering high-rises of the Avenida Paulista crisscross the sky above shanties rank with the stench of sewage.
In this almost surreal context, the revolver has emerged as the most powerful social leveler. "The most visible social difference used to be between a Volkswagen Beetle and some locally produced sedan," said Marco Vinicio Petrelluzzi, the city's top official for public security. "Now it's between the same old Beetle and an imported Ferrari. Globalization has brought new models of consumption relentlessly pushed on TV. And for many, crack and crime are the only route to coveted goods."
 
A Difficult Childhood
One of six children, Mr. Dias grew up dirt-poor in the dismal Brasilandia section of Sao Paulo. His father was an occasional house painter; his mother did odd jobs as a maid and a ticket inspector on buses. Despite hardship, he was a good student, never repeating a year of school.
"Things were all right growing up," he said. "But in that environment, you quickly understand how easy the access is to drugs and weapons. And I was intrigued by that world, especially after my Dad was killed and things fell apart."
The young man's eyes retreated again, to some distant point of pain. Asked about the fate of his father, he replied in a matter-of-fact way: "Yes, my father was killed by my aunt. She stabbed him in her kitchen when I was 12 years old."
Fatima Bernardo Dias still lives in the two rooms perched on a hill where her imprisoned son grew up. As in many Brazilian favelas, or slums, the view is a fine one, out to the lush hills beyond the city. But the immediate reality is one of grit and struggle. "We've always battled to eat," she said.
On one wall of the kitchen that now doubles as her youngest son's bedroom, she has hung a heart carved in wood and sent from Carandiru prison. Dated July 6, 1996, it says simply: "To the best mother in the world, from her son Leandro."
Beside the heart is an image of the Last Supper with the words: "Where there is faith, there is love. Where there is love, there is peace. Where there is peace, there is God. Where there is God, nothing is lacking."
Life has not been that simple. Fatima's late husband, Jose, sometimes turned violent when drunk. Once, mad with jealousy, he went for her with a screwdriver. Twice they separated; two of her six children were born to other men. But the marriage survived and Jose was always particularly close to the couple's first son, Leandro.
So when Jose was killed, the effects were traumatic on his young son. "Leandro would sometimes look at photographs of his father and vow to take revenge," Mrs. Dias said. "He told me he would hunt down his aunt."
The exact circumstances of Jose's death remain sketchy, but this much has been established: during an altercation in which Jose may have struck his sister, Jane, she stabbed him with a kitchen knife. He died soon afterward of an internal hemorrhage.
Nothing unusual in this, just another death in a Brazilian slum, where a one-dollar debt on a crack deal or a stolen pair of sneakers may be enough to extinguish a life. "Death has become entirely banal," said Regina Pastrana, a social worker.
Jane Dias said that she acted in self-defense and had been cleared of any crime. A hairdresser today, with a defiant air, she added, "Of course, nobody's conscience can be entirely at peace in a country with this many problems."
With his father dead, those problems crowded in on Leandro Dias. He had to leave school to find a job to support his mother. He started as an office boy. His mother recalls him returning home with his first salary still sealed in an envelope for her.
But her son soon became more capricious. He would disappear at night without saying where he was going. Fatima warned the adolescent boy: We are poor but what we have we have earned; God wants our hands and our souls to be clean.
The advice fell on deaf ears. At the age of 15, Mr. Dias found himself with a gun in his hand for the first time. The power of it, the adrenaline rush, remain vivid. "Things started small," he recalled. "Rob the bakery. Rob the corner shop. How else was I going to have a nice car, nice clothes?"
Deeply worried, Fatima decided to move the family in early 1994. Her father owned a tiny shack in the country, up the River Tiete, about 40 miles from Sao Paulo. It was a difficult place to survive the nearest store was a 10-mile walk -- but it seemed safe.
With reluctance, Leandro Dias followed. He took occasional work as a farmhand. He also helped the family by milking the cow of an aging, solitary, often drunken caretaker named Alirio Soares, who minded an estate and would pay him with some of the milk.
One day, after he had been drinking with a friend, Mr. Dias arrived late to milk the cow. The old man, who carried a knife and had rum on his breath, started to insult him. "I was not going to be a victim of my own hesitation," Mr. Dias recalled.
He went for Mr. Soares, grasping the man's neck with his large hands, squeezing the life from his victim with what he now calls a "crazed, unjustifiable rage that started with a row over a bucket of milk." Casting the stripped body into the muddy brown water, he believed the river would take it.
But the corpse caught on a bank, where it was found several days later by a local policeman, Claudio Cruz. "Shocking in this quiet environment," Mr. Cruz said. It is true that the gently swirling river, the grazing horses, and the dense green vegetation at the spot seem utterly alien to violence.
Mr. Dias fled, back to Sao Paulo. He fell in with some Korean smugglers, but a dispute over payments quickly led to more violence. On Oct. 24, 1994, Mr. Dias injured one of the Koreans in a knife attack.
Just over a month later, he was arrested while at work on a building site in Sao Paulo. At 20, he had already been on the streets for eight years. Mr. Dias confessed to the murder, believing his claim that he acted in self-defense would be recognized.
After being sentenced to 23 years in prison, Mr. Dias was escorted into the labyrinth of Carandiru, a prison large enough to resemble a detention camp. So began what he now calls "my descent into a very dark place."
 
Misery Behind Bars
The prisoner took down his pants, revealing his genitals. One testicle was swollen to the size of a large orange. The doctor, Drauzio Varella, examined the condition, shaking his head.
He works on the first floor of Carandiru's Block Five by the light of a naked bulb hung from the crumbling ceiling of a windowless room with no sink.
"Uncomfortable, but not life-threatening," Dr. Varella muttered, as he handed the prisoner some pills, and the next patient, Danilo Silva dos Santos, shuffled in, his skin covered in spots.
Mr. dos Santos, like about 15 percent of the inmates of Carandiru, is H.I.V.-positive. He also has tuberculosis, a skin infection, only one kidney, and three bullets in his body, mementos of the day police officers opened fire on him.
"I was dealing crack to pay the rent," said Mr. dos Santos, 19. "My friend fired on the police, and they fired back." He clutched his side, looked the doctor in the eye, and said, "I cannot stand the pain."
After a decade making weekly visits to Carandiru, Dr. Varella has seen everything in Mr. Dias's "dark place." He labors without laboratory support and in the knowledge that his only hope of getting a prisoner into a hospital is to report, "Immediate risk to life."
"The problem is simple: This society produces bandits much faster than it can produce prisons," Dr. Varella said. "The main reasons are inequality, police corruption and impunity. Of every 30 violent crimes in the city, one is brought to justice. The situation is out of control."
On the top floor of Block Five is the maximum-security zone, where prisoners regarded as a threat to others, or menaced with death themselves because of unpaid drug debts, are locked up.
Once a week, on Saturday morning, they are allowed into a yard for exercise. The rest of the time, they are often to be heard beating on walls, drumming on saucepans or crying out.
But these sounds are mere background noise, no more notable than Muzak to the prisoners, dressed in khaki, who lie slumped at the base of yellowish walls gazing into space. Many faces look stunned beyond feeling.
"Perhaps 90 percent of the prisoners arrive here on drugs," said Carlos Alberto Salce, who helps organize teams of workers in the prison. "They have nothing to believe in -- not family, not society, nothing. They let go."
Dr. Varella encourages them to hang on. To an H.I.V.-positive transvestite who uses the female name of Soninha Timo and is suffering from muscular problems caused by a body-changing injection of industrial silicone, he gives straightforward instructions: "Stop using crack, because it makes everything worse."
Mr. Dias knows well how dangerous the drugs are. When he entered the prison in 1994, it seemed to him that only crack could provide him with the oblivion he craved. "I was without hope," he said.
 
The Oblivion of Drugs
Life was reduced to the repetitive quest for the drug. It was in plentiful supply -- "the drugs do not come from the sky with the rain, they come through the people who work here," Mr. Dias said. But finding the money to pay for them was another matter.
A "pedra," or single dose of crack, costs about one dollar inside the prison. Mr. Guarnieri, the prison director, has no illusions about underpaid prison employees' role as the conduit. "We know what's happening, but it's very hard to stop," he said.
Public employees in Brazil, like the 800 Carandiru prison workers and the Sao Paulo police, often receive very low salaries that encourage corruption.
But because states and municipalities are heavily indebted, and because federal regulations generally make it impossible to cut staff through firing, the situation festers.
Mr. Dias scrambled to survive. He saw several prisoners die in disputes over drugs, generally stabbed. With miniature saws smuggled into Carandiru, some inmates contrive sharp implements out of metal cut from window bars. The prison murder rate runs at about 30 a year.
For Mr. Dias's mother, the anxiety was overwhelming.
She recalled the insistent requests from her son. Mother, I need $40. Mother, I need $20. Mother, I "smoked" my friend's television set -- used it to pay a drug debt -- and owe him $200. By tomorrow.
She borrowed money herself to pay these debts. On the last occasion, in the summer of 1996, she went to the prison on her birthday to deliver the cash and was greeted by another angry prisoner who said: "It was only out of respect for you that I did not bring you the head of your son, Leandro."
She pleaded with her son once more. He replied: "Mother, believe me, pay this, and I will never cause you hardship again." She was naturally skeptical, but Mr. Dias has been true to his word.
 
A New Beginning
It is now almost four years since Mr. Dias quit drugs, found faith and began the attempt to remake his life. He works as the leader of a group of 142 prisoners who make posters, calendars, kites and other products for a Sao Paulo company. Every three days worked inside the prison earns one day off his sentence.
He is organized, brisk in his instructions and movements. Mr. Salce, the prison employee, calls Mr. Dias "a model for others."
Mr. Dias's tiny cell is neatly ordered, with a mattress on a ledge beneath the window and a small television in a corner. A photograph of a little girl is prominently displayed. "She is my hope," he said.
The girl, a 1-year-old, is Mr. Dias's daughter, Sabrina dos Santos Bernardo Dias, a pretty thing with curly hair and smudgy brown eyes. She was conceived in this cell during one of the "visitas intimas" -- "intimate visits" -- allowed every two weeks.
The mother, Ana Celia dos Santos, 32, was visiting a brother-in-law in the prison when she met Mr. Dias. She now lives in a small apartment not far from Mr. Dias's home in Brasilandia. She has five children, by several different men. The latest, Mr. Dias's daughter, sits on her lap.
"Leandro is obsessed by this little girl," she said. "He is so affectionate to her, and he promises that one day he will take us all to a quiet place."
That place is not Sao Paulo. If Mr. Dias has changed, his hometown has not. Col. Jose Vicente, the former chief of security for Sao Paulo state, said attempts to fight crime continued to be frustrated by disorganization and outdated methods.
"We are working with a law code from the 1940's," he said. "We are not allowed to do sting operations. Justice is painfully slow. We cannot use videos as evidence. We have 83,000 military police and 35,000 civil police. So in most situations, you have two chiefs, two cars, two bureaucracies, and no results."
Even working every day and maintaining his model behavior, Mr. Dias probably faces another 15 years in Carandiru. He knows there are other prisoners who now regard him as a "do-gooder" and are out to get him. But he is determined. "Now that I have a family," he said, "I have to keep on the path I have set."
His mother, Fatima, is sure that "the violence has gone out of him now." She shows the last card from him, received from Carandiru. It reads, "We need to be strong, trust in God, and continue struggling. I love you, Mom."
Holding the card, Fatima Dias broke into tears. "This," she said simply, "is the dark side of my heart."

Excerpts From the Remedies Proposed by the Plaintiffs in the Case

 BODY:
Following are key portions of the plaintiffs' proposed remedies filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Washington in the antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation:
 
1. REORGANIZATION 

a. Not later than four months after entry of this Final Judgment, Microsoft shall submit to the Court and the Plaintiffs a proposed plan of reorganization. The Plaintiffs shall submit any objections to the proposed plan of reorganization to the Court within 60 days of receipt of the plan, and Microsoft shall submit its response within 30 days of receipt of the plaintiffs' objections.
 
b. Following approval of a final plan of reorganization by the Court (the "Plan") (and the expiration of the stay pending appeal set forth in section 6.a.), Microsoft shall implement such Plan.
 
c. The Plan shall provide for the completion, within 12 months of the expiration of the stay pending appeal set forth in section 6.a., of the following steps:
 
i. The separation of the Operating Systems Business from the Applications Business, and the transfer of the assets of one of them (the "Separated Business") to a separate entity along with (a) all personnel, systems, and other tangible and intangible assets (including Intellectual Property) used to develop, produce, distribute, market, promote, sell, license and support the products and services of the Separated Business, and (b) such other assets as are necessary to operate the Separated Business as an independent and economically viable entity.
 
ii. Intellectual Property that is used both in a product developed, distributed, or sold by the Applications Business and in a product developed, distributed, or sold by the Operating Systems Business as of April 27, 2000, shall be assigned to the Applications Business, and the Operating Systems Business shall be granted a perpetual, royalty-free license to license and distribute such Intellectual Property in its products, and, except with respect to such Intellectual Property related to the Internet browser, to develop, license and distribute modified or derivative versions of such Intellectual Property provided that the Operating Systems Business does not grant rights to such versions to the Applications Business. In the case of such Intellectual Property that is related to the Internet browser, the license shall not grant the Operating System Business any right to develop, license, or distribute modified or derivative versions of the Internet browser.
 
iii. The transfer of ownership of the Separated Business by means of a spinoff of stock of the Separated Business to Non-Covered Shareholders of Microsoft, or by other disposition that does not result in a Covered Shareholder owning stock in both the Separated Business and the Remaining Business.
 
d. Until Implementation of the Plan, Microsoft shall
 
i. preserve, maintain, and operate the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business as ongoing, economically viable businesses, with management, sales, products, and operations of each business held as separate, distinct and apart from one another as they were on April 27, 2000, except to provide the accounting, management, and information services or other necessary support functions provided by Microsoft prior to the entry of this Final Judgment.
 
ii. use all reasonable efforts to maintain and increase the sales and revenues of both the products produced or sold by the Operating Systems Business and those produced or sold by the Applications Business prior to the Implementation of the Plan and to support research and development and business development efforts of both the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business;
 
iii. take no action that undermines, frustrates, interferes with, or makes more difficult the reorganization required by this Final Judgment without the prior approval of the Court; and
 
iv. file a report with the Court sixty days after entry of this Final Judgment on the steps Microsoft has taken to comply with the requirements of this section 1.d.
 
2. PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING REORGANIZATION
 
a. After Implementation of the Plan, and throughout the term of this Final Judgment, neither the Operating Systems Business nor the Applications Business, nor any member of their respective Boards of Directors, shall acquire any securities or assets of the other Business; no Covered Shareholder holding securities of either the Operating Systems Business or the Applications Business shall acquire any securities or assets of or shall be an officer, director, or employee of the other Business; and no person who is an officer, director, or employee of the Operating Systems Business or the Applications Business shall be an officer, director, or employee of the other Business.
 
b. After Implementation of the Plan and throughout the term of the Final Judgment, the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business shall be prohibited from:
 
i. merging or otherwise recombining, or entering into any joint venture with one another;
 
ii. entering into any Agreement under which one of the Businesses develops, sells, licenses for sale or distribution, or distributes products or services developed, sold, licensed, or distributed by the other Business;
 
iii. providing to the other any APIs, Technical Information, Communications Interfaces, or technical information that is not simultaneously published, disclosed, or made readily available to ISVs, IHVs, and OEMs; and
 
iv. licensing, selling or otherwise providing to the other Business any product or service on terms more favorable than those available to any similarly situated third party.
 
c. After Implementation of the Plan and throughout the term of this Final Judgment, the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business shall file with the Plaintiffs a copy of each Agreement (and a memorandum describing each oral Agreement) entered into between them.
 
d. Throughout the term of this Final Judgment, Microsoft, the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business shall be prohibited from taking adverse action against any person or entity in whole or in part because such person or entity provided evidence in this case.
 
e. The obligations and restrictions set forth in sections 3 and 4 herein concerning Microsoft shall, after the Implementation of the Plan, apply only to the Operating Systems Business.
 
3. PROVISIONS IN EFFECT UNTIL FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
 The provisions in this section 3 shall remain in effect until the earlier of three years after the Implementation of the Plan or the expiration of the term of this Final Judgment.
 
a. OEM Relations
 
i. Ban on Adverse Actions for Supporting Competing Products. Microsoft shall not take or threaten any action adversely affecting any OEM (including but not limited to giving or withholding any consideration such as licensing terms; discounts; technical, marketing, and sales support; enabling programs; product information; technical information; information about future plans; developer tools or developer support; hardware certification; and permission to display trademarks or logos) based directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on any actual or contemplated action by that OEM:
 
(1) to use, distribute, promote, license, develop, produce or sell any product or service that competes with any Microsoft product or service; or
 
(2) to exercise any of the options or alternatives provided under this Final Judgment.
 
ii. Uniform Terms for Windows Operating System Products Licensed to Covered OEMs. Microsoft shall license Windows Operating System Products to Covered OEMs pursuant to uniform license agreements with uniform terms and conditions and shall not employ market development allowances or discounts in connection with Windows Operating System Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft shall charge each Covered OEM the applicable royalty for Windows Operating System Products as set forth on a schedule, to be established by Microsoft and published on its web site, that provides for uniform royalties for Windows Operating System Products, except that
 
(1) the schedule may specify different royalties for different language versions, and
 
(2) the schedule may specify reasonable volume discounts based upon actual volume of total shipments of Windows Operating System Products.
 
 Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft shall afford Covered OEMs equal access to licensing terms; discounts; technical, marketing, and sales support; product information; technical information; information about future plans; developer tools or developer support; hardware certification; and permission to display trademarks or logos. The foregoing requirement insofar as it relates to access to technical information and information about future plans shall not apply to any bona fide joint development effort by Microsoft and a Covered OEM with respect to confidential matters within the scope of that effort. Microsoft shall not terminate a Covered OEM's license for a Windows Operating System Product without having first given the Covered OEM written notice of the reason for proposed termination and not less than thirty days' opportunity to cure. Microsoft shall not enforce any provision in any Agreement with a Covered OEM that is inconsistent with this Final Judgment
 
iii. OEM Flexibility in Product Configuration. Microsoft shall not restrict (by contract or otherwise, including but not limited to granting or withholding consideration) an OEM from modifying the boot sequence, startup folder, internet connection wizard, desktop, preferences, favorites, start page, first screen, or other aspect of a Windows Operating System Product to:
 
(1) include a registration sequence to obtain subscription or other information from the user;
 
(2) display icons of or otherwise feature other products or services, regardless of the size or shape of such icons or features, or to remove the icons, folders, start menu entries, or favorites of Microsoft products or services;
 
(3) display any user interfaces, provided that an icon is also displayed that allows the user to access the Windows user interface; or
 
(4) launch automatically any non-Microsoft Middleware, Operating System or application, offer its own Internet access provider or other start-up sequence, or offer an option to make non-Microsoft Middleware the Default Middleware and to remove the means of End-User Access for Microsoft's Middleware Product.
 
b. Disclosure of APIs, Interfaces and Technical Information. Microsoft shall disclose to ISVs, IHVs, and OEMs in a Timely Manner, in whatever media Microsoft disseminates such information to its own personnel, all APIs, Technical Information and Communications Interfaces that Microsoft employs to enable:
 
i. Microsoft applications to interoperate with Microsoft Platform Software installed on the same Personal Computer, or
 
ii. a Microsoft Middleware Product to interoperate with Windows Operating System software (or Middleware distributed with such Operating System) installed on the same Personal Computer, or
 
iii. any Microsoft software installed on one computer (including but not limited to server Operating Systems and operating systems for handheld devices) to interoperate with a Windows Operating System (or Middleware distributed with such Operating System) installed on a Personal Computer.
 
 To facilitate compliance, and monitoring of compliance, with the foregoing, Microsoft shall create a secure facility where qualified representatives of OEMs, ISVs, and IHVs shall be permitted to study, interrogate and interact with relevant and necessary portions of the source code and any related documentation of Microsoft Platform Software for the sole purpose of enabling their products to interoperate effectively with Microsoft Platform Software (including exercising any of the options in section 3.a.iii).
 
c. Knowing Interference with Performance. Microsoft shall not take any action that it knows will interfere with or degrade the performance of any non-Microsoft Middleware when interoperating with any Windows Operating System Product without notifying the supplier of such non-Microsoft Middleware in writing that Microsoft intends to take such action, Microsoft's reasons for taking the action, and any ways known to Microsoft for the supplier to avoid or reduce interference with, or the degrading of, the performance of the supplier's Middleware.
 
d. Developer Relations. Microsoft shall not take or threaten any action affecting any ISV or IHV (including but not limited to giving or withholding any consideration such as licensing terms; discounts; technical, marketing, and sales support; enabling programs; product information; technical information; information about future plans; developer tools or developer support; hardware certification; and permission to display trademarks or logos) based directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on any actual or contemplated action by that ISV or IHV to:
 
i. use, distribute, promote, or support any Microsoft product or service, or
 
ii. develop, use, distribute, promote or support software that runs on non-Microsoft Middleware or a non-Microsoft Operating System or that competes with any Microsoft product or service, or
 
iii. exercise any of the options or alternatives provided under this Final Judgment.
 
e. Ban on Exclusive Dealing. Microsoft shall not enter into or enforce any agreement in which a third party agrees, or is offered or granted consideration, to:
 
i. limit its development, production, distribution, promotion or use of, or payment for, any non-Microsoft Platform Software,
 
ii. distribute, promote or use any Microsoft Platform Software exclusively,
 
iii. degrade the performance of any non-Microsoft Platform Software, or
 
iv. in the case of an agreement with an Internet access provider or Internet content provider, distribute, promote or use Microsoft software in exchange for placement with respect to any aspect of a Windows Operating System Product.
 
f. Ban on Contractual Tying. Microsoft shall not condition the granting of a Windows Operating System Product license, or the terms or administration of such license, on an OEM or other licensee agreeing to license, promote, or distribute any other Microsoft software product that Microsoft distributes separately from the Windows Operating System Product in the retail channel or through Internet access providers, Internet content providers, ISVs or OEMs, whether or not for a separate or positive price.
 
g. Restriction on Binding Middleware Products to Operating System Products. Microsoft shall not, in any Operating System Product distributed six or more months after the effective date of this Final Judgment, Bind any Middleware Product to a Windows Operating System unless:
 
i. Microsoft also offers an otherwise identical version of that Operating System Product in which all means of End-User Access to that Middleware Product can readily be removed (a) by OEMs as part of standard OEM preinstallation kits and (b) by end users using add-remove utilities readily accessible in the initial boot process and from the Windows desktop; and
 
ii. when an OEM removes End-User Access to a Middleware Product from any Personal Computer on which Windows is preinstalled, the royalty paid by that OEM for that copy of Windows is reduced in an amount not less than the product of the otherwise applicable royalty and the ratio of the number of amount in bytes of binary code of (a) the Middleware Product as distributed separately from a Windows Operating System Product to (b) the applicable version of Windows.
 
h. Agreements Limiting Competition. Microsoft shall not offer, agree to provide, or provide any consideration to any actual or potential Platform Software competitor in exchange for such competitor's agreeing to refrain or refraining in whole or in part from developing, licensing, promoting or distributing any Operating System Product or Middleware Product competitive with any Windows Operating System Product or Middleware Product.
 
i. Continued Licensing of Predecessor Version. Microsoft shall, when it makes a major Windows Operating System Product release (such as Windows 95, OSR 2.0, OSR 2.5, Windows 98, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows "Millennium," "Whistler," "Blackcomb," and successors to these), continue for three years after said release to license on the same terms and conditions the previous Windows Operating System Product to any OEM that desires such a license. The net royalty rate for the previous Windows Operating System Product shall be no more than the average royalty paid by the OEM for such Product prior to the release. The OEM shall be free to market Personal Computers in which it preinstalls such an Operating System Product in the same manner in which it markets Personal Computers preinstalled with other Windows Operating System Products.
 
4. INTERNAL ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE

 This section shall remain in effect throughout the term of this Final Judgment.
 
a. Within 30 days after the effective date of this Final Judgment, Microsoft shall establish a Compliance Committee of its corporate Board of Directors, consisting of not fewer than three members of the Board of Directors who are not present or former employees of Microsoft.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
An Imbalance In the Battle Over Custody

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
AFTER his experience in Queens Family Court, Mihai Muset has a slightly different perspective on the system of justice in his native Romania. During Communist rule in 1982, when he was 24 years old, he was arrested for carrying a protest banner in Bucharest.
"I was sentenced to two months in prison," he recalled, "but at least I got to appear in court and talk to the judge. That's more than I got in Family Court." 
Mr. Muset's problems began a year ago. His wife, Petruta, filed for divorce and asked him to move out of their apartment in Forest Hills. Mr. Muset said that he did not want to move away from their two daughters, ages 5 and 7, until a joint custody agreement had been worked out.
"My wife had a job that paid for her divorce lawyer, but I couldn't afford to hire one," said Mr. Muset, who was then unemployed after completing law school a year earlier. "I was in debt. The only asset I had was the apartment. I wanted to sell it, use some of the money to hire a lawyer, give my wife her share, and use some to rent another apartment for all of us until the divorce was settled."
Mr. Muset showed the apartment to potential buyers on the weekend of April 24, 1999, he said. The next day, Monday, Mrs. Muset petitioned Queens Family Court for a restraining order against her husband, saying that he had threatened to kill her if she did not sign papers allowing him to sell the apartment.
At the hearing, to which Mr. Muset was not invited, Judge Marian R. Shelton asked Mrs. Muset one question about her petition: "Is everything therein true?" Mrs. Muset said it was. The judge banished Mr. Muset from the home and ordered him to stay away from his wife, his children and their school.
Mr. Muset denies making the threat, and says he did not even need his wife's signature for the sale because the apartment was in his name. He claims the accusation was a ploy to get control of the apartment and the children. "I'm living the American dream in reverse," he said. "I came here to get a home and family, and then a court took it all away."
Mrs. Muset says that her husband did indeed threaten her life last year, and that he previously struck her during an argument in 1997, a charge that he also denies. "He is an abusive individual," she said. "He's a very controlling person. No woman in this country should have to live with a man like that."
IT is impossible to know who is telling the truth. But as the case drags on -- Mr. Muset is scheduled to be in court next month contesting the banishment -- there is no question which side in the divorce battle benefits. The longer Mr. Muset is out of the home, and restricted to seeing his daughters at prescribed times, the less likely he is to be granted joint custody when the divorce is settled, because a judge would be leery of disrupting the children's lives.
Whether a restraining order is justified or not, it can be an excellent strategic move in a divorce battle, and getting one has become easier thanks to laws intended to curb domestic violence. No one disputes the need to protect women, but some wonder about the unintended consequences of the laws.
"It's good that society is taking domestic violence more seriously, but the pendulum has swung too far," said Cathy Young, who analyzed the use of restraining orders in her 1999 book, "Ceasefire: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality" (Free Press). She points to research showing that the orders have little if any effect on reducing violence, and to estimates from some lawyers that 50 percent of restraining orders are sought chiefly for strategic advantage in divorce cases.
"Women are just as capable as men of abusing power," Ms. Young said. "There's already an imbalance of power in child custody cases -- women get custody 90 percent of the time -- and now they can summarily throw men out of their homes and children's lives, often for vague offenses like 'verbal abuse.' It's as if we'd rather violate the rights of 10 innocent men than allow one woman to suffer the risk of harm."
How to redress the balance without putting women at risk? Groups defending the rights of "throwaway dads" have proposed that New York join the many states that make joint custody the presumptive norm, which might discourage some of the vicious winner-take-all wars that take place over custody. But there is no guarantee such a reform would work, and any perceived threat to women's rights is politically problematic. When it comes to political influence and news media appeal, throwaway dads have not come a long way.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. AND 17 STATES ASK JUDGE TO CUT MICROSOFT IN 2 PARTS; SERIOUS CURBS ALSO SOUGHT

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Determined to change the rules of competition in the software industry, the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge today to break Microsoft into two parts and seriously restrain its behavior while the breakup is being carried out.
Federal and state officials, partners in the long-running antitrust case against Microsoft, said their approach was intended to encourage market forces to reshape incentives in the software industry. The two resulting companies, they said, would have strong motivations to compete with each other while also forming new alliances with other companies and products that Microsoft now shuns. 
 "Unless effectively remedied," the plaintiffs declared, Microsoft's actions "threaten an enormous toll on competition and innovation." Two of the 19 states involved dissented. Excerpts, Pages C6-7.
Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general who is head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said that under the proposal, "neither ongoing government regulation nor the self-interest of an entrenched monopolist will decide what is best for consumers." Instead, he said, "the marketplace will decide."
Attorney General Janet Reno called it "the right remedy at the right time."
But Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, reaffirmed his company's determination to fight not only the proposed remedy but the antitrust finding. "Breaking up Microsoft into separate companies is not in the interest of consumers and is not supported by anything in the lawsuit," he said. "Dismantling Microsoft would hurt the company's ability to continue to innovate." Page C1.
The government's remedy proposal is the culmination of almost four years of investigation and litigation by the Justice Department and the states. Microsoft's decision to include an Internet browser in Windows led to the investigation's start in August 1996. But by the time the case came to trial, in October 1998, it had grown to revolve around Microsoft's operating system monopoly and all of the actions the company has taken to protect it.
After settlement talks broke down four weeks ago, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft was a predatory monopolist that stunted innovation and harmed consumers.
If the recommendation were enacted by the court and upheld on appeal -- far from a certain proposition in both cases -- it would be one of the few times in the 110-year history of the Sherman Antitrust Act that the government had succeeded in breaking up a major national corporation. The most prominent were Standard Oil in 1911, and AT&T in a settlement in 1984.
The joint state-federal plan calls for breaking Microsoft into an operating-system company and a second company that would hold everything else, including applications software, like the word processor Word and the spreadsheet program Excel, and Microsoft's Internet properties.
This order would be stayed during legal appeals. But the state and federal officials are also asking the court to impose a group of additional remedies immediately that would restrict Microsoft's conduct. They would be in place for three years after the company was broken up, 10 years if it was not.
Judge Jackson has said he wants to move through the remedy phase quickly and may urge an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court -- an idea that Mr. Klein endorsed this evening but that Microsoft opposes. Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the request, and a remedy hearing is scheduled for May 24. Judge Jackson is unlikely to rule on the request before summer.
The intention of the Justice Department and most of the 19 states involved to seek a breakup of the company had become clear over the last week. What was in doubt until today were the specifics of the proposed restrictions on Microsoft's conduct and the number of states that would support a breakup.
In the end, attorneys general from two states -- Ohio and Illinois -- dissented, saying they believe the government should impose restrictions on Microsoft's conduct first, wait three years and move to break up the company only if those restrictions do not work. And some of the other state officials said they were disappointed that the restraints on behavior had no specific enforcement mechanism.
But Microsoft called the proposal outrageous and unwarranted.
"For months, the government and a handful of our competitors have been repeating that Microsoft should be broken up," Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said this evening. "But no matter how many times it's repeated, it's still unreasonable. I remain proud of the work this company does. We do not believe we have violated the law and the Court of Appeals has yet to consider this case."
Senior state and federal officials, disagreed; they said their plan struck the proper balance between strong-armed remedial enforcement and meddlesome government interference in industry.
"This remedy," the document says, "has the best chance of preventing future competitive harms and ameliorating some of the harm already done" while at the same time "it avoids burdensome regulation and minimizes ongoing judicial supervision and involvement. It can be reasonably implemented and will not impair the non-anticompetitive interests of Microsoft or its shareholders."
Under the plan, when the conduct restrictions expire three years after a breakup, the two new companies will be free to pursue their businesses with no government regulation or oversight.
"This decree will not limit Microsoft's ability to add new features to its products or otherwise to innovate," Mr. Klein said. Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, said it "offers the best hope of restoring competition and reigniting innovation without punishing the company."
The filing includes five supporting affidavits from economists and others. One, Paul M. Romer, an economist at Stanford University, said the proposed breakup was "the most important element of the remedy."
"It will deprive the operating systems company of some of the tools that Microsoft used to limit competition," he said. "It will also create an applications company with the incentive and the ability" to begin licensing software "to competing operating systems."
Carl Shapiro, a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley who served as a consultant to the government in the trial, said the experience of several recent competitive companies and products -- Microsoft Word versus WordPerfect, American Express versus Visa and MasterCard, Nintendo versus Atari video games -- demonstrates that "the strongest threat to Windows is likely to come from a company with a strong position in widely used applications software" in the same industry, namely the proposed new Microsoft applications company.
And Rebecca Henderson, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "Rather than relying on an extensive set of permanent prohibitions that may be difficult to enforce, or which may have undesirable side effects, this remedy will quickly put in place market-based incentives which rely on the firm's basic profit motive to promote competition. It will ensure that the competitive energies of both firms are focused on creating value in the marketplace rather than on evading regulation."
For its part, Microsoft said the proposal was so extreme that it would force the company to ask for extensive discovery and in-court testimony on the remedy. Government officials say that Microsoft's request will require months of hearings and procedures that could stall the case until the next administration takes office. Microsoft denies that.
The White House is taking a hands-off approach to the case. A White House spokesman said today that President Clinton was leaving the decision on remedies up to the Justice Department and had no intention of interfering.
The deliberations over a remedy were long and difficult -- especially for the states, which were trying to reconcile the views of 19 independent politicians of both parties and every possible political persuasion.
Lobbying of a small group of holdout attorneys general opposed to the breakup continued until today. But in the end, to the consternation of both state and federal officials, Betty Montgomery of Ohio and James Ryan of Illinois insisted on adding a dissenting addendum to the proposal.
In a statement, Mr. Ryan said he agreed with his colleagues that "the court should impose strong conduct remedies." But he added that "the goals of the litigation can be achieved without reorganization at this time."
Ms. Montgomery, in a statement, said, "A reorganization would be difficult to undo, and its effects would be difficult to predict."
Under the government plan, Mr. Gates, the company's chairman, would have to choose one of the two companies and divest himself of any financial interest in the other. So would the company's two other largest stockholders, Mr. Ballmer and Paul G. Allen, the co-founder.
The plan also includes a long list of restrictions on Microsoft's behavior, generally known as conduct remedies, including these:
*A ban on taking actions against computer manufacturers that choose to feature other companies' software products in place of Microsoft's.
*A requirement that Microsoft allow computer manufacturers to alter the Windows operating system in significant ways.
*A requirement that Microsoft share with other companies any technical information about Windows, including software interfaces, that the system engineers are sharing with other people at Microsoft.
*A uniform price list for Windows.
*A ban on design strategies intended to compromise or disable other programs that run on Windows.
*A ban on exclusive deals with, or retaliation against, other software or Internet companies.
The list is similar to the terms of the last offer the Justice Department made to Microsoft during the settlement talks that ended early this month. Now, as then, it includes no specific enforcement mechanism, a point of contention with some of the states.
If other companies believe Microsoft is violating the agreement, they would be required to petition the Justice Department to open a case and take Microsoft back to court. That is a long and cumbersome process at best, and uncertain as well -- though the proposal does give Justice Department investigators the right to enter Microsoft offices virtually on demand. But no one knows how the next administration will regard this suit and enforcement of the ruling.
For that reason, several attorneys general had pushed to include a request for a court-appointed special master who would be given some limited enforcement powers. But the Justice Department declined, telling the states they did not want to burden the proposal with "a lot of heavy-handed regulation," one official said.
The states decided this was not a deal breaker. But Mr. Blumenthal said: "Enforcement remains a work in progress and perhaps best left to the court which, in the end, will have responsibility for oversight and enforcement. It is an obvious area of concern for us."
Both state and federal officials say the states contributed significantly to the final proposal. But it is difficult to assign credit for one proposal or another to one side or the other because the two sides exchanged drafts over several weeks.
But Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa, who led the states' effort, said the 17 attorneys general were pleased with the end result.
"It is measured relief," he said. "This is a remedy, not a penalty. It is about the future more than the past."

Funeral Homes Branch Out to Catch No-Frills Wave

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.

 BODY:
LINDA KLEHAMMER knew she was in trouble when the first thing she saw as she walked into a St. Petersburg, Fla., funeral home was a table full of literature on financing.
Her father's unexpected death in February at 77 from a cerebral hemorrhage left Ms. Klehammer and her siblings devastated, she said, and they found themselves being steered toward a much more expensive funeral than their thrifty father would have wanted. 
 Then Ms. Klehammer, 49, remembered a billboard that she had seen in town: "Lower Cost Funerals," followed by a phone number. The advertisement was for A Life Tribute, a storefront "funeral shop" with bright fluorescent lights, big wall signs advertising deals, and merchandise -- urns and coffin samples -- arrayed on shelves.
Shops like A Life Tribute are popping up across the country -- about 500 so far, according to Mortuary Management, a trade publication. The shops cater mainly to the most cost-conscious customers, with prices for a simple funeral that are around half the industry average of $5,000 to $5,700, exclusive of burial costs. But some consumer advocates hope that they will provide enough competition to traditional funeral homes to rein in prices throughout an industry long known for pushing extravagance.
Others doubt that the discount shops will achieve any more than past efforts to spur competition and slow price rises that have run at double the inflation rate. The reason, they say, is that most of the shops, including A Life Tribute, are owned by established funeral home operators.
"The norm in the industry is to be taken advantage of, to be overcharged and to be manipulated," said Karen Leonard, a longtime critic of the industry whose research contributed to Jessica Mitford's tell-all book, "The American Way of Death." Far from lowering prices, Ms. Leonard said, the traditional funeral-home siblings of the discount shops will probably find ways to raise them, recouping from less price-sensitive customers the profits they forgo in the shops.
Ms. Leonard, who directs the Redwood Funeral Society, a consumer advocacy group in Cotati, Calif., said overall prices would not fall until states relaxed laws that require funeral arrangements to be made by licensed funeral directors.
Kelly Smith, spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association, denied that the funeral industry manipulates consumers into overspending. He said his group's members were business people like any others -- operating within the law, respecting regulatory guidelines, charging reasonable prices and responding to consumer demand. Critics of the industry and of all-the-trimmings funerals, he said, are merely trying to foist their personal views of what is appropriate on consumers who are entitled to choose for themselves.
REPEATED attempts over the years to make funeral prices more transparent and more competitive have made little headway.
In 1984, the Federal Trade Commission introduced a requirement that funeral homes accept coffins bought elsewhere. Funeral directors responded by charging a handling fee of up to $1,000, according to Rob Karlin, a board member of the National Casket Retailers Association. It took a second commission ruling 10 years later -- that the charges were illegal -- before the industry switched to offering discount packages to discourage customers from shopping for a coffin separately. Twelve states, mainly in the South and Midwest, still forbid sales of coffins by anyone but licensed funeral directors, a significant bar to competition.
Another 1984 ruling by the commission required funeral directors to provide consumers a detailed price list of all goods and services, to help combat deceptive business practices and hidden fees. But a 1999 study by the AARP found that funeral directors neglected to provide such lists up front nearly a third of the time. And in a survey in March, fewer than one consumer in 12 even knew of the price-list requirement.
Cremation was also once seen as a trend that could reduce the average cost of a funeral by thousands of dollars. Today, about a quarter of all bodies are now cremated, but consumer advocates say the funeral industry still manages to sell expensive services -- and in some cases even coffins -- to people who choose cremation.
Not even the rise of corporate chain owners -- large enough to exploit economies of scale -- has eased prices. Instead of competing robustly, many big chains are struggling, in part because they overpaid for acquisitions, said Kevin Silverman, an analyst at ABN Amro in Chicago. One of the biggest, the Loewen Group, is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
A Life Tribute was opened in February 1999 by Bill McQueen, president of Anderson-McQueen Funeral Homes and Cremation Services, a family-owned chain in St. Petersburg. Ron Hast, publisher of Mortuary Management, said funeral directors like Mr. McQueen had seen the handwriting on the wall, with consumer demand rising for no-frills burials and cremations.
Ms. Klehammer, for one, almost went into debt to pay a traditional funeral home $6,800 to bury her father. But she said a memory of her father's favorite saying stopped her: "Barnum saw you coming." The bill at A Life Tribute for a simple service and a blue-gray metal coffin came to $2,600.
Mr. McQueen said the shop could offer lower prices because of its low overhead costs. It is generally open weekdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and run by a single employee; its sibling funeral homes are staffed around the clock. The shop is about one-eighth the size of a typical funeral home and cost just $50,000 to set up, compared with $1 million or more for a traditional home.
"Normally we're the pallbearers," Mr. McQueen said of his funeral-home staff. "But at these lower-price services the family or friends do that. And if the family wants the flowers taken to the grave, they can only take as many as fit in the hearse; beyond that, it's up to the family."
Many consumers won't mind, even if their budget is no object, said Lisa Carlson, a consumer advocate and author of a book on funerals. Baby boomers are turning away from elaborate funeral arrangements and looking for simpler alternatives, she said.
Mr. McQueen said he did not believe Ms. Carlson's forecast that the fancy Victorian funeral parlor on Main Street was doomed to become a relic, but he acknowledged a need to cater to people who are turned off by the idea of walking into a funeral home. "They think they might bump into a dead body or a funeral might be going on" when they come to do business, he said. "Here, it's more comfortable."
Some other funeral businesses that have opened storefront shops, like Southcare Memorial Chapel in Atlanta, have taken the concept even closer to retailing by selling bereavement books, flowers and sympathy cards in the stores.
Not everyone thinks storefront shops are the best approach. "We have not seen the public demand," said Robert Waltrip, chief executive of Service Corporation International, the industry leader, which is based in Houston. The chain has instead opened 31 Family Funeral Care locations -- small funeral homes run mainly on traditional lines but offering lower-priced services.
Some consumers are hesitant, too. Alice Thomas, 61, of Treasure Island, Fla., hates to tell people that she went to a shopping center to make cremation arrangements for her mother, Elsie M. Sarno, who died at 83 on Jan. 29. But, she said, her mother wanted a simple low-cost cremation. The price at A Life Tribute was $650, versus $1,150 at a funeral home.
Mrs. Thomas recalled her mother once telling her: "Funerals have gone too far; they're just a big money-making job. I just want to be cremated."
So, Mrs. Thomas concluded, "I was following her wishes."
 
Be Prepared, and Bring a Friend
THE timing is always terrible.
Most people who find themselves making funeral arrangements must do so just when they are least ready to be clearheaded and practical -- immediately after a family member or friend has died. That is the main reason sales practices in the funeral industry have drawn so much criticism over the years.
Consumer advocates suggest several ways to keep the process from taking too great a toll on soul or wallet.
* Have a friend accompany you. This should be someone who has emotional distance from the death and can be a sounding board in sifting through catalogs and fees.
* Know your state's laws, and the cemetery's bylaws. Can a coffin be bought from a merchant not affiliated with a funeral home? Is a vault required to encase the casket? Services and products sold as "standard" or "required" may be neither.
 * Do not rush to have a mortuary pick up the body. You can usually take at least a day or two to research alternatives even if the death occurred at home, except in very hot weather.
* Get prices before sitting down with a funeral director. Obtain price lists from many establishments and study them at home, away from sales pressure. Avoid establishments that resist supplying lists or whose lists are confusing or long -- more than three pages.
* Keep some information to yourself. Do not disclose the value of the deceased's estate, death benefits or insurance.
Consumer advocates and the AARP also urge caution when considering prepaid funeral plans, which can be poor bargains and may be less all-inclusive than buyers are led to believe. EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

HEADLINE: Diesel Fuel Is Not Necessarily a Bargain

BYLINE: By JULIE DUNN 

 BODY:
PRICES may be dropping at the pump, but diesel fuel still isn't the deal it used to be.
"In 2000, we've seen a huge increase in diesel prices, 40 percent in the past couple of months," said Bob Costello, chief economist for the American Trucking Associations in Washington. "We're in a situation where diesel inventories are extremely tight. We have no room for mistakes. I think we're definitely in for more increases." 
 On the other hand, John H. Litchblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, predicted that diesel prices would keep falling, as they have in recent weeks. "Prices will go down in the near future, not very drastically, but the trend is now downward."
 The national average was $1.43 a gallon last week, up 3 cents after falling for five consecutive weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration. That compared with $1.48 for regular gasoline. Diesel reached a high of $1.50 in March.
 In 1994, the national average for diesel was $1.13, the trucking group said.
Because diesel is more energy efficient than gasoline, it produces better mileage. But it concerns environmentalists because of its high sulfur content. Sulfur levels and emissions for diesel fuel are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and have decreased by 90 percent since 1988. New regulations are about to be proposed to reduce sulfur even more, to 30 parts per million, from 300. JULIE DUNN

HEADLINE: A NIGHT OUT WITH: Toby Young;
A Way With Words

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS 

 BODY:
TOBY YOUNG was due at his own bon voyage party at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, but at 7 he was battling the British Invasion in his small Greenwich Village apartment.
Mr. Young, 36, is the English journalist who was brought to town with much fanfare five years ago by the editor of Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter, and has, in his own words, "been failing in a devastatingly public way" ever since. Oddly, failure seems only to have enhanced his popularity. As he shined his shoes with old underwear, his pal Sophie Dahl, the Ford model, was in the spare bedroom primping. Euan Rellie, who was just brought over from London to work at Talk and is Mr. Young's houseguest, was in the shower. Mr. Young is ostensibly leaving New York to live in London with his girlfriend, Caroline Bondy, 25, who was also there, squeezing into a bustier. They were readying for a party given by Nadine Johnson, a publicist, and her husband, Richard Johnson of Page Six of The New York Post, who has often used Mr. Young's exploits as column fodder. 
 "I really do need to shower myself," Mr. Young called to Mr. Rellie through the bathroom door.
"Good for you, mate," Mr. Rellie replied cheerfully.
Mr. Young, who is balding and trim, handled the brushoff with his signature sigh of acceptance and a vaguely embarrassed air, a pose that has earned him a following of media luminaries who treat him as a kind of hangdog mascot. In fact, among British journalists here, Mr. Young has become an ever-present icon of defeat. But in typically British fashion, that is regarded as its own sort of success, especially because Mr. Young has catalogued his fall from grace unstintingly in print.
"Americans are always touting their success," he said, "whereas we are much more interested in talking about what losers we are."
Mr. Young, who came to New York after running the trendy Modern Review, said he spent his time here "acting inappropriately." When Vanity Fair sent him to interview Nathan Lane, he promptly caused the actor to stomp out of the room when he bluntly asked: "Are you gay?" Soon after, he booked a stripper for a colleague on "Take Our Daughters to Work Day."
Mr. Young lasted three years at the magazine, though he wrote only 400 words. The articles he wrote elsewhere were questionable career moves: a chronicle in The Mail on Sunday of his 48-hour affair with a Venezuelan heiress who dumped him for Mick Jagger, and an attack in The Spectator on Harry Evans, the former editor of Random House, and his wife, Tina Brown. Mr. Evans threatened publicly to sue him but never did. "I've really given myself a remarkably bad time here," Mr. Young recalled during the cab ride to the party in his honor at the Johnson town house on East 18th Street. He arrived more than an hour late.
Mr. Young had invited about 150 people, and by 8:30, at least that many showed up to toast his leaving. "There are people here who have not returned my calls in two years," he said. In the spirit of Mr. Young's self-deprecating style, everyone had something cheerfully nasty to say about him. Plum Sykes, a Vogue fashion writer, noted that Mr. Young had, in fact, been living in London with Ms. Bondy for the last three months and had flown in expressly for the good-bye party. "Typical," she said with a sniff.
Mr. Carter agreed, saying Mr. Young "lingered like gum on your shoe." He denied that he had fired Mr. Young, but conceded that he was "eminently fireable."
"You take one look at him," Mr. Carter continued, "and say, 'He's out of here.' "
John Cassidy, who writes about economics for The New Yorker, noted that Mr. Young had wound up getting paid "several hundred dollars a word" at Vanity Fair. "His output was laughable," he said.
As the party peaked, around 9:30 p.m., Mr. Young got up on a chair and announced that Ms. Bondy had agreed last week to marry him. (He also made clear that she had originally turned him down.) The crowd cheered.
Mr. Young left shortly after midnight. Only the next day did he learn of his final missed opportunity: meeting Quentin Tarantino, who showed up at the party a half-hour after Mr. Young had left.

HEADLINE: Bridging a Divide

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
CYNTHIA WANG and her husband were on a train out of New York, headed upstate with another couple, their three children and the children's French au pair. Ms. Wang is Asian-American. The other wife and mother was a half-black woman who is sometimes assumed to be white but is darker than her children. The two husbands were white.
"This little white boy came over and stared at us," recalled Ms. Wang, a 46-year-old real estate banker, sitting in the Upper West Side apartment that she shares with her husband and their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy, who is adopted from China. 
 "He came up to me and asked me point-blank if I was the nanny because I was the only visible person of color in the group and I guess I was more nannylike," Ms. Wang said. "The other mother laughed and said: 'Cynthia, I always want to travel with you. It's the first time I haven't been taken for the nanny.' "
The vaunted melting pot that is New York City is home to a growing number of interracial families like Ms. Wang's and her friends. It is, however, a pot that incubates racial divisions as well as racial blending. In any mixed family, people tell stories ranging from Ms. Wang's comedy of errors to awkward moments and ugly slights that testify to a city that is less racially sophisticated than its image.
In interviews with dozens of New Yorkers from interracial families, most said they live in communities in which they feel accepted and their families are thriving. The tragic mulatto is a myth. In Park Slope, Brooklyn; Flushing, Queens, and the Upper West Side, interracial families are found in abundance.
Still, people will stare at a black man, a white woman and two biracial children because although the city's sidewalks and the subways are truly international, many people go home to separate neighborhoods and separate realities. The pockets of tolerance and diversity are celebrated because they are the exception rather than the rule, even as more racially mixed workplaces and schools give people more chances to meet and marry.
Emotional paper cuts are what most racially blended families face as they navigate the city. Mothers of racially mixed children talk about being mistaken for nannies (if they are not white) or teachers (if they are white). Store clerks approach mixed couples as individuals and seem startled when they say they are together.
People tell of attending parties or school events at which strangers insist that their child or spouse is not present because it is assumed the child or the spouse is the same race. In a restaurant, a waiter may ask a mixed family if they want more than one doggy bag because of the assumption that these different-looking people do not live under one roof.
Behind closed doors, the main issues for most mixed families are acceptance by the interracial couple's parents and extended family, an understanding of how their spouses and their children see the world and how to help their children feel comfortable in a race-obsessed world.
Yet most of the mixed families said that while theirs is not the easier choice, their lives are enriched by diversity. And their conversations in their homes are more often about dinner plans than about color because many take the new racial frontier for granted. This year's census, for example, alllows people to check more than one box for race.
"To say I'm half-black and half-Italian would not have been possible when I was a kid," said Roger Sanjek, a 55-year-old professor of anthropology at Queens College and an editor and contributor to the book "Race," a collection of articles by social scientists (Rutgers University Press, 1994). "Now, people talk like that.
"New York has always been a more ethnically, racially diverse area than any other part of the country," Dr. Sanjek said. "There are more possibilities and more combinations for interracial marriage. And perhaps the whites who come here are more willing that others to see race and ethnicity as not fixed."
Ms. Wang's husband, Daniel Sedlis, an assistant commissioner at the city's Administration for Children's Services, said he certainly looks at himself differently because of his marriage.
"The struggle I had to go through had to do with my Jewish identity with both my parents being Holocaust survivors," he said. "The growth for me, with a Chinese wife and a Chinese daughter, was to embrace not just the survival of the Jews but the survival of the human race.
"It's crossed my mind that one day I'll be in public with Lucy and she'll throw a tantrum and deny I'm her father," Mr. Sedlis said only half facetiously. Mostly, he said, people ask, "Does she look like her mother?"
Members of mixed families often develop a thick skin to shrug off the random strange comment or unsettling situation. Ms. Wang, for instance, said she feels happily embraced by two cultures even as she tells stories about mistaken identity or about people who compare her Jewish husband to Woody Allen because of Lucy. She has learned to put people in their place, she said, because these issues are recurring.
Because of the legacy of slavery and enduring racial prejudice that included anti-miscegenation laws that survived in some states until 1967, the issues are especially pronounced for black-white couples.
"I used to think he put too much emphasis on race when something went wrong at work," said one white woman who lives in Park Slope with her husband, who is black, and their baby son. "But the more I started noticing the way people treated me with my son and the comments I got when they found out I was married to him, the more I realized that black and whites really do have that separate reality thing going on."
The degree of separation varies greatly. More people have friends, colleagues and neighbors of other races. And some families were fine with the notion of their children marrying someone from another race and everyone got along well.
Those who felt that people of other races were essentially different or inferior were more likely to cut off contact or go for long periods without communication. One white grandmother bristled when her half-Hispanic grandchildren spoke Spanish. A black uncle made fun of how his niece's white husband danced.
Most couples recalled that when they announced their plans to marry, their parents worried about prejudice against the couple or any future grandchildren.
When it comes to dual-heritage children, parents take different approaches. Some tell their children they are "mixed." Others tell their children that if one parent is white, society will see them as members of the minority race. Still others insist there is no such thing as race. And there is a growing movement by biracial children to identify themselves as belonging to both races.
Clara Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican woman who lives in the Bronx with her husband Gelvin Stevenson, who is half-white and half-Cherokee, recalled how he learned to speak Spanish and dance salsa. Now married 30 years, the couple raised their son and daughter in the south and central Bronx, where the children learned Spanish and English and participated in Native American naming ceremonies.
Dr. Rodriguez said her children, who are now young adults, identify more as Puerto Rican. But at Fordham University, where she is a sociology professor, many biracial students refuse to be put in one category.
"It's not a zero-sum game," Mr. Stevenson, an economist who does investment consulting, said of the question of biracial identity. He added that through his marriage he has come to identify more as Native American. "Because they're proud of being Puerto Rican doesn't mean they're less Cherokee."
Jane Lazarre, a white woman who has been married for 30 years to Douglas White, a black man, and who has written extensively about mixed families, said the identity question is not resolved by using the term "biracial."
"The quick desire on the part of the white parent to identify a child as biracial is a way to distance themselves from racism," Ms. Lazarre said. A writing teacher at the New School who lives on the Upper West Side, Ms. Lazarre wrote about her family in "Beyond the Whiteness of Whiteness: Memoir of a White Mother of Black Sons" (Duke University, 1996).
Ms. Lazarre, who is Jewish, said that she had hoped their two sons would see themselves as black and Jewish, but that as brown-skinned men in a racist society they are considered "black" first.
"There is a tremendous amount of discomfort and ignorance on the part of white people about black people," Ms. Lazarre said. "I don't think white people want to face up to the enormity of their ignorance about slavery or the way black people think and how they feel.
"I'm asked all the time, 'Isn't it difficult that your children don't look like you?' " she said. "My sons do look like me. The problem is what when white people see even a very light-skinned black person, they see something very, very different. That inability to see physical similarities is a metaphor for an inability to connect on a deeper level."
At the same time, Mr. White, a lawyer, said that the black partner in a black-white marriage cannot be as quick as other black people to assume that all whites are unable to connect.
"You develop a different consciousness about white people," Mr. White said. "I understand a lot about Jewish culture because of Jane and getting close to her father. I've even picked up some Yiddish. I think I'm much less likely to dismiss someone because they're white. I've been too close to too many members of her family to be otherwise."
Ms. Lazarre and Mr. White, who are in their 50's, disagreed on whether their son Adam, who is 30, would face a more accepting society in his marriage to a white woman than they did. When they married, people questioned why they were together and warned that their children would have problems. Mr. White thought it would be easier for Adam. Ms. Lazarre said racism was too deeply entrenched.
Although the divorce rate nationwide is the same for interracial couples as it is for others, people often assume that the relationships are problematic. They cannot imagine that two people of different races are together for the same reasons as anyone else or that racism does not poison the relationship.
"An aunt once said to me, 'Has he ever called you a nigger?' " said Lisa Whitfield, a black woman whose husband, John Congdon, is white. They live in Inwood with their 2-year-old daughter, Imani. They were both 13 and in the eighth grade in Philadelphia when they met, and they attended Oberlin College at the same time. Now she is a teacher of violin and viola, and she sings and plays viola in a band called Hue; he is a furniture salesman.
"Sometimes friends have asked me, 'Why did you marry a white guy and what are you going to tell your kids?' " Ms. Whitfield said. "I've met some people who've expressed some real disappointment."
Imani's skin is white and she has blond hair. Ms. Whitfield said most people don't comment when the family is together but some women have made pointed remarks about Imani's "delicate features." Or they say, "Her hair is so different from yours," when she is with Ms. Whitfield, who has dark, curly hair.
On the census form, the family checked two races for Imani. At this point, Ms. Whitfield is using basic colors to teach her child about her heritage, although she said she thinks of her as black. She knows Imani will confront a world obsessed with figuring out her race.
"I like it when people are honest," Ms. Whitfield said. "Just say: 'What's up? Is one of your parents white?' Don't make little quips that are meant to break the ice. I don't want to be talked to like I'm some kind of freak.
"Or say: 'I know your husband's white and you're not. Is life hard because of that?' "
Because Imani is so light-skinned, when Mr. Congdon is with her, the only question they get is the origin of her name (it means faith in Swahili). When he tells white people that Imani has an African name because his wife is black, he gets murmurs of approval or a blank stare. Black people seem less surprised to learn that Imani is biracial.
As a result, Mr. Congdon has developed a dual consciousness.
"If I have a son, my son will have to deal with many of the things black men have to deal with in this country," he said. "Giuliani goes on about how everyone should get along with the police. I know on the one hand that's a really white thing to say and I can understand where he's coming from.
"The problem is that you have a society, a culture, with a set of mental constructs to deal with the world," he said. "You're saying there is an 'us' and there is a 'them.' To let go of that, you have to let go of a lot. I've dealt with black people who've been just as unhappy I've taken one of 'theirs' away as I have white people who don't get it or are offended."
Mr. Congdon spent his early childhood in an all-white New England town. "I didn't decide to marry someone black," he said. "I decided to marry Lisa. The fact that she was black didn't matter."
Michel Gelobter, a racially mixed college professor who lives in Harlem, said people are curious about interracial families because they represent a baffling intimacy in a society where people have a hard time getting along across lines of race.
Mr. Gelobter, who teaches public administration at Rutgers University in Newark, has a Jewish father from Poland and a black mother from the Caribbean. He will tell you that he is Jewish by religion and black by race.
He knows many biracial people who speak glowingly of being voyagers in two worlds and who bring special sensitivity to issues of race. The reality is not that simple, he said, because most people categorize anyone with any visible heritage other than white as belonging to the nonwhite group. And a being a symbol or a bridge to two communities can be hard.
Mr. Gelobter, who is 38, said the tolerant and even self-consciously racially sensitive New York of his youth no longer exists.
When he was growing up in the 70's in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and the Upper West Side, black men used to approach his father on the subway to compliment him for having a beautiful black wife. And Mr. Gelobter's biracial friends from that era never felt their heritage represented a special problem.
But the other day, at Symphony Space on the Upper West Side, Mr. Gelobter said he was the target of bewildered stares and a palpable discomfort as he held the white child of a white friend. And sometimes heads turn when Mr. Gelobter's father is out walking or playing with Mr. Gelobter's older daughter, who is almost 3.
"We've lost the language to talk about the problem," Mr. Gelobter said. "I can be very angry at white men who historically raped black women without being angry at my father. The sad thing is, people let politics rule their responses. The one thing that biracial people can bring in is the response that I'm not born of politics. I was born of two people who love each other."
Suzanne Rust, an African-American writer who is married to Marco Khelo, a white man from Italy who develops Web sites for a living, said that even she stares at interracial couples. She and her husband have two young children and live on the Upper West Side.
"Sometimes I stare just because people look interesting together," Ms. Rust said. "This is silly, but sometimes I smile because I want people to feel acknowledged and accepted."
Many mixed families do avidly seek others like themselves because their numbers are still small. According to the 1990 census, 3.5 percent of all marriages in New York were classified as mixed race, although many experts believe that the 2000 census will show markedly higher numbers. In the nation as a whole, 2.9 percent of all marriages are interracial.
Census data show that of new marriages, about half of Asian women marry outside their race and half of Hispanic women (who can be any race) marry outside their ethnic group. The rates were slightly lower for men in the two groups.
A national study of black-white marriages in 1993 found that of all new marriages by blacks that year, 12.1 percent were to white spouses, up from 2.6 percent in 1970. That study, published in New Democrat magazine and based on census data, also found that in 1990 there were four times as many children living in homes where the primary adults were of different races that there were in 1970.
The real question, said Dr. Sanjek, the Queens College anthropologist, is what forces conspire to keep the intermarriage rate so low even in an international city like New York? Notions of race, he said, are shaped by politics and social factors like class, with immigrants to the city like the Irish, Italians and Jews considered nonwhite at various times.
The future for intermarriage is unclear, Dr. Sanjek said. There could be continued emphasis on broad racial categories, new categories or an abandonment of the very concept of race. Blacks could become just another ethnic group. Or, as other groups meld at ever higher rates, blacks could continue to be outsiders -- seen but not seen.
Mr. Gelobter, the college professor who is black and Jewish, tells this tale. Strolling around the Upper West Side, he often saw an elderly black woman pushing an elderly white man in a wheelchair. Mr. Gelobter wondered if it was difficult for the woman to work as the man's caretaker.
"I talked to her one day," Mr. Gelobter said. "It turned out they had been married for a long time and he had become ill. She was very devoted to him. It seemed like love, more than anything else."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENDING ELBOWS;
Finally, the Teamsters Have Something to Toast

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF 

 BODY:
Something is happening with big labor. Union men and women are starting to feel good about themselves again.
After the rank and file of Teamsters Local 282 met Thursday night at their union hall in Lake Success, N.Y., members moved on to J. J. Peabody's to drink from the well of their hard-earned success. 
 Peabody's is tucked away in the deep recesses of Glen Oaks, Queens, off the Union Turnpike. The bar is one of those brick-and-paneling jobs you're likely to find in rural Michigan. Teamsters are a clannish lot, and they stood six deep in the corners, bickering for the privilege of buying the drinks. They exchanged hugs and genteel kisses, as if they were on the receiving line at a debutante cotillion. Others leaned on the rail like dusty cowboys.
"Is that a woman?"
"Don't know. Sex change, maybe?"
"In this bar?"
"Hey, be a trucker and roll with it."
Things have changed around here. Local 282 was once Gambino property, and members outside the wise guy clique got little work and were afraid to complain.
Nothing of any significance gets built in New York without the 4,000-member local, whose drivers deliver building materials. But under mob control, the union threatened slowdowns to extort money and women and beach houses from contractors. In 1995 the government stepped in and threw the leadership out.
The men and women of Local 282 have not had a democratically elected board since 1990, a stain of shame and embarrassment for these workers, who wear the American flag on their sleeves. But under the appointed trusteeship of Gary Labarbera, the union's dealings have become transparent, work is plentiful, and the books are balanced. The feds are expected to grant a general election in November.
This is cause for celebration and loud music. But, as in any good roadhouse, when the customers get tired of hollering and hell-raising, they sit down to talk, and they usually have something to say.
"Underneath the economic boom, something's rotten," said Joe Lehrer, who has 32 years in the local, 24 behind the wheel of a cement mixer. He bought a house in the burbs and a Lincoln, and fed two kids. "Nice and middle class," he says. "Nothing rich, just American."
Joe is 63. He spoke matter-of-factly. "When the smoke clears on this stock market, we are going to wonder what happened to the jobs with the benefits," he said. "You can't have an economy based on data entry and wiping old people's behinds. America needs unions again."
Something is happening, and you can feel it from these people. They were among the protesters at the world trade meetings in Seattle and Washington. They were part of the 40,000-man hard-hat march in Midtown two years ago, in which several people were arrested and a police horse was slugged -- all because the Metropolitan Transit Authority awarded a nonunion contract of $180 million.
That M.T.A. contract eventually went to the union. "That was a sign that we're back," Nick Spinelli said. "We're taking it to the streets." A fellow Teamster drained his beer. "I got to go home, guys. I got to build those streets in the morning."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;
A Site With No Commitments Draws Eyes of 7 Eager Suitors

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
The city must choose among seven competing plans for a two-square-block site of prime East Side real estate.
Last November, the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Health and Hospitals Corporation sought proposals for developing the 3.5-acre city-owned site on the Bellevue Hospital campus. The parcel, bounded by First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and 28th and 30th 
 Streets, includes the former psychiatric building, a nine-story structure built in the 1930's, which now houses a homeless men's shelter that is closing, along with a smaller building.
The request elicited seven responses for renovating the psychiatric building and building new structures on the rest of the site. One developer, A&R Kalimian Realty, wanted to build apartments. Castle Senior Living proposed subsidized housing for the elderly. The Related Companies, a major real estate developer, suggested some combination of apartments, a medical school and a biotech research center. Others proposed a mix of subsidized housing, student housing and community facilities.
New York University, whose medical school is just north of the Bellevue complex, proposed housing for post-doctoral students, doctors' offices, conference space and a child care center. It also proposed building several commercial biotechnology research facilities on the rest of the property.
"I have several grave concerns about the proposed sale," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, whose district includes Bellevue. "To begin with, we only found out about it through an ad. The community should have been consulted from the beginning."
Mr. Sanders said he feared that additional housing would increase congestion, especially if Con Edison sells land it owns nearby to housing developers, which seems likely.
Edward Rubin, chairman of the land use committee of Community Board 6, added: "It's not fair to go direct to contract without giving people a chance to comment. It's not the way you do things, but that's they way they did it. There is a lot of suspicion that this was a done deal in advance, and that N.Y.U. will get the site."
Martin Begun, a lawyer who represents Castle Senior Living, said he was so convinced that N.Y.U. would get the property "that I told my client to forget about it, at least for now."
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, said that the city was free to sign a contract with any of the respondents but that no decision had been made. DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: Investing;
Out on a Limb, and Carrying an Ever-Heavier Bag of Stocks

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
THOMAS GALVIN'S voice never wavers as he describes the view from out on the lonely end of a limb.
Mr. Galvin, the chief investment officer for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, edged his way out there on the morning of April 17 when, following one of the scariest days in the stock market in 18 months, he recommended that clients put 90 percent of their assets into stocks. Even for a staunchly bullish investment strategist at a firm whose clients are mostly institutions and wealthy investors, it was a daring move. 
 Most strategists on Wall Street never set the stock portion of their asset allocation at more than 75 percent and, lately, they have been more inclined to advise reducing stock holdings rather than raising them. Mr. Galvin, 39, is the only prominent strategist who has run against the herd and not turned back. Thomas McManus, the strategist for Bank of America Securities, also raised his stock allocation on April 17 -- to 80 percent from 75 percent -- but reversed that call a week later.
"Taking this position was not without career risk," Mr. Galvin acknowledged. "It's much easier to be bearish than to be bullish right now."
But Mr. Galvin said he saw much more risk in missing the rebound from the technology-stock sell-off than in suffering through any further declines. With the Nasdaq composite at 3,321 after its 10 percent plunge on April 14, he said he thought the index would fall no more than another 200 points. But he thought it could rise 2,000.
Charles Larsen, a managing director of Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles, met with Mr. Galvin April 17 and liked what he heard. "When there's panic in the streets, he has the demeanor of never being flustered and sticking with his guns," Mr. Larsen said. Since Abby Joseph Cohen, chief strategist for Goldman Sachs, trimmed her stock weighting to 65 percent, from 70 percent in March, Mr. Larsen said, Mr. Galvin "has kind of taken her mantle as the positive strategist."
AT the time, Mr. Galvin was reluctant to say that technology stocks had hit bottom. Since then, the Nasdaq index has risen 16 percent, and now Mr. Galvin says he believes the index bottomed out on April 24 when it dipped below 3,250: "I just think it's time to be in there buying with both hands."
Sure, but 90 percent stocks and no bonds? Who puts 90 percent of assets into stocks when the market is swinging wildly?
"I do," Mr. Galvin said, adding that he has more than 90 percent of his own assets in stocks and has been buying more technology shares in the last two weeks. "I don't manage my mother's portfolio this way, but I manage my own portfolio this way."
That attitude distinguishes Mr. Galvin from his more conservative counterparts at firms that cater to a wider range of investors. Strategists at those firms, like Merrill Lynch, tend to maintain a balance of stocks and bonds, and to see their recommended asset allocations as the most important guidance they can offer for broad groups of small investors. David Bowers, Merrill Lynch's global strategist, recommends 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds, 15 percent cash and 5 percent in commodities.
Compared with them, Mr. Galvin is a radical. He argues that the crucial decision now is choosing the market sectors in which to invest. During the long bull market for United States stocks, the lion's share of investment gains have come from particular sectors, like financial stocks in the early 1990's and technology stocks in the late 1990's, Mr. Galvin said.
The widely held belief in the importance of diversification is "a bunch of hogwash," he said."If you'd been able to pick one or two sectors," he added, "you did a lot better by being overly focused."
For now, he said, investors should focus on technology and telecommunications stocks. His asset allocation calls for a 41 percent weighting in technology and 10 percent in communication services. Among his favorites are Veritas Software, Amdocs, Digex, Nokia and Siebel Systems.
Investors should look for companies whose sales are rising fast enough to offset the sharply rising labor costs that were shown this week in the employment cost index, he said. "I try to find industry groups or stocks that have an opportunity to gain market share and sustain profit margins," he said.
Mr. Galvin also contends that most investors spend too much time fretting about high price-to-earnings ratios and whether stocks are too expensive or cheap enough to buy. Valuation accounts for just 10 percent of investment decisions, he said, and is far less important than the economic climate and market conditions. He believes investors are holding a lot of cash that they intend to pour into stocks as soon as they think the sell-off is over.
"Sometimes the catalyst is just a recognition that the market has just digested some market-unfriendly news," he said. That is exactly what happened on Thursday, he said, when technology stocks bounced back strongly after a government report that showed labor costs rising unusually fast. That afternoon, he told the firm's sales staff to ask themselves, "If this didn't take the market down, what will?"
Boldly calling for a market resurgence has become a hallmark of Mr. Galvin's brief tenure as Donaldson Lufkin's chief strategist. He joined the firm in early 1998 from the New York-based securities unit of Deutsche Bank of Germany; for his first four months, he held to a moderate allocation of 65 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 5 percent cash.
In early August 1998, as an economic crisis was spreading from Russia through Asia, Mr. Galvin began his gradual shift further into stocks and away from bonds. In a move that did not pay off for several weeks, he shifted 10 percent out of bonds and raised his stock allocation to 75 percent.
Six months later, in January 1999, he went another step, moving an additional 5 percent out of bonds into stocks. He held that mix -- 80 percent stocks, 15 percent bonds, 5 percent cash -- for 15 months before making the leap completely out of bonds, with 90 percent in stocks.
Bonds have outperformed stocks so far this year, but Mr. Galvin says that will not continue. And the idea of owning bonds as a hedge against rising inflation is a mistaken one, he said. The major stock indexes will recover and will be higher at the end of the year than they were at the start, Mr. Galvin said.
And if they don't? "I'll be a laughingstock," he said. "People will say, "Didn't he know P/E's were high? Didn't he get that letter?' "

Newest Game Is Buying and Selling Teams

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Get out the tote board: another local team has been sold.
Since 1997, the Islanders have been bought three times -- once, briefly, by a now-convicted felon -- the latest by Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar last Wednesday for $187.5 million. The Nets have been sold twice, the Devils and the Jets once. 
 The Yankees, once chased by Cablevision, turned into the hunter last year and merged with the Nets, then snapped up the Devils last month.
Cablevision may still be wooing the Mets, who may be waiting for a dot.com gazillionaire to pay a half-billion to them into software.
With the Knicks and the Rangers secure under the Cablevision umbrella, only the Giants have eluded the local auction block.
Since 1991, when Bob Tisch paid the Mara family $75 million for 50 percent of the Giants, nine National Football League teams have been sold, including the Jets last January. Four expansion teams were added in those nine years.
"If the Jets went for $635 million, the Giants would be worth $750 million or $800 million," Tisch said. Despite the overheated appetite for teams, he said he had not received offers for his half of the franchise.
"Never," he said. "They know I'm not selling. I don't know if I should feel bad or not, but everybody knows we're in it for the long haul."
Plenty of selling is going on nationally. Since 1998, 26 major league teams have changed hands in whole or have sold large minority stakes. Last week, Stan Kroenke, who owns 40 percent of the St. Louis Rams, agreed to pay $450 million for the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center in Denver, beating out a group that included John McMullen, the departing owner of the Devils, who was part of groups that tried to buy the Jets and the Washington Redskins.
Since the start of the year, the Vancouver Grizzlies have sold for $165 million, the Dallas Mavericks for $280 million and the Kansas City Royals for $96 million (less than one-third of the $322 million paid last year for the Cleveland Indians).
The national trend has created a Wal-Mart sports bloc -- the blue light special owners. Bill and Nancy Laurie, a daughter of Bud Walton, who founded Wal-Mart with his brother, Sam, bought the St. Louis Blues last year for $100 million ($10 million for the team and $90 million for the debt on the Kiel Center). Kroenke's wife, Ann, is Bud Walton's other daughter. And David Glass, a retired chief executive officer of Wal-Mart, is the new Royals owner.
"The skyrocketing asset values of teams make them attractive to sell, even with operating losses," said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm. "Teams are also selling when their owners die. But there is also a new breed of owner, the technology entrepreneurs, willing to buy teams. So you have a Mark Cuban spending a huge amount of money for the Mavericks. It may be worth a lot in the future, but not now."
Cuban is a billionaire through his Broadcast.com Internet company. Ted Leonsis used his AOL wealth to buy the Washington Capitals and a minority interest in the Wizards, and Paul Allen spent a bit of his Microsoft billions for the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers.
Wang and Kumar built their technoriches through software at Computer Associates International, and used it to keep the Islanders on the sports world's most-sold list.
From John Pickett, the team went to John Spano, who loved hockey but loved a scam more and sits in prison for defrauding banks to lend him the money to buy the team. Pickett took the team back, got $25 million more from a group led by Howard Milstein, which said it has lost $40 million over 28 months before Wang and Kumar developed a sudden hunger for hockey.
Wang really wanted the Nets, then tried to join Robert Wood Johnson IV's bid to buy the Jets, but backed away last year when he found that he would get no control for his investment.
So Wang and Kumar overpaid to get the one New York team left -- and because Milstein wouldn't cut his price.
The Pickett-to-Spano-to-Pickett-to-Milstein-to-Wang daisy chain showed that a team could lose games and cash in mass quantities, become a political hot potato but maintain its sale value. What a country!
Wang and Kumar deflected questions about a new lease, a new arena or future cash losses by saying they weren't buying the team as a financial investment or even because they love hockey, which they don't. Their mentor was Alfonse D'Amato, New York's renowned former "Senator Pothole."
"Once we stopped looking at it as a business, it was easy then," said Wang, whose Computer Associates stock is worth $1.7 billion.
Wang's view expands on the prevailing wisdom that a mogul can earn better financial returns from Treasury bills or Beanie babies than with a sports team.
"But you can't watch T-bills play," Alfred Lerner said when he agreed to pay $530 million in 1998 for the renascent Cleveland Browns.
The Islanders' demise as a competitive team in the past decade pegged them as an almost irretrievable charity case. Wang and Kumar hope to deploy the team in the service of their charitable goals.
That's admirable and works for the best community-minded teams, like the Jacksonville Jaguars. But National Football League economics are far healthier than the N.H.L.'s It will be instructive to see how long Wang and Kumar view the Islanders as a noneconomic endeavor if their player investments do not yield victories and a new arena remains an unfulfilled dream.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
He Didn'tSay It. He Knew It All Along.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
THEY last spoke four years ago, when Alan Greenspan, worried that stock prices might be getting too high, invited eight experts to Washington to hear their views. That was when Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economics professor, warned unequivocally that American investors, caught up in their own fervor, were creating a dangerous bubble.
In his 10-minute presentation, Mr. Shiller said, he never uttered the words "irrational" or "exuberance." "I liked the word 'zeitgeist' in those days, and I probably used it," he recalled. But two days later, on Dec. 5, 1996, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, wondered in a now-famous speech whether "irrational exuberance" might be infecting the stock market. And Mr. Shiller saw his influence at work. 
 "He may have had elements of my way of thinking already in his mind, and when he heard my presentation, he may have been persuaded to say a little more in that speech than he would have otherwise," Mr. Shiller said. "That could be how 'irrational exuberance' got from me to him."
Now, though, the phrase has migrated back to Mr. Shiller, who made it the title of a book on the emotional nature of the stock market, written for a popular audience and published just as technology stocks tumbled, launching the markets into their wild April swings. Suddenly, Mr. Shiller, 54, found himself elevated to the status of Wall Street guru. His view that investors are driven by impulse, herd behavior, dinner party chatter, intuition, media hype, fear of being left out -- everything, in short, but informed, reasoned analysis -- offered a timely explanation for the spreading uneasiness about stocks.
An irony is that Mr. Greenspan, despite having introduced the notion of overexuberance into the national dialogue, increasingly sees high stock prices -- a lot higher than they were in 1996 -- as a rational appraisal of corporate America's profitability and prospects.
Technology is transforming the American economy, he says in his speeches and Congressional testimony. Productivity is rising, along with profits. And so investors are logically investing with enthusiasm in companies that are likely to grow in value. What's more, Mr. Greenspan notes, computer technology has increased the amount of information available to investors, and has thus reduced their risk of overpaying for stocks. "Because knowledge once gained is irreversible, so too are the lowered risk premiums," he declared in one recent speech.
Bulls are always more popular than bears -- and most people would rather be regarded as rational than irrational -- but Mr. Shiller's book has nonetheless given voice to an anxiety that clouds today's zeitgeist. "Shiller has managed to pluck an emotional chord," said James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, himself a Wall Street pessimist whose fame has waned as stock prices have kept rising.
THAT might be Mr. Shiller's fate, too, if the market recovers from its springtime stumble. Even now, Mr. Shiller's fellow economists are in no rush to take his advice. Spiritually, at least, they seem more in the camp of Wall Street strategists like Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs, who for years has encouraged investors to buy into a rising market and a prosperous economy.
"I can present my research and findings to a bunch of academics and they seem to agree," Mr. Shiller said. "But afterward at dinner, they tell me they are 100 percent in stock. They say: 'What you argue is interesting, but I bet stocks will go up. I have this feeling.' "
If Mr. Shiller turns out to be right about the markets, tens of millions of American families will have invested their savings too thoughtlessly and emotionally in stocks. And over the next 10 to 20 years, their retirement incomes will turn out to be a lot smaller than they now anticipate -- not to mention the value of their stock options, the pleasure they get from feeling wealthy and the amount of money they therefore spend.
If Mr. Greenspan -- with his faith that markets, even exuberant markets, essentially reflect the logical and sensible behavior of investors -- is right, then the nation has ahead of it years of strong economic growth and high stock prices. There will be the usual, periodic recessions, of course -- and immense volatility in stocks as the markets sort out winners from losers in the new economy -- but no serious setbacks.
Mr. Shiller is no Jeremiah, raging at the markets. Rather, he is a courteous, even-tempered Midwesterner, raised in Detroit, educated as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, with a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is reluctant to stray far from mainstream economics, with its emphasis on rational behavior. And the conviction in his cautious, almost diffident comments takes a moment to sink in.
"Over the last 100 years," he asserted in an interview last week, "aggregate stock prices have either gone up too much or down too much."
His argument is that stock market indexes -- the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard & Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite -- are almost always too high or too low. An individual stock price is often an accurate barometer of a company's earnings prospects. But only occasionally, on their way up or on their way down, have the indexes in this country accurately reflected true corporate value. They have more closely resembled a stopped clock that cannot help but be accurate twice a day.
Right now, he says, the indexes are reaching a peak, for the fourth time since 1901. And if history is a guide, this latest peak -- the highest of all -- will be followed by a decline that might last for years before stocks turn up again into a new bull market.
Just when the next downturn will begin and how it will unfold, Mr. Shiller says he does not know. He is confident, though, that after the fact, the experts will offer all sorts of rational -- and incorrect -- explanations.
One will undoubtedly have to do with corporate earnings. Falling market indexes should reflect a fall in average corporate earnings, or at least the expectation that they will fall. But that has seldom happened, and right now corporate profits are doing quite nicely, Mr. Shiller notes. When the turn comes, the irrational reason will be that all the group reinforcement that now drives the market up will go in reverse, and people will convince one another that stocks are a bad deal.
"People are smart, but they tend to make big errors, and they do it in groups," Mr. Shiller said.
OF MOST economists don't get this -- beyond the small group of behavioral economists to which Mr. Shiller belongs -- that is because they don't pay enough attention to psychology, sociology and history. These disciplines, he says, offer more accurate descriptions of human behavior than the models of rational, sensible human beings at the heart of mainstream economic theory.
Psychology is particularly important, and ignored. Walking toward his office in the Cowles Foundation for Economic Research on Hillhouse Street, in a neighborhood of old mansions now mostly owned by Yale, Mr. Shiller points to the brick Victorian headquarters of the economics department and, a block away, the psychology department's building.
"The economists never visit with the psychologists and hardly know where they are located," Mr. Shiller said.
He attributes his iconoclastic economics at least in part to the influence of his late father, Benjamin, described by the son as a fiercely independent engineer, inventor and entrepreneur who never achieved much success. Outside academia, the son had not made much of an impression, either.
And then last summer, he decided to offer his research in a hurriedly written popular book. On Friday, April 14, when the Nasdaq index fell almost 6 percent, "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton University Press) jumped to 13th place on Amazon.com's sales rankings, from 43rd place the day before. (It will rank 22nd on the expanded hardcover nonfiction best-seller list to be published next Sunday on The New York Times on the Web.)
Suddenly, Mr. Shiller had captured the success -- or at least the public attention -- that had escaped his father.
"Being a best-selling author is a different thing than being a professor," he said. "It seems my social status has climbed. Neighbors ask me to sign copies of the book, and students come by my office, wanting to give signed books to their fathers. My college roommate, whom I have not seen in 20 years, called me. And my wife is saying that it will all go to my head."
On sabbatical this semester (though he still tends to his graduate students), he is away so much that his wife Virginia, a psychologist herself, says that when she and their two teenage sons want to see him, they turn on the television.
At a book signing at a New Haven bookstore, Dr. Shiller recounted, the audience was invited to talk to her husband. "My son said, 'Wow' and rushed up," she said. "Maybe it was a joke, but it was not funny."
Over the last week, Mr. Shiller has appeared on more than a half dozen radio and television programs. Mid-week, he taped an interview for Time magazine with James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett, co-authors of another big seller, "Dow 36,000" (Times Business/Random House); its thesis is that as investors come to understand the true value of stocks, the Dow should more than triple.
"I have debated them before, on television," said Mr. Shiller, who is out of the market himself, without regrets. "They say people have learned that stocks are not risky. I don't think people have learned anything, or will learn anything."
But he is careful in public appearances. He is not comfortable being cast as a Wall Street wise man, a calling that in his view requires constant forecasts of what the market will do in the next few days or weeks. He does not know, he says. An overly upbeat mood can last for months -- or years -- before the exuberance inevitably reverses. So he generalizes.
"If it is an up day in the markets," he said, "I talk about how exuberance forms and why we have it. And if it is a down day, I talk about how markets drop because of negative feedback."
MR. SHILLER stands very nearly alone in his relentless insistence that markets move on feelings and herd behavior, not corporate fundamentals. Many experts agree that stock indexes are now too high. "But if you wait long enough," said Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist, "you will find some conformity between stock prices and true value."
Markets, in sum, do get it right, and the excesses in between are mostly noise; dangerous noise, to be sure, subjecting markets to sudden crashes when investors temporarily panic, but noise nonetheless.
That is a view that Mr. Greenspan seems to hold, too, and he offers the reassurance that the Fed can end a panic and restore confidence through timely cuts in interest rates and plenty of support for the indebted. Rational solutions thus restore rational behavior.
Mr. Shiller describes public moods that are more ingrained, harder to rout, resistant to reason. "I have never been satisfied that markets are rational," he said. "It is not my experience."

In Asia, Picnic Was Over Before It Began

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
ASIA'S Internet boom had really only just started when America's dot-com deflation sent the region's technology share prices crashing. But analysts say the shake-up will mean an earlier-than-expected shake-out of the industry and leave investors with healthier companies to choose from later.
"A year ago, nobody in Asia was talking about the Internet, so there hasn't been time for many of these guys to mature and go public," said Jay Cheng, an Internet analyst at CS First Boston in Hong Kong. So the best companies are still waiting in the wings. 
 Many of the companies that have listed shares, he added, are opportunists without a viable business plan or substantial operations. Rather than ride higher and higher on general Internet euphoria, as did stocks in the United States for the last couple of years, these companies are coming under closer scrutiny and paying the price if their businesses are found wanting.
As a result, some once-hot Internet stocks may be headed for oblivion. "The compression of dot-com concept valuations is unlikely to reverse," said Andy Xie, a regional economist for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
Many Asian Internet companies, analysts say, fail to offer any real innovation: they copy Western e-commerce models, put together with off-the-shelf technology instead of the proprietary software at the core of the most promising Internet companies in the United States. Many managed to raise funds during Asia's brief boom, but "when the market turns bad, as it has, they all become questionable," said Dong Tao, senior regional economist at CS First Boston.
The doomed may include many of Asia's portal companies, which operate Web sites that offer a variety of services to consumers. Many of Asia's listed Internet plays are portals, among the easiest e-businesses to assemble though among the most speculative in terms of future profitability. Few are expected to survive, in part because investors have learned that the Internet's low-margin, high-volume world will only support a few companies of any one type.
Already, early portal entrants are turning into money drains: shares of Nasdaq-listed China.com, which operates portals focusing on China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, are trading at half of what they were at the beginning of the year and about one-third of their highest close, on March 3. Competition in the sector is rising, while profits remain a distant dream. And it is easy to argue that there is still plenty of air left in the stock price: at $48.625, it is still nearly quintuple the July 1999 initial offering price.
Sina.com, which also operates portal sites for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, closed on Friday at $19.625, or $2.625 above its April 13 Nasdaq offering price of $17 a share, but that is little consolation for investors who bought near the peak of its post-offering run-up, when the stock reached $29.125.
That is not to say that Asia's Internet investing opportunities are gone. For one thing, strong companies with capital are well-positioned to pick through the carnage for the industry's best bits. Already, Japan's Internet giant Softbank, which bankrolls dozens of new-economy ventures, has stepped up its aggressive investment program and even plans to acquire one of Japan's nationalized banks. Though the company's shares have plunged from a 52-week high of 60,666.67 yen (about $560) on Feb. 18 to 26,600 yen ($246) on Friday, analysts still like the stock.
Pacific Century Cyberworks of Hong Kong is another company building a critical mass of strategic investments and alliances with blue-chip companies like Intel, which has invested $50 million and is providing technology to help Pacific Century with its plan to build a network of broadband Internet service providers linked by satellite and spanning Asia. If it succeeds in its current bid to buy a stake in Hong Kong Telecom, it will have serious revenue, too. The company also has a venture capital arm that is looking at acquiring other Internet ventures. It closed Friday at $14.50 (Hong Kong), or $1.86 (United States), 45 percent off its peak close on Feb. 15.
In general, companies providing the nuts and bolts of the Internet economy are the surest plays, analysts say. Among them are companies that tie disparate networks together -- so-called systems integrators -- or companies that provide the software and hardware for things like billing systems that will allow the region's e-commerce to work. "Companies providing these services have sounder business models and are likely to report profitability ahead of others in the industry," said Sohaib Umar, an Internet analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong.
One of the most promising is AsiaInfo, a company based in Beijing that is building Internet backbones for Chinese telecommunications companies and providing e-mail software to Internet service providers. While many Chinese Internet companies are little more than experiments in the new economy, much of the country's export machine is scrambling to get online, creating a huge market for AsiaInfo's services.
The company's stock price briefly spiked over $111 after it went public on Nasdaq March 3 at $24 a share. But the shares then went into a free fall, hitting a low of $29.125 earlier this month before rebounding. The stock closed at $43.50 on Friday. Still, AsiaInfo has most of the $138 million it raised in the share offering and, like Softbank and Pacific Century Cyberworks, is on the acquisition trail.
Mr. Xie of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter calls dot-com mania "the briefest financial phenomenon in East Asia's history," but that does not mean the Internet won't continue to transform the region's economies. It does mean that financing for the most speculative of companies probably won't come from the region's stock markets, though. A result may be less of a bubble and more for investors to chew on.

Wireless Choices Rise Over the Static in Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WHEN Europeans talk technology stocks, they are wont to refer to T.M.T. -- for technology, media and telecommunications. And these days, many are pinning their hopes on the third one -- the titans of telecommunications, particularly the wireless market.
The business of snazzy handsets and mobile phone networks, after all, is an area where Europe has the lead. 
 As fund managers and investors are painfully aware, the broad technology sector that has seen such dazzling growth in both Europe and the United States -- far more than old economy stocks -- is part of a global phenomenon that takes its lead from Wall Street. Since early March, however, that has caused convulsions. From its high on March 6, the Dow Jones Europe Stoxx Technology index fell 25.9 percent to its trough on April 14, and has since risen 20.1 percent from there.
With the Nasdaq's fall, even such monuments to European wireless advances as Vodafone AirTouch took nose dives. Vodafone fell from a high of 399 pence on March 6 to 294.50 on Friday. And highflying Psion, whose stock rose tenfold on hopes of its capturing the market for operating systems in next-generation wireless devices, has fallen from a 52-week high of 72.70 on March 2 to 38.37 on Friday. And that included a bounceback on news that Sony would license its software for new mobile devices.
What is happening, said Anna Mackman, European equity strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston, is that a "a big wall of money" that started flowing into technology sector funds last November has begun to recede.
"The thing that has really been affecting European investors has been the volatility, which has injected a need for caution and realism," she said. "Everybody has been buying these stocks in the expectation of doubling their money. Now we have to get back to a situation where that doesn't happen."
Some fund managers see investors moving funds out of smaller, riskier technology companies and into blue chips like the mobile phone makers Nokia and Ericsson, along with proven network providers like Vodafone. Nokia closed at its high of 63.10 euros on Friday and Ericsson closed at 810 euros, just 12.9 percent below its peak. Increasingly, too, chip-makers like STMicroelectronics, which have largely weathered the collapse, are being seen as good long-term bets.
"If investors are going to keep money in technology then they'll typically put it into a blue chip," said Adrian Brass, a manager with Investec Guinness Flight's Wireless World fund, which has assets of $25 million.
The hardest hit among the European technology stocks, he said, are pure Internet plays. "People have started to ask questions about fundamentally how much money they can generate," he said.
The sell-off also spread to companies like Baltimore Technologies of Britain, which provides Internet enabling technology. It closed at 64.63 on Friday, versus a 52-week high of 137.50.
But the rapid decline also provided some opportunities among quality companies with superior technologies. Sonera of Finland, a leading wireless company that fell from a 52-week high of 95.49 euros in March to 60.50 euros on Friday, "was sold off to such an extent that it did not look overpriced," Mr. Brass said.
Just last week, the market seesaw seemed to bear out the idea that a flight to quality was under way. Nokia, which earns 80 percent of its revenue from the mobile handsets that are continuing to boom with Europe's much-vaunted wireless revolution, produced soaring growth figures last week that bolstered its stock price.
The macroeconomic view may be the most bearish. Trevor Greetham, a global strategist at Merrill Lynch, said recent history has shown that riskier stocks take off when central banks free up liquidity, as occurred just after the 1998 Russian meltdown and during the run-up to Year 2000. But with higher interest rates likely, he said liquidity is "being driven out of the system." And, Mr. Greetham added, defensive stocks begin to look better when economic growth looks as if it's peaking. "What I'm saying is: diversify away from technology-media-telecommunications towards value and defensive stocks," he said.
But others see more transitory factors at work. William Lovering, a manager of the $150 million Legg Mason Europe fund, reckons that some of Vodafone's recent retreat could be attributed to investors' selling it to buy into the initial offering of AT&T Wireless, but he said that by the end of the year, the stock would be back near its previous high of 399 pence, on March 6.
He also figures that STM could hit 250 euros by the end of the year, up from 209.9 euros on Friday. Other chip makers like Infineon could also perform well, because semiconductor demand now looks less cyclical and more like a fact of life in the wireless era.
Unlike some American investors, whose European gains were wiped out by the recent fall of the euro, Mr. Lovering is not too worried about the currency. "It's hard to see the euro falling as much again as it has fallen," he said. "And a low currency makes for competitiveness" among European exporters.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: Going Places;
Defining the Target in the Battle for Votes

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

 BODY:
LOOK closely at a few typical events on the campaign trail these days and the true targets of this presidential election quickly emerge.
For example, Al Gore recently talked about education (a major concern to suburban mothers) in Columbus, Ohio (the swing city in a swing state). George W. Bush unveiled his new "compassionate conservative" agenda on health care, home ownership and tax cuts (another bid for the center, especially women, who rank health care high) in Cleveland and St. Louis (both in traditionally swing states with a combined total of 32 electoral votes). Mr. Gore went to the drug store with an older woman who lacks prescription drug coverage (big, big issue with the elderly). 
 Every presidential candidate at this stage of the game swears he would fight for every state and every vote in this richly diverse country. But the ugly little truth is that some states are more important than others, not just because they are big (with a lot of electoral votes) but because they are up for grabs.
As the primary season was dominated by New Hampshire, the general election campaign will most likely be ruled by an arc of big industrial states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. Or, as a gleeful David J. Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, puts it: "Bush was here yesterday and Gore was here last week. I suspect we'll see a lot of both."
There is a demographic corollary: Some groups of voters will get more attention than others -- like elderly voters, the legendary 800-pound gorillas of politics, who used to be reliably Democratic but in recent elections have swung toward the Republicans; married suburban mothers, an important part of the Clinton vote but now a battleground between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore; and Catholics, once the quintessential Reagan Democrats, pulled one way by their cultural conservatism and another by their instincts on domestic policy.
Much of the strategic thinking in the parties these days revolves around these groups and these states. For example, Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, talks about "the Reagan seniors, aged 60 to 70," who tend to be more affluent than older retirees but also very responsive to the idea of expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs -- which many of them suddenly need.
Put the geography and the demographics together, and a 65-year-old woman (a high likelihood of voting) in a Macomb County, Mich., suburb, with an affection for the Bush family (a Republican advantage), a concern for the country's values (ditto) and mounting medication bills (a Democratic advantage) can look like ground zero in the 2000 campaign.
This targeting also explains why some candidates for the vice presidential nomination become so compelling -- like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, the popular Catholic governor of a battleground state, who suddenly appeals to so many Republicans. Some Democrats say Mr. Bush has a problem with white Catholics, not just because of the criticism over his visit to Bob Jones University in the primary season, but also because of the Southern conservative dominance of the party's leadership.
Mr. Ridge would neatly provide geographic and cultural balance, although his support for abortion rights carries risk for Mr. Bush.
Not all the effort will be confined to those states in the middle, of course. For some time to come, each candidate will be probing for weaknesses and targets of opportunity in the other's base. Most notably, Mr. Bush is making forays into California, which the Democrats carried by wide margins in the last two elections; the Republicans are running advertising aimed at Hispanics, hoping that Mr. Bush's appeal to that voting bloc in Texas is transferable. And Mr. Gore is paying attention to Florida, a Republican-leaning state whose governor, Jeb Bush, has a personal stake in the election.
But most experts see the electoral map as pro-Republican in the South and Mountain West, pro-Democratic on the West Coast and Northeast, and up for grabs in much of the industrial heartland. Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter, said, "They don't have strong liberal tendencies like the Northeast or the West Coast and they don't have strong conservative tendencies like the Southern and Rocky Mountain states."
Bob Teeter, a pollster long active in Republican politics, said of that arc of battleground states: "Because they're big, they have all the elements in them that the country has -- they have rural areas that are Republican, small towns that are Republican, suburbs with a lot of swing votes, big cities with union members and blacks that are Democratic." This long-running role in presidential politics, he added, has given rise to the axiom that no Republican has ever been elected president who didn't win Ohio.
This political map can change, and has. Most notably, the once solidly Democratic South realigned to the Republicans in presidential voting in the late 1960's. For much of the 1980's, the Republicans were considered to have an "electoral lock" on the presidency because of their strength in the South and California. But California, which has 54 electoral votes, began turning to the Democrats in 1988, when Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, lost it narrowly in what was nationally a sweeping defeat for the Democrats. In the last two elections, Democrats have anchored their victories on the coasts.
The important demographics can also shift. The over-60 vote went to the Republicans by a surprising margin of 10 percentage points in the 1998 midterm elections, according to the exit polls. "Senior women are anywhere from 12 to 15 percent of the electorate," said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. "They will vote at an 80 to 85 percent clip."
MANY pollsters say the tug of war for older voters will be between their attraction for Republican leadership on values -- including Mr. Bush's promise to "uphold the honor and dignity of the office" and a general concern over the country's moral direction -- and Democratic promises to protect Medicare and Social Security. "Once very specific Medicare and Social Security issues go off the table, values concerns come back," said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.
Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster, grumbled that at the height of the campaign, "Democrats wake up every day saying, 'What is it we gotta do today? Oh, yeah, scare seniors and make sure the black vote gets out.' "
"Soccer moms" have become almost a cliche in presidential politics, but married mothers are, if anything, likely to be more important in this election than in years past. In large part, this reflects Mr. Bush's greater personal appeal to this group and his careful courtship on issues and style; from the start, his promise of compassionate conservatism and emphasis on issues like education showed his determination to close the gender gap.
A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed how much better Mr. Bush was doing among mothers than the last Republican nominee. In April 1996, 60 percent of mothers said they were backing Mr. Clinton, while 37 percent said they were backing Mr. Dole. Last month, 41 percent of mothers said they were backing Mr. Gore, while 52 percent were backing Mr. Bush.
"I hate the soccer mom cliche," Mr. Cook said, "but I have to tell you that middle- and upper-middle-income white women who economically ought to be Republicans but on social and cultural issues -- abortion, guns, education and health care -- gravitate to the Democrats, will be important."
For all the demographic trends that cut across state lines, states also have their idiosyncracies. The auto industry's dominance in Michigan, for example, makes it almost inevitable that the Bush campaign will try to paint Mr. Gore there as an environmental extremist.
AND for all the focus on swing voters, the cardinal rule of politics is to cultivate your base. Still, as this unusually long post-primary, pre-convention political season drags on, the battlegrounds are clear. And assuming the election stays competitive, it will only get worse. "If you want to know what hell is like for a voter, it's a swing presidential state with a key Senate race and an open Congressional race," Mr. Bolger said. "They're going to see so many political messages that there won't be any actual news -- just 30 minutes of 30-second spots."

HEADLINE: The Bad Guys Are Always With Us

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel teaches international relations at the University of Southern California and is the author, most recently, of "In Love with Night: The American Romance with Robert Kennedy."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
They may hate each other, but Lazaro Gonzalez and Fidel Castro have one trait in common. They both drive Washington crazy.
And American officials, for all their huffing and puffing, don't really know what to do about either. First they issue ultimatums to the Miami family and no one pays any attention. They send in a commando team to seize a 6-year-old boy, and outraged congressional Republicans schedule hearings. And Fidel Castro orchestrates another rally in Havana to celebrate his victory. 
 To make matters worse, the Cubans -- in Miami or Havana -- aren't the only ones thumbing their noses at the single superpower. Saddam Hussein is still in power nine years after we sent an army of half a million men against him; he blithely brushes off, like pesky flies, the wannabes we hope will replace him in his palaces. There is the nasty Slobodan Milosevic, whom we bombed into withdrawing from the rebellious province of Kosovo, but whose hold on power in Serbia is stronger than ever. And North Korea is another place we seem to be able to neither buy off nor intimidate.
We call them "rogue states" because they are bad places, but also because they won't play by our rules. We are even debating whether to spend some $60 billion to build a leaky Star Wars umbrella in case one of them is tempted to lob a missile against us. It would probably be cheaper, and safer, to buy off rogue dictators at, say, $1 billion each (and maybe a house in Malibu).
Is this any way to treat a global hegemon that can blow any country off the map, send bombers halfway across the world to take out a bridge, and devastate a country's economy just by blocking a loan?
Well, what we're learning about the new blueprint for global peace and prosperity under America's helpful guidance is that the rules of proper behavior apply only to those willing to observe them. In the cold war, countries played the Great Power game -- they built big armies and fancy weapons, bought allies and worried about making a good impression on hard-to-get bystanders. In the world of triumphant global capitalism, the small countries line up for handouts at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, then meekly follow orders. They, too, want to make a good impression by showing that they know the rules.
But there are always a few outsiders who play a different game. Bosses like Fidel Castro don't care about impressing their well-behaved neighbors or maintaining a good credit rating. They store wrecked cars in their front yards and refuse to clean up their trash. They make noise all night long, and their kids steal your kid's bicycle. And if you try to do anything about it, they'll slash your car tires and then sue you for harassment. And there is not much you can do about it -- unless complaining to other law-abiding people makes you feel better.
That is why -- after more than 40 years and nine presidents who have tried to get rid of him by fair means or foul -- we are still driven nuts by Fidel Castro. The recent melodrama in Miami is not, as so many have said, just a cold war hangover -- a kind of geocultural lag. Rather, it is a distressing reality of today's world.
For those who care more about wielding power than being loved, more about their own ambition than their countries' welfare, America's rules are merely an inconvenience to be circumvented or ignored. Like Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein and even Osama bin Laden, Mr. Castro perplexes us because he manages to survive everything we throw at him. We've tried assassination teams, proxy invasions, sabotage, financial strangulation and economic boycotts. Nothing has worked.
Such men survive because they are willing to pay a higher price to stay in power than we are to get rid of them. We try dirty tricks and are so embarrassed when caught that we apologize and promise to lay off. Since for them power is an end in itself, they see no reason not to lie and cheat, and they honor only those agreements that suit their purposes. When we try to hold them to our rules, they rev up their populations against us with patriotic rallies, strengthening their grip on power. Instead of bending to our will, and to our lectures on morality, they jeer us.
What makes them so infuriating is that we cannot respond in kind. We held back our military forces at the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 for fear that Latin American governments friendly to us would be toppled by their own people, cheering for the underdog. Though we destroyed Saddam Hussein's army in 1991, we did not invade Baghdad to get rid of him from concern that without him Iraq might fall apart. In the war over Kosovo we didn't demand that Mr. Milosevic resign before we stopped bombing Serbia because we knew he wouldn't.
Likewise, when somebody (maybe a member of Mr. bin Laden's team of zealous volunteers) blew up two United States embassies in East Africa, we were so eager to find someone to punish (and to avoid looking like a "pitiful, helpless giant," in Richard Nixon's memorable phrase) that we bombed a chemical plant in Sudan and some mountain caves in Afghanistan. The backlash against us by our client states in the Arab world was so strong that it might have been better to have done nothing at all.
This is hard to take. We've spent the Soviet Union into oblivion, turned China into a capitalist bazaar, made American English the world's lingua franca, turned the dollar into the universal currency and discouraged any other state from even trying to challenge us for the title of king of the mountain. But we reign supreme only among those who play the same game that we do. The others, like Mr. Castro, laugh as we squirm. Unforgivably, they have taken all the fun out of running the world. Instead of being the revered monarch collecting tribute from distant tribes, we are tormented by a plague of fleas and grasshoppers.
So what can we do about it? Nothing in our arsenal works against the resentful weak. Eventually they pass of their own accord -- only, of course, to be replaced by other rogues.
Some problems, like dandruff, acne and arthritis, have a way of defying all solutions. People learn to live with them, just as they do with unpleasant neighbors. Maybe we should try a different strategy with the rogues -- slapping them down, of course, when they get too far out of line, as Saddam Hussein did in invading Kuwait, but giving up on trying to get rid of them. Getting hysterical does not make them go away -- it only makes them seem like victims.
Being rich and strong does not mean you always get your own way. And when you fall on your face, nobody feels sorry for you. The sad fact is, hegemony just isn't what it's cracked up to be.

Conversations With a Grizzly

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
"It is not popular to be negative, especially when you work for a brokerage firm, as I do," said Byron Wien, United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and one of America's foremost bears.
Last Thursday, it's fair to say, Mr. Wien was not adding to his popularity. He told an economics conference that he expects further declines in domestic stocks, especially in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite. "I think the Nasdaq could go back and test and possibly break the November lows," Mr. Wien told reporters at the meeting. 
 He also said a broad decline of around 25 percent in the stock market could slow economic growth to the point that the Federal Reserve would postpone further tightening of monetary policy, but he saw no likelihood of pre-emptive easing by the Fed against a possible slump.
Last November was the first month of a Nasdaq buying spree that ran the index up nearly 2,000 points to culminate on March 10 in a close of 5,048.62, its highest ever. Since then the index has fallen 23.5 percent, to close on Friday at 3,860.66.
Mr. Wien also said he thought the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index could return to "1,300 or so." He did not give a time frame for such a decline, saying it may take time before investors stop seeing sell-offs as buying opportunities. The S. &P. 500 closed at 1,452.43 on Friday.
He said the best values for stock investors are to be found among the unglamorous, undigital stalwarts of the mainstream economy. "I think the old economy is the place to do your shopping," Mr. Wien said, adding that technology stock valuations had gone impossibly high and that bearish voices may now prevail as reality begins to take over.

Wall Street's Runs, Hits and Errors

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
Ah, the American pastime. No, not that one. The money sport, where keeping track of the Dow industrials, Nasdaq composite and Standard & Poor's 500 has been consuming women and men of a certain stock-trading age.
 For some, this pleasant diversion has moved beyond a hobby. April alone was enough to make bleary-eyed investors steel themselves for the worst, while still hoping for the best. 
 With summer approaching and the direction of the market uncertain, investors may wish they were following batting averages instead.
 On Friday, the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge to break Microsoft in two. Microsoft developments alone have been a drag on the markets of late. But there was more. A number of government reports released last week renewed fears of inflation and of interest rate increases.
 Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company, said: The inability to predict market swings has created three camps in Wall Street -- the bulls, the bears and the bewildered. Adding to the uncertainties are Microsoft, margin calls and mounting anxieties about interest rate hikes. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: Surplus a Gulf Between Candidates

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
This is the first presidential election in memory when the candidates have a budget surplus to discuss, not a deficit, and their sharply contradictory approaches on how to use it are perhaps the biggest differences between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Mr. Bush has built his campaign around a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that would send most of the surplus back directly to taxpayers. Mr. Gore calls that risky, because the surplus so far exists largely in the minds of economists, who once could foresee only deficits. 
 "What's risky is overtaxing people and leaving unspent money in Washington," where politicians will waste it, Mr. Bush said last week in Arkansas. If the government collects more money than it needs to spend, he argues, then taxes are too high.
Mr. Gore's proposals, derided by the Bush campaign as calling for excessive spending, are harder to follow in detail, though plainly they amount to a continuation of President Clinton's approach. Some proposals for new programs that Mr. Gore favors, like a $115 billion education trust fund, are part of Mr. Clinton's most recent budget proposal but have not been approved by Congress. The Gore camp does not count them as new spending.
He would cut taxes $250 billion over 10 years, and his biggest spending proposal is for a $200 billion prescription drug benefit for Medicare. He says the prudent thing to do is to devote large sums to reducing the national debt, which should help keep interest rates down, and to shoring up Social Security and Medicare. An unspent surplus automatically reduces the debt.
But, as Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, observed, "In historical perspective, you would have to conclude that both candidates are fiscally prudent because both are attempting to reserve the surpluses in the Social Security system for debt reduction."
There is another index of shared prudence. Mr. Bush's tax cuts do not approach the level urged by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Mr. Gore's Medicare drug plan is nowhere near as costly as the national health insurance plan Bill Clinton promised in 1992.
Side-by-side comparisons are virtually meaningless. The candidates assume surpluses of very different sizes, and Mr. Gore's proposals cover the years 2001 to 2010 while Mr. Bush's cover 2002 to 2006.
These are, moreover, campaign promises, not blood oaths. Candidates change their minds after election, like Mr. Clinton on middle-class tax cuts, or when circumstances change, as when a freshly inaugurated Jimmy Carter had to confront rising inflation.
But each approach can be judged for internal consistency -- and, with less certainty, for the plausibility of the underlying assumptions.
On those scores, Dr. Reischauer says both candidates "are skating right along the edge of the ice," by proposing to "absorb all of the projected on-budget surplus" in tax cuts and new spending.
Mr. Bush's surplus is bigger, $586 billion in five years. Mr. Gore relies on estimates by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which expects the surplus to be $164 billion.
The difference is not created by the old-fashioned "rosy scenario" of the 70's and 80's, when government made wildly optimistic guesses about growth rates to justify spending and tax cuts. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, notes that among other forecasts, Wall Street's Blue Chip forecast calls for 3.2 percent annual growth, while the Bush campaign predicts 2.7 percent. "We actually are quite cautious on the growth side," he said. (The White House budget office and Mr. Gore predict 2.6 percent.)
Instead, the difference arises because Mr. Bush makes a much lower estimate of what Congress will spend than do the Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Gore. The agency estimate basically assumes that spending will grow at about the rate of inflation, and the Congressional Budget Office's latest study ducked the issue, by offering three guesses. Mr. Lindsey said, "Congress is capable of spending that much money," but under pressure from a new President Bush, he thinks it would not.
Maybe, but restraint from the Congress that thinks of the constitutionally required decennial census as a spending emergency, is pretty optimistic. Dr. Reischauer calls the Gore assumptions "a good deal more plausible," but even so, he says, Congress might spend even more.
The Gore camp says the Bush accounting overlooks that his tax cuts and spending increases mean the national debt will not be cut as much as the Congressional Budget Office had assumed, and that interest payments on the national debt will cost $56 billion more. But $483 billion for tax cuts, plus promises of $46 billion for health care, $13 billion for education and $25 billion for defense add up to $567 billion; so only $19 billion of surplus would be left to pay $56 billion in added debt interest.
Mr. Lindsey replies that the issue is, "Have we left ourselves enough room? I think we have." He says Mr. Bush will soon speak on "government reform" and lay out enough spending cuts to make things balance.
The Gore camp also contends that Mr. Bush's tax cuts would balloon in later years. Mr. Gore charged on Monday that even if the economy grew fast enough to afford them through 2006, the last year the Bush campaign's documents discuss, there is no hope that it could pay for the $2.1 trillion they would cost through 2010.
Mr. Lindsey says his estimate of the cost of the tax cut through 2010 is $1.3 trillion, and that it is affordable because "surpluses grow quite quickly after 2006."
But out-year surpluses are the "most speculative," said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group of deficit hawks. That is a problem for the Gore campaign, too. Three-fifths of the $746 billion, 10-year surplus it wants to use would arrive in the last three years of its plan.
Mr. Gore's $250 billion net tax cut is vague. Its details have not been spelled out, but it will include some, if not all, of the cuts proposed by Mr. Clinton in February. Some of the $146 billion Mr. Gore has proposed for expanding health insurance for the poor comes in the form of a tax credit, and so is also part of that $250 billion.
The overlaps and vagueness of the Gore proposals invite skepticism. For several weeks Mr. Gore's Web site produced nothing at all when surfers clicked on "Keeping the Budget Balanced." A murky pie chart appeared on Tuesday, listing: $432 billion for "Medicare Solvency and Prescription Drug Benefit," $380 billion for "Health care coverage and tax relief" (with three asterisks indicating "includes other investments"), and $64 billion for "debt service."
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: "It appears that the vice president is doing his best to hide how much money he wants to spend. Is it any wonder that sometimes people question whether the vice president has a credibility problem?" He said he believed that if Mr. Gore is elected "his first inclination will be to spend more taxpayer money, particularly if that is what organized labor wants."
But each side believes in the surplus. "Nobody's lying," Mr. Bixby said. "They just have different assumptions." But those assumptions "of huge surpluses as far as the eye can see," should be treated very skeptically, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE CONSUMERS;
PC Users Express Concern That Split May Hurt Them

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 29

 BODY:
While lawyers and regulators in Washington ponder the fate of the Microsoft Corporation, Troy Anthony stands in a computer store here, struggling with the conflict the case inspires in ordinary consumers. He says he feels strongly that Microsoft should not be divided in a way that destroys the Windows standard he already knows how to use.
But what brought him and his laptop to the PC@more store on a busy weekday afternoon? "I've got a bug in Windows 98," he said sheepishly. Mr. Anthony added that he had developed a not-so-technical remedy for the times his operating system crashes. "I know how to reboot the computer." 
 For many consumers, the Microsoft operating system, used on 85 percent of personal computers, is the devil they know. And many say they are not sure what the devil will look like if federal regulators succeed in splitting Microsoft in two, as they proposed on Friday, with one half an operating-system company and the other half holding everything else, including word processing and spreadsheet programs, e-mail software and the other Microsoft applications.
When the legal theory, public-relations spin and courtroom drama die out, what is supposed to be left is an environment that offers the American consumer better, more innovative, less expensive products, thanks to heightened competition. But many consumers are skeptical. According to a Gallup survey released on April 12, some 69 percent of Americans said they thought Microsoft should be left alone, while 21 percent favored a breakup.
This is consistent with Gallup's finding that 80 percent of those polled said Microsoft had a positive impact on the computer industry, while 20 percent said it had a negative impact.
As the government was preparing to announce its proposals for Microsoft, Tom Gibney, finance director for Impiric Chicago, a promotional advertising firm, said he thought the ruling against the software giant was too harsh, even if some of its tactics have been "unwholesome."
Microsoft's products work very well for him, he said, adding that while he had heard vague comments about other operating systems, he was not inclined to try them.
"I don't really have enough knowledge about the programs," he said. "I'm just a corporate wonk going around getting set up with Microsoft, and it works great for me. I use a PC, and they all run Microsoft. It's ingrained; that's just the way it is."
Dr. Steven McAfee, 38, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, is also contented with Microsoft's current structure. His concern is that a breakup of the company would fracture the Windows standard, which could hurt his patients.
"I sense there will be a lot more glitches in the software," he said, if the company is broken up. That would be especially troublesome because patient records may soon be on computers and thus vulnerable to bugs. "I would prefer not to go so backwards. It's a hard thing to endure at this point."
Others, even some who work with computers for a living, think the outcome of the case will have little effect on them. Steve Abbitt, 23, a computer system administrator at the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco, said he did not care about the trial and he was unconcerned about the possible breakup of Microsoft. He said politics, not concern for the good of consumers, was driving the legal wrangling. Mr. Abbitt worries that if there were more operating systems available, companies might have to retrain workers, which he said would be costly and time-consuming.
Besides, "I'm much more interested if a good rock concert comes to town than in the Microsoft trial," said Mr. Abbitt, noting that he was an avid Grateful Dead fan.
If consumers are unsure about what it would mean if Microsoft were divided, they have plenty of company. Some of the best and the brightest in the country, applying economic theory of the highest order, cannot agree either.
Advocates of the government's proposal say it may take time, but that new competitors should emerge if Microsoft is broken up.
The theory is that the new applications business will have an incentive to create versions of programs for makers of other operating systems like Linux. In turn, those new operating systems will be able to offer better products with a broader range of functions.
Meanwhile, other companies making applications would find it easier to compete against a Microsoft that is half its current size. And at least in theory, more operating systems and applications makers would mean more innovation, more competition, more competitive pricing and, eventually, more store shelves full of software made by entrepreneurs.
"There will be more stable operating systems that boot up immediately," said Steven C. Salop, professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law Center. "Two or three years out, consumers might be buying PC's with Linux and more choices of network computers."
More competition would force Microsoft to lower its prices, asserts Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America. Citing well-known estimates, he said computer makers pay Microsoft a fee of $45 to $60 for each PC they put the Windows operating system on, but he figures that amount could easily fall to $15 a machine if Microsoft faced more intense competition.
Mr. Cooper dismisses the dire prophecies that more operating systems would mean chaos and confusion for consumers who are accustomed to Windows.
"They want you to believe that you touch one hair on the head of this company, we'll go back to 1982, when you have to be a computer programmer" to use a computer, he said. "No one is going back to 1982."
Maybe not 1982, but 1984, say economists on the other side of the argument, alluding to what they see as inappropriate government interference in the market. These economists argue that dividing Microsoft would actually lead to higher prices and little new innovation.
"This is anticonsumer," said Richard McKenzie, a management professor at the University of California at Irvine and author of a book about antitrust policy, "Trust on Trial: How the Microsoft Case is Reframing the Rules of Competition." "The main reason is that a breakup will lead to higher prices."
Mr. McKenzie argues that consumers benefit from having the applications and operating system housed under one roof. The idea is that engineers working on applications and operating systems share ideas in hallways and cubicles, thus creating features they might not think of if they worked in separate companies. This is called the water-cooler theory.
Then there is the slightly more complex "double marginalization" theory. Jerry Hausman, the McDonald Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an occasional consultant to Microsoft, said that according to this theory, Microsoft can charge lower prices for both its applications and its operating system when it operates both businesses. The ostensible reason is that if Microsoft lowers the price of, say, word processing software, it stimulates demand both for the software and for the operating systems that run it, increasing revenue for both businesses.
That will all change if Microsoft is broken up, Mr. Hausman said.
"Economic theory says this leads to higher prices," he said, referring to a breakup.
Such arguments fail to sway some Microsoft customers, though. Akther Ahmed, 32, chief executive of an Internet startup called Gomingle.com, said Microsoft had treated him arrogantly in business dealings. He said that when he was negotiating to buy Web servers, the powerful computers used to operate Web sites, Microsoft representatives acted as if Mr. Ahmed had to take what they offered or take his business elsewhere.
In the end, Mr. Ahmed did decide to go to another company, a decision that meant spending roughly double the Microsoft price. But Mr. Ahmed said that Microsoft needs to be taught a lesson.
"When a company gets too arrogant, its innovation goes down," he said. If Microsoft is broken up, he concluded, "in the long run, it'll be better for consumers."

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Legislation for Tougher Consumer-Privacy Rights

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
The Clinton administration is preparing legislation to protect the financial privacy of consumers by limiting how banks, insurers and other companies share sensitive consumer information like personal spending habits, medical files and insurance records.
Administration officials said that President Clinton would describe the plan on Sunday at a commencement address at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti and that it was strongly endorsed by Vice President Al Gore. But even before its formal unveiling, the package was denounced by the financial services industry, which has chafed over less restrictive proposed privacy regulations authorized by a banking law passed last year, and by leading Congressional Republicans who stripped some provisions similar to the new plan from last year's legislation. 
 Opponents of the administration's new privacy plan say it will cost companies too much and will discourage the consolidation of banks, insurers and securities firms that the law passed last year was intended to promote by deregulation.
The White House proposal would prohibit affiliates of large financial conglomerates, for example, an insurance company and a bank, from sharing information like medical records when a customer applies for a loan unless the customer consented. It would also restrict the ability of banks to divulge the personal spending habits of their customers that might be gleaned from checking accounts, or credit or debit cards. It would give consumers a new right to review their credit and financial information and correct errors. And it would force companies to give consumers new privacy notices upon request to enable them to shop for the most protective institutions.
"To further the Clinton-Gore commitment to protecting consumer privacy, the president is taking strong steps to enhance financial privacy protections," a senior administration official said. "The president believes that firms should not be able to share especially sensitive medical information, or information on personal spending habits unless the consumer affirmatively consents."
While the plan's prospects for passage by Congress this year are dim, the plan appears certain to become an issue in the presidential campaign this fall, particularly as public opinion polls show the issue to be of growing importance to voters and consumers who are increasingly relying both on the Internet and on large financial conglomerates to do banking, buy consumer goods and trade stocks.
Mr. Gore and other leading Democrats have strongly allied themselves with the plan. Lawrence Lindsey, a top economic adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said today that the governor had taken no position on the details of the legislation, but that he "has a very strong and instinctive preference towards protecting consumers' privacy."
But Mr. Lindsey and others said the White House appeared to be motivated primarily in conveying a political message, as much as bringing about actual changes. Many senior Republicans in Congress and supporters of Mr. Bush have been vociferous against taking any further steps to increase privacy protection of consumers because of the cost to the financial services industry.
Kenneth Guenther, a top lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers Association, which represents many of the smaller banks and savings associations and opposes the new measure, said, "It's very clear that this a political act and the president is playing to the traditional base of the party."

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Mrs. Clinton Is Everywhere

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
There can be little doubt about it. Hillary Rodham Clinton is getting around the state.
In just the last week, Mrs. Clinton visited a dairy farm in Wyoming County, N.Y., talking about agriculture policy to the strains of mooing cows in the background. She spoke to a group of Democrats at a luncheon in Penn Yan, a town of about 3,000 in the Finger Lakes region, telling them about her vision of the upstate economy and confessing her first experience hunting ducks. And she stood on the stage at Alfred University, in Allegany County, to be inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society. 
 For those who might have questioned how fully or comfortably the first lady of the United States would immerse herself in the minutiae of a statewide Senate campaign, the answer can be found in the schedule Mrs. Clinton has been keeping over the last few weeks. Indeed, she seems to be in every corner of New York, from hamlets to large cities.
By the time she left an appearance at a high school in Watkins Glen, in Schuyler County, on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton had visited 58 of the state's 62 counties. And, in a point she underscored several times last week, she has every intention of visiting the remaining four counties in the next few weeks.
The first lady's campaign schedule signals a significant shift from her earlier forays into New York State politics, when her events were carefully choreographed with little spontaneous interchange between Mrs. Clinton and voters.
These days, Mrs. Clinton is spending significantly more time interacting with voters, taking time to shake hands, pose for pictures, sign autographs and talk with people. For example, after an hourlong, nationally televised town hall meeting in Buffalo last week, Mrs. Clinton spent nearly another hour taking more questions from the audience and shaking hands.
Mrs. Clinton insists that her campaign style is unchanged from the early days of her "listening tour," when she spoke to relatively small groups and rarely plunged into crowds. "I don't feel like I'm doing anything differently," she said in an interview last week. "I thought I spent a lot of time back in the listening tour. But I was trying to cover a lot of ground, so I didn't have, perhaps, as much time in my schedule."
Discussing her campaign schedule, she said: "I'm doing what I said I would do when I started: I'm meeting as many New Yorkers as I possibly can meet and going to every county. I'm going into a lot of different settings to see where people live and work, and I'm having an absolutely wonderful time."
Still, Mrs. Clinton seems less inclined to engage in regular question-and-answer periods with the news media, unlike her Republican rival, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who typically conducts a news conference every day.
Her schedule and campaign style seem intent on making voters comfortable with the notion that a woman who has never held public office and who, until recent months, had never even lived in the state is nonetheless a fitting choice to be United States senator. Moreover, her frequent trips -- many from dawn to late into the night -- are also intended to provide a sharp contrast to Mr. Giuliani, who has largely remained in New York City during the last few months.
Mr. Giuliani, who revealed on Thursday that he has prostate cancer, traveled this weekend to Buffalo, for a meeting of the Independence Party, and to Saratoga Springs, for a Republican dinner. His aides suggest that Mrs. Clinton is able to travel the state freely since she is unencumbered by the responsibilities of running a city -- or anything else for that matter.
"A year ago, Mrs. Clinton was at 57 percent in the polls," said Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani's campaign. "She is now approaching going to every county in the state. It seems that the more people see her, the less they like her, given her rapid decline in poll numbers in the last year."
But a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll showed Mrs. Clinton was 8 points ahead of Mr. Giuliani over all and even with him upstate.
The extent to which her numerous trips produce dividends at the polls in November remains to be seen, of course. Many in the crowds she attracts are undoubtedly motivated by the novelty of seeing the wife of the president.
"It's pretty exciting," said Debra Almeter, who operates a large dairy farm in Strykersville with her husband and went to see Mrs. Clinton at a campaign stop last week in Wyoming County. "I'm not a very political person. But how often does a first lady come out here?"
That seems to be a common reaction to Mrs. Clinton.
"No candidate ever, ever comes here. Ever. Ever," Barbara Steinwachs said after Mrs. Clinton's speech in Penn Yan. Ms. Steinwachs, an independent training consultant and the Democratic Party chairwoman in Yates County said: "People are thrilled. And to have it to be the first lady makes it even more thrilling. I think people are impressed just that she came."
Indeed, many of the people who come to see Mrs. Clinton -- particularly in small communities in western New York -- are registered Republicans who say they have no intention of voting for a Democratic candidate.
But it is Mrs. Clinton's strategy, her aides say, that by going to as many cities as her schedule allows, as frequently as possible, she will become a political figure that voters are increasingly comfortable with. Visiting upstate communities and discussing the details of, say, milk prices or high air fares, her aides suggest, Mrs. Clinton is likely to chip away at what is perceived to be Mr. Giuliani's political strength.
And it is clear that Mrs. Clinton continues to elicit strong passions from New Yorkers. On the road to Alfred University, last week, for example, several huge banners were placed along the highway, saying "Go Home Hillary" and "Stand By Your Man -- In Arkansas."
On the other hand, her very appearance on the stage in the college auditorium produced wild cheers.
At one point last week, Mrs. Clinton spent time in the early morning hours looking at the Middle Falls, a picturesque waterfall in Letchworth State Park in Wyoming County. "It's beautiful," she said to an entourage of reporters traveling with her. "Have you ever seen this sight before?" Most of the reporters responded that they had not. "Well, you travel with me," she said, "and you see New York."

The Case for a Breakup

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The overriding policy goal of a remedy in the Microsoft antitrust case, the government has said repeatedly, is to make the world safe for future innovation. The door to fair competition must be left open, the government insisted, so that Microsoft cannot thwart its next head-on challenger with illegal tactics as it did Netscape Communications, the pioneer in Internet browsing software.
In their papers supporting the government's proposal to split Microsoft into two companies, three economists have identified the challenger that could be the "next Netscape": Microsoft's own Office suite of software, like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations. 
 The government plan, no doubt, will strike the executive team at Microsoft as a "Pogo" policy for competition, recalling the observation of Walt Kelly's cartoon possum: "We have met the enemy and he is us."
Yet the economists intend no humor in their prediction that the Office business, once placed in a separate company from Microsoft's industry standard Windows operating system, will be a powerful force for reviving competition in the software industry.
That idea is the linchpin argument in trying to convince a federal district court in Washington that splitting up Microsoft is a risk worth taking, a step that would serve to increase competition, encourage innovation in America's high-technology economy and benefit consumers.
And the prediction is being made by three leaders of the emerging "new mainstream" in economics: Paul M. Romer of Stanford University, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley and Rebecca M. Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They are economists in their late 30's and 40's who focus on the effects that innovation and new technology have on economic growth, industrial organization and corporate behavior.
The intellectual debate over the government's remedy will revolve around the innovation arguments presented by the government's economic advisers. The court's decision, Mr. Romer wrote, "will profoundly affect the information industry, the most technologically dynamic sector in our economy."
Of course, Microsoft would agree entirely with that statement, but it argues that the government proposal is a dangerous gamble with history given the fast-changing conditions in high-technology markets whose direction even entrepreneurs, let alone courts, cannot predict.
But Mr. Romer and his colleagues say the remedy is needed precisely to protect and accelerate the innovation process. "By encouraging conditions that encourage increased competition in the operating system market," Mr. Romer wrote, "this remedy will increase the rate of innovation in the software industry and thereby increase the rate of growth for the economy as a whole."
He added, "The lasting stream of benefits that can be expected to follow from this remedy will substantially outweigh any temporary costs that it may involve."
There are two ways, the economists say, that a stand-alone Office business could bring new competition to the software industry. The first is that Office, like Netscape's Navigator browser, has the potential to become a software "platform" capable of competing with Windows. Netscape posed a frightening challenge to Microsoft, trial evidence showed: as a layer of software that sat on top of the Microsoft operating system, it could replace Windows as the technology that controls the look and feel of computing.
And for software developers, the Netscape browser threatened to become a kind of "middleware." Such software could replace Windows in providing the key software hooks -- known as application programming interfaces, or API's -- that programmers write if their electronic commerce applications, e-mail and games are to run smoothly on personal computers.
In an internal memo in 1995, "The Internet Tidal Wave," William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, warned Netscape could "commoditize" the Windows operating system.
The breakup, Ms. Henderson wrote, will "have the effect of putting important middleware into the hands of a firm that has no incentive to protect Windows." She added that both Office and the Internet Explorer browser, which would be placed in the Office company under the government proposal, are "popular applications that expose API's and are widely distributed."
Ms. Henderson wrote, "Office is, like Navigator, an application in wide demand for its own sake that rivals Windows in its level of penetration." Accordingly, she stated that an independent company controlling Office "might threaten Windows much as Netscape threatened Windows in 1996."
The Office company, Mr. Romer wrote, could foster competition and innovation in the operating system market in a number of ways. It could, for example, develop its own operating system. Most likely, this would be an operating system tailored to the Office applications for computing in emerging markets, like on handheld machines or so-called Web applications.
For example, Word or Excel might reside on a central computer, with customers tapping into it over high-speed networks using an Internet appliance instead of a personal computer running Windows.
The other way a stand-alone Office company could encourage competition would be to support operating systems that compete with Windows, like Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix operating system. An independent Office business would have a strong incentive to make sure its programs run on Linux, the economists say, because it would no longer be trying to help Windows maintain its dominance.
This kind of healthy competition between powerful companies in adjacent markets is now evident in the relationship between Microsoft and Intel. Just as the Windows software controls the basic operations of nearly 85 percent of all personal computers, Intel holds a similar share of the market for microprocessor chips that power PC's. Intel's chips run mainly on Windows, but it has made investments to back companies that produce operating systems like Linux that compete with Microsoft.
"Intel is following its own self-interest in working with multiple operating systems," Mr. Shapiro wrote. "In similar fashion, the applications company will have incentives to be 'platform neutral' following the reorganization, rather than favoring the Windows platform."
Some economists have criticized the breakup proposal as likely to increase prices for consumers. They believe that Microsoft now has incentives to restrain the price of both Windows and Office in the greater interest of reaching a larger market for both products. Once split up, they say, both companies -- dominant in their respective markets -- will focus more on near-term profits. "I worry that the net effect of this may be to increease prices for consumers," said Nicholas Econimedes, an economist at the New York University business school.
Yet the three economists endorsing the government plan say that risk will be more than offset over time by increased competition, and thus lower prices, resulting from the breakup.

A Tangled Path To the Decision To Seek a Split

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
When it all began two years ago, with the federal and state governments filing their landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft, Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin, was struck with a numbing fear: What would the plaintiffs do if they actually won the case against one of the richest and most powerful companies in America?
"It's like the dog chasing the bus," Mr. O'Connor said. "What's he going to do if he catches it?" 
 The answer came Friday. The Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge to break Microsoft into two companies that would compete with each other and, they contended, change the rules of competition across the software industry. Today, government officials were relieved, behaving in some ways like a new parent after a long and tortured labor. And that it was.
Over the last few weeks, the Justice Department and 19 states were sometimes in warring camps that reconfigured themselves as events swirled around them. All think it something of a miracle that a vast majority wound up in agreement on a single remedy proposal. (Two attorneys general dissented.)
Within the Justice Department, the job was easier. On Sunday, April 2, the day after mediation efforts broke down, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general who heads the antitrust division, convened his senior aides and polled them on their preferred remedies.
"And everyone said the same thing: ops-aps," said one person with knowledge of the discussion. Ops-aps is the term coined within the department for the proposal to create two new companies, one that would have the Windows operating system and another that would have the applications software, like word processing and spreadsheet programs.
A roughly similar idea had been offered during the settlement talks. But this point of consensus was reached only at the end of a long and bumpy road.
Almost immediately after Mr. O'Connor worried about the dog and the bus in May 1998, the states had agreed to form a remedies committee, which began work well before the trial opened in October 1998. After almost a year of research, consultations with experts and intense internal discussions, they came up with a plan that was presented at the group's annual convention in Washington in March 1999.
The proposal called for forcing Microsoft to auction the source code for the Windows operating system to other companies, which would develop and improve it, creating competition in the operating system business.
The states were not interested in breaking up Microsoft, even though the antitrust trial was almost over and it was clear that Microsoft had put on a miserable defense in court.
Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, who was by far the most active of the 19 attorneys general, said the idea "was somewhere between conduct and structural" -- that is, between merely restricting Microsoft's behavior and actually restructuring the company.
But as the states quickly found out, there was one big problem. When they talked to the various companies that might be bidders in the Windows auction, they learned that none had any interest in bidding. The consensus was that the computer code was too complicated, and the price was likely to be too high.
"So we discarded that idea," Mr. Miller said. And another attorney general, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said the government's ability to impeach the credibility of Microsoft executives who testified helped convince him and others about that time that remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct probably would not work.
"We saw that there was no moral core to their defense," he said. "It was all bluster and rhetoric, so I came away thinking that it was very risky to believe there would be even a scintilla of credibility on their part" when it came to hoping they would abide by conduct restrictions.
About the time the states were reaching this point in their thinking, Mr. Klein chartered a wide research project on remedies using department staff and academic experts. Over the summer, Justice Department personnel spoke with dozens of computer industry leaders, analysts, venture capitalists, lawyers and others to gauge their views on remedies. Mr. Klein carried out many of the interviews himself.
Some of those consulted were Microsoft allies; others were theoretically loyal customers, and still others were competitors. But "the broad consensus, when you took the competitors out of it, was that Microsoft could and would evade conduct remedies," a person with direct knowledge of the discussions said.
Still no decision was made. But then Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his findings of fact on Nov. 5, declaring Microsoft a market-stifling monopoly, and opinions within the Justice Department began to coalesce. The department began looking for an investment banking firm to help explore the economic ramifications of a breakup or other structural remedy, an official said. On Dec. 2, it hired the New York firm Greenhill & Company.
Around that time, court-sponsored settlement talks opened, mediated by Judge Richard Posner, chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago. By the time he asked for remedy ideas early this year, the Justice Department was ready. The department proposed splitting Microsoft into three companies. One would hold Windows 98, and another would have Windows 2000, the new operating system recently released, primarily for big corporate users. A third company would hold the rest of Microsoft's businesses.
This was intended to create immediate competition in the operating system business, and the states joined in advocating the idea. But after a period of discussion, Judge Posner said he had spoken to Microsoft, and the company had made it clear it was not willing even to discuss the proposal. One official said Judge Posner also raised his own objections, saying he believed an appeals court would not look favorably at the idea. "It would arouse tremendous resistance in Congress, allowing Microsoft to rally public opinion against the suit," the official added, paraphrasing the judge.
That breakup proposal was dropped. Instead, the Justice Department, Judge Posner and Microsoft, often represented by its chairman, William H. Gates, fell into intense negotiations over a set of conduct remedies. Judge Posner essentially locked the states out of the process, several state officials said.
As the states got word of the discussions, they grew distressed. They considered the plan under discussion wholly inadequate.
"The states just would not have agreed to it," Mr. Miller said. As a result, he and others said, the attorneys general were relieved when the talks broke down on April 1. But they were also demoralized. The judge had issued a statement praising the negotiating parties but had pointedly failed to mention the states. And Microsoft blamed the states for the failure of the talks -- an idea state and federal officials denied.
"Morale was down," Mr. Miller said. But more important, in meetings with the litigants, Judge Jackson had made it clear he wanted to complete the remedy phase of the trial quickly. On April 5 he said he wanted a joint state-federal remedy proposal by the end of the month.
That was three days after the meeting in Mr. Klein's conference room in which the group had reached consensus on the ops-aps breakup strategy (though the department had much work to do on the details of its proposal). But the last the states had heard, the Justice Department was proposing a range of conduct remedies to Judge Posner.
And Harry First, a senior official in the New York attorney general's office, said the states figured "the judge didn't want two different opinions in front of him." The states also believed, "after Justice's performance in the settlement talks, that it was not at all likely they would go for a structural remedy," another state official said, so "we decided we would devise as long a list of conduct remedies as we could."
By mid-April the centerpiece of the states' evolving proposal was three ideas that Mr. Miller called "conduct plus" remedies. The first was to prevent Microsoft from adding new products to Windows unless they were distributed on a separate disk that users could chose whether to install. The second was to require Microsoft to divest itself of Internet Explorer, the Web browser that is part of Windows. It would be put in a separate company. And the third was to require Microsoft to create versions of its package of applications software, Microsoft Office, for other operating systems.
Those ideas and others were proposed at meeting of the attorneys general in Chicago on April 13. All the states but Louisiana attended. Even the states that opposed structural remedies, notably Ohio and Illinois, seemed to like the ideas. "They seemed pretty interested," Mr. Miller said. So the states prepared a list of conduct remedies, with those three ideas at the center.
At the Justice Department, meanwhile, officials were talking to industry leaders about the ops-aps idea, and other short-term conduct remedies to go with it. Soon after, Mr. Klein took the idea to Attorney General Janet Reno for approval, and she gave it.
In the middle of all this, the states decided to send the Justice Department a copy of their proposal, unsolicited. "We wanted to get it to Justice as soon as we could," Mr. First said. Another official said, "We hoped it would prompt some discussion with them," because so far there had been no substantive contacts.
The Justice Department did not respond substantively even to this, though Mr. Klein did tell Mr. Miller, "I can see you put a lot of work into this," Mr. Miller said.
Work continued on the state plan, but experts consulted by the states began pointing out significant problems with some proposals. For example, what if Microsoft simply reported, a year later, that it had been unable to create a version of its Office software for Linux, another operating system? What recourse would the attorneys general have?
Then, on April 17, Mr. Klein individually called Mr. Miller, Mr. Blumenthal and Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York. He told them they would be surprised and pleased by the federal proposal.
"It's going to be more aggressive than what you are considering now," Mr. Miller quoted Mr. Klein as saying. One knowledgeable person said Mr. Klein was trying to signal his department's direction without being specific; he was afraid of leaks.
But none drew the conclusion that Mr. Klein seemed to intend. "He didn't convey a whole lot," said Mr. First, who was on the call with Mr. Spitzer. "From my point of view, as we were trying to draft something, it was sort of meaningless."
Mr. Blumenthal said, "The conversation wasn't very specific."
And Mr. Miller said, "I thought maybe he was saying they were going to come up with some proposals in the midrange, conduct-plus sort of things." So the state research continued, but experts and analysts began poking more and more holes in the proposals. "It got very frustrating," one official said.
Finally, on April 20, Mr. Klein convened a conference call with his aides and the same three attorneys general. He told them exactly what the Justice Department intended to propose: the ops-aps idea along with a set of conduct remedies.
"I was somewhat surprised," Mr. Miller said. So were the others. "But the more I thought about it," he added, "I was pleased" -- particularly since the states' proposal was rapidly falling apart.
Mr. Miller said he asked Mr. Klein how he had come to his proposal. He said Mr. Klein told him: "We looked at conduct plus, like you did. But we came to the conclusion that it wouldn't work as well as we had thought."
Mr. Miller said the states had come to the same conclusion, "but we hadn't announced it." So the states embraced the federal plan, noting that many elements were identical to their own.
Now all of them have to wait for the decision of the judge. "It's not appropriate to speculate on how he will proceed or how he will rule," Mr. O'Connor said.
But with a chuckle, another official said, "I would bet he'll reach his decision more easily than we did."

HEADLINE: GORE FAULTS BUSH ON FOREIGN POLICY

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
In a foreign policy speech to be delivered on Sunday, Vice President Al Gore gives one of his harshest assessments to date of Gov. George W. Bush, saying his Republican rival is stuck in a cold war time warp, has serious gaps in his experience and knowledge and would rely on isolationist, right-wing advisers for guidance.
Mr. Gore faults Mr. Bush for proposing to "skip" a generation of military weapons while emphasizing research into more advanced ones, leaving the United States unprepared for battlefields of the next two or three decades, and for wanting to deploy an implausible "Star Wars" system. 
 The vice president casts the Texas governor as unrealistic and irresponsible for regarding Russia and China as enemies of the United States and suggests that Mr. Bush would ignore Africa because it does not fit America's strategic interests.
"Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the cold war past when speaking of the use of force," Mr. Gore says in prepared remarks that were provided by his staff the day before they were to be delivered in Boston. "Stuck in a cold war mindset, Governor Bush continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies."
Condoleezza Rice, the chief foreign policy coordinator for Mr. Bush, replied, "There is nobody more internationalist than Governor Bush from the point of view of American national security interests."
Ms. Rice, who served as a Russia specialist in President George Bush's National Security Council, called Mr. Gore's assertion that Governor Bush was stuck in a cold war mindset "a ludicrous charge."
In the speech, Mr. Gore presents himself as more forward thinking -- constructing a kind of Gore doctrine that he calls "forward engagement," which essentially is to nip problems before they swell into crises. He says he views Russia and China not as enemies but as "vital partners." And he goes on to give his strongest support to date for establishing permanent normal trade relations with China.
"One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership," Mr. Gore said.
He links Mr. Bush with Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms has said that he will block any arms control agreements until a new president is inaugurated, scuttling any hope President Clinton may have of reaching an arms control pact with Russia, which he is to visit in June.
Regarding China, Mr. Gore says, "It is wrong to isolate and demonize China, to build a wall when we need to build a bridge," speaking here less to Mr. Bush, who also supports open trade with China, than to his own backers in organized labor, who oppose such an agreement.
Yet Mr. Gore, in his speech, does not seize the opportunity of what his staff says is a major foreign policy address to lay out an agenda that diverges from the main outlines of the Clinton administration's policies. The speech contains no specific new foreign policy proposals.
The vice president does carry forward the administration's approach of elevating new issues -- the economy, health and the environment -- to the top of his international agenda.
He believes the classic cold war paradigm of war and peace among nations should give way to "a new security agenda for the global age based on forward engagement."
The Bush campaign has criticized the Clinton administration's foreign policy as devoid of strategic vision and characterized by ad hoc responses to crisis after crisis. For that reason, perhaps, Mr. Gore does not mention President Clinton's name once in his speech.
To bolster his standing as a Democrat with strong defense views, Mr. Gore notes that he was one of the few Democrats to break with the party and vote in favor of going to war against Saddam Hussein in 1991 after the invasion of Kuwait. He says the United States should intervene when national security is at stake, when a military engagement can work, where allies are willing and the costs are acceptable.
"We cannot be the global policeman, but we must reject the new isolationism that says: don't help anywhere, because we can't help everywhere," he says.
He also notes that he pushed for a new generation of missiles during his years in the Senate.
Ms. Rice, the Bush adviser, turned the tables and charged that after seven years of a Clinton presidency, "the armed forces are in the worst shape that they have been since the Carter era in terms of morale, procurement, in terms of using spare parts from one airplane to fly another." Mr. Gore, she added, "has no standing to paint himself as a defender of military readiness."
Ms. Rice was most pointed in her criticism of the way Mr. Gore has dealt with Russia. She said Mr. Gore has "defended as liberal reformers people who were stealing the country blind."
"He turned a blind eye to corruption in which millions of dollars in private capital and international financial assistance went into Swiss bank accounts," she said. "I don't think he has any notion of what he is dealing with in Russia."
Mr. Gore, apparently trying to inoculate himself from this kind of charge, is critical of Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya, for supplying weapons to "irresponsible groups," and failing to combat corruption.
Mr. Gore's intentions are clear. The speech is one more block that Mr. Gore is using to build his case that Mr. Bush is too unprepared, naive and reckless to be president. Placed in the context of an increasingly complex world, these failures, Mr. Gore suggests, could be perilous.
By contrast, Mr. Gore portrays himself as far more worldly, noting that he served in Vietnam, albeit as a journalist, a conflict that "I witnessed with my own eyes." Mr. Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard at the time.
The vice president also plans to remind his audience, the International Press Institute, that he has always been more hawkish than his fellow Democrats on foreign policy matters, notably by supporting the use of force against Mr. Hussein, pressing for a strong national defense and supporting a move away from multiple-warhead missiles to single-warhead missiles as a way to reduce the appeal of a nuclear first strike.
Mr. Gore accuses the Republican leaders of Congress of a blend of isolationism and obstructionism.
"They have refused to adequately fund our diplomatic and international development efforts, from promoting peace in the Middle East to fighting drugs in South America," he says. "They have held our contributions to the United Nations hostage to their own political agenda for years. They have repeatedly tried to sabotage this administration's programs even in places like Bosnia and Kosovo, where what is needed is steadiness and continuity of purpose. They have made themselves the sworn enemies of a worldwide effort to deal with the global environment."
And he criticizes Mr. Bush for having "joined with the isolationist, partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
Mr. Gore essentially calls for an Americanization of the world economy, saying America has a vital interest in promoting its own economic prosperity throughout the world. "We need to promote the stable flow of investment around the world," he says, although he does not describe a mechanism for doing that within a free market system, where investors have as much right to pull money out as they have to put it in.

HEADLINE: Island Talks Get New Push From Japan And Russia

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, April 29

 BODY:
In their first meeting as the new leaders of Russia and Japan, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori pledged today to meet often, to call each other by their nicknames and to try to conclude a long-sought peace treaty by the end of the year.
Such a treaty would formally end decades of antagonism between the countries over a group of islands seized by Russia at the end of World War II. In making the pledge, both leaders were reaffirming the commitment of their predecessors to reach that goal. 
 During the last two years, Russia and Japan have exchanged proposals and counterproposals over one of the most nettlesome territorial disputes left over from the war. Japan calls the islands its Northern Territories, and Russia claims them as part of the Kurile Islands chain.
Russia forcefully reasserted its sovereignty over the islands on April 21 by firing on, boarding and seizing a Japanese fishing boat near there.
"We attach great significance to concluding a peace treaty by the end of the year," Mr. Mori said at a joint news conference in the Winter Palace of the Romanov czars, which now houses the Hermitage Museum.
For his part, Mr. Putin said he had accepted an invitation to go to Tokyo this summer for an official visit that both sides hope will yield a compromise on the islands.
For Russia, concluding the treaty would likely pave the way for greater economic assistance from Japan, which has lent Russia $1 billion in the last three years. For Japan, too, ending the dispute would remove a major domestic issue and a brake on overall relations with Moscow.
Mr. Putin and Mr. Mori spent a full day together, beginning with formal exchanges in the Mikhailovsky Palace, which houses the Russian Museum, then moving to the nearby Winter Palace.
After lunch and a performance of chamber music, Mr. Putin and Mr. Mori emerged to say that they had already established such a close personal relationship that they agreed to call each Yoshi and Volodya, the familiar forms for their names.
The two leaders discussed preparations for the summit meeting in Okinawa in July of the world's major industrial powers, and Russia's view of nuclear disarmament issues. It was, however, almost preordained that they would make no breakthrough on the sensitive issue of the islands during their first meeting, especially with Mr. Mori's Liberal Democratic Party facing parliamentary elections in June.
Any compromise on Japan's sovereignty over the islands could raise a political storm at home for Mr. Mori, who made Moscow the first stop of his inaugural tour of major Western capitals.
Mr. Mori, who became prime minister this month after his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a stroke, will also visit Italy, Germany, France, Great Britain, Canada and the United States, where he will meet President Clinton on May 5.
In the coming weeks, intensive negotiations are expected on how to structure a compromise on the future of the Kurile Islands.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia consistently balked at Japanese demands to return the islands outright as a precondition for any significant development in economic and trade relations. But since 1997, Japan has reversed policy and has pursued a course of expanding trade and economic assistance to Russia.

HEADLINE: Bronx Journal;
Once a Hospital and Again an Anchor

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
From the outside, the old Morrisania Hospital in the Bronx looks much as it did 20, or 70, years ago: blond brick, lots of it, coating the neo-Renaissance facade of an 11-story building that takes up much of a square block.
But inside, there are no patients, or doctors, or nurses, no emergency room or maternity ward. What was the ambulance garage is a fitness center; where rabbits were once used for pregnancy tests, there is a community room; what was a waiting room is now a lobby, with a lunch kiosk, for a community economic development center. 
 After more than 20 years of sitting empty, the grand building on East 168th Street between Gerard and Walton Avenues in the southern Bronx is once again an institutional anchor for its neighborhood, much as the municipal hospital once was.
On one side, 132 apartments for low-income and formerly homeless families have been carved out. From the light-filled lobby to the arched windows and the 12-foot ceilings in some apartments, they retain the beauty of the original structure.
"The best apartment I've ever lived in," said Antonio Cortijo, 67, who moved to the apartment in 1997.
On the other side of the building is the Urban Horizons Center, which offers residents of the neighborhood an array of social services, from job training and child care to counseling. Many of the services are intended to help welfare recipients, including those who face the greatest difficulties moving into the work force.
The faces who come through the door are, of course, different from those who came through in the hospital's early years. When it was built in 1926, Morrisania Hospital served a population of mostly second-generation immigrants, many of whom were Jewish, German or Irish, said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. The hospital, he said, saved his own life in the 1940's, when he had a severe asthma attack.
Over the years, the faces became mostly black and Puerto Rican, and poorer. Then the Bronx's well-catalogued troubles and the building of Co-op City drained the area around the hospital of much of its population. In 1976, a city facing fiscal crisis decided to close the hospital. There were protests, even a doctors' sit-in, to no avail. Morrisania Hospital was shut.
Nancy Biberman, president of the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, which runs Urban Horizons, led the effort for the building's rehabilitation, starting in the early 1990's. The redone building opened in 1997, after the organization received $23 million in state, federal and private funds.
"Its closing was very symbolic in a very, very negative way," Ms. Biberman said. To make matters worse, the building stood empty for 20 years. It drew drug users and rats and dumpers, so that when Ms. Biberman first climbed under a fence to explore the building, the debris in the building was up to her chest.
"It was horrible," said Carla Baldelomar, 25, who has lived in the neighborhood for 12 years. "You didn't want to walk by here."
The light-colored exterior of the building helped keep the outside from becoming too forbidding. And now there is an interior to match: sconces and pilasters in the residential hallways, solid oak cabinets and ceramic tiles in apartment kitchens. And on the other side, there is an array of services offered by the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation.
There is an upscale catering business that trains the unemployed in preparing everything from canapes to marketing plans; a day care center; a program to train and license at-home child care providers; a fitness center; a computer center; family support and counseling services and job readiness programs. A new city school, the Rafael Hernandez Dual Language Magnet School, on the site of what was the hospital's laundry, opened last fall.
The activity within the walls, although full of promise, also shows how hard surviving poverty, let alone surmounting it, can be. Ms. Biberman's organization, which was founded to help low-income women, is committed to working with the hardest-to-place welfare recipients, and that requires fitting together support for every aspect of life.
In one classroom, students pepper Lizette Roman, their English-as-a- second-language teacher, with questions and complaints that their English class is scheduled at the same time as their workfare requirements. For many of the adults in her class, most of whom are Dominican, language is the greatest barrier to entering the work force.
In a job-readiness class, Didria Brown helps a man who can barely read as he fills out a job application, showing him what to write when he sees "MI" or "SSN."
Numerical illiteracy is a problem as well, particularly for students looking for jobs in the food-service industry. Many have sixth- or eighth-grade math skills at best, yet cooking relies on numbers: calculating portions for a dinner of four, or knowing how many people a pound of asparagus could serve. The students take basic math as part of orientation.
The catering business, Urban Horizons Food Company, which is overseen by two former pastry chefs from Lespinasse, primarily serves Manhattan businesses and organizations. Ms. Biberman is practical: the Bronx, she says, has always been a bedroom community. People must be trained to go to jobs, not wait for them to materialize close to home.
So Deborah Horne, who lives a few blocks from Yankee Stadium, will probably commute to work in the food business.
She is well prepared, having learned to saute, to handle raw meat with sanitary care, to glaze vegetables to a shine, to sear tuna, not just scoop it from a can, and to run the lunch kiosk in the lobby.
Ms. Horne said that when she came to the center as a public assistance recipient last year, and heard that it offered a free culinary training program, "I just stood and held onto the counter. You don't get culinary for free," she said.
After six months in the program, she has gained skills but lost weight -- almost 40 pounds, thanks to classes in the fitness center required by the training program.
"People like us, we don't go to gyms; we can't afford gyms," Ms. Horne said.
But she can afford this one. Already, more than 400 residents of the neighborhood have joined her.

HEADLINE: In a Village's Long Memory, The Vietnam War Is Fleeting

SERIES: VIETNAM TODAY: In History's Shadow

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KHANH HAU, Vietnam, April 28

 BODY:
"No," said Bui Thi Van, a frail village woman of 80, "I don't think anything has changed."
She cast her mind back through the history of the village -- through the American war, the Japanese occupation, the French colonial administration -- back through six generations to her illustrious ancestor, Nguyen Huynh Duc, who, long before today's Communists, fought in a war to unify Vietnam. 
 "No," she concluded, "it's not different at all. We still work in the fields. We still worship here. We have water and electricity now, but actually nothing has changed."
She paused to swing a mallet three times against a great brass bell as a visitor lit a fistful of incense sticks at the altar of Marshal Duc, who is now the village deity.
Then she added, "I don't go anywhere, so how can I see any changes."
Indeed, if she traveled only a short distance to the main north-south highway, she would see the forward edge of advancing development from Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, 30 miles to the north, into the fertile farmlands of the Mekong delta.
She would also spy several miles away a small red banner reminding travelers that Sunday marks the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of northern and southern Vietnam under Communist rule.
Here in Khanh Hau, it takes only a short walk from the noisy highway to enter the timeless world of rural Vietnam, where 80 percent of the nation's people live, hidden behind thick stands of coconut and areca palms, banana trees and feathery bamboo.
Like the rest of Vietnam, Khanh Hau has not escaped the ravages of Vietnam's wars and the pressures of its politics and modernization.
In a narrow strip along the highway, new factories manufacture textiles, ceramics, plastics and aluminum plate. Billboards advertise tires, pesticides, face cream and family planning. The nearby village of Ben Luc, famous for its pineapples, now uses its fields for factories and imports pineapples from elsewhere to be sold along the roadside.
But Vietnamese villages are insular places, stubborn and self-contained. They absorb the pressures of history, adapt to them and, like Khanh Hau, go on very much as before.
This is a difficult country to subdue or to manage. In an often-repeated saying, the mandate of the emperor stops at the village gate.
"Rural communities have always been the real areas of negotiation," said Shaun K. Malarney, a Tokyo-based American scholar of Vietnamese village life. The history of Vietnam is not just the history of great national events, he said; it is thousands of histories of individual villages.
"Once you pass through the village gate you are in a way entering a different history, a different sense of place," he said. "If we are going to write the history of Vietnam since 1975, it's not just the liberation of Saigon or these types of things. It is also the story of what has happened in communities like Khanh Hau and how they pursue their own needs and desires and traditions."
As successive governments have recast history to suit their politics, Marshal Duc -- a hero of the Tay Son rebellion of the late 18th century -- has shifted in and out of official favor. But his cult has persisted into what is now the 10th generation of his descendants, and pilgrims still come here to pray at his shrine.
Continuity and change are easy to assess in Khanh Hau because it is one of the most thoroughly examined villages in Vietnam, the subject, among others, of a classic study by the anthropologist Gerald Cannon Hickey called "Village in Vietnam" (Yale, 1964).
"At high tide, the water rises and the stream presses in around the houses lining the bank, giving the impression that Ap Cau is a floating hamlet," he wrote, "a green island in the midst of paddy fields.
Like the flood tides of the Mekong delta, history has washed across the village -- and its scattered hamlets like Ap Cau -- but it has remained a place that Marshal Duc would recognize.
Indeed, Khanh Hau, with its population of about 3,000, was something of an island during the American war -- the site in the early 1960's of a "strategic hamlet" in which the American side relocated the more remote villagers into a tightly defended cantonment.
"When I was a boy I didn't know anything about the war," said Nguyen Huynh Khanh, 45, a farmer who is one of Mrs. Van's nine children. "This was a protected village, and everything was quiet here."
From time to time, Mr. Hickey wrote, the farmers paused in their fields to watch the bombing of a distant neighbor, the village of Cu Chi, a stronghold of Communist resistance that has remained famous for its network of tunnels.
But not all in the family escaped the war; three of Mr. Khanh's brothers fought on the South Vietnamese side.
One was killed and one emigrated to the United States in 1991, after serving for six years in a re-education camp after the Communist victory.
The family has little contact with its American son. "It would cost us a whole rice crop to make one telephone call to him," Mr. Khanh said.
The martial history of the village also tied it to the war, both before and after 1975.
During the war, a series of South Vietnamese and American officers and government officials stopped here to pay their respects to the memory of Marshal Duc and to record their visits in a fat red guest book. They included William E. Colby, at one time the top man for the Central Intelligence Agency in Vietnam and later its director. He took the occasion of his visit in May 1969 to tout America's policies. Updating Vietnamese history, he wrote, "With gratitude for Marshal Duc's inspiration to better pacification."
The guest book is mostly blank after 1975, reflecting the new government's suspicions both of Khanh Hau's recent history and of Marshal Duc's role in the long-ago Tay Son rebellion.
"For a while, things were a little difficult," Mr. Khanh said. "They accused us of being in the noble class. They called us collaborators with the French colonialists."
Much of the land the family had held for centuries was redistributed, and the brothers found themselves doing the hard work that laborers had performed for them in the past.
"But now things are pretty much back the way they were," Mr. Khanh said. The government leaves them alone. The shrine is newly refurbished. The crowds on Marshal Duc's feast day number in the hundreds.
Vietnam's villages remain some of the poorest in the world. But there has been some change. When Mr. Hickey studied Khanh Hau nearly 40 years ago, there were no motor vehicles here. There were just six battery-powered radios, owned by the most wealthy residents.
Today, Mrs. Van's family has a motorbike and an electric clock that announces the time in a recorded woman's voice. Some of Mrs. Van's grandchildren study in Ho Chi Minh City; one works there as an accountant.
One 10th-generation descendant of Marshal Duc, 3-year-old Nguyen Huynh Thanh Tong, may be the bearer of a message about the future. On a recent day, he wore a T-shirt with the words "Born to be wild."
"You can't judge the present by the standards of the past," Mr. Khanh said. "In the past, in Marshal Duc's day, the children of kings were kings. Now it is the people with talent who rise."
But until there is a revolution that is more far-reaching than the Communist victory of 1975, even the wild and the talented will remain rooted in their villages.
In her long life, Mrs. Van has seen her nation convulsed and transformed, and yet, as she says, she has seen nothing change. All day long, she paces through the newly whitewashed shrine, sweeping, dusting, adjusting the flames of small oil lamps.
Not far away lies the imposing tomb of her ancestor, Marshal Duc, its stone walls pitted by age, its precolonial Chinese lettering faded. Other family tombs lie here and there around it, arranged according to astrological dictates, covered by waxy white flowers from the trees that shade them.
The scene is a reassuring anchor for a people buffeted by history.
"When I go," said Mrs. Van with a note of satisfaction, "I'll be buried here too."

That Whining Sound Of Lost Money and Lives

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.

 BODY:
Responding to a study showing malaria is a major impediment to African development, the World Bank announced that it would pledge $500 million toward the eradication of the disease. The announcement came in Abuja, Nigeria, at the first international summit on the disease, which kills 3,000 Africans a day, most of them children.
The study of 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, done by Harvard's Center for International Development and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, concluded that sub-Saharan Africa's gross domestic product would now be $400 billion instead of $300 billion if malaria had been eliminated in 1965. 
 The first line of defense is mosquito nets dipped in insecticide, a fact which Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Center for International Development, said might induce Americans to contribute more money to cure the disease. "Bed nets," he pointed out, "aren't going to end up in bank accounts in Switzerland." DONALD G. McNEIL JR.

The Challenge
 of Global Capitalism
 The World Economy
 in the 21st Century.
 By Robert Gilpin
 with the assistance
 of Jean Millis Gilpin.
 Illustrated. 373 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
 Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 Late in the afternoon in early December, on the first day of the antiglobalization demonstrations in Seattle, I scrambled through the tear-gas-filled streets, and marveled that a deadly dull meeting of the World Trade Organization had suddenly turned into a riot of strange bedfellows. Here were environmentalists dressed in sea-turtle costumes marching arm in arm with Teamsters, who until now have not been known for their concern about the fate of tortoises. A few blocks away, self-described anarchists ran circles around a befuddled police force, kicking out windows in a protest against -- well, they weren't quite sure just what. (At a coffee bar near the chaos -- this was Seattle after all -- one of the more aggressive protesters acknowledged to me that he was not quite sure what the World Trade Organization did, but he was angry about "the way rich people run the world.")
Just as I was taking all this in, my cell phone rang. It was one of this country's top trade negotiators, locked in a hotel room high above the melee and barred by the Secret Service from venturing out. "What's happening down there?" he inquired. I filled in the details. "You think that's chaos?" he said. "The Pakistanis just told us, 'We will blow up the negotiations,' and the Indians, who are usually talking about blowing up the Pakistanis, say they are going to help." Indeed, to many in the developing world, the whole effort to start a new round of global trade talks was part of a plot by the United States to set rules that would make the developing world's economy more expensive -- under the guise of preventing child labor or stopping pollution. Or, as Youssef Boutros-Ghali, the savvy Egyptian trade minister, asked at the end of the Seattle debacle, "Why, all of a sudden, when third world labor has proved to be competitive, do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers?"
All this calls out for explanation. Robert Gilpin, an emeritus professor of public and international affairs at Princeton and a man who has written often about markets and economic institutions, offers a comprehensive take on this new world of economic conflict. Unfortunately, he finished "The Challenge of Global Capitalism" before all those emotions erupted in Seattle. But he understands, at least intuitively, that the wheels may be coming off the post-cold-war roller coaster that the United States rode to great heights in the 1990's.
Like many economists, though, Gilpin appears a bit perplexed about how to handle the politics of it all both at home and abroad. And the battle over who gets gored by the consequences of economic globalization is, after all, entirely about politics. It is about whether the rules of free trade should protect tortoises and set minimum wages, even if that means that the World Trade Organization overrules the governments of India or Egypt or even the United States. It is about who sets those rules and about brewing resentments among winners and losers. Wander anywhere abroad, from Malaysia to Japan to France, and it does not take long to find raw resentment that the world economy is now run by "international standards" that look and feel suspiciously American. After all, isn't it Washington that pulls the strings of the International Monetary Fund? Isn't it the United States that is using the Internet to spread American-style capitalism? And aren't global trade talks an effort to rig the rules to benefit the most technologically advanced and the most competitive?
Early in his book Gilpin notes that "rejoicing in their own good fortune, Americans failed to appreciate that the country's prosperity was highly dependent on the global economy and that, in international economic affairs as in other aspects of life, no person or country is an island." And throughout the 1990's, he adds, few noticed that "although global capitalism has indeed triumphed, the larger global economy was in serious trouble." Stranger yet, even citizens of the countries that have been the biggest winners of economic globalization are complaining. After all, virtually all of those protesters in Seattle were Americans, many of them taking time off from jammed docks and overworked factories. Prosperous times have treated them well but have not alleviated their sense that the global economy can, in the click of a keyboard, move a good job in Seattle to Bangalore. The result is more suspicion than ever about the wisdom of open markets. In fact, it is questionable whether the North American Free Trade Agreement would pass in Congress today, even though economic conditions now are far stronger than they were in 1994. And there is doubt that Congress will agree to normal trade status for China this year, even though the accord that ushers China into the World Trade Organization requires China to open its markets, but essentially contains no concessions on the part of the United States.
"All the political elements that have supported an open global economy have considerably weakened," Gilpin concludes. "Despite the huge benefits" of the system, he argues, "an open and integrated global economy is neither as extensive and inexorable nor as irreversible as many assume." In other words, even as nations around the world race to embrace free-market capitalism -- or at least talk a good game -- their political systems convulse at its ramifications. The result is a search for a new protectionism. Europe uses dubious science to keep genetically modified farm products, chiefly from the United States, off its shelves. China woos investors but at the same time is desperately attempting to regulate access to the Internet, for fear that the Communist Party will lose even more control over the country. Japan discovers, to its horror, that years of sharply limiting foreign investment and immigration to retain control over its economy have deprived it of both foreign innovation and foreign innovators; after a lost decade, it cannot bring itself to break old habits. All this has turned American foreign policy on its head. Negotiating the number of warheads that the former Soviet Union could keep on top of a missile was a breeze compared with trying to negotiate an accord among 160 nations about a set of minimum rights for workers that makes sense in both Brussels and Shanghai. Gilpin, alas, does relatively little to parse the political complexity. "Most Western economists are very dubious about making workers' rights a part of the trade regime, as this would unduly complicate trade negotiations," he writes. It is in this territory where the interests of individual nations come into direct conflict with America's sense of how the post-cold-war world should be molded that a whole new world of foreign policy is being created.
Atop that is added another layer of complexity: at what point does the rest of the world have to step in to save a country from its own failed economic policies before the infection spreads? This was the question raised by the Mexican peso crisis and then, in much more urgent terms, by the Asian financial crisis. Here Gilpin has some stronger insights. He quotes Walter Wriston, the former Citibank president, who once famously declared that nations "don't go bankrupt." "Unfortunately, Wriston was wrong," Gilpin writes. The Asian crisis proved the case. He describes how a series of bad decisions in Thailand and Indonesia -- from linking their currencies to the dollar, then failing to supervise their banks, then letting political cronies rule some of the world's most promising economies -- led to disaster. In came the International Monetary Fund, followed by the United States Treasury. There was talk of the need to stop "systemic risk" -- banker talk for a problem that leaps, like a wildfire, from one nation to another. On the other hand, Gilpin notes, "the Clinton administration did not want to be viewed as rescuing foreign bankers from the consequences of their own greed and foolishness."
In the end, Gilpin appears to side with those who believe there was some American greed and foolishness at play as well. The Treasury, influenced by American financial interests, used its clout over the years to force open economies around the world, so that American banks and companies could spread their wings around the world. "Unfortunately, the international community, which had pushed for openness, failed to push for regulation of the financial sector, and the governments were too inexperienced to appreciate the dangers of an unregulated financial market," Gilpin concludes. The Asia crisis touched off a debate over whether institutions like the International Monetary Fund and its biggest shareholder, the United States, should get more deeply involved in the way countries run their economies or stand back and let the market apply its own disciplines. No one won that battle -- it was called off as Asia recovered. Even while the street protests continue, like those in Washington in mid-April, the whole debate over creating what President Clinton called a "new international financial architecture" has faded. Politicians cannot apparently sustain interest in the question in the absence of a raging crisis. But financial crises, like volcanoes, do not stay dormant forever. The problem will be back -- along with the guys in the tortoise suits.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Volunteering On Vacation

BYLINE: By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON; MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON is a freelance writer living in San Diego.

 BODY:
AH, vacation. If lounging next to azure water -- breeze in the coconut palms, cool drink in hand -- sounds boring, maybe it's time for something completely different. That's the opinion of an increasing number of altruists who are spending weeks on volunteer or service vacations, performing tasks from clearing waste ditches in Mexico to reintroducing Przewalski horses in Mongolia. Among them are college students seeking an inexpensive, meaningful summer abroad, professionals on sabbatical and retirees and others who want a grass-roots sense of the cultures they visit and an engagement that can't be had from a cruise ship or tour bus.
As these "vacations" become more popular -- Habitat for Humanity fielded 700 volunteers in 1994 and expects 3,000 this year -- more options become available and the possibilities can be bewildering. 
 Service can be a weekend or two years; lodging can be in tents or in a villa; volunteers may get a small living expense, along with free room and board, or they might pay a fee (possibly tax-deductible) that approaches the cost of a regular tour.
A good primer is "Volunteer Vacations," a guide by Bill McMillon (1999), published by the Chicago Review Press, that lists organizations and agencies, cross-referenced by expense, region and type of project. Most riveting are returned volunteers' articles, ranging from a witty account of helping to restore Stowe Landscape Gardens in Britain to wrenching memories of the Home for the Dying and Destitute in Calcutta. Many found their service rewarding. "I received much more than I gave," was the echoing summary.
The Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service, created in 1948 under the aegis of Unesco, helps coordinate voluntary service, especially the work camps, worldwide. It publishes a guidebook, "How to Be a Volunteer in Europe, Africa, Asia and America," and recently opened an information center at the Unesco offices in Paris.
The Internet has several useful sites. One of the best is idealist.org, with links to many United States and global agencies; it freely accepts listings; another is www.avso.org, which has a youth orientation.
Many organizations' Web sites offer links to accounts of returned volunteers, or to the volunteers themselves, so it's worth checking and researching as much as possible in advance. And, although here as elsewhere the level of comfort and security most often rises with the amount of money expended, the mantra of this kind of experience is: "Keep your sense of humor, learn to operate as a group, and don't expect everything to go exactly as planned."
 
Building Projects
Since 1976, with former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, as high-profile participants, Habitat for Humanity, an ecumenical Christian organization, has built more than 85,000 houses, with "sweat equity" from the prospective residents, in more than 2,000 communities around the world. Some projects operate in partnership with Elderhostel, the educational agency for those 55 or older that includes service options in its own programs.
Habitat's Global Village program now mixes tourism with its missions: For example, a 19-day Botswana trip includes side trips to Victoria Falls, white-water rafting, a game drive and cultural exchanges, along with the building activities, for about $4,000. This covers a donation to the building fund in Kasane, medical insurance, housing, ground transportation, meals, administration fees and round-trip air fare to Africa.
The American Friends Service Committee has projects around the United States. It also provides links to service organizations with long- and short-term volunteer opportunities. Quaker Workcamps International specializes in rebuilding burned churches in the United States. This summer the group will continue work on the Community Baptist Church in Cedar Heights, Md., which was destroyed by fire just before Christmas 1997, with weeklong work camps.
 
Culture and Conservation
Other programs focus more on cultural exchange and economic self-sufficiency; participants might help teach English, refurbish school rooms, assist in vocational programs or engage in agricultural or community development or environmental awareness. During a stay of several weeks, participants are immersed in the local culture, with weekends and time at either end of the trip spent sightseeing. Costs, about $500 to $1,000 depending on whether the destination is domestic or international, include most expenses but not air fare.
Two of these organizations, the Global Citizens Network and Global Volunteers, are headquartered in St. Paul, Minn.; each sends small teams of volunteers to help communities on projects they initiate. These might include helping Tibetan refugees in camps in Nepal, refurbishing a preschool in Guatemala's highlands, or teaching English and helping build a school in Ecuador.
Similarly, the Global Service Corps, an adjunct of the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, helps local agencies in Costa Rica, Kenya and Thailand with sustainable development projects. A new Global Service Corps project, Global CPR, developed by the conservationist David Brower, will field volunteers for a year's service in Kenya, Costa Rica or Thailand.
Amizade began with an orthopedic shoe workshop in Santarem, Brazil, in 1995; its programs have grown to include building a vocational school for Santarem street children, as well as projects in the Korrawinga aboriginal community of Queensland, Australia.
Another group of agencies serve as clearinghouses for voluntary service worldwide, often for college students or youths who are willing to rough it in exchange for a meaningful experience abroad in relatively secure conditions. These generally charge an administrative fee of $500 or less, and require participants to pay their way to and from the work site and serve two to three weeks, mostly during the summer months, with basic room and board often provided free or at less than $10 a day. Most camps are limited to those over 18 years old, although some projects accept those as young as 15, and older volunteers are welcome.
One of the largest, oldest and best known of these is the Council for International Educational Exchange, which claims an international staff of nearly 800 in more than 30 countries. One returned volunteer, Vicky Huey, said of her 1998 experience at an environmental work camp in a Japanese forest: "I honestly cannot think of any negatives. The greatest thing was meeting so many people from around the world." In her group of about 25, half were from Japan and the rest from the United States, Germany, Korea, France and the Czech Republic. "To this day I keep in touch with people from the trip."
Volunteers for Peace, founded in 1982, originally focused on exchanges across the Iron Curtain. It now has more than 1,800 programs in over 70 countries; in 1999 it placed more than 1,300 volunteers in its various work camps. Listings range from looking after children orphaned by AIDS in Thailand to helping stage a music festival in Denmark.
"Peace through deeds, not words" has been the mission of Service Civil International since 1920, when its founding members in Europe conceived the idea of a work camp to help reconstruct villages damaged in the First World War. Its work camps, developed in conjunction with local grass-roots organizations, include the Balkan Sunflowers project of volunteers in Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia, and an interesting range of projects in Germany, including maintenance of the Buchenwald concentration camp.
 
Whales and Snow Leopards
Other organizations combine volunteerism with eco-tourism. Earthwatch is probably the best known, with expedition teams of scientists, educators and the public. Offerings can range from a Discovery Weekend cataloging plant specimens at Kew Gardens in London ($150) to a two-week expedition to Ladakh, in India, tracking snow leopards ($2,495); neither price includes air fare. The organization estimates that more than 4,000 Earthwatch volunteers will join 720 research teams in the year 2000, about one-third of them returning volunteers.
UREP, the University of California Research Expeditions Program, partners university scientists with interested members of the public on research expeditions, which are tax-deductible and can also provide scholastic credit. As an example, a study of the grasshopper population of the African plain of Kenya scheduled for this summer costs $1,575 a person for a two-week land program.
The Oceanic Society offers expeditions to research sea birds and marine mammals including whales, dolphins and sea turtles worldwide, from the Amazon basin to Monterey Bay.
Researching and saving coral reefs is the mission of Cedam, or Conservation, Education, Diving, Awareness and Marine Research, which organizes expeditions to coral cays in the Caribbean and Pacific regions, with volunteer divers (and nondivers, should they wish to sign up) helping researchers document reef life.
The Sierra Club has a large listing of domestic and international trips, including "service trips" often geared to clearing or building trails in the wilderness; some of these are directed at teenage girls and their mothers, or to women or single hikers. Arguably more rugged but much cheaper are the American Hiking Society's volunteer opportunities, also clearing and building trails, in some of the most beautiful natural areas of the country. Most national and state parks welcome volunteers as campground hosts, who help educate and aid the public in exchange for free campsite and hookup.
Interested more in the planet's past than its future? A range of agencies fields archaeology volunteers. Passport in Time, a program of the United States Forest Service, welcomes people who want to help excavate and preserve historic and prehistoric sites on public land. One project is restoration of the OTO Ranch, one of Montana's original dude ranches, now part of the Gallatin National Forest. A biannual newsletter describes the programs.
Historical sites in the Caribbean are the focus of volunteers with Caribbean Volunteer Expeditions, who work with local museums, universities and national parks on the islands; Elderhostel also participates in some of these trips. The British National Trust is known for its whimsical rental properties, historic houses and manors. It also sends teams of volunteers to work on restoration and preservation; they pay a small fee for a week's lodging and food. Other programs can be found through the Archaeological Institute of America, which publishes a yearly bulletin of excavations needing help worldwide.
Mobility International USA aims to assist people with disabilities who want to teach, study, research, work or volunteer overseas. Its affiliate, the National Clearinghouse on Disability and Exchange, can help plan programs to fit a volunteer's interests and resources.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND GETAWAYS;
By Pedal and Paddle In Arkansas

BYLINE: By LUCY FERRISS; LUCY FERRISS, a novelist, teaches English at Hamilton College.

 BODY:
REMEMBER: your wheels will follow your eyes," Steve Shepherd tells me. I'm one of 10 early-morning Fossil Flats bicyclists heading up a 60-degree incline over shale and baseball-size lumps of limestone, and my wheels are following their own minds. They slide into the Arkansas mud, taking me with them. "Right," I say. I execute a downhill mount, train my eyes on the terrain five feet in front of me, and crank into first gear. I am being indulged, I know, but not pampered, and I am determined to make it across the hillside straightaway known as the Bench.
Devil's Den State Park in northwest Arkansas, where I took part in this spring's two-day, 11-ride recreational Mountain Bike Festival, has been an advocate for mountain biking since 1989, when it ran its first combined Festival and Race Weekend. "A study found that biking does no more harm to the environment than hiking, so we allowed it, and then we promoted it," said Tim Scott, assistant superintendent at Devil's Den. The high points of biking are now split into the festival, which draws hundreds of enthusiasts the first weekend in April, and the race, which brings serious competitors from all over the country to this 2,200-acre park in September. With its ready conveniences and miles of roughly cut paths in the rolling, wooded foothills of the Ozark Mountains, the park lends itself to the gadgetry-based wilderness explorations of the amateur bicyclist. 
 Descending the rough path toward a spring stream, I try Steve Shepherd's instructions. He is an expert, after all -- slim and yellow-goggled, a leader in the sport since he brought the first mountain bike to Little Rock more than 30 years ago. Sure enough, I spot a six-inch path between two large rocks followed by a small fallen branch and then a trickle of mud toward the stream. So long as I don't look down, I can pedal and steer my way between obstacles at the same time. My teeth chattering with the descent, I splash into the water, downshift and pedal furiously to make it up the clay embankment, which I almost do.
The trail we are on, Fossil Flats, has just been spruced up and lengthened by expert bikers, one of whom is in our group of 10. Slim, baby-faced and ponytailed, he asks us gently to let him know if there are any patches too difficult for novices. Pedaling across the Bench, overlooking the teal-green Lee Creek far below, I dig into red Arkansas mud and leap over sharp-edged mini-boulders. I slide off my bike only once (at which point my forgiving companions agree it was worth stopping, for the view) and assure the young expert that the stretch is perfect for beginners like me, with nerves of steel.
But the great advantage of mountain biking is that you can get off the bike. No one seems in a hurry; the point of wheeling rather than walking is not the speed but the challenge of navigating and the occasional thrill of a swift descent and a muddy, cool stream crossing.
We rest against hickory trees and regard Lee Creek far below while Steve's daughter Stephanie, a geology student at nearby University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, explains that its iridescent green is caused by free-floating minerals, especially limestone, that are awakened by the spring current and subside in summer. We stop near the end of the trail to watch the more daring of our crew take on the Pipe, a rust-colored bowl that the biker descends at top speed in order to make it up the other side and maybe pop a wheelie at the top. Returning to the campground from which we began, we hoist our space-age bicycles and balance across a rock bridge, and I miraculously do not tumble into the frigid creek.
Devil's Den, miles south of Fayetteville, is largely the product of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal agency that put unemployed single young men to work developing the nation's natural resources. The C.C.C. blazed many of the trails, built cabins, and even hewed the furniture for the homey restaurant next to Lee Lake. The origin of the park's name is obscure; some attribute it to early Christian suspicion of local Indians, others to illicit goings-on in the cave of the same name, which extends 535 feet into the mountain from a narrow aperture on Devil's Den Trail. Recovered from my bike ride, I thankfully took to my own feet on this path and on the longer Yellow Rock trail, which culminates in a high bluff stained with yellow iron oxide and looking across the valley cut by Lee Creek to the Ozark Plateau.
With fewer fellow trekkers on these foot trails -- and none of them in helmets or Spandex leggings -- I slowed my pace and stretched out on Yellow Rock to watch a dozen circling birds. I first mistook them for eagles but they turned out to be turkey vultures, their red heads tucked and their wings extended with an elegant flip at the end. Catching the warm drafts from the valley, they choreographed an air show, which one ranger told me was just play. "They'll head over to the highway for lunch," he said. "Here, they're just showing off."
Plenty of campsites are available at Devil's Den, both with hookups and primitive, but having arrived from a grueling conference in Kansas City, I elected to stay in one of the private C.C.C.-built cabins, furnished structures with fully equipped kitchens, fireplaces, original webbed-seat chairs, and patios for cookouts. Most of the comments in the cabin's guestbook came from members of church groups who retreat to this den of the devil and remark on the divine presence they find in a pileated woodpecker, a carpet of wildflowers or the myriad streams that lace the park.
To balance the workout of my legs, I took off next day for the Buffalo River to work my arms on a canoe trip. The drive from the university town of Fayetteville, home base for excursions in northwest Arkansas, took just over an hour through misty green hills to Ponca, home of the Buffalo Outdoor Center and its enthusiastic proprietor, Mike Mills.
From a start as Arkansas's director of tourism under Bill Clinton, Mike has taken over as one of the Buffalo National River's dozen or so concessionaires, who rent canoes, cabins, horses, gear and, in Mike's case, the occasional ride in the Miss Arkansas, a hot-air balloon that floats over the Ponca Wilderness Area or wherever else the wind blows it. Designated a national river in 1972, the Buffalo comprises 135 miles of seasonally floatable river and the surrounding protected wilderness. A group I met from Minnesota was taking the week to canoe the whole distance, from Ponca to Buffalo City, but for weekenders there are ample shorter options.
Mike and I put in at Steel Creek on the Upper Buffalo, on a Sunday predicted for rain that turned out balmy and sunny. "People phone me up a week ahead and want to know what the weather'll be," Mike said, "but whatever anyone says, they're bound to be wrong." The best months for floating the shallow Upper Buffalo -- May and June and November and December, when the water flows readily from the surrounding watershed -- are also the least predictable. But I happily stripped off my rain gear as we made it downstream past the towering limestone bluffs that the area is renowned for.
My canoeing skills, like my biking, are those of an able child. I know the draw stroke, the J, the C; I execute a passable rudder; I look for the upside-down V in negotiating a riffle. To my relief, the Buffalo presented a surmountable challenge. Stretches of rocky riffle were nicely spaced by smooth, clear flow with smallmouth bass racing the canoe downstream. Each time we rounded a bend away from a set of 500-foot bluffs on the right, another appeared on the left. Pebbled bars afforded stopping points for views and lunch. About midway to our destination, Kyles Landing, Mike suggested we stretch our legs and make our way inland to one of many hidden waterfalls.
As we pulled the canoe ashore, we heard a shout from the bluff. "Seen a white husky down there?" We hadn't. Elk, yes; turtles, coyote, deer, woodpeckers, but no dog. "Folks think their domestic pets like it out here," Mike said. "They do not. After a day they are frightened and hungry and possibly injured, and it's me who has to fish them out."
Aside from instructions to leash dogs, the Buffalo is relatively unregulated. Camping is first-come at official sites and permissible anywhere a half-mile from developed areas in the park. A hundred miles of hiking and horseback trails crisscross the park and are mostly "left natural and unmarked," according to the visitors' guide. From our canoe, we had a spectacular view of the great bluffs; from the bluffs, hikers had an unrestricted view of the river.
We reached the waterfall in about 20 minutes, passing Dutchman's-breeches, jack-in-the-pulpit, moss and phlox, as well as the elusive morel, a treat for savvy foragers here including armadillos, whose tracks we saw. Our land legs recovered, our spirits refreshed by a light beer, we pushed off again. "Making good time," Mike said, and then gave me my greatest compliment of the weekend: "Of course, you're an above-average paddler."
As at Devil's Den, cabins are available along the Buffalo -- primitive huts from the National Park Service and more elegant accommodations from concessionaires like Buffalo Outdoor Center, which rents, among other offerings, the Presidents' Cabin, a lofty retreat with a Jacuzzi, a stunning view and framed photos of Presidents Johnson, Kennedy and Clinton, not to mention letters from Bill Clinton and clippings from his early run to the governorship.
Now food, as we all know, tastes best in the outdoors. Campers may enjoy fresh bass and griddlecakes; cabin dwellers have charcoal grills as well as kitchens. But for soft city folk like me, the second or third night of the outdoors weekend deserves a shower, a wrinkle-free dress and a glass of cabernet that I don't pour myself. For that restorative, I followed the advice of Ann Osborne and Jerry Edwards, gynecologists from Little Rock who were staying with their family near the river at the Azalea Falls Lodge.
Azalea Falls is the brainchild of Alf Carter, an Ozark guide and rock-climbing instructor, and his wife, Kathy Trimble, who decorated the three-bedroom, three-bath, Frank Lloyd Wright-style getaway with antiques and artwork. I found Jerry on the deck overlooking the "hollow" below the secluded house, tapping out bird calls on his laptop. "And there he comes," said Ann, pointing as we heard an answering call. "Male finch in full plumage." Ann and Jerry were dining in -- Azalea will stock your kitchen prior to arrival -- but recommended Chez Charles in nearby Eureka Springs for my "civilized" evening.
Eureka Springs, according to a West Coast friend who's settled into Fayetteville, is "our Carmel" -- an overpriced, overbusy cluster of Victoriana on Beaver Lake, just north of the Buffalo. But the owner, Charles Clark, serves such fare as escargot in pastry and smoked quail, followed by desserts that win awards as much for their delicate architecture as their sinful taste.
Glutted, then, with the Azalea's art and the river's rapids, with chocolate cream and caves, with the flash of sunlight on water and the splash of mud on bare legs, I made my way into the red Arkansas sunset out on State Highway 62, stopping here and there for views of river gorges and the Ozark Plateau. I let my wheels follow my eyes this time, too, but already I missed the trails and the rocks, the water and bluffs, even the circling vultures.

HEADLINE: A Haider In Their Future

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen; Roger Cohen is the Berlin bureau chief for The New York Times.

 BODY:
The best-known Austrian since Freud and Hitler has an evident interest in gear. His tight cords, polo shirt and jacket come in soigne shades of gray, conveying an image at once businesslike and casual. Jorg Haider is an image merchant; he is also Europe's most successful politician of the past decade. Briskly, he emerges from the lights beamed on him for a television interview, bids farewell to each and every member of the TV crew and takes messages from a bevy of acolytes before bringing the unstinting gleam of his gray-blue eyes to bear on his next visitor: "Yes, Mr. Cohen, please come in, and do forgive this stupid, noisy scene."
Life is hectic, celebrity sometimes burdensome -- or so Haider intimates -- but he remembers names. Politics is also that: getting to know everyone, pushing their buttons. With a sprinkling of revisionist remarks praising the Waffen SS and Nazi labor policy, zealous physical fitness, an American-style political machine, a trash-the-politically-correct style of straight talk and a reworking of Robin Hood in mildly xenophobic guise, Haider has contrived to propel Austria's far-right Freedom Party from political irrelevance to power in less than a generation. Europe, land of ghosts, is aghast. 
 On one level, the Haider story is an Austrian story -- that is to say, a story of the little lies and large frustrations of a small country that was once a big empire. Such a yarn would be titillating, a divertissement light as a Strauss waltz, but a sideshow. Yet on a deeper level, Haider speaks of the European zeitgeist, for it is on this that he has conjured part of his success.
He has emerged in a Europe uncertain what place, if any, nations and national identity should command as the attempt to build a federal United States of Europe is pursued. A continent worried by immigration and the idea that calls to Islamic prayer will drown out church bells. An uneasy polity that is growing increasingly Americanized and has swapped the Communist threat for fears of globalization.
In this context, Haider is more than a provincial curiosity from a country still dyspeptic over its exit from history; he is a possible taste of the future. That future has an easy smile and a tight waist; it is telegenic or it is nothing at all. Haider, 50, knows the glib, politics-as-pop-culture temper of his times. His governor's office in Klagenfurt, the stiflingly picturesque capital of the southern Austrian province of Carinthia, is testament to the 360-degree Haiderian political wink.
It contains some figurative art, some abstract art, a photograph of the American football club he founded called the Carinthian Cowboys and a discreet print of a proud German knight on horseback. Tradition, modernism, Americana, pan-Germanism -- nothing has been forgotten. "Wherever you have a notional concentration of votes, he goes for it," says Friedhelm Frischenschlager, a former Freedom Party member.
And why not? With the reconfigured, Blairian European left straddling the center, the moderate right unsure what terrain to occupy and the angst of losers from Internet-driven modernization seeking scapegoats and political expression, the times are propitious for a politician who mocks and twists the old labels.
"What is a populist?" Haider asks with a bloodless smile that creases skin of a leathery hue, aging his boyish face abruptly. "Everybody who is a good democrat is a populist. If you keep an eye on the people, consider their problems, then I'm a populist. That is my opponents' problem. They don't take care of their voters. People always ask if I am to the left or right of my opponents. I am ahead of them."
Certainly, Austrian voters think so. They have been migrating en masse to the Freedom Party since 1986, when Haider took over a tired movement featuring a motley crew of ex-Nazis and free-market reformists. The party then had 4.98 percent of the vote. It now has 27 percent. Although other rightist parties in Europe have also made substantial headway of late, no other has made such a decisive breakthrough. So decisive that the cordon sanitaire that -- with a brief exception in Italy in the mid-1990's -- has kept far-right parties from European political office since the Second World War broke earlier this year with a loud snap.
The reverberations linger. Consider the scenario. The people of little Austria -- factory workers, secretaries, hoteliers, burghers in their lodens -- vote for Haider in large numbers. His party comes in second and in February joins a coalition government with the conservative People's Party. Democracy at work, bringing change after decades of Social-Democratic-led rule. And what happens? Some bureaucrat in Brussels or Berlin or Paris decides this is not kosher.
Austria is informed that all bilateral contacts between its government and the 14 others in the European Union have been frozen and is warned that there can be "no business as usual" with such a coalition. Yet Austria has broken no law, infringed no treaty, curtailed no liberties. Imagine an American president sanctioning Texas over the results of a state election. And the United States, unlike the European Union, is a federation in fact.
"This cannot be accepted by Austrian democrats," says Haider, who uses the word "democrats" a lot. "We take decisions. We vote as we want. Not the way foreign countries tell us. We do not accept pressure from outside. In Austria, we had socialist-led governments for 30 years, and these socialists have mobilized their friends around the world to attack us because we took their votes. But this is a dangerous course Europe has taken. There is a huge reaction. I get 15,000 e-mails a week of support to my Web site."
Haider, online and off, has clearly become a lightning rod for Europe's disenchanted. He likes to compare himself to a wolf; certainly he inspires fear, some of it irrational. He has a six-letter name beginning with "H" and ending with "er"; he hails, like Hitler, from northern Austria; and his apologies for his past Nazi apologias have seemed more dutiful than heartfelt. Europe has not forgotten that its mid-20th-century descent into ruin gathered pace with its acquiescence to Hitler's absorption of Austria into the Reich in 1938, a nonreaction that gave the Fhrer a green light to pursue more "Lebensraum." So there is no doubt something subliminal, compensatory, in the unusually swift European reaction to Haider, a pursuit of retroactive redemption by getting ahead of the game this time.
Yet there is no solid evidence that Haider is an anti-Semite, and Austrian threats to European peace and stability today do not exist. What does exist is a pivotal battle for Europe's identity -- between federalists and nationalists, between globalist dot-commies and territorialist fly-the-flaggers, between multiculturalists and defenders of what Germans still call the "Volk."
Freedom Party posters in Vienna last year attacking "berfremdung" -- a word dear to Goebbels that roughly means "overforeignization" -- struck enough of a chord to win the party more than one-quarter of the city's votes in the national election in October. The theme was the same as that of an earlier poster proclaiming "Vienna must not become Chicago," a city used here as a preposterous shorthand for a den of mixed-race gangsterism.
The "foreigners" being attacked lie without and within. The fall of the Iron Curtain has opened the gates for more than one million immigrants, many from central and southeastern Europe, to enter the European Union every year. At the same time, the end of the cold war has revived old dreams of a United States of Europe as cohesive as the United States. The question of the long-term survival of the European nation-state has thereby been posed. This is the new landscape of perceived external and internal threats to national identity that has helped breed Haiderism.
"The cold war ended in Germany in 1989, but in Austria it is happening in 2000," says Robert Menasse, an Austrian writer. "We were a predemocracy, a state without opposition, nestled by the Iron Curtain, where only stability counted. And when a system implodes, you can't choose the form the implosion will take. This is a crisis of transformation. Everyone wants a simple picture here. But Austria is not a videoclip. Nor is Europe. They are murky. And Haider learned that with his mother's milk."
Haider's mother, Dorothea, was an enthusiastic Nazi, a member of the League of German Maidens. So, too, was his father, Robert, a shoemaker who joined the Nazi Party years before the Anschluss. In this they were by no means unusual. But postwar politics dictated another version of history.
Austrians, it is said, have convinced themselves that Hitler was a German and Beethoven an Austrian. That is the least of the national delusions. The myth to which the postwar Second Republic hitched itself was initially foisted on the Austrians by the Allies. As early as 1943, in the so-called Moscow Declaration, they described Austria as the "first victim of Nazi aggression" -- a half-truth at best.
The purpose, during and after the war, was to place Austria in the Western camp. But more than one million Austrians -among them Haider's father -- fought for Hitler; enthusiasm for "Dolfi" (an affectionate diminutive for Adolf) was widespread; and Eichmann, another Austrian, spent what he called the happiest year of his life in Vienna taking care of the logistics of expelling, and fleecing, Jews.
In this way, a double life took hold in the land where Freud discovered the secrets of dreams. Many of the "first victims" knew that they were in fact perpetrators. But that truth was a private one, alien to public discourse, where the miraculous myth of Austrian victimhood prevailed.
"We convinced ourselves we'd won freedom by being the first victims," says Oscar Bronner, the publisher of Der Standard, a Vienna daily. "But we loved the German occupation. In fact, the real occupation here is widely seen as having ended in 1955, when the Allies left!"
Many prominent Nazis recycled themselves as prominent postwar Austrian politicians. Among them was Friedrich Peter, a member of the Waffen SS, who went on to lead the Freedom Party. Bruno Kreisky, a Jewish survivor and the longtime Social Democratic chancellor, aware of the silences and evasions on which his support depended, included several former Nazis in his cabinets of the 1970's. As for Kurt Waldheim, the former president and United Nations secretary general, he was the Austrian everyman: a soldier who had labored in Hitler's army only to suffer amnesia about that period of his life. Hence his domestic popularity through thick and thin.
Unlike Germany, driven to confrontation with its past, Austria tended to bury itself in a folkloric provincialism. All the creamy Hapsburg palaces, so out of proportion to the modern state's modest role, abetted the flight from reality. So did a postwar economic boom that suggested all was well in a never-never land of waltzes and Sacher tortes. Meanwhile, the Social Democrats and the People's Party brought political stability in the form of a stranglehold on office, handing out jobs and apartments under a so-called Proporz system that made party membership a key to advancement.
Marcus Marageter, a 30-year-old musician, recalls a teacher telling his class at engineering school that a "little bit of anti-Semitism is de rigueur." Snide references to money-grubbing Jews remained socially acceptable in many circles. The phrase "Wir brauchen einen kleinen Hitler" -- We need a little Hitler"- never went entirely out of fashion in Austria. "Naja" ("No-yes" or "Well-yes"), a frequent verbal reflex, caught all the Austrian psyche's curious ambiguities.
Nobody understood these equivocations, evasions and elisions better than Haider. Born in 1950, reared in the small northern Austrian town of Bad Goisern, not far from Hitler's beloved Linz, he digested all the resentments and secrets of the war generation. After 1945, his father was forced to work as a gravedigger and his mother was banned from teaching because of the couple's former Nazi sympathies. At the same time, more prominent ex-Nazis found ways to thrive.
No wonder, then, that Haider favors the little man and barks at privilege. A gifted debater from an early age, a talented actor at school, handsome, quick, he clearly intuited that his parents' story was common enough to carry important political lessons. "My parents," he says, "are decent persons. After the war, they learned from history and contributed to the re-establishment of Austrian democracy."
The truth is rather more complex. "Haider is from a Nazi family, and he is proud that his parents were Austrian Nazis," says Lothar Hobelt, a historian who knows Haider well and is sympathetic to him. "He accepts that Austria was in it as much as the Germans because, let's face it, we are Germans. But if you follow the guidelines set by the state, if that is the law of the land and you have to obey, can you be said to be evil?"
Certainly Haider has never been ready to regard his parents, now in their 80's, or the myriad Austrians who behaved similarly as evil. As he said in 1996, "I have always fought against dismissing the war generation as a whole as criminals." At the same time, he has, more than once, called the Third Reich the most heinous of criminal regimes.
This back-and-forth evidently creates some psychological strain. If Haider castigates Hitler, he also calls Churchill "one of the greatest criminals" of the 20th century for his decision to firebomb Dresden. For to be absolutely unequivocal in his condemnation of Nazism is to engage in an act of basic filial disloyalty.
Haider's instinct was always to be loyal. By the age of 16, he was active in the youth movement of the Freedom Party, then led by the ex-SS man Peter. After military service and law studies in Vienna, he landed in 1976 as an assistant professor in a Carinthia law school where his mother had some relatives and where, more important, the political climate offered intriguing possibilities.
Lying just to the north of the former Yugoslavia, Carinthia marked the border of the German-speaking and Slavic worlds and was heavily steeped in Germanic national sentiment. It was provincial enough to suit Haider's anti-urban, anti-intellectual message. With its pine-clad slopes, little family-run factories and soaring peaks to lift the soul, it offered picture-postcard images of the good, clean, physically active life.
At the time of Haider's arrival, the Social Democratic governor of Carinthia was Leopold Wagner, a man who liked to boast of his former senior position in the Hitler Youth and inveigh against the Slovene minority in the province. Haider proceeded to outflank him. He satisfied nationalist sentiment in stirring speeches while presenting a new face of youth and economic renewal. By 1989, he was governor.
"Carinthia was a propitious climate for Haider," says Rudolf Vouk, a lawyer and leader of the 15,000-strong Slovene community. "You see, Slovenes have always been seen here as wanting to prize Carinthia from Austria and attach it to Slovenia. To the Nazis, we were ersatz Jews. And after the war, Slovenia was part of Communist Yugoslavia. So ex-Nazis here could see themselves again standing up to Communists."
Haider understood in his bones the political value of a nod in the direction of these old sentiments. His problem was fine-tuning the nod. In June 1991, he went over the top. Always an opponent of what he calls "the collectivist welfare state," he allowed himself to be provoked in the provincial assembly into declaring, "They had a sound employment policy in the Third Reich." A motion of "no confidence" obliged him to quit.
But as with Dr. Strangelove, that arm kept popping up -- whether through emotional instinct, political calculation or, most likely, some combination of the two. Addressing war veterans in 1995, including members of the Waffen SS, Haider said they had "risked" their lives so that "the younger generation should have a future in which order, justice and decency are still principles."
On the same occasion, he called the former soldiers in Hitler's ranks "decent men who have character," and he thundered: "Anyone who today says that the members of the war generation, the Wehrmacht, were all criminals are in the end besmirching their own parents, their own family and their fathers! And a people who does not hold its forefathers in honor is condemned to doom."
In Germany, these words alone would have doomed Haider. But Austria has largely evaded what Germany has confronted, so Haider bounced back. And where does he really stand? The chameleonic charmer of Austria eyes me coolly and says: "I have made clear in statements that I know I was wrong when I said these things and I apologized. We have many young supporters and must establish a strong democratic system that makes impossible a repeat of such a dark period."
But then something stirs in him, the old Austrian "Naja." "Of course the remarks, for instance on Nazi employment policy, were taken out of context," he says. "If you read the whole debate, there is nothing, really nothing, that could be attacked. But my opponents took this one sentence and made a campaign out of it. And this was my mistake. I have to know that this was dangerous."
Evidently, Haider is learning. Whether he is changing is another matter.
Mario Urschitz, 18, sports a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, a fila shirt and low-slung jeans and sneakers. He has recently returned from a year at a high school in Florida, an experience he loved. Like all Klagenfurt kids, he spends a lot of time on his cell phone, talking and sending messages. And like many of them, employing a German assemblage of English words, he calls himself a "Haiderfan." Haiderfans sometimes hang out at Jorg's Treff -Jorg's Meeting Place" -- a Freedom Party joint where they can play video games, surf the Net and have questions answered by party officials.
If Haider understands the "Kriegsgeneration" -- war generation -- he has an even better feel for the young, whose world is not one of ideology but image. "Haider looks so good, he makes you a fan," says Nina Kulterer, 17. "I saw him selling lottery tickets, and he was very friendly. He's always at events for young people, and he remembers you."
The Freedom Party has more support than any other political movement among Austrians under 30, taking more than 35 percent of their votes at the last poll. Haider's designer labels, mountain-climbing, bungee-jumping, chin-jutting, Porsche-driving rock-star air and provincial-Hollywood glitz are all tailor-made for what Anton Pelinka, a political analyst, calls "the sound-bite MTV voter with an attention span of three minutes -- and there are quite a few of them in Europe today."
Haider's sound-bite skills were sharpened during extended sojourns in the United States during the 1990's, in California and later at Harvard, where he took seminars on privatization, tax reform and public budgeting. "A beautiful time, the best time of my life," Haider calls it in his good, American-accented English. "A country where people can use their freedom."
There is no question that the American experience had a profound effect on him, producing some oddball ideas like a flat tax that he continues to push. But also, at a deeper level, it led to the bizarre Euro-American cultural amalgam central to his broad appeal: a sort of rugged Marlboro Country hero, conversant with e-commerce even on his stallion, pushing the creation of a high-tech "Silicon Alps" in Carinthia, yet ready to crack the whip in the good old Teutonic style of his forbears.
It makes little sense, of course, if sense is defined as coherence. But perhaps that is part of the point: it is a world without a dialectic now that capitalism has won. Haider is aware of the unbearable lightness of modern political being. Call him the first post-politician. Post-Nazi. Post-conservative. Post-socialist. Post-xenophobic. Post-just-about-everything.
He is not a Nazi, but he plays on Nazi themes. He is not a conservative, but he wants to deregulate and slash taxes. He is not a socialist, but he wants to hand out fat maternity checks and oblige party members to limit their monthly income to $4,000, giving anything over that, Robin-Hood style, to the less well off. He is not in favor of privilege, but he lives off the income from a vast Carinthian estate called Valley of the Bears, inherited from a great-uncle whose family picked it up for a song from Jews fleeing the Nazis. He is not, he insists, a xenophobe, but is ready to use bigotry to deliver votes.
"On the one hand, I'm a kind of Margaret Thatcher, because I want lean government," Haider says. "But then again, I am a new Social Democrat because I defend programs for young mothers. I'm also for law and order, which is a program of the right. And immigration is a general problem, not right, not left." Blah-blah, blah-blah.
"Haider's is a post-ideology that eliminates rational discussion," says Andre Glucksmann, a French writer and philosopher. "He is this, he is that, and in the end he is nothing, so what is left is the image onto which people project. Haider knows that if he were merely peddling the old ideology of his father, he would be a marginal figure."
Glucksmann sees a sort of Putin-Haider contemporary school of politics. The new Russian president says Russia might join NATO. The next day he says NATO stinks. Haider apologizes for revisionist remarks only to turn around and say he can't abide the German mania for apologizing. He laments the fate of the Jews in the Holocaust, then says the Sudeten Germans driven from Czechoslovakia in 1945 also deserve money. The message: I may not have a program, but see me move; I look good and understand you all.
The technique seems to be winning Haider astonishingly broad support. Mario Urschitz's great-uncle, Julius Urschitz, is 84 and has known Haider for more than 20 years, supporting him because "he goes to the little people and gives to them." Julius, who supplements his pension by working part time doing menial cleaning jobs, is a veteran of the Nazi forces who fought on the Russian front. "Look," he says, "we had no choice. Tall people, like my brother, were drafted into the Waffen SS. Shorter ones, like me, into the Wehrmacht. The alternative was to be shot."
And how was the war? Well, not so bad. "It was only after everything was over that we heard about Auschwitz. I was in Warsaw in 1943. I saw some Jews being taken away, but I had no idea where. Maybe to work camps. You know, the Jews should have waited until the Russians came, but they were shooting at the Germans."
There they stand -- the Florida-loving youth in his gear, the war veteran who knew nothing of the fate awaiting the deported Jews of Warsaw, Haiderfans all. It is quite a coalition of forces that Haider has assembled, one new to postwar Europe. As I rise to leave, Julius Urschitz eyes me up and down. "You would have been in the Waffen SS," he says with a warm smile. "You're tall enough."
European integration was first pursued in the 1950's as a way of forestalling the 20th-century wars that had scarred the continent so badly. Stage 1, the merging of the French and German coal and steel industries in 1951, was designed to ensure that the two countries would never fight again. A united Europe was a political and moral endeavor as well as an economic one. Then there were the details: freeing markets, opening borders, harmonizing legislation, setting wheat prices, creating a customs union, introducing a common currency. At Europe's stop-and-go pace, they took a half-century.
So it was only recently, with "economic Europe" in place, that European leaders began to look in earnest at the other aspects of the project. Hence the sudden push to develop a credible European military force (within NATO), coordinate foreign policy, move toward decision-making by majority vote, balance what the French now call "American hegemony." Hence, too, the addition last year of a clause to the European Treaties saying any member-state found guilty of a "serious and persistent breach" of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms could be punished.
Enter Haider to spoil the party of this new "moral Europe" that had fought a war for human rights in Kosovo. Beaming, provocative, in a curious embrace with Wolfgang Schssel, the bow-tied People's Party leader and now Austrian chancellor. The coalition of their parties was, of course, no "serious and persistent breach" of anything. Haider has never passed from word to deed. But the symbolism could scarcely have been more ill timed for a union bent on expanding to include the ex-Communist states of central Europe, where rightist movements are often virulent.
For bigotry has been an intermittent trademark of Haider's party. In its literature, the party has warned of "black African asylum seekers with designer suits and mobile phones" who "deal in drugs undisturbed." It has also said that "a return to the nation" must be a founding principle of the "Third Republic" (eerily named) that it proposes. "Anti-immigration posters were produced because we are building ghettos that are not accepted here," says Thomas Prinzhorn, a Freedom Party member and close associate of Haider. "So we say stop, or severely limit, immigration until we can integrate the foreigners we have. Let's take a breath. Our phone book in Vienna looks like New York's!"
With 14 percent of Austria's population of eight million now made up of foreigners, many of them recent arrivals from the Balkans, this sort of message has played well. It has provided the third peg of Haider's support, besides the veteran nationalists and the MTV crowd: blue-collar workers afraid their jobs might go to foreigners and those generally seeking a scapegoat for the threats, real or imagined, of globalization. In the last election, 47 percent of young, male, blue-collar workers voted for Haider.
The resentments behind this vote pattern are by no means confined to Austria. Christoph Blocher's Swiss People's Party became the country's largest political force last year, taking 23 percent of the vote with a campaign equating immigration with criminality. In Belgium, a slogan of "Our People First" propelled the Vlaams Blok to 29.6 percent of the vote in the country's second city, Antwerp, last year. In Denmark, the Danish People's Party of Pia Kjaersgaard recently gained new prominence with a welfare-mocking poster saying, "When I become a Muslim, I'll have a home." And in France, Germany and Italy, issues of immigration and national identity have moved to the center of political debate.
"Europe has a past that tells us we have to draw a line," says Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and a chief architect of the European sanctions against Austria. "We cannot accept the legitimization of the far right. Haider is not just about Austria." But whatever the justifications offered for Europe's move to punish Austria, the sanctions unquestionably represent a quantum leap in the union's intrusion in the affairs of a member state.
George A. Bermann, a professor of law at Columbia, questions on what basis European states can "collectively punish a sister state, given the language in the E.U. treaty on human rights and the fact that any violations on Austria's part are purely anticipated." Taking the opposing tack, Andrei S. Markovits of the University of Michigan compares the situation to the United States in the early 1960's, when "the federal government took it upon itself to force its morality on racist Southern states. Then Alabama and Mississippi also railed -- like Austria today -- against outsiders' intervention into states' rights. Only under pressure from outside did George Wallace mutate from a rabid racist into an acceptable politician."
Haider as Wallace? A European country comparable to a state in the United States? Such references offend Haider. A disgruntled-little-boy look can cloud the chiseled features of Europe's most talked-about politician, and it hovers there as he insists that his party's immigration policy is "moderate," designed to ensure only that foreigners already in Austria have adequate housing and schooling and to head off a flood. As for European integration, Haider says he is for the Europe proposed by de Gaulle, "a Europe of fatherlands, not a federalistic structure with a huge bureaucracy in Brussels."
Those almost imploring Haider eyes and the level tone of voice combine to bleat, Believe me, I am a reasonable, much maligned man. "He wants to be loved by everyone," says Klaus Lukas, a former Freedom Party member who left when the party's antiforeigner tone became more strident. "It's almost childish. The only person I've seen who always gets her way with him is his wife, Claudia, who runs the business at the estate. Others say, Jorg, this is wrong, and he does not like it. He wants to be the best speaker. The fastest runner."
Haider, who has followers rather than partners or colleagues, makes no secret of where he would like his run to end. "Yes, I would like to be chancellor," he says. For the moment, he has taken a back seat, resigning the leadership of the party, but the ultimate aim remains clear enough.
Of course, now that it is in government, the Freedom Party will no longer be able to grow by railing. It will have to deliver. Businessmen, who constitute the fourth and last bastion of Haiderism, are waiting for the free-market revolution he has promised, even as Austria's powerful unions gird to resist it. "We want to break the rules blocking entrepreneurial spirit," says Karl-Heinz Grasser, the 31-year-old Freedom Party finance minister. "Cut taxes. Privatize. Free people. That is what we are about, not this Hitler talk."
Down the road from the Klagenfurt office of Haider-the-democrat is a small restaurant, owned by Sukhwinder Singh Mehal, an Indian who has lived in Austria for 19 years. The other day he was in a favorite pizzeria with friends when two young men at the bar started shouting: "You pig foreigner, you'll be out of here soon now that Haider's in power. Pig foreigners out."
Mehal ignored the taunts, but as he walked out, one of the men kicked him. A brawl ensued that left Mehal severely bruised. When police came to investigate, they found that the two young men were off-duty policemen. Outraged, Mehal sent a letter of complaint to Haider. The reply from the governor's office was prompt: such behavior was outrageous, would be investigated and could not possibly be the work of anyone identifying with the Freedom Party.
Haider is conscientious. He is concerned. He is a democrat, a freedom lover, a man with the flag of California adorning his Vienna office. He would never hurt anyone; he knows images are merely playful and magnetic things. But, as Mehal's fate shows, sometimes in the real world people have gotten hurt by real racists who somehow got the wrong idea about where the gregarious governor of Carinthia stands.

HEADLINE: The Eroded Self

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Rosen; Jeffrey Rosen is an associate professor at the George Washington University Law School and the legal affairs editor of The New Republic. This article is adapted from his book, "The Unwanted Gaze: The Destruction of Privacy in America." to be published next month by Random House.

 BODY:
Monica Lewinsky is a most unlikely spokesperson for the virtues of reticence. But in addition to selling designer handbags, she has emerged after her internship as an advocate of privacy in cyberspace. "People need to realize that your e-mails can be read and made public, and that you need to be cautious," she warned recently on "Larry King Live." Lewinsky was unsettled by Kenneth Starr's decision to subpoena Washington bookstores for receipts of her purchases; in her underappreciated biography, "Monica's Story," she points to the bookstore subpoenas as one of the most invasive moments in the Starr investigation. But she was also distraught when the prosecutors subpoenaed her home computer. From the recesses of her hard drive, they retrieved e-mail messages that she had tried unsuccessfully to delete, along with the love letters she had drafted -- but never sent -- to the president. "It was such a violation," Lewinsky complained to her biographer, Andrew Morton.
 Many Americans are beginning to understand just how she felt. As reading and writing, health care and shopping and sex and gossip increasingly take place in cyberspace, it is suddenly dawning on us that the most intimate details of our daily lives are being monitored, searched, recorded and stored as meticulously as Monica Lewinsky's were. For most citizens, however, the greatest threat to privacy comes not from special prosecutors but from employers and from all-seeing Web sites and advertising networks that track every move we make in cyberspace. 
 Consider the case of DoubleClick Inc. For the past few years, DoubleClick, the Internet's largest advertising company, has been compiling detailed information on the browsing habits of millions of Web users by placing "cookie" files on our hard drives. Cookies are electronic footprints that allow Web sites and advertising networks to monitor our online movements with telescopic precision -- including the search terms we enter as well as the articles we skim and how long we spend skimming them. Once DoubleClick sends you a cookie, you will receive targeted ads when you visit the Web sites of its 2,500 clients. So, for example, if you visit Alta Vista's auto section you may be greeted by a cheerful ad from G.M. or Ford.
As long as users were confident that their virtual identities weren't being linked to their actual identities, many were happy to accept DoubleClick cookies in exchange for the convenience of navigating the Web more efficiently. Then last November, DoubleClick bought Abacus Direct, a database of names, addresses and information about off-line buying habits of 90 million households, compiled from the largest direct mail catalogs and retailers in the nation. In January, DoubleClick began compiling profiles linking individuals' actual names and addresses to Abacus's detailed records of their online and off-line purchases. Suddenly, shopping that once seemed anonymous was being archived in personally identifiable dossiers.
Under pressure from privacy advocates and from dot-com investors, DoubleClick announced in March that it would postpone its profiling scheme until the federal government and the e-commerce industry agree on privacy standards. Still, the DoubleClick controversy points to the inherent threat to privacy in a new economy that is based, in unprecedented ways, on the recording and exchange of intimate personal information. Privacy protects us from being misdefined and judged out of context. This protection is especially important in a world of short attention spans, a world in which information can easily be confused with knowledge. When intimate personal information circulates among a small group of people who know you well, its significance can be weighed against other aspects of your personality and character. (Monica Lewinsky didn't mind that her friends knew she had given the president a copy of Nicholson Baker's "Vox" because her friends knew that she was much more than a person who would read a book about phone sex.) But when your browsing habits -- or e-mail messages -- are exposed to strangers, you may be reduced, in their eyes, to nothing more than the most salacious book you once read or the most vulgar joke you once told. And even if your Internet browsing isn't in any way embarrassing, you run the risk of being stereotyped as the kind of person who would read a particular book or listen to a particular song. Your public identity may be distorted by fragments of information that have little to do with how you define yourself. In a world where citizens are bombarded with information, people form impressions quickly, based on sound bites, and these brief impressions tend to oversimplify and misrepresent our complicated and often contradictory characters.
The sociologist Georg Simmel observed nearly 100 years ago that people are often more comfortable confiding in strangers than in friends, colleagues or neighbors. Confessions to strangers are cost-free because strangers move on; you never expect to see them again, so you are not inhibited by embarrassment or shame. In many ways the Internet is a technological manifestation of the phenomenon of the stranger. There's no reason to fear the disclosure of intimate information to faceless Web sites as long as those Web sites have no motive or ability to collate the data into a personally identifiable profile that could be disclosed to anyone you actually know. By contrast, the prospect that your real identity might be linked to permanent databases of your online -- and off-line -- behavior is chilling, because the databases could be bought, subpoenaed or traded by employers, insurance companies, ex-spouses and others who have the ability to affect your life in profound ways.
The retreat of DoubleClick may seem like a victory for privacy, but it is only an early battle in a much larger war -- one in which many expect privacy to be vanquished. "You already have zero privacy -- get over it," Scott McNealy, the C.E.O. of Sun Microsystems, memorably remarked last year in response to a question at a product show introducing a new interactive technology called Jini. Sun's cheerful Web site promises to usher in the "networked home" of the future, in which the company's "gateway" software will operate "like a congenial party host inside the home to help consumer appliances communicate intelligently with each other and with outside networks." In this chatty new world of electronic networking, your refrigerator and coffee maker can talk to your television, and all can be monitored from your office computer. The incessant information exchanged by these gossiping appliances might, of course, generate detailed records of the most intimate details of your daily life. Your liquor cabinet might tell Pinkdot.com, the online grocer, that you are low on whiskey, prompting your television to start blaring ads for alcoholics anonymous. But this may not be what Sun Microsystems has in mind when it boasts about the pleasures of the "connected family."
New evidence seems to emerge every day to support McNealy's grim verdict about the triumph of online surveillance technology over privacy. A former colleague of mine who runs a Web site for political junkies recently sent me the "data trail" statistics that he receives each week. They disclose not only the Internet addresses of individual browsers who visit his site, clearly identifying their universities or corporate employers, but also the Web sites each user visited previously and the articles he or she downloaded there. And it's increasingly common to find programs in the workplace that report back to a central server all the Internet addresses that employees visit. After the respected dean of the Harvard Divinity School was forced to step down in 1998 for downloading pornography on his home computer, a former Harvard computer technician wrote an article for Salon, the online magazine, criticizing his former colleagues for snitching on the dean. "In the server room of one of my part-time jobs," the techie confessed, "I noticed that a program called Gatekeeper displayed all the Internet usage in the office as it happened. I sat and watched people send e-mail, buy and sell stocks on e-trade and download pictures of Celine Dion. If I had wanted I could have traced this usage back to the individual user."
A survey of nearly a thousand large companies conducted last year by the American Management Association found that 45 percent monitored the e-mail, computer files or phone calls of their workers, up from 35 percent two years earlier. Some companies use Orwellian computer software with names like Spector, Assentor or Investigator, available for as little as $99, that can monitor and record every keystroke on the computer with videolike precision. These virtual snoops can also be programmed to screen all incoming and outgoing e-mail for forbidden words and phrases -- involving racism, body parts or the name of your boss -- and can forward suspicious messages to a supervisor for review. E-mail can be resurrected from computer hard drives even after it has ostensibly been deleted. And companies are increasingly monitoring jokes and e-mail sent from home as well as work over company servers.
The most common justification for Internet and e-mail monitoring in the workplace is fear of liability under sexual harassment law, which requires companies to protect workers from speech that might be construed to create a "hostile or offensive working environment." Because employers cannot be sure in advance what sort of e-mail or Web browsing a particular employee might find offensive, they have an incentive to monitor far more Internet activity than the law actually forbids.
Changes in the delivery of books, music and television are extending these technologies of surveillance beyond the office, blurring the boundaries between work and home. Last summer, for example, Amazon.com was criticized for a feature that uses ZIP codes and domain names to identify the most popular books purchased online by employees at prominent corporations. (The top choice at Charles Schwab: "Memoirs of a Geisha.") And anonymous browsing continues to be under assault. The Sprint wireless Web phone that I bought in March promptly revealed my new telephone number to Amazon's pre-programmed Web site when I dialed in the hope of browsing discreetly for ordering information about my new book.
The same technologies that are making it possible to download digitally stored books, CD's and movies directly onto our hard drives will soon make it possible for publishers and entertainment companies to record and monitor our browsing habits with unsettling specificity. "Snitchware" programs can regulate not only which books you read but also how many times you read them, charging different royalties based on whether you copy from the book or forward part of it to a friend. Television, too, is being redesigned to create precise records of our viewing habits. A new electronic device known as a personal video recorder makes it possible to store up to 30 hours of television programs; it also enables viewers to skip commercials and to create their own lineups. One of the current models, TiVo, establishes viewer profiles that it then uses to make viewing suggestions and to record future shows. And in a world where media conglomerates like AOL-Time Warner can monitor your activities in cyberspace and then use your browsing habits to determine the content that is beamed to you through television, books, movies and magazines, the integrated media box of the future may have surveillance capabilities that make DoubleClick's database look benign.
As if that weren't bad enough, Globally Unique Identifiers, or GUID's, are making it possible to link every document you create, message you e-mail and chat you post with your real-world identity. GUID's are a kind of serial number that can be linked with your name and e-mail address when you register online for a product or service. Last November, RealJukebox, one of the most popular Internet music players, with 30 million registered users, became a focus of media attention when privacy advocates noted that the player could relay information to its parent company, RealNetworks, about the music each user downloaded, and that this could be matched with a unique ID number that pinpointed the user's identity. At a conference about privacy in cyberspace held at the Stanford Law School in February, a lawyer for RealNetwork, Bob Kimball, insisted that the company had never, in fact, matched the GUID's with the data about music preferences. Nevertheless, hours after the media outcry began, RealNetworks disabled the GUID's to avoid a DoubleClick-like public relations debacle. But some currently available software products, like Microsoft's Word 97 and Powerpoint 97, embed unique identifiers into every document. Soon, all electronic documents created electronically may have invisible markings that could be traced back to the author or recipient.
There is nothing new about the fear that new technologies of surveillance and communication are altering the nature of privacy. A hundred years ago, in the most famous essay on privacy ever written, Louis D. Brandeis and Samuel Warren worried that new media technologies -- in particular the invention of instant photographs and the tabloid press -- were invading "the sacred precincts of private and domestic life." What outraged Brandeis and Warren was a mild society item in The Boston Saturday Evening Gazette that described a lavish breakfast party that Warren himself had put on for his daughter's wedding. Although the information itself wasn't inherently salacious, Brandeis and Warren were appalled that a domestic ceremony would be described in a gossip column and discussed by strangers.
At the beginning of the 21st century, however, the Internet has vastly expanded the aspects of private life that can be monitored and recorded. As a result, cyberspace has increased the danger that personal information originally disclosed to friends and colleagues may be exposed to, and misinterpreted by, a less-understanding audience. Gossip that in Brandeis and Warren's day might have taken place in a drawing room is now recorded in a chat room and can be retrieved years later anywhere on earth. Several months ago, The Washington Post, for example, described the case of James Rutt, a man who worried that his Internet past might be misconstrued if taken out of context.
Rutt had spent years unburdening himself in a chat group. Although he had been happy to speak candidly in the sympathetic confines of a space characterized as "a virtual corner bar," once he was appointed to a new position as C.E.O. of Network Solutions Inc., he feared that his musings about sex, politics and his own weight problem might embarrass him, or worse. Fortunately for Rutt, the chat group offered a special software feature called Scribble that allowed him to erase a decade of his own postings. But as intimate information about our lives is increasingly recorded, archived and not easily deleted, there is a growing danger that a part of our identities will come to be mistaken for who we are. In certain circles today it is not uncommon for prospective romantic partners, before going out on dates, to perform background checks on each other, scouring the Internet for as much personal information as possible. And these searches can be a deal-breaker: a friend of mine, after being set up on a blind date, ran an Internet search and discovered that her prospective partner had been described in an article for an online magazine as one of the 10 worst dates of all time; the article included intimate details about his sexual equipment and performance that she was unable to banish from her mind during their first -- and only -- dinner. These are the sort of details, of course, that friends often exchange in informal gossip networks. The difference now is that the most intimate personal information is often recorded indelibly and can be retrieved with chilling efficiency by strangers around the globe.
In a famous essay on reputation published in 1890, E.L. Godkin, the editor of the Nation, elaborated on the distinction between oral and written gossip. As long as gossip was oral, and circulated among acquaintances rather than strangers, Godkin wrote, its objects were often spared the mortification of knowing they were being gossiped about. Oral gossip is a flexible way of enforcing communal norms while still respecting privacy. When neighbors gossip about one anothers' intimate activities, those who behave badly will soon feel the indirect effects of social disapproval. The wrongdoers can then correct their misbehavior without feeling that their public faces have been assaulted. And because all of the relevant parties know one another well based on close personal observation, individual transgressions can be weighed against the broader picture of an individual's personality.
Cyberspace, however, has blurred the distinction between oral and written gossip by recording and publishing the kind of private information that used to be exchanged around the water cooler. Unlike oral gossip, Internet gossip is hard to answer, because its potential audience is anonymous and unbounded. A Web site called Disgruntled Housewife (www.disgruntledhousewife.com) offers an appalling feature called the Dick List, designed to promote "girly solidarity through bile-spewing," in which women from around the country write in to describe the most intimate secrets of former lovers they dislike. (The men are identified by their home towns and sometimes by their full names, a few letters of which are fatuously omitted.) Furthermore, when the gossip is archived, it can come back to haunt. If, in a moment of youthful enthusiasm, I posted intemperate comments to an Internet newsgroup, those comments could be retrieved years later simply by typing my name or Internet protocol address into a popular search engine. For more and more citizens the most important way of exchanging gossip is e-mail. But instead of giving private e-mail the same legal protections as private letters, courts are increasingly treating e-mail as if it were no more private than a postcard. In an entirely circular legal test, the Supreme Court has held that constitutional protections against unreasonable searches depend on whether citizens have subjective expectations of privacy that society is prepared to accept as reasonable. This means that as technologies of surveillance and data collection have become ever more intrusive, expectations of privacy have naturally diminished, with a corresponding reduction in constitutional protections. More recently, courts have held that merely by adopting a written policy that warns employees that their e-mail may be monitored, employers will lower expectations of privacy in a way that gives them virtually unlimited discretion to monitor e-mail.
Even when employers promise to respect the privacy of e-mail, courts are upholding their right to break their promises without warning. A few years ago in a case in Pennsylvania, the Pillsbury Company repeatedly promised its employees that all e-mail would remain confidential and that no employee would be fired based on intercepted e-mail. Michael Smyth, a Pillsbury employee, received an e-mail message from his supervisor over the company's computer network, which he read at home. Relying on the company's promise about the privacy of e-mail, he sent an intemperate reply to the supervisor, supposedly saying at one point that he felt like killing "the backstabbing bastards" on the sales force, and referring to a holiday party as the "Jim Jones Koolaid affair."
Despite the company's promises, it proceeded to retrieve from its computers dozens of e-mail messages that Smyth had sent and received, and then fired him for transmitting "inappropriate and unprofessional comments." Smyth sued, arguing that the company had invaded his right to privacy by firing him. But the court blithely dismissed his claim on the grounds that Pillsbury owned the computer system and therefore could intercept e-mail sent from home or work without invading its workers' legitimate expectations of privacy.
This can't be right. I'm at home as I type these words, but the computer on which I'm typing is owned by the law school I teach at, as is the network that supplies my e-mail access. I would be appalled if anyone suggested that the provision of these research tools gave my law school the right to monitor all the e-mail I send and receive. In 1877, the Supreme Court held that postal inspectors need a search warrant to open first-class mail, regardless of whether it is sent from the office or from home. And searches of e-mail can be even more invasive than searches of written letters. Georg Simmel wrote about the ways in which written letters are peculiarly subject to misinterpretation. Because letters lack the contextual accompaniments -- sound of voice, tone, gesture, facial expression" -- that, in spoken conversation, are a source of obfuscation and clarification, Simmel argued, letters can be more easily misinterpreted than speech. With e-mail, the possibilities for misinterpretation are even more acute. E-mail combines the intimacy of the telephone with the infinite retrievability of a letter. And because e-mail messages are often dashed off quickly, they may, when taken out of context, provide an inaccurate window onto someone's emotions. In 1997, for example, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson chose Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School to advise him in overseeing the antitrust dispute between the government and Microsoft. When Microsoft challenged Lessig's appointment as a "special master," Netscape officials turned over to the Justice Department an e-mail message that Lessig had written to an acquaintance at Netscape in which he joked that he had "sold my soul" by downloading Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The Justice Department, in turn, gave Lessig's e-mail to Microsoft, which claimed he was biased and demanded his resignation.
In fact, Lessig's e-mail had been quoted out of context. As the full text of the e-mail makes clear, Lessig had downloaded Microsoft's Internet Explorer to enter a contest to win a PowerBook. After installing the Explorer, he discovered that his Netscape bookmarks had been erased. In a moment of frustration, he fired off the e-mail to the Netscape acquaintance, whom he had met at a cyberspace conference, describing what had happened and quoting a Jill Sobule song that had been playing on his car stereo: "Sold my soul, and nothing happened." And although a court ultimately required Lessig to step down as special master for technical reasons having nothing to do with his misinterpreted e-mail, he discovered that strangers were left with the erroneous impression that the e-mail "proved" that he was biased, and that it was this that brought about his resignation. The experience taught Lessig that, in a world where most electronic footsteps are recorded and all records can be instantly retrieved, it is very easy for sentiments to be taken out of their original context by people who want to do someone ill.
"The thing I felt most about the Microsoft case was not the actual invasion (as I said, I didn't really consider it much of an invasion)," Lessig wrote in an e-mail message to me after the ordeal. "What I hated most was that the issue was just not important enough for people to understand enough to understand the truth. It deserved one second of the nation's attention, but to understand the issue would have required at least a minute's consideration. But I didn't get, and didn't deserve, a minute's consideration. Thus, for most, the truth was lost." Lessig felt ill treated, in short, not because he wasn't able to explain himself, but because, in a world of short attention spans, he was never given the chance. In what might be seen as poetic justice, Microsoft itself was embarrassed in the antitrust trial that followed when e-mail from top executives, from Bill Gates on down, was turned over to the government and introduced in court.
Unchastened by Lessig's experience, I behave as if my online life isn't virtually transparent, even though I understand on some level that it is. Not long ago, I visited my law school's computer center to find out how many of my online activities were in fact being monitored. "If I happen to be in the server room, I can watch you send e-mail, and I'll know who you're sending it to," said the discreet head of the center. Beyond that, I was pleased to learn, the law school has decided not to install the programs that many companies use to monitor the browsing, reading and writing of their employees in real time, or to make regular copies of hard drives, including the cache files that record all the Internet documents a user has downloaded. But if I, like the former dean of Harvard Divinity School, asked school technicians to repair my home computer, the school would be able to reconstruct my personal and professional online activities with granular precision.
Perhaps the only sane response to the new technologies of surveillance in cyberspace is unapologetic paranoia. If so, my candidate for the perfectly rational man is K., one of my former students. K. wears green Army fatigues and black boots and spends much of his day shredding and covering his electronic tracks. "In my home office, I have five computers with AtGuard personal firewalls," he explained to me not long ago. "With AtGuard you can monitor how many backdoors you have open to the Internet, so if someone is spying on you with a hacking program like BackOrifice or NetBus, you can kill that connection." Whenever an uninvited Web site tries to send K. a cookie, AtGuard fires back a cookie that says, "Keep your cookies off my hard drive." Aware that files and e-mail can be resurrected from his hard drive even after they are ostensibly deleted, K. also uses a suite of security tools called Kremlin. Every time K. turns off his computer, Kremlin does a "secure total wipe" of his 20 gigabyte hard drive, scribbling electronic graffiti, in the form of zeroes and ones, over all the free space so that any lurking, partly deleted files will be rendered illegible. This takes more than an hour. K. also uses Kremlin to encrypt his personal documents in a secure folder on his hard drive, and he carefully chose a nonsense password, garbled with upper- and lowercase letters and numbers, so that it can't easily be cracked by a "brute force attack program" that might hypothetically bombard his computer with millions of random words generated from an electronic dictionary. Impressed by his vigilance, I asked K. what, precisely, he was trying to hide. "It's more an ideological act than anything else," he said. "I know that I can be surveilled at all times, so I feel like I have a responsibility to resist."
Not everyone agrees that there is reason to resist the brave new world of virtual exposure. This is, after all, an exhibitionistic culture in which people cheerfully enact the most intimate moments of their daily lives on Web cams and on Fox TV. It is a culture in which Wesleyan students are offered a chance to live in a "naked" dorm and in which 2,000 confessional souls have chosen to post their most private thoughts on a site called Diarist.net, which boasts, "We've got everything you need to know all about the people who tell all." Defenders of transparency argue that there's no reason to worry about privacy if you have nothing to hide, and that more information, rather than less, is the best way to protect us against being judged out of context. We might think differently about a Charles Schwab employee who ordered "Memoirs of a Geisha" from Amazon.com, for example, if we knew that she also listened to the Doors and subscribed to Popular Mechanics.
But the defenders of transparency are confusing secrecy with privacy, and secrecy is only a small dimension of privacy. Even if we saw an Amazon.com profile of everything the Charles Schwab employee had read and downloaded this week, we wouldn't come close to knowing who she really is. (Instead, we would misjudge her in all sorts of new ways.) In a surreal world where complete logs of every citizen's reading habits were available on the Internet, the limits of other citizens' attention spans would guarantee that no one could focus long enough to read someone else's browsing logs from beginning to end. Instead, overwhelmed by information, citizens would change the channel or click to a more interesting Web site.
Even the most sophisticated surveillance technologies can't begin to absorb, analyze and understand the sheer volume of information. The F.B.I. recently asked Congress for $75 million to finance a series of surveillance systems,including a new project called Digital Storm, which will allow it to vastly expand its recordings of foreign and domestic telephone and cell-phone calls, after receiving judicial authorization.
But because it can't possibly hire enough agents to listen to the recordings from beginning to end, the F.B.I. plans to use "data mining" technology to search for suspicious key words. This greatly increases the risk that information will be taken out of context: as "60 Minutes" reported, the Canadian Security Agency identified a mother as a potential terrorist after she told a friend on the phone that her son had "bombed" in his school play. Filtered or unfiltered, information taken out of context is no substitute for the genuine knowledge that can emerge only slowly over time.
Moreover, defenders of transparency have adopted a unified vision of human personality, which views social masks as a way of misrepresenting the true self. But as the sociologist Erving Goffman argued in the 1960's, this take on personality is simplistic and misleading. Instead of behaving in a way that is consistent with a single character, people reveal different parts of themselves in different contexts. I may -- and do -- wear different social masks when interacting with my students, my editors, my colleagues and my dry cleaner. Far from being inauthentic, each of these masks helps me try to behave in a manner that is appropriate to the different roles demanded by these different social settings. If these masks were to be violently torn away, what would be exposed is not my true self but the spectacle of a wounded and defenseless man.
Goffman also maintained that individuals, like actors in a theater, need backstage areas where they can let down their public masks, tell dirty jokes, collect themselves and relieve the tensions that are an inevitable part of public performance. In the new economy of information exchange, white collar workers are increasingly forced to work under constant surveillance like the dehumanized hero of "The Truman Show," a character who has been placed on an elaborate stage set without his knowledge or consent and whose every move, as he interacts with the actors who have been hired to play his friends and family, is broadcast by hidden video cameras.
The inhibiting effects on creativity and efficiency are palpable. Surveys of the health consequences of monitoring in the workplace have suggested that electronically monitored workers experience higher levels of depression, tension and anxiety and lower levels of productivity than those who are not monitored. Unsure about when, precisely, electronic monitoring may take place, employees will necessarily be far more guarded and less spontaneous, and the increased formality of conversation and e-mail can make communication less efficient. Moreover, spying on people without their knowledge is an indignity. It fails to treat its objects as fully deserving of respect, and treats them instead like animals in a zoo, deceiving them about the nature of their own surroundings.
In "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," Milan Kundera describes how the police destroyed an important figure of the Prague Spring by recording his conversations with a friend and then broadcasting them as a radio serial. Reflecting on his novel in an essay on privacy, Kundera writes, "Instantly Prochazka was discredited: because in private, a person says all sorts of things, slurs friends, uses coarse language, acts silly, tells dirty jokes, repeats himself, makes a companion laugh by shocking him with outrageous talk, floats heretical ideas he'd never admit in public and so forth." Freedom is impossible in a society that refuses to respect the fact that "we act different in private than in public," Kundera argues, a reality that he calls "the very ground of the life of the individual." By requiring citizens to live in glass houses without curtains, totalitarian societies deny their status as individuals, and "this transformation of a man from subject to object is experienced as shame."
A liberal state should respect the distinction between public and private speech because it recognizes that the ability to expose in some contexts aspects of our identity that we conceal in other contexts is indispensable to freedom, friendship, even love. Friendship and romantic love can't be achieved without intimacy, and intimacy, in turn, depends upon the selective and voluntary disclosure of personal information that we don't share with everyone else. Moreover, as Kundera recognized, privacy is also necessary for the development of human individuality. Any writer will understand the importance of reflective solitude in refining arguments and making unexpected connections: in an odd but widely shared experience, many of us seem to have our best ideas when we are in the shower. Indeed, studies of creativity show that it's during periods of daydreaming and seclusion that the most creative thought takes place, as individuals allow ideas and impressions to run freely through their minds without fear that their untested thoughts will be exposed and taken out of context.
It is surprising how recently changes in law and technology have been permitted to undermine sanctuaries of privacy that Americans have long taken for granted. But even more surprising has been our relatively tepid response to the new technologies of exposure. But there is no reason to surrender to technological determinism; no reason to accept the smug conclusion of Silicon Valley that in the war between privacy and technology, privacy is doomed. On the contrary, there is a range of technological, legal and political responses that might help us rebuild in cyberspace some of the privacy and anonymity that we demand in real space.
The most effective responses may be forms of self-help that allow citizens to cover their electronic tracks, along the lines of the Kremlin technology that my student uses to scour his hard drive or the Scribble technology that James Rutt used to erase his own chat. The fact that e- mail, for example, is hard to delete and easy to retrieve is partly a consequence of current technology, and technology can change. Companies with names like Disappearing Inc. and ZipLip have introduced a form of self-deleting e-mail that uses encryption technology to make messages nearly impossible to read soon after they are received. When I send you a message, Disappearing Inc. scrambles the e-mail with an encrypted key and then gives you the same key to unscramble it. I can specify how long I want the key to exist, and after the key is destroyed, the message can't be read without a herculean code-breaking effort.
At the moment the most advanced technology of anonymity and pseudonymity in cyberspace is offered by companies like Zero-Knowledge Systems, which is based in Montreal. For a modest fee, you can disaggregate your identity with a software package called Freedom, which initially gives you five digital pseudonyms, or "nyms," that you can assign to different activities, from discussing politics to surfing the Web. (Why any of us needs five pseudonyms isn't entirely clear, but the enthusiasm of the privacy idealists is sweet in its way.) On the Freedom system, no one, not even Zero-Knowledge itself, can trace your pseudonyms back to your actual identity.
"You can trust us because we're not asking you to trust us," says Austin Hill, Zero-Knowledge's 26-year-old president. Hill has a messianic air about his role in vindicating what he considers to be the universal human rights of privacy, free speech and the possibility of redemption in a world where youthful errors can follow you for the rest of your life. "Twenty years from now, I'm going to be able to talk to my grandkids and say I played an instrumental role in making the world a better place," he says. "As the Blues Brothers say, everyone here feels that we're on a mission from God."
Freedom makes traceability difficult by encrypting e-mail and Web-browsing requests and sending them through at least three intermediary routers on the way to their final destinations: each message is wrapped like an onion in three layers of cryptography, and each router can peel off only one layer of the onion to learn the next stop in the path of the message. Because no single router knows both the source of the message and its destination, the identity of the sender and the recipient is difficult to link. Zero-Knowledge assigns pseudonyms using the same technology, and so the company itself can't link the pseudonyms to individual users; if it is subpoenaed it can only turn over a list of its customers, who can hope for anonymity in numbers.
But should people be forced to resort to esoteric encryption technology with names like ZipLip and Zero-Knowledge every time they want to send e-mail or browse the Web? Until anonymous browsers become widespread enough to be socially acceptable, their Austin Powers-like aura may deter all but the most secretive users who have something serious to hide. Moreover, every technological advance for privacy will eventually provoke a technological response. For this reason, some privacy advocates, like Marc Rotenberg, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, argue that anonymity on the Internet should be a legal right, rather than something achieved with a commercial product.
Americans increasingly seem to agree that Congress should save us from the worst excesses of online profiling. In a Business Week poll conducted in March, 57 percent of the respondents said that the government should pass laws regulating how personal information can be collected and used on the Internet. The European Union for example, has adopted the principle that information gathered for one purpose can't be sold or disclosed for another purpose without the consent of the individual concerned. But efforts to pass comprehensive privacy legislation in the United States have long been thwarted by a political reality: the beneficiaries of privacy -- all of us, in the abstract -- are anonymous and diffuse, while the corporate opponents of privacy are well organized and well heeled.
In the hope that the political tide may be turning, Senator Robert Torricelli has introduced a bill that would forbid a Web site from collecting or selling personal data unless users checked a box allowing it to do so. This "opt in" proposal has been vigorously and successfully resisted by the e-commerce lobby, which insists that it would cripple the use of online profiling and cause advertising revenues to plummet.
The e-commerce lobby prefers a more modest Senate proposal that would require Web sites to display a clearly marked box allowing users to "opt out" of data collection and resale. But it's not clear that "opt out" proposals would provide meaningful protection for privacy. Many users, when confronted with boilerplate privacy policies, tend to click past them as quickly as teenage boys click past the age certification screens on X-rated Web sites.
Moreover, many people seem happy to waive their privacy rights in exchange for free stuff. There is now a cottage industry of companies with names like Free PC, Dash.com and Gator.com that offer their users product discounts, giveaways or even cash in exchange for permission to track, record and profile every move they make, and to bombard them with targeted ads on the basis of their proclivities.
This is about as rational as allowing a camera into your bedroom in exchange for a free toaster. But as Monica Lewinsky discovered, it's easy to forget why privacy is important until information you care about is taken out of context, and by that point, it's usually too late. "One of the things that I was a little bit disappointed about," Lewinsky told Larry King, "was that people didn't seem to pay too much attention about their privacy issues." In what will hopefully be the last indignity for Lewinsky, some of her previously undiscovered e-mail messages to Betty Currie surfaced only a few weeks ago, when the White House turned them over in response to a subpoena in an unrelated case. In cyberspace, as in cheap horror movies, your ghosts can rise up to haunt you just when you think the danger has passed.
There is no single solution to the erosion of privacy in cyberspace: no single law that can be proposed or single technology that can be invented to stop the profilers and surveillants in their tracks. The battle for privacy must be fought on many fronts -- legal, political and technological -- and each
new assault must be vigilantly resisted as it occurs. But the history of political responses to new technologies of surveillance provides some grounds for hope. Although Americans are seldom roused to defend privacy in the abstract, the most illiberal and intrusive technologies of surveillance have, in fact, provoked political outrage that has forced the data collectors to retreat. In 1967, after the federal government proposed to create a national data center that would store personal information from the I.R.S., the census and labor bureaus and the Social Security administration, Vance Packard wrote an influential article for this magazine that helped to kill the plan.
We are trained in this country to think of all concealment as a form of hypocrisy. But perhaps we are about to learn how much may be lost in a culture of transparency -- the capacity for creativity and eccentricity, for the development of self and soul, for understanding, friendship and even love. There is nothing inevitable about the erosion of privacy in cyberspace, just as there is nothing inevitable about its reconstruction. We have the ability to rebuild some of the private spaces we have lost. What we need now is the will.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Chicago

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER; BRENDA FOWLER lives in Chicago.

 BODY:
A decade ago, Chicago's downtown was confined to a milewide swath of Lake Michigan shoreline that stretched from the gleaming shops of Michigan Avenue in the north to the steps of the Field Museum in the south. But catalyzed by the cheery economy, urban activity is bursting out every which way.
Old red-brick factories along the western edge of downtown are being converted into residential lofts, galleries, restaurants and clubs; vacant lots with views of the skyline are being built up; and small stretches of the Chicago River, which sneaks almost unnoticed right through the city center, are being cleaned up. 
 Chicago is expanding upward, too. At the touristic epicenter, hoteliers are building atop older structures. And, in a city of tall buildings, last year the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill announced plans to reclaim for Chicago the title to the tallest building in the world, held for years by the Sears Tower, with a 1,550-foot building called 7 South Dearborn to be done by 2004.
The city is even covering a rail yard, at the bottom of a gaping canyon along South Michigan Avenue, with the new Millennium Park, which will include a bandshell designed by Frank O. Gehry.
Those who look upon such development with skepticism can find comfort in the unchanging waters of Lake Michigan, whose shores are lined for miles with well-kept, if occasionally crowded, paths for bikers and pedestrians of various speeds and styles. Come Memorial Day, the lakefront at Grant Park provides the backdrop for the city's nonstop summer festivals. In a city that still likes to divide itself into north, west and south sides, these festivals -- from blues to gospel, country and western and Irish -- give Chicagoans the chance to meet their neighbors and hear one another's music.
 
Events
Kids can make their own kites out of paper bags and then fly them in the Lake Michigan breeze at Mayor Daley's Kids and Kites Fest on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the great lawn of the Museum of Science and Industry, 57th Street and Lake Shore Drive. Kites will also be for sale, or bring your own. Rain date is May 7. Call (312) 744-3370. Free.
Through June 11 portions of 15 Dead Sea Scrolls, including 5 never before seen by the public, are on display at the Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive; (312) 922-9410. The scrolls were written 2,000 years ago and discovered in the desert caves at Qumran in 1947. Tickets are $11, which includes admission to the rest of the museum. Some will be available each day on a first-come, first-serve basis, or they can be ordered through Ticketmaster at (312) 902-1500 or at www.ticketmaster.com. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Ray Charles will perform June 16 at 9 p.m. at the House of Blues, 329 North Dearborn, a turtle-shaped building (formerly a theater) that is part of Marina City; doors open at 7:30 p.m.; age 21 or older. Tickets are $55; (312) 923-2000.
The Folk and Roots Festival is July 15 and 16 from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at Welles Park, 2333 West Sunnyside Avenue. The music begins at 3 p.m., but music and dance workshops for children and adults start earlier. More information is available from the Old Town School of Folk Music, 4544 North Lincoln Avenue; (773) 728-6000. Suggested donation: $5.
Throughout the summer the Chicago Cubs play day and evening games at Wrigley Field, 1060 West Addison Street, an intimate ballpark built in 1914. Unreserved bleacher seats cost $6 until May 18, and rise to $15 on weekends and for the rest of the summer. Box seats are $25. Call Ticketmaster at (800) 347-2827, or (312) 831-2827 inside Illinois. Tickets are also sold at the ballpark.
You can get a lesson and then dance under the stars to live bands during the free Chicago Summer Dance program, Thursday to Saturday from 6 to 9:30 p.m. and Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. from July 13 to Sept. 24 in Grant Park at the Spirit of Music Garden, 601 South Michigan Avenue; (312) 742-4007. Each session begins with a free hourlong lesson in the style of dance -- everything from zydeco to klezmer to salsa -- that suits the performing band. Sunday always features ballroom dancing. The Chicago artist Dan Peterman designed the 3,500-square-foot dance floor made of recycled plastic boards laid out in a herringbone pattern.
 
Sightseeing
The Chicago Architecture Foundation's 90-minute river cruise offers a relaxing introduction to the city's architecture. Boats depart from the southwest corner of the Michigan Avenue bridge. Through June 4, cruises run Monday to Friday at 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m., Saturday and Sunday hourly from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. From June 5 to Oct. 1, cruises are daily on the hour from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Additional tours Saturday and Sunday. Cost: $21. To buy tickets in advance (recommended), stop at the dock during tour hours, or at the Chicago Architecture Foundation at 224 South Michigan Avenue, (312) 922-3432, or 875 North Michigan Avenue, (312) 751-1380, or call Ticketmaster at (312) 902-1500.
On a clear day, you can see across Lake Michigan to Michigan from the 94th-floor observatory in the obelisk-like John Hancock Center, 875 North Michigan Avenue, the city's second-tallest building, after the Sears Tower. Open daily 9 a.m. to midnight; (888) 875-8439. Admission: $8.75.
The excellent interactive displays at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, a contemporary building of soaring skylights and prairie stone that opened last October, show how implicated humans are in what we commonly refer to as nature. At the water lab, visitors can make it rain on the 40-foot-long model of an urban river, and then test how human interventions like sewer systems affect its flow. The various exhibits incorporate living organisms such as butterflies, snakes and plants with a few well-placed artifacts, such as Charles Darwin's microscope. The museum is at 2430 North Cannon Drive; (773) 755-5100. Through Memorial Day, it is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Wednesday until 8 p.m.; Memorial Day to Labor Day (Sept. 4) daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday to 8 p.m. Admission: $6.
The neighborhoods of Wicker Park and Bucktown, which join up at the gritty intersection of North, Damen and Milwaukee Avenues, are home to Mexican and Polish immigrants, artists and, increasingly, young urban professionals. The main streets are dotted with restaurants, cafes, thrift shops and expensive boutiques that sell vintage furniture and clothing. Robin Richman, 2108 North Damen, (773) 278-6150, sells quirky vintage and new women's clothing and accessories like beaded pocketbooks; P.45, 1643 North Damen, (773) 862-4523, has a great selection of the latest in women's clothes; and Red Hen Bread, 1623 North Milwaukee, (773) 342-6823, sells pastries and breads.
Though several galleries at the Oriental Institute Museum, housed in a building designed in a sort of Art Deco Gothic style on the campus of the University of Chicago, 1155 East 58th Street, (773) 702-9520, are closed for renovation, the small Egyptian Gallery reopened last year. The exhibit begins with an imposing quartzite statue of King Tutankhamen that dates to about 1334 B.C. All that remains of the figure, presumably of his wife, that once stood beside him is her toes. The displays on the four different scripts used by ancient Egyptians are especially enlightening. Hours are Tuesday and Thursday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Wednesday to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday noon to 4 p.m. Free.
 
Where to Stay
The lovely Hotel Burnham, 1 West Washington Street, opened last October in the former Reliance Building (1894), right in the middle of the Chicago Loop. Floors 7 to 15 preserve the feel of a distinguished old office building: the floors are the original terrazzo (carpeted down the middle to reduce noise); the doors to the rooms are inset with large frosted panes of glass (lined on the other side with a mirror). Many of the 122 rooms, elegantly done in gold and dark blue, have a chaise longue nestled in the bay window. Rates are $185 to $230; (877) 294-9712, fax (312) 782-0899.
When it was built in 1925, the Allerton Crowne Plaza, 701 North Michigan Avenue, then known simply as the Allerton, was the tallest building in Chicago, with 24 floors. Miraculously, considering that it's in the center of the downtown shopping district, the views are still breathtaking from many of the newly renovated hotel's 443 rooms, which are decorated in yellows, golds, flowers and plaids. Rates from $169 to $199; (312) 440-1500, fax (312) 440-1819.
Budget: The Willows, 555 West Surf, sits on a quiet tree-lined residential street on the city's near north side. The 55 rooms, with data ports and bathrobes, are done in mauve, pink and light green. Afternoon tea is served in the pretty lobby. A standard double room costs $149; (773) 528-8400, fax (773) 528-8483.
Luxury: The venerable Drake, 140 East Walton Place, occupies the intersection of Lake Shore Drive and North Michigan Avenue. Each afternoon, to the strains of a live harp, ladies and gentlemen, many of whom are regulars here, take tea in the Palm Room off the lobby. The hotel's 537 rooms are appointed with traditional furnishings and color schemes, some with splendid views of Lake Michigan. Rates: $239 to $295; (800) 553-7253, fax (312) 787-1431.
 
Where to Eat
The view from a loft table up through the industrial, ridge-shaped skylight at the restaurant called mk, 868 North Franklin, (312) 482-9179, almost makes a predusk dinner reservation, say 5:30 p.m., sound like a cool idea. In any case, if you delay making your reservation at this minimalist restaurant on the edge of Chicago's downtown, 5:30 p.m. is what you will get. Michael Kornick's contemporary American menu recently included a roast rack of lamb, garlic flan, roasted plum tomatoes and mint. The desserts are hard to forget, notably one titled "three banana, new banana, vol. III," described as banana malt semifreddo, banana coffee cake and butterscotch sauce. Dinner and wine for two: $125.
Large parties, families and young couples seem to prefer Wishbone, 1001 West Washington; (312) 850-2663. The decor is airy and bright; the food, Southern home-style with dishes like Hoppin' John (black-eyed peas with rice and cheese), baked bone-in-ham, shrimp and grits. Dinner and wine for two: $30. The restaurant has a branch at 3300 North Lincoln Avenue, (773) 549-2663.
Rambutan, a Filipino-American restaurant, serves original appetizers such as ukoy, crispy shrimp fritters battered with sweet potatoes and cassava; main courses such as coriander-crusted barbecue beef; and, for dessert, the buko cream tart, with coconut and sliced bananas in a chocolate-cookie crust. Bring your own wine or beer. Dinner for two: $40. The restaurant reopens at 2049 West Division Street, (773) 772-2727, in a couple of weeks.
L'Olive, 1629 North Halsted Avenue, (312) 573-1515, a quiet restaurant with perfectly dimmed lighting, serves Moroccan specialties like the appetizer grilled spinach with roasted peppers and spicy olives and the main course tagine zitoun, baked chicken with olives and preserved lemon. Dinner and wine for two: $70.
The Taco and Burrito House, 1548 West Fullerton Avenue, (773) 665-8389, with a counter and a few tables, makes a steak burrito worth driving out of one's way for. Dinner for two without wine: about $12.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 4-30-00: Questions for Mikhail Gorbachev;
The Greening of Gorbachev

BYLINE: By Philip Taubman 

 BODY:
Q: You are now leading Green Cross International. I wonder if your interest in environmental issues was to some extent produced by the Chernobyl accident.
To be sure, yes. But when I was the leader of the large Stavropol region, I had to look after environmental questions, too. 
 And then when I became a member of the Politburo in Moscow, I got information that encouraged me to think very seriously about the rivers, the forests, the state of lakes like Baikal, the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea. These were tremendous problems that made me really very restless.
I was in Moscow when the Chernobyl accident took place, and it seemed that it was a factor in leading to a certain degree of cynicism or disillusionment with the government.
Our situation was very difficult. It was not till after 24 hours or even more that we knew about the real scale of this disaster, though we were very decisive in our actions. We used whatever was possible within the planned economy. Perhaps our actions were not clear, but we were not clear ourselves about what happened and what we had to do.
Could we discuss the current political scene in Russia? For example, President Putin?
He's quite a normal man, well educated, with a wide range of vision, though his experience in running the state is not long. Don't let us expect
a miracle. But he understands that without cooperating with Europe and the United States, he will not make it.
Is there reason to be concerned about either his own background in the K.G.B. or the fact that many of his aides come from the security services?
I just came from the U.S.A. I was asked exactly the same question. And my answer was, Where does George Bush come from?
How about President Yeltsin?
His epoch is over. It ended very sadly. Through his efforts, the country and the economy were ruined. And he got to the very core of our existence: education, science, medicine, culture. Though I can say that when you live in these conditions, people learn many things, and this will stand them in good stead now when Russia is climbing onto the path of stable development.
And what do you think of the war in Chechnya?
Rearranging our federation on a democratic footing is impossible unless we solve the Chechen problem. They say that Putin is very ruthless and that he likes blood being shed. I don't think so. I would say that Putin inherited the war in Chechnya. In the first Chechen war, which Yeltsin provoked in order to improve his authority and which took a heavy toll of life, the whole of society of Russia was against that war. Today, most of the people support the idea of defeating terrorists.
I know you have traveled extensively in the United States. What do you like most about America?
What I like most is Americans. They are people who were born and raised in conditions of democracy. They're open. Sometimes they are carefree. I like Americans. I have a lot of confidence in Americans. My confidence and support is much less when I look at foreign policy pursued by the United States. But as far as the domestic issues are concerned, they were quite spectacular in the past 10 years. I like that Americans reaped the efforts of globalization. But the gap between the rich and poor countries is widening. What happened in Seattle is just the bell that is tolling for all of us.
So you are concerned about the forces of globalization?
Yes, absolutely. That's what I'm always saying. Incidentally, I'm very glad that I'll be going to America for a couple of days at the invitation of Henry Kissinger. He's holding a forum where representatives of Europe, Russia and North America will discuss how we see the role of America in the 21st century. And Americans are going to tell us how they see American interests. This is the way to conduct dialogue.
Thank you for your time. I know Americans send their best wishes to you.
Thank you very much. When are you going to publish this interview?
They print the magazine ahead of time, so it won't be immediately.
Well, you work very slowly in America. I am surprised that your development rate is so stable. Philip Taubman

The Call Of the Andes

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
This is a media alert for editors and television producers who thought they could safely ignore all news outside the United States: the permanent drug war is going military -- and abroad. The White House and Congress, having failed with massive domestic police actions to reduce the quantity or quality of illegal drugs on our streets, are mounting a major pursuit of coca growers in Colombia.
Lay news junkies may also be interested, but they can take their time; this story promises to be around for years. Alert media, however, will want to prepare to field Spanish-speaking correspondents, duly covered by kidnap insurance, to follow the action across the photogenic terrain of the Andes. 
 It would be unwise to expect trustworthy information from Washington, where success in this war is still defined by the bag count -- the amount of cocaine captured or the number of coca plants destroyed. The experience of decades proves that any such good result in one venue merely pushes the farming, processing or trafficking of drugs to another. Indeed, it was the great assault on coca plantations in Peru and Bolivia a decade ago that led to the cultivation of even richer strains in Colombia. That country, two and a half times the size of France, now supplies 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States and equal amounts for the rest of the world.
Nor can much reliable information be expected from Colombian journalists. Though intrepid, they are the targets of murderous assaults by the competing factions of Colombia's drug-fueled civil war. In the past six months, five reporters have been killed and scores threatened, kidnapped or forced into exile. The newest refugee is Francisco Santos, the news editor of El Tiempo, the country's leading paper, who left in despair last month before a credible death threat could be carried out.
The terrorism of left- and right-wing guerrillas -- and the efforts of the army and the police to pursue them -- have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Colombians each year. All the paramilitary gangs are well armed; some tax the coca growers whom they protect, others profit from kidnappings and extortions. The turf battles in coca regions caused 350,000 people to abandon their homes last year. The violence and Colombia's bitter economic depression combined to cause another 350,000 to leave the country altogether.
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug commander, says the explosion in Colombia's cocaine production is "clearly a huge drug emergency." But Congress has taken its time acting on a $1.3 billion aid package, which will send the drug hunters 60 helicopters, assorted weapons and several hundred American military instructors.
A major cause of delay was the need to apportion the aid among rival units of the Colombian Army and national police. Another was the search for a compromise between lobbyists for two helicopters -- the Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk, made by United Technologies in Connecticut, and the cheaper but slower Huey, made by Textron's Bell division in Texas. As Tim Golden reported in The Times last month, both companies began as far back as 1996 to demonstrate their alarm about developments in Colombia and their readiness to contribute to the drug war there and to political campaigns at home.
A further delay, after the House finally acted, was prompted by Senate leaders who thought the aid was attached to too many pork barrel projects. In the meantime, Roberto Suro learned for The Washington Post that coca production was resurgent in Peru because of the loss of American radar flights in the Andes region. Our base for reconnaissance planes in Panama was closed. A substitute field in Ecuador can operate only in daytime. Even if that field was refurbished with money in the pending aid package, all of the Air Force's big Awacs radar planes have now been irretrievably committed to surveillance over Kosovo, North Korea and Iraq.
The confusion at the American end of the war is more than matched by that in Colombia. President Andres Pastrana has promised to wage a vigorous campaign against the drug lords, but some of his closest political associates (as well as their top American military adviser) have been enveloped by scandal. Pastrana still trusts the Colombian Army, but many of its units have been accused of complicity in human rights violations.
A further complication is the fact that President Pastrana has begun peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (F.A.R.C.), the country's largest leftist insurgent force and the protector of many drug growers. Those negotiations have further inflamed a rival, right-wing guerrilla group that the State Department has called a bunch of murderous thugs. There is little chance of waging the drug war in Colombia without also becoming involved in a multilayered civil war.
Moreover, unless peace is achieved soon, the American aid seems destined to provoke an arms race. As Gen. Fred F. Woerner, the former commander of our forces in Latin America, has said: "What you can absolutely count on is that with the Blackhawks or the beefed-up Hueys, the bad guys are going to acquire surface-to-air missiles. Helicopters will be shot down. The question is, will we replace them?"
It is but one question among many. The pending aid package is for two years, the time needed to deliver all the helicopters. But General McCaffrey has told Congress to expect at least a five-year effort in Colombia. Others warn that an effective campaign will simply push the coca planting back into Peru or into neighboring regions of Venezuela and Brazil.
And alas, the escalating war abroad will only divert attention from the ultimate policy question at home: are attacks on the supply of drugs really more effective than major efforts to reduce demand? The cost of federal anti-drug programs during the Clinton years has doubled to nearly $20 billion, but only one-fifth of that goes for treating addicts. States and cities have spent vastly greater sums and filled their prisons with 400,000 violators of drug laws. But that has had no apparent effect on street supplies. Concerned media could dig into that conundrum without even worrying about kidnap insurance.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Beyond Kitsch: A New Look At Art Nouveau

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
A CENTURY after its heyday, the ornate decorative style known as Art Nouveau remains so immediately recognizable that debate over its merits often comes down to this: do you love it or hate it? The Victoria and Albert Museum, however, believes the time is ripe to revisit an earlier question: what is Art Nouveau? And to prove that the answer is not obvious, it has put together "Art Nouveau 1890-1914," the largest exhibition on the subject since the last fin de siecle.
The premise of the show, which will travel to the National Gallery of Art in Washington this fall after closing here on July 30, is that Art Nouveau was not a flash-in-the-pan movement driven by press and publicity. Rather, it was a complex style, inspired by the idea of total art, or Gesamtkunstwerk, as a political instrument, that had roots in the mid-19th century and exercised influence well into the 20th century. The show's organizers are all too aware of the view that Art Nouveau is kitsch, but they hope to demonstrate that there is more to it than meets the eye. 
 Five years in the making, with some 400 objects from the Victoria and Albert's own vast and eclectic collection and on loan from public and private collections in Europe and the United States, the exhibition records Art Nouveau's Gesamtkunstwerk reach through paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glass, textiles, furniture, jewelry, graphics and architecture. It also spotlights the stars of the day, among them Aubrey Beardsley, Emile Galle, Rene Lalique, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Henry van de Velde and Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
For all the bravura of the museum's presentation, though, the show cannot disguise the inferiority complex that has long plagued the decorative arts, Art Nouveau included. "Suddenly they were called arts of the second rank, then decorative arts, then the minor arts and lastly the industrial arts," van de Velde lamented in his day. "We can't allow a split which aims at single-mindedly ranking one art above the others, a separation of the arts into high art and a second class, low industrial art." But a century later, thanks to the self-confident elitism of the fine arts, that split still exists.
Thus, it is no coincidence that the display here opens with the claim that Art Nouveau is also art by showing a half-dozen recognized masterpieces. The first, Lalique's corsage ornament called "Dragonfly Woman," is a remarkable piece of jewelry made of gold, enamel, chrysoprase, moonstones and diamonds. (This object was chosen for the cover of the show's catalog as well as its principal poster.) Others include a high-backed oak chair by Mackintosh; Galle's glass "Hand"; "Five Swans," an exquisite tapestry by Otto Eckmann, and "Head of a Girl," a silver and bronze statue made by Alphonse Mucha for the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900.
After this overture, the show becomes more instructive, tracing the early influences on Art Nouveau. The impact of the exaggerated forms of late Baroque, Rococo and Gothic Revival is immediately apparent, notably in their subversion of classicism. Rococo was particularly embraced by the Ecole de Nancy, which, along with Paris, became one of the French centers of Art Nouveau. In Central and Eastern Europe, in contrast, folk art and mythology inspired the ceramics and furniture of many "new art" designers.
Two non-European influences were significant. With Europe rediscovering Egypt and North Africa in the 19th century, Islamic art became popular: patterns inspired by calligraphy along with the shapes of trees, leaves and flowers soon found their way onto European textiles, glassware, ceramics and stone. Mischievously, a swan-necked glass flask by Tiffany is shown here beside an identical Persian flask from which it was copied. Japanese prints, which had already seduced many of the Impressionists, also contributed to the abstract designs and elongated figures much valued by Art Nouveau.
The show looks at the special place of Britain, not as an important capital of Art Nouveau, but as an inspiration for the style through the early influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris, the Arts and Crafts movement and the Aesthetic Movement. The exhibition's curator, Paul Greenhalgh, even identifies Beardsley's 1893 engraving "J'ai Baise Ta Bouche Iokanaan," inspired by Oscar Wilde's "Salome," as one of the first works of Art Nouveau. But while the style flourished in Mackintosh's Glasgow, it floundered in England after the homosexuality trial of Wilde, whose name was associated with Art Nouveau. (Interestingly, the Victoria and Albert began acquiring Art Nouveau objects after the Exposition Universelle, although there was an outcry when they were first displayed.)
The show's second theme is Art Nouveau's cult of nature, which may have been inspired by Charles Darwin's watershed work on evolution and the growing fascination with the natural sciences. Love of nature, though, was also a socially acceptable way of evoking eroticism. Either way, lamps, furniture, candelabras, vases, jewelry and wallpaper were decorated with flora and fauna or assumed organic forms reminiscent of exotic plants and marine life. And yes, let's face it, a good deal of this looks pretty kitschy today. But in architecture, the results were often more pleasing as facades, pillars, doorways and terraces abandoned straight lines for twists and twirls, nowhere more than in the Barcelona of Antoni Gaudi.
The final section of the show, "The Metropolis and the Designer," looks at how Art Nouveau was expressed in eight fin-de-siecle cities: Paris, Brussels, Helsinki, Glasgow, Vienna, Munich, Budapest and New York. (Mr. Greenhalgh said Barcelona was not included in the exhibition because its form of Art Nouveau, known as Modernismo, survives principally in buildings, although Barcelona's experience is discussed in the catalog.) This overview confirms how quickly Art Nouveau was adopted by European designers, but also how many designers reached similar aesthetic conclusions independently of each other.
Paris was of course Europe's art capital before and after the turn of the century, so it was only appropriate that the term "art nouveau" should be borrowed from a Paris gallery owned by a German dealer, Siegfried Bing. The style also left its mark on Paris, not least in the curvilinear wrought-iron entrances to the Paris Metro stations designed by Hector Guimard (one is on display in the exhibition). And yet when Victor Horta designed the Hotel Tassel in Brussels in 1893, he was not following Paris. In his architecture and interior design over the next 15 years, he created an urban legacy matched only by that of Gaudi in Barcelona.
In Vienna, too, a frantic search for the new was taking place under the slogan of Secession. Josef Maria Olbrich's 1898 Secession Building, for instance, wore on its facade the proclamation, "To the Age Its Art, to the Art Its Freedom," and it was there that Gustav Klimt first showed his revolutionary painting, "Pallas Athene." The most talented "total artist" in Vienna, though, was probably Josef Hoffmann, whose range of work included architecture, furniture, silverware and tapestries.
INDEED, as with Mackintosh's Glasgow, it was often through one or two renowned architects or designers that Art Nouveau took root in different cities. In New York, it was through Tiffany, while in Budapest, Josef Rippl-Ronai's illustrations were matched by Odon Lechner's success in, as he put it, "giving birth to a new style" in architecture. Similarly, in Helsinki, the dominant figure was Eliel Saarinen, whose style was simultaneously ethnic and cosmopolitan, Romantic and nationalistic, in the words of Jennifer Opie, a deputy curator at the Victoria and Albert. And here again, the inspiration was not Paris, but rather Finland's struggle for independence from Russia.
What these many Art Nouveau movements had in common, then, was a desire to break with the past -- even more, to use art and design as motors for social and political change. "Art Nouveau becomes a style when it reflects the culture of an age," Mr. Greenhalgh said. "It appears suddenly, rips around the world, then destroys itself as the economic and political moment changes. But it had made the break. It was the first moment of international Modernism."
Even before the outbreak of World War I, Art Nouveau had run out of steam, yet in Mr. Greenhalgh's view its influence continued to be felt, notably through Art Nouveau architects who made the switch to either Art Deco or Modernism, carrying with them their quest for a "new style." Surrealism's debt to Art Nouveau and the fin-de-siecle approach to nature is even clearer. Yet it was not until the 1960's that Art Nouveau design began to recover some degree of public legitimacy. And only in the 1980's was its architectural influence apparent in the decorative features of postmodernism.
Still, the mere fact that Art Nouveau buildings in many cities are being restored today rather than being torn down, as many were in the past, is evidence that the style has become a historical footnote. Whether it was the beginning or the end of something may long be debated, but Mr. Greenhalgh can hardly be faulted for presenting a show with a point of view: as he looks back at Art Nouveau a century later, he is persuaded that he is looking forward.
"Perhaps this would be fairest to say of the men and women who created Art Nouveau: that, in the larger sense, they finished almost nothing," the curator writes in the catalog. "But for those of us alive in the complex vortex of a world entering a new era, we say that they started almost everything."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Harry Phillips 3rd;
New Member of Regents Explores Role

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IF Harry Phillips 3rd of Greenburgh, the newest member of the State Board of Regents, had to take an exam about his new job, he would be leaving a lot of questions blank.
Mr. Phillips says he has much to learn before he is ready to make grand pronouncements about what should be done to improve New York's schools. Generally, he likes the track the Regents are on under Richard Mills, the state commissioner of education, demanding higher standards of all students. But how should the state deal with disruptive students, failing schools, school financing? These are the questions he says he must consider. 
 A graduate of Harvard College, Mr. Phillips was named by the State Legislature in April to a five-year term on the Board of Regents, representing Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Ulster Counties. Before the appointment, he was chairman of Westchester Community College for five years and a trustee of the college for 11 years. In his professional life, he is managing director of Winged Keel Group, a financial security management company in Manhattan, and president of Phillips Compensation. He and his wife, Marjorie, have three grown children. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation:
Q.: What do you want to accomplish as a Regent?
A.: Because my daughter is a principal of a public school in Brooklyn, we've talked about all the issues confronting the public schools, especially in New York City: the implementation of the Regents' standards, problems with disruptive kids and the fact that we seem to be falling behind in our education compared to the rest of the industrialized world. It kind of requires the system to be shaken up some.
Of course, I should preface all this by saying I am new to this, I have so much to learn, so much to read. The scope of the Regents job is so much bigger than I thought. They have a $16 billion budget, and most people are not aware that in addition to supervising both public and private education from pre-k to graduate school they license and discipline all the professions except lawyers. And they supervise the public radio and TV stations in the state and all the public libraries.
So it's so hard for me as the new kid on the block to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to listen a lot. And I have some concerns about charter schools. I am hopeful that the innovations that they present will be helpful to the whole public school and private school system. There are dangers -- they siphon money from the rest of the public school system, and it could siphon role models.
Q.: What about proposals for renewable contracts for teachers instead of tenure?
A.: The point is moot. The Democratic majority in the Assembly is certainly not in favor of changing those rules. I think everybody agrees there has to be streamlined procedures for removing teachers who become incompetent, paranoid or dangerous, but have tenure. I'm told the Legislature did institute such a system four or five years ago, and I will be looking carefully to see if it works.
Q.: In Westchester, there are some schools that make "top" school lists and others that are in trouble. What should be done?
A.: It's a dilemma. You don't want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy by labeling those other schools as failing when they might be improving. So far, test scores have correlated closely with the average income of the district, and someone said maybe the best way to raise the test score is to raise the minimum wage.
Be that as it may, I am very sympathetic to that point of view. More and more, I'm seeing a desire to make people accountable. You can point to a district somewhere in the city where a great administrator has come in and turned a school around. So you can't give up and say low income, low scores.
Q.: Some critics say that the state should take over financing of education from property taxpayers. What is your position?
A.: There is a school on Long Island that is economically not viable, that has a population that has no economic base and the tax rate is the highest in the state and they owe the state money. And you can only ask: Is that fair? How can these kids get a decent education? And some states have chosen to have some form other than local property taxes to support their schools, and there is some of that in New York as well through grants, and so on.
That is in the hands of the Legislature. But clearly you can make the case that poor districts are being shortchanged. Maybe there is something that can be done short of a drastic change.
Q.: What about the quest for high educational standards? Are you pleased with the approach of the commissioner of education?
A.: I am happy there was a shaking up of a complacent system. Should there be some form of alternative assessment? Maybe. But I think there are many more concessions that have been made by the Regents already that the public may not be aware of. Dropping the passing grade to 55 on a Regents exam is a major concession. And there are great concessions for people with learning disabilities.
Q.: Do you think it was wise to lower passing grades on Regents exams to 55?
A.: Again, I do not know how to deal with this yet. I think it's possible the Regents exams have become harder. It's possible dropping the passing grade to 55 really was not the change it looks like. And the 55 is meant to be temporary. The reason is that students taking the exams now have not had the benefit of universal pre-k education, which is going to happen, I hope. They haven't had the advantage of the much stricter fourth- and eighth-grade requirements and tests that will get them in the swing of these new standards.
Q.: New York is in the minority of states that do not mandate gifted education. What is your position on that?
A.: I really don't know. I really need to learn more about that. It sounds like a good idea; on the other hand it has not been proven in the lower grades that homogeneous grouping does a better job than heterogeneous.
Q.: Sports programs in schools have become bigger and take up more time. Does this detract from studying?
A.: I have a granddaughter who was captain of the tennis team and a grandson who was a left-handed pitcher. They were all recruited by every college. It is one of what my son-in-law calls the last bastions of affirmative action. It would be wonderful if the brightest kid in school were given the kind of recognition that the best athlete is given. I think sports are overemphasized, but it's hard to change.
There are priorities, and I'd like the priorities to be education and have athletics be secondary. But I can't change the world. However, I think some progress is being made, especially because there is a drive in black churches to recognize the importance of education.
Q.:You've mentioned concern about disruptive children in the classroom. Describe the problem as you see it.
A.:The disruptive child is a big issue. It is very difficult to know the answer. There are legal ramifications and all kinds of things. I was at Newburgh Free Academy, which is a large public high school, and if I have the numbers right there are about 2,250 students. There is an alternative school for people who are disruptive, and there are only 30 kids there and they have to earn their way back into the main operation.
There needs to be some solution where you don't continually send a kid down to the principal's office every few days and the most the principal can suspend is for five days and the kids are taking up the time of the assistant principals. There has to be a better way to handle the problem. Again, as the new kid on the block, I don't know that way, but I will be looking at it.

HEADLINE: Benjamin Zwirn: Once More, for the Greens

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THERE is a deadlock in the Nassau County Legislature. Party lines are sharply drawn. Nine unyielding Republicans confront nine intransigent Democrats. The county is on fire with trouble and Wall Street is watching, but nobody is budging.
The outcome of a crucial vote -- one, perhaps, that will decide how the county will try to resolve the worst financial crisis in its history -- is in the hands of an independent who is friend to neither side. 
 And, if he is in fact elected in a special vote in the 11th legislative district on Tuesday, the man on center stage in that scenario will be Benjamin L. Zwirn, the original world-shaker of Nassau politics, the enfant terrible from North Hempstead, the abrasive political fighter, and, some say, the very person to force the doing of what must be done to right dangerously listing Nassau.
One who says so is Mr. Zwirn, 48, of Port Washington, the former North Hempstead Town supervisor, who is running on the Green Party line with a reputation more closely associated with fiery red.
"It's the perfect race at the perfect time," Mr. Zwirn said last week. "The Republicans and the Democrats haven't got the guts to cut personnel and reduce the size of county government."
If elected, Mr. Zwirn said, he would either compel legislative action or ask Albany for a state fiscal control board. "If they can't take care of their own mess, then someone is going to have to come in and do it for them," he said.
With strong name recognition and intense door-to-door campaigning, Mr. Zwirn is a longshot whose chances cannot be ruled out. In a political career that began in 1987, when he ran unsuccessfully for supervisor of North Hempstead to oppose the building of a garbage incinerator, he has pulled off a few upsets.
Most notably, in 1993, Mr. Zwirn, then a rising political star but already controversial for his combative manner, defeated Richard M. Kessel in a Democratic primary for county executive.
Mr. Kessel, now chairman of the Long Island Power Authority and then head of the State Consumer Protection Board, was backed by Governor Mario M. Cuomo and the Nassau Democratic Party.
Mr. Zwirn had at first said he would support Mr. Kessel but then called him "a marshmallow" who would be eaten up by Republicans.
The father of two, Mr. Zwirn was born in Bayside in 1951 to a middle-class Jewish family. He attended Earlham College, a Quaker college in Richmond, Ind., where he was an opponent of American involvement in the Vietnam War. He received a law degree from St. John's University, worked briefly for a New York City real estate law firm and was an assistant district attorney in Nassau County for three years.
During the 1980's, Mr. Zwirn, then a Republican, ran the family import and export business, Fiesta Nut in Port Washington. He was known to friends as the Pistachio King for his habit of handing out pistachios. By the mid- 1980's, he was involved in opposing the incinerator, switching his party enrollment to Democrat in anger over Republican refusals to heed opposition to the plant.
Beginning then and in all the years since, Mr. Zwirn, though inactive politically after losing as an independent candidate for North Hempstead supervisor in 1995, has been a constant critic of patronage, which he has described as the root of current financial problems.
With Democrats, in his estimation, now playing the same games he detested Republicans for, he said, "Wouldn't it be the best situation for Nassau County that I would be voting on the side of the taxpayers, and not on the basis of who is going to be the next head of O.T.B.?"
Moderate opinions about Mr. Zwirn are hard to find. Over the years he has been called brilliant, idealistic, dedicated and passionate, but also volatile, self-righteous, ruthless, vicious and dangerous.
A colleague on the Nassau Board of Supervisors, Bruce Nyman, a Democrat, has likened Mr. Zwirn to a "T. rex totally focused on his prey." Another one-time Democratic colleague, the former Oyster Bay supervisor, Lewis J. Yevoli, went further last week at the mention of Mr. Zwirn's name.
"Just look in the dictionary under evil and you'll find it," Mr. Yevoli said. "He is always angry at someone or something. I would not want the misfortune of serving with him again."
The special election -- in the North Shore district that includes Manhasset, Port Washington, Sands Point, the Plandomes, Old Westbury, Roslyn and other solidly affluent areas -- is to fill the legislative seat left vacant by Barbara J. Johnson, a Democrat, who died from breast cancer earlier this year.
A political analyst, Arthur J. Kremer, a lawyer and former state assemblyman, said, "I see Ben as a spoiler but not a victor." He added, "And if he won he would be a thorn in the sides of both parties."
Mr. Zwirn explains some of the enmity by pointing to cost cutting during his time as town supervisor.
"I downsized the government and it ran better than ever," he said. Most who lost their jobs were Republicans.
But his successor, May W. Newburger, a Democrat, said a hidden $3 million deficit she found compelled higher taxes and took years to close. "The deficit was a result of his administration," said Ms. Newburger, now in her fourth term.
Still, even critics credit Mr. Zwirn for forging the way for Democrats in long-Republican Nassau. In 1989, when he was elected as the first Democratic supervisor in the Town of North Hempstead in more than 70 years, it marked the beginning of the end of total Republican domination of the county.
To Republicans, there is a lovely promise in Mr. Zwirn's return. Some believe that, in the race to replace Mrs. Johnson, Mr. Zwirn will hand control to his old foes by spoiling the chances of the Democrats' candidate, Craig Johnson, the late legislator's 29-year-old son.
So Democrats are furious with Mr. Zwirn for running -- and apoplectic at the thought of him winning.
"It would create upheaval, really chaos at a time when the county needs stability and methodical, intelligent thinking," said Judith A. Jacobs of Woodbury, the legislature's presiding Democrat. "It is inexcusable for him to be putting his name in a race that could change the face of Nassau County government for many years to come."
Phoebe Goodman, the executive director of the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee in Manhasset, said she was concerned about a county legislature of "nine and nine and one."
"The one then becomes the ruler, whoever it is," she said.
The Republican candidate, a former North Hempstead town clerk, Linda Green of Port Washington, described Mr. Zwirn as "the last angry man" but said they shared some views. Both have criticized terms of the county's agreement in a Federal lawsuit that will require property reassessments by 2004.
In a manner his Democratic detractors describe as vintage Zwirn, Mr. Zwirn has hammered Mr. Johnson mercilessly over residency, saying the Republican has been a resident of Manhattan rather than Port Washington and is thus ineligible.
"I feel badly that his mother died, she was a friend of mine," he said. "But this is not England and we don't hand the throne down to the next in line. He can't just say 'Vote for me because I had a tragedy in my family,' but that is what he's saying."
Mr. Johnson, on leave from a Manhattan law firm, seems stunned by the vehemence. "Ben Zwirn has been going pretty negative on me and I don't know why," he said.

HEADLINE: An Unpaid Watchdog Looks Back at Tenure

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AFTER three years as president of the League of Women Voters of Westchester, Jo Brill knows there are times when politicians just don't want to hear from her about all the things she -- and the league -- think they should be doing.
Her term ended on yesterday, and Ms. Brill is both nostalgic about her 50-hour-a-week unpaid job as a government watchdog and excited about things she may do in the future. 
 Of her presidency, Ms. Brill, 41, said: "It took over my life. You're surrounded by wonderful people who you work side by side with, but the work is unbelievable."
Ms. Brill, who lives in Peekskill with her husband, Dr. David L. Jensen, and their three sons, said that she found attending countless government and civic meetings exciting.
"Sometimes I'm amazed at the people you get to talk to just for showing up -- for free," she said. "I feel like I've been welcomed into rooms of so many interesting people."
In Westchester, there are 14 local leagues as well as the county league, which have a total of about 2,300 members. Their mission, she said, is twofold: to promote voter education in a nonpartisan way and to lobby for issues that they, by consensus, feel are important.
During Ms. Brill's tenure, the main issues were campaign finance reform, affordable housing, property revaluation, establishment of the county's Human Rights Commission, redistricting of legislative boundaries and budget reform. Some victories, some defeats, she said.
Born in Troy, N.Y., Ms. Brill grew up in Arkansas and received a master's degree in economics in 1984 from Cornell University in Ithaca. She settled in Peekskill in 1987 and was a stay-at-home mom until the county proposed building a sludge disposal facility in Peekskill. She joined with others to oppose it. (Ultimately, the county decided it did not have to build the plant because of changes in federal law.)
Ms. Brill then became active in causes that promoted health care and housing for the poor. She joined her local league (the Briarcliff-Ossining-Croton-Cortlandt League) in 1990 and became president of the county league in 1997.
"Sometimes I wonder whether pouring all this effort into good government in Westchester County is a good use of my life for three years," she said. "After all, it's not world hunger. But Westchester has a great government, an open government. And it's possible to be heard and to spread the word and make changes -- although it can be slow."
She is not sure what she will do next. She will remain on the board of the Westchester County Health Care Corporation and will probably find that she won't be able to stop showing up for the Monday night meetings of the Board of Legislators. Succeeding her as president of the county league is Roberta Wiernik of Chappaqua. DONNA GREENE
 
A Guide to Officials
 
 The League of Women Voters of Westchester's annual Directory of Officials is now available. The 48-page booklet contains the names, addresses and phone numbers of elected officials who represent Westchester at the federal, state, county and local levels, as well as similar information on many high-level appointed government officials.
To obtain the directory, call the league at 949-0507 or send a check for $3 a copy with a self-addressed, stamped envelope. The postage required for one copy is 55 cents. The league's address is League of Women Voters of Westchester, Rochambeau School, 228 Fisher Avenue, White Plains, N.Y. 10606.

HEADLINE: Special Unit Quells Gangs in Yonkers

BYLINE: By JAMES V. O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
LAST summer Officers Ray Montero and Jim Lloyd saw a man being beaten in front of a bodega on New South Main Street. They asked the victim if he wanted to press charges, but Officer Montero knew the answer would be no. He had been patrolling this street for 10 years and understood that the beating was an initiation for a new member of Chicano Nation, a Mexican street gang.
Yonkers is home to 30 street gangs, which were responsible for 368 crimes over the last two years, ranging from harassment to murder, said Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. The growth of such gangs in Westchester, she said, is a spillover from stricter law enforcement in New York City. 
 "Our proximity to New York City makes Westchester prone to gangs looking to increase membership," Ms. Pirro said. "Criminals don't recognize jurisdictional boundaries."
The first line of defense in the Yonkers Police Department is the Gangs, Graffiti and Bias unit, which is made up of four officers trained to recognize gang graffiti, known as tags, and develop intelligence on gang members.
Sgt. Tim Hodges, who was recently assigned to head the unit, is building a database of all gang members, hangouts and graffiti in the city. The unit works closely with the district attorney's office and a gang intelligence unit in the county jail.
Gang graffiti is one of the best indications of gang territory and which gangs are at war with one another. Officer Kenneth Davis is the graffiti expert, and he has formal training in art and has researched more than 5,000 different gang tags and their origins.
"Gang graffiti is bold and simple; it's not stylish or artistic," he said. "They use it to mark their territory, and they want their enemies to know that this is their turf."
The gang unit scours the neighborhoods for new tags, photographs them and reports them to a crew of city workers that tries to remove all graffiti, whether it is gang related or not, within 24 hours.
"These guys put a lot of time and effort putting up their tags," Sergeant Hodges said. "When they see us removing it immediately, it takes some of the wind out of their sails."
The tags reveal gang alliances as well as gang feuds. For example, Officer Davis said, the Unlimited Styles and the Hoover Boys are bitter enemies, and he pointed out tags where the US was crossed out in places and HB replaced it.
In contrast, he said, the Ravine Posse and Body Hurting Walliburton Crew have recently formed an alliance, which is indicated by their tags being placed next to each other.
There has been an explosive growth in Mexican gangs in Yonkers in recent years with the influx of illegal aliens drawn by the strong economy, said Officer Montero.
The largest Mexican gang is Chicano Nation, followed by Aztec Pride, Vatos Locos and 13 Locos.
"We are dealing with more vicious Mexican gang members now who have done jail time in Mexico and are behind a lot of homicides," Officer Montero said.
Some Mexican gangs have formed because members were victims of other established gangs in the area, especially the Bloods. Officer Montero said that the Bloods, an African-American gang, used to wait for Mexican workers who were paid on Friday and rob them of their wages.
"They banded together in a gang for protection initially," Officer Montero said. "But that's all out the window now. Now they're the ones victimizing people by selling drugs, forcing girls into prostitution and extorting store owners."
The biggest problem for the police in tracking and prosecuting gang members is that they are mostly a transient population. They all go by street names and almost never carry identification, Sergeant Hodges said.
On a sweep of gang haunts in March, only two of 18 members who were stopped and questioned had any identification. One had an expired Florida driver's license, and the other had a Mexican voter registration card. One knife was found as well as a small quantity of marijuana.
All the gangs have female members, usually juveniles who hold weapons and drugs, Officer Montero said. Juveniles are handled in family court and are less likely to draw jail time for possession charges, he said. "The female members are treated like communal property, and their only purpose is sex and holding weapons and drugs," Officer Montero said.
Westchester has aggressively prosecuted gang-related violence, despite the obstacles. The District Attorney's Office has had two big cases in the last six years by using a state law that carries a higher penalty for assaults committed by a group. Juan Alberto Cotto, a gang member, was sentenced to 17 years to life for the murder of Peter Lopez in 1999. Mr. Cotto was a member of the Lawrence Street Posse. He was killed, the authorities said, while crossing another gang's turf when he went to visit his mother.
The gang unit, the Yonkers Police Department and the Youth Violence and Gang Intervention Program in the District Attorney's office have been trying to prevent gang activity by discouraging children from joining gangs. The police regularly visit the middle schools and high schools, talking to students about the perils of gangs. The city has kept school gymnasiums open later and organized athletic leagues in gang-plagued neighborhoods to help children find positive outlets.
"The gangs prey on kids from dysfunctional families that don't have any money in their pockets and wear old clothes," Officer Montero said. "They give them some pocket money or buy them some new shoes. Once they take the money they're in. They make them enforcers or drug runners."
All the members in the gang unit believe that the best prevention is not to join a gang in the first place, because getting out is difficult. Gang members who do get away usually do it by moving out of the city or by being injured.
"Unless you move away or you're in a wheelchair, you're not going to be able to walk away from the gang life," Officer Montero said.

HEADLINE: Memo From Hartford;
Around Here, Don't Say Stupid

BYLINE: By COLIN McENROE; Colin McEnroe is a radio talk-show host in Hartford.

 BODY:
THE whole idea that Hartford finished dead last among large American cities in mail-back census returns rankles Bill Rocks.
"Stop talking about how stupid Hartford is," Mr. Rocks growled at me last week. "Hartford is actually doing a lot better than 10 years ago." 
 Mr. Rocks is the state census director and, therefore, a little touchy on this subject, but he has a point. In 1990, the city's mail-back rate was 38 percent. In 2000, it was 42 percent on April 20, when an article came out pronouncing Hartford dead last. By Monday, Mr. Rocks and his crew had somehow found another percentage point to bring the city to 43, and so-called "late mail returns" had yet to be factored in.
"People talk about 'comparable' American cities, but there are no comparable American cities," said Mr. Rocks. His point is that Hartford is tiny, only 17.8 square miles.
Most American cities encompass an area at least as big as Hartford, West Hartford and East Hartford, folding in middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods that can offset the low rates from the inner city.
On the positive side, when Mr. Rocks sends his enumerators door-to-door this month, they'll have less ground to cover than their counterparts in Newark and other undercounted American cities. One way or another, Hartford will probably claw its way out of last place in census compliance.
But even that statement says a lot about a city struggling not to prosper but to avoid desolation. The census article resonated for a few days because it seemed to sum up Hartford's basket-case status.
All cities have problems, but it would be hard to find another city failing on so many fronts at once.
The police force is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation. Six officers have been indicted for criminal offenses, some involving drugs and prostitutes. When a police dog bit an officer a couple of weeks ago, the local joke was: who could blame the dog for getting mixed up about which ones were the crooks?
A consultant's study suggested that even the law-abiding segment of the department was disorganized and out of touch with the citizenry. Ailing Chief Joseph Croughwell agreed to retire in return for a $569,600 settlement and a pension, but the city leaders worry that the department is too dysfunctional to attract high-quality successor candidates.
Fire Chief Robert Dobson was recently driven out after an embarrassing episode in which he was caught working for his wife's art-framing business while on the city clock, followed by allegations that he was disliked and distrusted by his firefighters. In one of those peculiar Hartford twists, Mr. Dobson was given the fabulous parting gift of a taxpayer-funded trip to a Florida firefighters' conference, after he was out of office.
School Superintendent Anthony S. Amato arrived last year with a single-minded focus: get the Hartford system out of last place in the Connecticut Mastery Tests. "Never be last again" became his slogan and, although it lacked some of the dash of "to infinity and beyond," it was something.
And Mr. Amato delivered, raising all the scores in one year and getting the city out of the cellar. He then shocked everybody by becoming, briefly, a candidate for the top educational post in San Francisco.
He later withdrew, apologized and explained that he was only trying to keep his name in circulation. Mr. Amato even claimed it was good exposure for Hartford, although how "lone bright spot looks for an exit" constitutes good exposure is something he found hard to elucidate.
(Lately, there has been talk in the schools of, no kidding, "mastery burnout," as the pressure of being not-dead-last was just more than the schools could bear.)
Meawnhile, Gov. John Rowland is often cited as Hartford's biggest booster, despite his apparent determination to move key state agencies out of the capital city and into his hometown, Waterbury, which he once described as "the center of the universe."
At a lecture sponsored by Fleet Bank in Florida this winter, Mr. Rowland, apparently unaware that a reporter was in the audience, described the Hartford school system as "a disaster."
"Anybody who's ever been to Hartford -- it's dead," said the city's biggest booster. "We haven't had a crane in the air for 30 or 40 years."
Mr. Rowland's recipe for health is, of course, Adriaen's Landing, a proposed mixed-use riverfront development with a convention center, apartments, retail shops and restaurants. The development is controlled by the Capital City Economic Development Authority, an ad hoc panel that has had its own problems, including the resignation of its original chairman after a scandal involving payments and government-subsidized loans to a longtime mistress.
The cost of a ringside seat for Hartford's chaos and squalor is high. The mill rate -- the amount of tax for each $1,000 of assessed value -- has climbed to 50, with a 15 percent surcharge for commercial real estate, which means that a business will pay 57.5 mills, more than 4 percent of market value. It's sort of axiomatic that you pay more taxes in a poorly run city than in a well-run one.
The Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut found that in the last 10 years Hartford's vacant properties increased by 12 percent, while the city lost 10 percent of its apartments and 5 percent of its businesses.
This was during a boom.
Now, if this article seems like the work of a sneering "build-a-wall around it" suburbanite, please understand that I'm writing it in an office, paid for by me, in downtown Hartford. When WTIC radio, where I work, moved out of Hartford last year, after 74 years downtown, I decided to maintain my own writing office, to keep in touch with the city.
I pay rent; I patronize downtown eateries; and chances are good I'm getting, right this minute, one of the pretty red-and-white parking tickets that are handed out in the city the way they hand out leis in Hawaii.
Why? I could work out of my house and my radio office, save money and avoid all the melodramas of Hartford.
It's like being a Red Sox fan or stuck in a dysfunctional family. You don't leave because you've sunk too much of yourself in and because it might finally get better and because, with all the smart and public-spirited people around, darn it, it really should be getting better.
And maybe it will. The Sox have a new center fielder, the daffodils are up, Uncle Bert quit drinking last month, and our mail-back census rate . . . well, in a sense it did get better. Wait till next decade, buster.

HEADLINE: A City Whose Time Has Come Again;
After Years of Deprivation, Jersey City, an Old Industrial Powerhouse, Is Remaking Itself

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
SQUINTING against the glare of sun on water, Bernard Hartnett stood on his eighth-floor balcony at Port Liberte and gestured toward the pinnacles of lower Manhattan, the up-close profile of Lady Liberty and the expansive harbor enveloping this luxury development that rises on the ruins of an old shipyard.
"You should see the view in the evening, when the setting sun reflects off the skyline and my white kitchen turns gold," said Mr. Hartnett. "It's spectacular." 
 Laughing gulls shot through the air as workers hammered away at the latest batch of neo-Georgian condominiums. In the distance, a seemingly endless caravan of dump trucks unloaded dirt over the site of a former oil-tank farm, the first step in turning the tainted earth into an 18-hole golf course.
Never mind the surrounding brownfields and the relentless grinding noise from an adjacent scrap metal plant. Town houses here -- the ones with backyard boat slips -- are selling for $900,000 and most of the 134 units under construction have already been spoken for. Another 1,100 are on the drawing board.
"Business,"' said Nancy Nassaney, a sales agent, "is fabulous."
As development continues to remake Jersey City's seven miles of once-desolate waterfront, officials here predict this former industrial powerhouse will soon overtake Newark as the state's largest city, a distinction that carries a measure of political, practical and symbolic heft.
"This used to be a place that people had just given up on," said Mayor Bret Schundler, gazing at a giant aerial photograph of the city as he rattled off recent milestones, plans and pie-in-the sky projects. "Suddenly everyone wants to be here."
While most people welcome growth after so many years of deprivation, there are some who believe the development juggernaut is rending the social fabric, displacing old-timers and drawing the kinds of people who work, shop, and play in Manhattan while using Jersey City as a place to sleep. "These yuppies think $2,000 for an apartment is a good deal," said Domenic Santana, 38, a local restaurateur owner who grew up here. "But to natives, it's a disgrace."
For many -- the poor, the unskilled and the recently arrived immigrants -- Jersey City's soaring skyline is little more than a dreamy, distant mirage. Melissa Holloway, a City Council member who represents some of the most desperate neighborhoods, said many residents have yet to taste the new prosperity.
"Local people can't even apply for these jobs by going to the waterfront," Ms. Holloway said. "You have to use headhunters in Manhattan. Imagine that. For now, it's just a tale of two cities."
It is, however, a remarkable tale.
Once lumped together with the state's other ailing urban centers known as the Big Six, Jersey City is the only one to experience a true renaissance. For the others -- Camden, Trenton, Paterson, Newark and Elizabeth -- talk of rebirth and renewal remains little more than feel-good sloganeering. Among the Big Six, for example, Jersey City accounted for 90 percent of all new jobs last year. In terms of new construction, population growth and gains in per capita income, it stands a head above the others. Indeed, if the population projections are accurate, Jersey City could surpass Newark in the next few years as the state's largest city.
But in truth, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, the benefits would be largely psychological. "It would mark a new stage of evolution for a city that has always been in the shadow of New York, one that was better known for its railyards than its major corporate players," Mr Hughes said. "Being the biggest would just be the icing on the cake."
Still, Jersey City has its share of urban woes: nearly 20 percent of its 232,000 residents live in poverty, and illegal drug sales and crime flourish in many neighborhoods. In addition, the public schools are not much better than they were in 1989, when the state took over because they were hopelessly mismanaged. After more than a decade of oversight, education officials say test scores are still too low to allow a return to local control.
But overall, Jersey City has come a long way.
In many ways, the story of Port Liberte provides a fitting metaphor for Jersey City's rocky voyage from post-industrial blight to high-tech boomtown.
Billed by its original developers as "Venice on the Hudson," the $750 million waterfront project was the first of many to break ground on the vast wastelands left behind by the railroad companies, detergent manufacturers and shipping companies that began departing in the 1940's. Lured by mesmerizing views and generous tax abatements, Port Liberte's developers planned 1,690 homes along 2.5 miles of meandering canals. But by 1990, the recession had driven them into bankruptcy, leaving such early buyers as Mr. Hartnett with a shell of the St. Tropez-style yacht club they had been promised.
"In the early 1990's, you couldn't give these places away," said Mr. Hartnett, 70, the president of the homeowner's association. More than any of the half-built carcasses that littered New Jersey's Gold Coast in those painful years, Port Liberte came to symbolize the overblown ambitions of a real-estate boom gone bad.
But heady days are here again. A new developer is completing Port Liberte's master plan -- slightly scaled down -- and construction is roaring up and down the Jersey City waterfront. Since emerging in 1993 from a recession that left a third of its office buildings dark, developers here have put up four million-square-feet of commercial space, two hotels and TK,000 apartments. The abandoned train yards and decaying piers have finally given way to a glimmering ribbon of marinas, riverfront promenades and glass-faced towers. And unless New York's economy runs out of steam, developers say there is no end in sight.
"We can't build them quick enough," said Sam LeFrak, the 82-year-old patriarch of the Lefrak organization, whose 600-acre Newport complex already boasts 5,000 residents and 11,600 workers and an ever-expanding megamall. "We have such grand plans. You ain't seen nothing yet."
Such grandiose promises do not thrill everyone. For the early wave of pioneers who turned shabby row houses into landmark gems, more buildings mean more people, more traffic and less open space. Those who live in such downtown neighborhoods as Paulus Hook and Van Vorst Park complain that daily life is increasingly marred by the pounding of pile drivers, the race for scarce parking spaces and early morning gridlock as suburbanites make their way to the waterfront.
For those who live along Jersey City's northern-most ridge, a neighborhood known as the Heights, soaring condominiums threaten to chip away at views that are perhaps the most astounding of anywhere in the metropolitan area. "A lot of people came here because of these incredible vistas," said Doris C. Brown, whose family has lived in the Heights for three generations. "We're not about to sacrifice that to some ugly high rise."
The proposed development, a pair of 43-story towers just below the Heights, would only obscure a thin slice of a view that takes in Hoboken, Jersey City's lowlands and the jagged spine of downtown Manhattan. But opponents fear the project, known as Millennium Towers, would be the first of many. "It would be the beginning of the end," Ms. Brown said.
Jersey City officials dispute that notion, however, saying current zoning restricts tall buildings at the base of the Palisades, an area that is still pocked by empty factories and vacant lots. The Millennium's developers, they say, will not go forward unless they receive a variance for a high-density project. "People in the Heights are afraid of a forest of towers but we're saying we can guarantee that won't happen,' said Mr. Schundler.
There is little trust between local residents and Jersey City officials, both of whom are still smarting from a redevelopment battle that took place several months ago. The Palisade Avenue Coalition, which led the opposition, claimed they were fighting to stop the demolition of their cliff-top community, which once cleared, would be handed over to developers. City officials said the group was misconstruing the facts.
To make their case, Ms. Brown and several friends recently led a visitor on a tour of this ethnically diverse neighborhood, with its sagging Victorians, densely packed tenements and boarded-up storefronts. Rents are still affordable, but that could change as an increasing number of New Yorkers discover the neighborhood.
"Granted, the vinyl siding is not romantic, but we see the problem as a skin condition and the city thinks it's bone cancer," she said. "The bones are fine. These buildings just need a good facial."
City planners said they never intended to bring in the bulldozers, but that a "blight" designation would have qualified the area for valuable federal and state redevelopment funds. The neighborhood's council member, Tom DeGise, said the opposition killed any hope for renewal by twisting the facts.
Long overshadowed by its giant neighbor across the Hudson, Jersey City is something of a black hole to most people, a nondescript blur of two-family homes and grimy warehouses they pass on the way to Newark Airport or the well-groomed suburbs beyond.
"We've had so many friends who refused to visit us because they thought we were in central Jersey," said Leon Yost, a photographer and early homesteader who traded his Manhattan studio for a century-old row house near Van Vorst Park. The cost in 1974: $13,000.
Since then, Mr. Yost said, five friends who braved the 15-minute PATH train ride from Manhattan have purchased their own homes here. These days, an Italianate-style home near downtown fetches $300,000 or more. "You know how it works," Mr. Yost said, a dismissive edge in his voice. "First the artists come and sniff out the cheap prices. Then once they've fixed the place up, the lawyers and dentists show up with all their money."
Still, with 15 square miles of space, there are plenty of ungentrified neighborhoods in Jersey City. These days, refugees come not only from New York City, but from nearby Hoboken, where housing prices have begun to mimic those in Manhattan and the tonier sections of Brooklyn.
As Jersey City's cachet grows, Daniel H. Frohwirth, the real estate director at the Jersey City Economic Development Corporation, says he is noticing a slight shift in the city's self-image. Less and less, he says, people are denying they are from Jersey City.
Like New Jersey's other big cities, Jersey City experienced its greatest glory in the decades before World War II, when heavy manufacturing was king. Originally occupied by the Lenni Lannape Indians, the marshes and rolling hills that later became Jersey City were settled by Dutch farmers in the 1630's, a few years after Peter Minuit made his notorious purchase of Manhattan island.
Much like New York, Jersey City has always been a landing pad for new immigrants. "America's Golden Door," its current promotional campaign, is visible all over town, and residents love to point out that Ellis Island is closer to Jersey City than it is to New York. Two years ago, after a long court battle between the two states, the Supreme Court gave New Jersey jurisdiction over much of the island.
In its heyday before World War II, German, Irish and Italian immigrants found work at Chloro, Colgate or Dixon, the pencil maker. But the single biggest employer was the railroads, whose national networks dead-ended on the Hudson. Until 1911, when the Pennsylvania Railroad Company built the first tunnel under the river, rail passengers transferred here for ferries to Manhattan or to trolleys that fanned out through Hudson County and beyond.
The last streetcar was junked in 1949; today only one rail line, the former Erie Lackawana, survives, with its soaring, copper-faced terminus in Hoboken. When the four other railroad companies went under, they left Jersey City the land that included their vast train yards and sheds, worthless then, but now the gold that is being gobbled up by so many developers.
By the 1970's, Jersey City was in a free fall. From 1950to 1980 it lost 75,000 people residents. And from 1975 to 1982 it lost 5,000 jobs, or 9 percent of its workforce. Although it had always had a reputation as a tough port town, any romantic notions about the old Jersey City were subsumed by a surge of violent crime. Mr. Santana, who grew up downtown, said those were crazy days.
"It was worse here than Fort Apache in the Bronx," said Mr. Santana, adding that as a teenager he was stabbed and shot during brawls. Wily thugs, he said, would stage fights at the Holland Tunnel entrance and divert 18-wheelers onto side streets, where others would cut their cargo locks and unload the loot. "Even old ladies would come out to pick over the stolen goods," he said with a laugh.
These days crime is way down. Mayor Schundler said it has fallen 40 percent since he took office in 1993, mainly through the brand of quality of life policing that has been used in New York.
Still, things have a long way to go in places like Lafayette, Bergen and Greenville, the predominantly black neighborhoods that occupy "The Hill," a gently rising slope that accounts for a third of Jersey City's topography. Most days it is easy to spot the drug dealers, although they usually scamper when Irene Carson comes down the block, slowly hobbling on her cane. Despite two open-heart surgeries and worsening diabetes, the 64-year-old Mrs. Carson fearlessly tells the dealers to leave Lafayette Gardens, the low-rise public housing project that has been her home for more than three decades.
"When I came here, it was so clean and nice, everyone tended their gardens," she said. "The young people, they just don't have respect."
As president of the Lafayette Gardens resident's council, Mrs. Carson has made some progress in her crusade to rein in the chaos. She leads anti-drug marches, steers youngsters into the local Little League and helps raise scholarship money for those who make it to college. The Irene Carson Scholarship Fund -- her neighbors named it -- usually gives from $200 to $500 to each college-bound resident, all of it raised through chicken dinners and children's fashion shows.
Though some of her neighbors disagree, Mrs. Carson thinks life is getting better at Lafayette Gardens. Any day now, she says boastfully, construction should begin on Lafayette Village, a mixed-income development that will bring 77 homes to a vacant lot across the street. Mrs. Carson said her next dream is to see a nearby parcel -- one she described as "that eyesore that attracts drunks and fights" -- replaced by assisted-living housing for Lafayette Gardens' aging residents.
Although she said she could have moved away long ago, joining her children in the suburbs, Mrs. Carson refuses to leave until she sees the return of the old neighborhood that nurtured her in the 1940's and 50's. "I'll stay here to make sure things are brought up," she said.
Further up The Hill, on Martin Luther King Drive, life is still an unending struggle. Merchants began disappearing from the drive, once Hudson County's pre-eminent shopping boulevard, in the 1950's, shortly after the middle-class took off for the suburbs. Block after block, a grim parade of darkened storefronts is all that is left of that other era.
But after decades of despair, there are unmistakable signs of renewal. A station for the Bergen-Hudson Light Rail has just opened on the drive, a new post office is nearly finished and a suburban-style shopping center called "The MLK Hub" is celebrating the arrival of its first tenants, among them such national chains as Ashley Stewart, One Price Clothing, Ponderosa steakhouse, and most importantly, a hulking supermarket. It is, most everyone agrees, a momentous thing.
Omar Barbour stood in the shopping center's parking lot one day last week shaking his head with a mix of pride and disbelief. "It might not look like much, but people here haven't had something like this in a long time," said Mr. Barbour, 46, who shepherded the project through 13 years of broken promises, false starts and fierce opposition.
Just then, Hattie Staggers, 70, came ambling up and gave Mr. Barbour a hug. For 28 years, Miss Staggers lived in a 17-room house on this very spot, she said, pointing toward an empty swath of asphalt. As part of the $18 million redevelopment project, she and about 100 people, 15 businesses and 4 churches had to go. "We took her house, her garden and her church," Mr. Barbour said. "It was a sacrifice she made for a greater good."
Although she was initially skeptical, Miss Staggers now agrees that the end justified the means. By the time the demolition crews came, Ege Avenue had long been a ghost of its former self. More than half the block was pocked by burned-out houses or garbage-filled lots. Before the crews took everything down, Mr. Barbour's group, the MLK Drive Neighborhood Development Corporation, found Miss Staggers an apartment and built her congregation a new church. "I have to say, they came through in the end," she said. "Because this is the most beautiful market I've ever seen."
It was a perfectly choreographed moment, except it didn't feel staged. With Miss Staggers out of earshot, Mr. Barbour admitted that relations between himself and local residents were not always so cordial. "I'm still condemned in this life and in the afterlife," he said, referring to the bruising fights over the project. "Sometimes I wondered if it would ever happen."
Against all odds, it did. Of course it remains to be seen whether The Hub will spark the neighborhood's revival. One of its earliest tenants, a black-owned automotive parts store, closed after only a few months.
But now that almost dozen new shops are open, Mr. Barbour believes the crowds will come. "As far as I'm concerned," he said, strolling through the supermarket's sprawling produce section, "it's already a success."
Before blue-chip titans like Merrill Lynch, American Express and Paine Weber discovered the New Jersey waterfront, there was Journal Square, the city's commercial heart, home to its tallest buildings and the place where generations came to see vaudeville acts, movie premieres and appearances by Bob Hope, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington.
These days, Journal Square is best known for its huge PATH station and a busy bus terminal that serves 30,000 commuters a day. The few surviving brand-name retailers left in the 1980's, around the same time the last of the square's four movie palaces went dark. More than a mile from the waterfront, Journal Square, it seemed, was just too far from Manhattan's glittering skyline to catch some of its pixie dust.
By the time Brian Coleman was given the task of rejuvenating the square in 1995 it had become a place to be avoided. "It was full of garbage, vagrants and graffiti," said Mr. Coleman, executive director of the Journal Square Restoration Corporation. "The most prominent feature was an asphalt parking area for idling taxis."
On a recent sun-filled afternoon, Mr. Coleman stood on that same spot, except that it was now paved with granite slabs and full of pedestrians. The $7.5 million refurbishment of Journal Square, completed this month, has recaptured a bit of the area's lost luster. There is a lavish fountain, a Victorian-style kiosk for food and a grove of new trees. Private security guards keep a lid on boisterous behavior while uniformed cleaning crews chase down every last scrap of paper.
The current wave of construction, it seems, is finally moving off the water's edge. The old Earle Hotel, once a haven for squatters, is offering penthouse apartments for $3,000 a month. A 16-story office building, 26 Journal Square, recently received a $2 million makeover. And a real-estate consortium has plans to build apartments on the site of old State Theater.
If all goes according to plan, Mr. Coleman said, a decaying row of buildings will be replaced by a new home for Hudson County Community College, whose students currently take classes in buildings scattered throughout the neighborhood. "I think we're finally back on the map," he said.
Bricks and mortar are one thing. Bringing back Journal Square's soul is another. To that end, a small army of volunteers is resuscitating the old Loews Jersey Theater, which barely escaped oblivion in 1993 when its owners decided the land was worth more than the building. It was a close call, but the 10,000 signatures and relentless lobbying by local preservationists convinced the city to purchase the theater, which opened in 1929.
Since then, the Friends of the Loews, a nonprofit group, have made the theater's rebirth a citywide crusade. Every weekend, dozens of volunteers tend to the sumptuous interior, which was severely wounded when the Loews Corporation carved it into a triplex. But beyond missing chunks of ornament and a few vanished fixtures, the theater is in remarkably good shape.
A Czechoslovakian-made chandelier still graces the Hollywood baroque vestibule, winged cherubs abound and $38 worth of spray-on lubrication was all it took to get the orchestra pit elevator working again. The theater, inside and out, is a sight to behold.
Colin Egan, the project's only paid employee, estimates that devotees have put in the equivalent of $1 million in free labor; another $1.5 million has been raised through grants and fund-raising events.
These days, the volunteer workers are installing newly reupholstered seats, which have been liberated from 70 years of bubble gum. By summer, the marquee's lights will begin winking again and the legendary clock, with its 6-foot-high figures of St. George and the Dragon, will be doing their hourly dance. Back then, the show began on the sidewalk, Mr. Egan said.
When it opens, the Loews Jersey -- with 3,021 seats -- will be the state's largest theater, and Mr. Egan expects it to support an eclectic range of programming, from Indian dance and rock concerts to independent film and children's theater.
Two miles from Journal Square, beyond The Hill, past the acres of weed-choked brownfields, Port Liberte rises like a sentinel in an unsettled frontier.
With the uncertain years of bankrupcy behind him, Mr. Hartnett, the president of the homeowner's association, sees a grand future for Port Liberte. The clubhouse, which sat unfinished for more than a decade, is finally nearing completion. These days the most vexing problem, he said, is the giant scrap plant next door, which is poorly concealed by a row of hedges. "We're trying our best to come up with a solution", he said.
Growing up in Jersey City's old Irish neighborhood, the Horseshoe, Mr. Hartnett said he always knew his hometown was destined to be more than a railroad junction. A fourth-generation Jersey City native, he is the last in his family to remain. The Horseshoe was plowed over long ago to make way for the Holland Tunnel access ramps.
A tireless Jersey City booster, Mr. Hartnett believes the best is yet to come. "We have the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the science center, Liberty State Park," he said, "and we're a few minutes from Newark Airport." He paused, and then added, "People laugh at me, but I think there will come a time when travel agents book vacations to Jersey City. You'll see."

In Vineland, It's Baseball Bilingually

BYLINE: By SHARON WATERS 

DATELINE: VINELAND

 BODY:
Vineland has long taken its high school baseball seriously, so seriously that the games are broadcast on local radio. But after decades of home runs and strikeouts, there are cuadrangulars and ponchados.
Welcome to WMIZ, 1270 on the AM band, which first introduced bilingual baseball broadcasts three years ago in covering the Vineland High School Roosters. This year the coverage was expanded to include the Sacred Heart High School Lions. 
 Sitting behind home plate, one broadcaster provides play-by-play in English while a second offers a Spanish translation.
"It's so unique, so unusual and so smart," said Phil Roberts, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Broadcasters. "I'd be surprised if it's not adopted by Major League Baseball."
The bilingual broadcasts are a hit not only with with the players and their fans, but with advertisers and Spanish teachers, who are considering using the radio shows in their classrooms.
Vineland, at 69.5 square miles the state's largest municipality in terms of area and midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City, is a lush farming area that has long attracted Hispanic migrant workers, many of whom have stayed and established roots.
Today, more than one-third of Vineland High School students are Hispanic, a 13 percent increase since 1995, and almost 20 percent of all students have a parent who speaks Spanish at home, spokesmen for the school say. Moreover, they say, Hispanic pupils now outnumber Caucasian ones in the Vineland public schools by 41 percent to 39 percent. At Sacred Heart High School, 10 percent of the student body is Hispanic.
The numbers on the field are similar. On Vineland's varsity team, half of the 18 players are Hispanic, said the coach, Rich Klimek. On the Sacred Heart team, 5 of the 20 players and 2 of the 4 assistant coaches are bilingual, said Don Robbins, the Lions' coach.
"We have gotten to the point where we play salsa music when they run out on the field," Mr. Klimek said, noting the players speak Spanish during a game, sometimes confusing opponents.
The notion of offering bilingual broadcasts evolved while trying to appease WMIZ's program director, who objected to the Spanish station announcing games in English. As a result, WMIZ tried the bilingual format as an experiment.
"It became a hit so we kept it," said the station manager, Carl Hemple. "Sometimes you do things by accident, and they work out."
Mr. Roberts said that no other radio station in the state provides bilingual sports broadcasts. Indeed, he called the idea brilliant because the Spanish translation replaces the color man, who would ordinarily fill in dead time between plays with comments about the crowd, the weather and player statistics.
Interestingly, he said that the Spanish radio stations in the area have begun broadcasting commercials in English as they come to realize that many Hispanic people today use English as their first language.
Although second- and third-generation Hispanics may speak Spanish at home, they use English in school and at work. English commercials also reach listeners who tune in for the Spanish music but do not know a word of the language.
In addition, Mr. Roberts said, advertisers get more words for their buck because it is faster to say something in English than Spanish -- a one-minute English commercial translates to a 75-second commercial in Spanish.
The economics of the bilingual format is not lost on Mr. Hemple, the station manager, who noted that the station sells out ads on the broadcast of the games.
Local businesses target an audience of Spanish and English-speaking residents in the Vineland area. And WMIZ reaches about 4,000 listeners in the Vineland area in any given 15-minute period, Mr. Hemple said.
For Vic LaTorre, who owns LaTorre Hardware here, advertising on the bilingual broadcasts is a way of supporting youth baseball and reaching the local community at the same time.
"We're mainly trying to build image," said Mr. LaTorre, who has placed 60-second spots in Spanish and English. "It's difficult for a store of my type to sell any one product unless it's snowing and they want a snow shovel. We're just trying to target ourselves to the community."
WMIZ's concept was great in theory, but it could work well only with the right synergy between the two broadcasters -- particularly because under the current arrangement the man providing English play-by-play, Joe Habelow, the station's sports director, knows no Spanish. Mr. Habelow listens to a language he doesn't comprehend until he hears his name, the cue provided by his Spanish-speaking partner, Sony Lugo.
"When he says 'Joe,' I know I come on," Mr. Habelow said.
The harmony seems to stem from their friendly rivalry as Yankees and Red Sox fans. Mr. Habelow -- a Boston transplant who peppers his on-air remarks with references to Bill Buckner and Roger Clemens while dropping his R's faster than a Kennedy -- wore a Red Sox hat and shirt to a recent Lions game.
Mr. Lugo, a native of Puerto Rico, wears a Yankees hat and the smug grin of a fan of the repeat world champions.
Over all, the broadcasts feature more English, with Spanish summaries at the end of each half-inning. But exciting plays, pitching changes and controversial calls warrant an immediate Spanish translation.
Understandably, the broadcasts have stirred excitement among players and fans in the Hispanic community.
"They feel very proud," said Cruz Gomez, an assistant coach for Sacred Heart. "The Hispanics are feeling that now they're being welcomed in the town."
Baseball is big in Vineland, where last year the Roosters clinched the Cape-Atlantic League title and Sacred Heart's team won the state championship for the parochial B division.
Steven Gonzalez, for one, is pleased with the arrangement. Steven, a senior who pitches for Vineland High School, said his extended family -- some of whom speak Spanish and others English -- could listen to the games together.
And everyone who steps into his father's taxi can listen to the game on the radio.
"He's always in his car, so he's always listening," Steven said.
If a passenger asks, Steven's father, Robert Gonzalez, will discuss at length his son's playing ability. Indeed, some have already heard about the fourth-year varsity player.
The games are also popular among the other cab drivers who tune in when Steven pitches.
"We talk about it almost every day over there," said Mr. Gonzalez. "It makes me feel good that I can do my job and still listen to my son play ball."

Big Box Stores, Redefined

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
Fittingly, perhaps, Casket Discounters set up shop in a bedding store. The telephone number is (877) 7AT REST.
Still, Andrew B. Paer, the president of the company, says it was not a sense of the macabre that prompted him to locate a business that sells caskets next to a showroom for mattresses and box springs. 
 There is the exposure -- Westwood Sleep Centers is situated at 736 Route 17 North in a major shopping area. There is visibility -- his sign in the window of a simply furnished but dignified office adjacent to the bedding showroom can be seen from the highway. And the space was available, since he is also an owner of the sleep center.
Of course, there is what Mr. Paer calls "a natural fit." Comparing a coffin with a bed, he says, with a touch of wryness: "What really is it? It's a final resting place."
His business, which opened in February, is one of a growing number of retail casket depots that have been showing up in shopping centers, strip malls and downtowns around the country since 1994, when the Federal Trade Commission ruled that funeral directors could not refuse or charge an extra fee for caskets bought from someone other than the funeral director.
Estimates vary as to how many stores there are because several went out of business not long after opening, said Maynard Cheris, founder and former chairman of the National Casket Retailers Association, who owns a casket store in Gurnee, Ill. Mr. Cheris estimated that there were about 200 such stores nationwide.
In New Jersey, there are more than a half a dozen, said Charles Graves, the owner of Evan's Casket Store in Linden, who is a spokesman for these businesses in the state. The stores, besides those in Linden and Paramus, are situated in Clifton, Green Brook, Union, Voorhees and Woodbridge, Mr. Graves said.
"This is a business that's going to take time to grow on the public," said Mr. Graves, who is beginning his second year. "It's not like a candy store. People really don't realize the savings they can have."
So what has been the effect of the stores on the $10 billion-a-year funeral industry?
"They've shaken up the troops," said Lisa Carlson, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, a consumer watchdog group in Hinesburg, Vt.
Ms. Carlson added, "Once a funeral home is losing 10 percent of its casket business they tend to lower their casket price and jack up their service prices."
But Kelly Smith, a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association, said the retail casket businesses have had little effect.
"It comes to about six a state, which is not a significant number," said Mr. Smith. "They've been more successful in generating media attention than selling caskets."
As for Ms. Carlson's assertion that funeral homes have been reducing casket prices and raise the cost of other services, Mr. Smith said he would like to see the data to back that up. In addition, he said, casket stores are not regulated like funeral homes.
"Consumers eventually learn they can receive a much higher level of service and consumer protection at a funeral home," he said.
The industry has been under attack for years. Jessica Mitford"s 1963 book, "The American Way of Death," led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and the passage of stricter funeral rules in 1984 that required funeral directors to present an itemized list of charges, including casket cost.
In hearings earlier this month, the Senate Special Committee on Aging heard testimony about aggressive sales tactics, like the story of an 80-year old Florida woman who said she was talked into buying $125,000 in funeral items and services, including a $40,000 coffin.
Inflation in the industry has been running about 5 to 7 percent annually as against a general rate of about 2 percent, said Ms. Carlson of Funeral Consumers Alliance. The average cost of a funeral is $5,000 to $5,700, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. The cost including burial comes to $7,500.
But critics contend that funeral homes have historically inflated the price of coffins by 300 percent. Ms. Carlson said a cloth-covered particle board casket selling at $150 wholesale sells for as much as $995 in a funeral home but for only about $300 at a retail casket store.
For instance, Mr. Paer claims he can undersell undertakers on caskets from 50 to 75 percent because his overhead is low and because he is an independent agent. The L-shaped showroom adjacent to his office features 24 full-sized coffins -- the cheapest is a simple pine box that he sells for $399 and says would cost at least $1,000 in a funeral home; the most expensive is an Italian hand-carved solid mahogany casket for $12,000 that he claims would sell in a mortuary for $30,000 to $40,000.
"There is a need for this type of business," said Mr. Paer, who has a background in accounting and marketing and once worked in sales and marketing for a health and beauty care manufacturer.
Wilson H. Beebe, executive director of the New Jersey State Funeral Directors Association which represents 600 members, said he objected to the tone of Mr. Paer's advertisements.
"It's really pandering to prejudices which have created fears and a kind of mythology based on anecdotal information about the funeral industry that's been circulating for 30 years," Mr. Beebe said. He said Mr. Paer would be hard-pressed to demonstrate a 50 to 75 percent savings consistently. "People would be well-advised to check the price against local funeral homes because it may not be the case," he said.
One local funeral director, Tim Newman of the Riewerts Memorial Home in Bergenfield, said that within the last five years he has lowered his mark-up on caskets to the point that he makes only about $60 on lower-end and mid-level coffins.
Competition from casket stores is beneficial, Mr. Newman says, because it is making many funeral directors de-emphasize the coffin and accentuate service.
"It made us reassess our real purpose," Mr. Newman said. "Most of us that have some idea what's going on have affirmed that our value lies in being funeral directors and not casket sales people. They've actually done us a favor. Putting a very high mark-up on our caskets is not the way we should be going with people today."
As for Mr. Paer, sitting behind his sign facing Route 17, he said of his business after two months: "It's been an interesting process. I've been getting a lot of inquiries regarding the industry. I've been doing business delivering caskets and getting involved with monuments. But it's been basically a slow build."

HEADLINE: Deregulation Has Given Power to the Power People

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
WHEN New Yorkers last heard of William J. Catacosinos two years ago, he was being hounded from his job running the former Long Island Lighting Company after pocketing a $42 million paycheck that drew denunciations all the way to the governor's office.
Back then, the utility industry's prospects were cloudy as deregulation fever swept the states. And considering the wounds he took from Lilco -- whose rates, the highest in the continental United States, made him a favorite target of local politicians -- the circumstances hardly seemed inviting for Dr. Catacosinos to dive back into the business. 
 But he did. Weeks after resigning from his old job, he was in discussions that would lead to the first leveraged buyout of an electric utility. With CIBC World Markets and other investors, Dr. Catacosinos this month completed the $1.1 billion acquisition of TNP Enterprises Inc. of Fort Worth.
An act of masochism? Not a bit. The relatively low values that the market is assigning to utility stocks -- along with the favorable terms that the industry was able to negotiate as old-fashioned rate regulation faded -- have captured the attention not only of Dr. Catacosinos, but also of some of the nation's most prominent investors.
Last month, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts invested $550 million for a 20 percent stake in DPL Inc., the utility in Dayton, Ohio. And no less an investing icon than Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway recently spent $2 billion to acquire 76 percent of MidAmerican Energy Holdings of Des Moines. Mr. Buffett told shareholders Berkshire's future utility investments "could be large."
Such deal-making -- along with a surge in merger activity and asset-swapping by utilities -- shows how quickly fears have evaporated that deregulation could cause widespread financial trauma in the industry.
Just three years ago, the Energy Department predicted that deregulation could lead to numerous bankruptcies, with some utilities losing 30 percent or more of their revenue.
Stripped of their monopolies, industry executives grumbled, they would never recoup the money spent over the decades building generation plants -- including nuclear reactors -- to meet demand. Competition from newer, lower-cost power producers, they complained, would force old-line utilities to eat more than $100 billion of "stranded costs" -- money spent building generation plants that would be unable to pay for themselves under deregulation.
Instead, the industry appears to be holding its own. Rising prices for electricity in many parts of the nation have helped make existing plants more valuable than most anyone expected. Nonetheless, the utilities continue to enjoy ratepayer-financed bailouts for nuclear plants and other assets, based on a gloomy post-deregulation outlook.
Five years ago, Moody's Investors Service, the bond rating house, estimated the industry's stranded costs at $135 billion; it now puts the number at just $10 billion.
"It turns out there is a lot of value in power plants, more than anybody anticipated several years ago," said Ken Rose, senior institute economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute, in Columbus, Ohio. "I'm convinced that with a little creative accounting, you can show stranded costs for just about anybody."
The Energy Department, meanwhile, has turned its attention to much different concerns. Policy makers worry that the big power generation companies -- still facing little competition, despite regulation -- will be able to use their near-monopoly power in some parts of the nation to keep prices artificially high, even as the nation's transmission grid suffers from neglect.
Too little has been invested in the grid in recent years, according to Bill Richardson, the energy secretary. "Couple that with some of the market power advantages some of the utilities have, and not only do you have the potential for outages and strain on the grid, but also for artificially high prices," Mr. Richardson said. He advocates greater federal control over transmission lines.
THE industry's turnabout is vividly illustrated by Dr. Catacosinos's deal for TNP, which serves 233,000 small-town customers through its Texas-New Mexico Power Company unit.
Not long ago, TNP seemed an unlikely candidate to attract smart money. In 1995, its shares languished at $15 amid worries about the debt-laden utility's future under deregulation. In particular, analysts wondered how TNP's generating plant, built for $640 million and fueled by lignite, a soft coal, would fare against cheaper energy from other sources.
So what attracted Dr. Catacosinos and his investors? Partly the prospect of owning a utility that was focused primarily on transmission and distribution services. But they also had the promise of a 1999 Texas law that allowed TNP to collect $23.4 million last year in excess earnings -- beyond a state-mandated cap on profits -- to speed the recovery of its stranded costs, mostly from the lignite plant. TNP can collect similar sums in 2000 and 2001, after which it can impose a surcharge on customers to recoup the remainder of the plant's stranded cost.
The new law was clearly important to the Catacosinos group, which did not agree to the deal until the final week of the 1999 Texas legislative session, when it became clear that the bill would pass. Ultimately, the group paid $44 a share, a 26 percent premium over the stock price before the deal was proposed.
Dr. Catacosinos did not respond to an interview request, and his spokesman declined comment on the law.
ACROSS the nation, similar legislation has aided utilities. But even without such arrangements, utilities are finding buyers willing to pay surprisingly fat premiums for generation plants. Many deals have been at two to five times book value -- in this case, the amount invested but not yet recovered under the old rate-setting structure.
According to an April report by the Legg Mason brokerage firm, about 68,000 megawatts of fossil-fuel and hydropowered generation capacity -- roughly one-twelfth of the nation's total -- were sold by utilities from 1997 to 1999, for a total of $24.4 billion. Those plants had been carried on their owners' books at $10.3 billion.
Here in Texas, the TXU Corporation, based in Dallas and the state's largest utility, said recently that it expected to receive as much as 10 times book value for a half-dozen gas-fired power plants. In Pennsylvania, the Duquesne Light Company, the largest unit of DQE Inc., had expected to take until 2005 to recover $1.5 billion of stranded costs through a special customer charge. But a pending deal to sell its plants at a fat price to Orion Power Holdings should allow that process to be largely completed next year.
Most of these sales are of older, fossil-fuel plants -- not the nuclear units that, because of huge debt service, would have trouble paying for themselves if left to compete on an equal basis with cheaper plants.
But nuclear plants have begun to make a modest comeback, too. Some utilities -- notably Peco Energy, the Philadelphia-based utility that is merging with Unicom, and Entergy, based in New Orleans -- have become major acquirers of nuclear plants, figuring that they can operate them more efficiently.
Just last month, Entergy bought two nuclear plants owned by the New York Power Authority for about 70 percent of book value. At a deal-signing ceremony, Clarence D. Rappleyea, chief executive of the authority, said such a deal would have been unlikely until very recently.
"There was no market a year and a half ago," Mr. Rappleyea said.
Analysts caution that some favorable trends for the industry could reverse, prompting a decline in electricity prices. A slowdown in the economy, for example, could reduce demand for power. Or natural gas prices could fall, making it cheaper for upstart generation companies to compete. And electricity supply is growing as new generation plants are built. Although it is difficult to say how many plants will be completed, analysts think 50,000 megawatts or more could come on line in the next few years, increasing the nation's power generating capacity by about 6 percent.
Yet apart from economic circumstances, the industry still wields tremendous political power at the state level. About half of the states have already passed competition plans, but utility lobbyists focused on persuading legislators to allow utilities to recover their stranded costs. By and large, they won, despite howls from critics who likened the arrangements to the savings-and-loan bailouts of decades past.
In some states, utilities have done one better, getting cash up front for their stranded costs by selling bonds to be paid off through special surcharges on customers. The Edison Electric Institute, the industry trade group, says $26 billion in stranded costs has been securitized this way. That has allowed Peco, for instance, to retire debt and buy back stock, bolstering first-quarter earnings per share by about 15 percent.
OVER all, American utilities are on track to generate $92 billion in free cash flow from 1999 to 2001, even after dividends and stock buybacks, said Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in New York. "Obviously, if you have massive assets that you intend to recover over 30 years, then all of a sudden the recovery period is supposed to be 5 to 10 years, you can imagine how much more cash you're going to have," she said.
In the 1980's, state officials fought bruising battles with utilities over rate increases. In the stranded-cost debate, legislators often sided with utilities but found political cover by mandating rate cuts of 5 to 15 percent in deregulation bills.
Some consumer advocates contend that, because of the economics of the business, rates would have fallen that much even under the old rate-setting structure. But when customers' bills are not rising, it is difficult to stir the public, as anti-utility organizers in California learned in 1998 when their initiative to block payment of stranded costs to utilities lost by nearly 3 to 1.
"What the utilities have been getting is absolutely astounding to me," said Kenneth Lay, chairman of the Enron Corporation, the energy and trading company in Houston that has sought to challenge regional monopolies on their home turf. The company has battled utilities in statehouses and in Congress.
By Mr. Lay's estimate, ratepayers nationwide are paying up to 50 percent too much to cover stranded costs, a situation that he likens to paying off a mortgage early but still having to pay interest to the bank each month. But he marvels at the industry's power at the state level.
"That is one of their core competencies," he said. "That may be their only core competency."
Utilities take sharp issue with that assessment. State lawmakers, they say, have merely made good on promises from decades ago, when generation plants were built with the understanding that utilities could recoup all prudently incurred costs.
Industry officials are less certain that stranded-cost concerns are gone for good. "I wouldn't agree that stranded costs have been driven to zero yet," said Mathew Morey, chief economist of the Edison Electric Institute. He said some utilities were still bound by old contracts to buy power at relatively high prices, an arrangement that constitutes a different type of stranded cost.
But, he said, "there's no question that the market valuations of a lot of the coal-fired plants have really been a surprise, well above the expectations of a few years ago." If projected increases in generation capacity do not occur, he added, there could be more upward pressure on electricity prices.
Despite the avid interest of big investors like Dr. Catacosinos and Mr. Buffett, utility stocks still may not be dependable investments for widows and orphans.
The main historical factor in the stocks' safety and reliability -- the monopoly profit guaranteed through state regulation -- has faded. To survive in the new world of deregulation, utilities have been adopting vastly different strategies, so investors may need to be much more selective than in the past.
Some utilities have decided to buy existing coal or nuclear generation plants, or to build gas-fired plants, in an effort to become large, efficient generators. Others are getting out of the generation business altogether, figuring that they are too small to compete effectively; instead, they plan to buy power in the deregulated marketplace, then distribute it to homes and businesses.
Still others have gone on shopping binges overseas, gobbling up foreign utilities. And some have even prompted pops in their stock prices by highlighting telecommunications or Internet-related subsidiaries.
IF utility shareholders are certain about anything, it is that the stock market has not been kind to them lately. Last year, the Standard & Poor's Electric Utilities index lagged behind the S.& P. 500-stock index by 43 percentage points. This year has been brighter, as the pummeling of technology stocks has helped utilities pull ahead of broader indexes.
But relative to the S.& P. 500, utilities still have the lowest P/E ratios and highest dividend yields in memory. Prices, in other words, do not appear to reflect the industry's resuscitation, some analysts say.
"The worries about bankruptcies and balance sheets getting blown up from two to three to four years ago have not proven out," said Steven Fleishman, a utility analyst at Merrill Lynch. "If I would have known this is how things would have played out three or fours years ago, I would have never believed the stocks would be where they are today."
But if some old risks have dissipated, some new ones have appeared, Mr. Fleishman said. Many utilities may be unable to build strategies to lure back investors who have become infatuated with the fast growth potential of technology issues.
Moreover, as utilities have acquired huge piles of cash from selling assets and recovering stranded costs, they face all the risks that accompany the allocation of large amounts of capital. The industry's record so far is mixed. Some overseas acquisitions have proved untimely, and some domestic mergers have shown little promise for bolstering shareholder returns.
From the ratepayer's perspective, complaints abound that recovery of stranded costs has impeded competition in some areas. In certain cases, the hefty surcharges customers are paying -- regardless of who they now buy power from -- do not allow much room for competitors to undercut incumbent utilities.
SOME industry observers wonder whether the recovery amounts are so large that ratepayers may end up paying far more than is necessary -- even though many states have provisions to adjust stranded-cost recovery up or down if necessary.
At a recent meeting of consumer advocates from various states, Dr. Rose of the National Regulatory Research Institute said he noticed that a number of officials were sounding very defensive about their decisions on stranded costs.
Should the recoveries prove too generous, said Dr. Rose, whose group is the research arm for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, "the legislators, the commissioners, most of the people involved in the process are going to have a real hard time admitting they made a mistake."
In cases where utilities received their money up front by securitizing their stranded costs, Dr. Rose said, "the state's options are more limited if circumstances change."
"You can't take the money back once it's been doled out," he added.
Customers "may be paying for stranded costs that won't materialize in the future," he said, depending on the portion of stranded costs that were securitized.
Figuring stranded costs is as much art as science. In Mississippi, which has come late to the deregulation movement, regulators recently held hearings on the issue.
One big investor-owned generator, Entergy Mississippi, said it could have $90 million in stranded costs; the other, Mississippi Power, a unit of the Southern Company of Atlanta, did not release its estimate.
But Frank Spencer, an assistant attorney general in the state, argued that the utilities would each have $700 million to $800 million in what he called "stranded benefits" -- in other words, generation plants and other assets worth far more in a competitive market than what they are carried for on the companies' books. He contended that ratepayers might be entitled to share in such benefits.
Mr. Spencer's estimates, disputed by utilities, were based on studies of selling prices of comparable generation plants. "Utilities talk about how all these charges have to be passed on to customers," he said. But "this shows that there might be some costs consumers ought to receive the benefit of, some way."

Picture captions last Sunday with an article about the improved financial outlook of the utility industry after deregulation misstated the location of a Pennsylvania power plant that the Duquesne Light Company has agreed to sell to Orion Power Holdings. Though it is called the Cheswick plant, it is in Springdale, Pa.

Chart: "An Improved Outlook"
A few years ago, utilities had collectively amassed over $100 billion in debts from building power plants, particularly nuclear plants. This debt loomed as a major hurdle to deregulation as utilities sought to recover what were termed stranded costs. Now, much of those costs have been, or are being, erased. Here is how three utilities did it.
 
1995 STRANDED-COST ESTIMATE
 
DQE INC., Pittsburgh
$1.356 billion
 
WHAT HAPPENED
Traded its share in five power plants to another utility for three power plants. It then sold those plants plus four others for $1.71 billion.
 
OUTCOME
Costs will be mostly recovered by next year.
 
TNP ENTERPRISES, Fort Worth
$941 million
 
WHAT HAPPENED
A law allowed the company to keep earnings above a mandated cap on profits through next year. After that, the utility will be allowed to impose a surcharge.
 
OUTCOME
Cost estimated to be collected over 12 years.
 
SEMPRA ENERGY, San Diego
$1.168 billion
 
WHAT HAPPENED
Sold two generation plants and 17 combustion-turbine generators for $466 million. The rest of the costs were recovered through customer charges.
 
OUTCOME
Costs were mostly recovered by last year.

HEADLINE: When Rent Becomes the Show Stopper;
Arts groups, with specialized space demands, are being squeezed by real estate costs

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
THE Trisha Brown Dance Company usually tours Europe for six weeks each fall before returning to New York, but this year it will spend three months there, then head to Salt Lake City for two weeks. While the troupe is pleased about the lengthened tour, its schedule owes as much to real estate concerns as to artistic considerations.
"The reason we'll be away so long is that our lease expires at the end of September," said LaRue Allen, the group's executive director, "and this way we'll have more time to look for another place." 
 Ms. Allen has already been searching for more than a year, she said, but "either it's impossible to find the space we need or the rent is out of sight."
In its present location, on the fourth floor at 211 West 61st Street, the dance company pays $16 a square foot for 8,000 square feet, an annual rent of $128,000, It pays nothing for an additional 2,000 square feet in the basement. "But those days are over," Ms. Allen said, adding that rents for many of the other spaces she has looked at have ranged up to $45 a square foot.
Clara Miller, the president of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which makes loans to cultural and community organizations, said: "One of the ironies is that when times are good, real estate prices rise, and lots of groups can't afford them. A lot of groups come in to see us in a panic."
And times have been good indeed in New York during the last few years, with the booming economy fueling demand -- and raising rents -- for office and retail space. At the same time, there has been a proliferation of performance groups, all of which need not only stages but also office and rehearsal space. For rehearsals, not any old space will do: dancers need to be able to practice without having to dodge columns, actors need enough space to enter from the wings without immediately finding themselves center stage. And when the rehearsal spaces double as performance spaces, as is not infrequent with smaller performance groups, both need ceilings high enough to accommodate stage sets and lighting.
"In 1990, New York City had 150 theater members; today, there are nearly 350," said Virginia P. Louloudes, executive director of the Alliance of Resident Theaters/ New York (widely known as A.R.T./New York), whose members include the Lincoln Center Theater, the Roundabout Theater Company and the New York Theater Workshop.
One result, Ms. Louloudes said, is that "while the nonprofit companies are continuing to grow, the funding community can't keep up."
Lee Allen, the owner of Arc Advisors Inc., a commercial real estate company that works exclusively with nonprofit groups, said: "It hasn't been anywhere near this bleak since the mid-80's. Space is tight everywhere, but in Manhattan it's virtual gridlock unless you're willing to pay almost twice what a place is worth."
Even then, the race belongs to the swift, as Robert LuPone, a founder of the Manhattan Class Company theater group in Chelsea, found out when he starting looking for a space bigger than the current 99-seat theater. "I went to our board to tell them about a 30,000-square-foot building that was up for sale for $8 million," he said, adding that although he thought the price excessive, there was nothing else available. "But before we could decide anything," he said, "somebody else bought it."
John Denham of Denham Wolf Real Estate Services said that when he told a nonprofit company about a space that was overpriced but otherwise suitable, "that same day the landlord got so many offers he raised the rent 10 percent."
Paul Wolf, the other partner in the firm, said: "Three years ago you might be able to find free space with another nonprofit. Two years ago it was, 'Where can I find cheap space?' This year it's 'Where can I find space?' "
For a growing number of performers, the answer, increasingly, is nowhere. Which is why some real estate people, Mr. Allen of Arc Advisors included, are telling groups thinking of moving because they need need extra space, rather than because their lease is about to expire, to stay put in hopes that rents will sooner or later stop skyrocketing.
Paradoxically, although many artists live most of their professional lives with uncertainty, uncertainty about real estate seems to create even more anguish. "I never thought when I chose dance as my profession that I'd be inextricably linked to real estate," Ms. Allen of the Trisha Brown troupe said with a resigned laugh.
The space that the Trisha Brown Dance Company must vacate in September (to make room for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which exercised its option for the space) is that rare combination of three rehearsal studios, dressing rooms, offices and storage space.
The shortage is as acute for well-known dance groups like Alvin Ailey and Paul Taylor as it is for well-known theater groups like Primary Stages.
The Paul Taylor Dance Company, whose lease for a rehearsal studio above a Banana Republic in SoHo doesn't expire for two years, is already actively looking, just in case.
"The work of this dance company has been centered in Manhattan for 45 years," said Ross Kramberg, the Taylor troupe's executive director. "But when it comes time to renew, we know we'll face a doubling of our rent. And knowing that four other major dance companies are looking around and expecting rents to at least double, we have to look at all available alternatives, even if it means having to vacate the neighborhood where Paul Taylor has been a fixture for more than 25 years."
THE lease for Poets House, 2,100 usable square feet on the second floor of an office building at 72 Spring Street in SoHo, expires at the end of this year, but it, too, is looking for more space. In addition to housing 35,000 volumes of poetry, "we need space to nurture poets," said Lee Briccetti, its executive director, "poets who come in to write, read the books, attend readings and workshops on writing and publishing poetry." The current space, she said, would ideally be devoted solely to the library and public programs, while administrative offices and classrooms would relocate nearby, perhaps within the same building.
While the most acute real estate challenge is to find office and rehearsal space, performance sites are also in short supply, arts administrators say, although it has usually been possible to avert a crisis by staggering performance schedules and through other creative juggling.
The space picture for nonprofit groups is not entirely bleak. In Times Square, where a 10-story building at 229 West 42nd Street is well along toward completion, there will be three floors of offices for nonprofit groups as well as 14 rehearsal studios and what will be called the Duke on 42nd Street, a 199-seat experimental theater, available to theater, dance, music and other performance groups.
"We hope to open in June, and when we do, rents for nonprofits will be subsidized," said Cora Cahan, the president of New 42nd Street, the agency created in 1990 by the state and city to oversee seven of the nine theaters on 42nd Street in Times Square.
Preliminary plans have also been announced for the Women's Interart Center to create rehearsal studios and a cultural center complex in the renovated 10-story building it currently occupies at 549 West 52nd Street, as well as to add an eight-story addition.
Perhaps one of the most creative approaches to financing was the Roundabout Theater Company's recent deal with American Airlines. The airline will pay $8.5 million over 10 years to have the refurbished 740-seat theater at 227 West 42nd Street, formerly the Selwyn, renamed the American Airlines Theater.
Dancers are probably the most peripatetic artists. "Dance has always been a homeless art form," said David R. White, the executive director of the Dance Theater Workshop, at 219 West 19th Street. But his group is one of the lucky ones. Construction will start this fall on a new building for the workshop, which sold its air rights to developers for more than $3.2 million.
That gave it enough money to build a new home at its present location. The new building will be 25,000 square feet, compared with the current 7,500 square feet, the seating capacity in the theater will double to 200, and there will be two studios instead of one.
The real estate problem confronting performance groups is not confined to Midtown or Lower Manhattan. In Harlem, about 30 nonprofit groups associated with the Harlem Foundation for Arts and Culture have had to beg for space in church basements, school lobbies, conference rooms or simply outdoors.
"Everybody here has the same problem," said Joseph L. Persons, the foundation's founder and executive director. "Either there are no spaces to rent or rents are too high." That is why the Harlem Summer Arts Festival in July will again be held in whatever makeshift spaces the dancers, musicians, actors and writers can beg, borrow or scare up.
The scarcity of space often means that groups move from one temporary home to another. The Frank Silvera Writers Workshop, founded by Morgan Freeman and Garland Lee Thompson almost 25 years ago, has had five addresses in the last three years, including temporary quarters in the Harlem office of the borough president.
"You can't schedule weekly readings or workshops if you don't have the space," Mr. Thompson said, "and square footage on 125th Street has gone through the roof. It's the worst time we've seen."
THE Jewish Theater of New York is also having problems. After performing three years on Theater Row on West 42nd Street, it was forced to vacate last month to make way for wrecking crews knocking down four of the eight small theaters. They will be replaced by four 99-seat stages, a 199-seat theater and a 499-seat theater jointly owned by the Shubert Organization and an apartment building.
Although the plan is for the nonprofit theaters to return, "talk is cheap, so whether we'll ever get back in there, we just don't know," said Tuvia Tenenbom, the Jewish Theater's artistic director. Meanwhile, as Mr. Tenenbom works on an stage adaptation of the diary that Adolf Eichmann wrote in an Israeli jail, he has taken temporary office space in the Financial District on Greenwich Street, just above the Pussycat Lounge. "For a group that does cultural things," Mr. Tenenbom said, "it's very embarrassing."
To cope with the shortage of space, many Manhattan groups say they are looking for space in Brooklyn and the Bronx. Nineteen small performance groups, including 12 from Manhattan, have signed leases for space in a 19,200-square-foot building in Fort Greene, not far from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Purchased for $1.25 million by A.R.T./New York, the five-story building has three rehearsal studios, an auditorium and office equipment, all for a rock-bottom yearly rent of $12 a square foot, including utilities, less than half the lowest rent of $30 a square foot in Manhattan.
The veteran Mark Morris Dance Group plans to move from offices in SoHo to a dance center in Brooklyn after it rebuilds the three-floor abandoned hotel that it bought across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Scheduled to open in October, the dance center will be rented to other performing arts groups.
But not even desperation is always enough to lure groups from one borough to another. "I could go to Hunts Point in the Bronx," said Mr. LuPone of the Manhattan Class Company, "but we wouldn't have much of an audience."
For smaller companies especially, moving from one borough to another, even one neighborhood to another, is not just a matter of moving a few blocks, or crossing a river. Unlike the big-name theaters with big-name actors that attract tourists, smaller companies tend to attract audiences top-heavy with people from nearby neighborhoods.
But many of those same people are wary about venturing into unfamiliar places, and doubly hesitant about going to neighborhoods where transportation is spotty.
E VEN Ms. Louloudes of A.R.T./New York, who conceived the project in Fort Greene, acknowledged the problem that performers, interns and volunteers face in keeping nonprofit groups afloat. 'If you don't have roots in Brooklyn," she said, "you don't wake up one day and say, 'Hey, I want to live in Brooklyn.' "
But if the "build it and they will come" spirit has not caught on with audiences when it means traveling far afield, it has a long history in Manhattan. Performance groups doubled as pioneers, venturing into Greenwich Village, Chelsea, SoHo and many other once-marginal areas because it was all they could afford.
"When we took over the WPA Theater in 1976, it was on the Bowery, and we moved it to a loft on lower Fifth Avenue in 1977, which people may find hard to believe was a no man's land back then," said Kyle Renick, the artistic director. "When people heard that, they warned us we'd never get an audience. But within a few years it was gentrified into one of the hottest areas in Manhattan."
When the building was sold, Mr. Renick moved to Chelsea, to West 23rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. "I got warnings again," Mr. Renick said, "things like 'Nobody will go there' and 'That's not Manhattan -- it's so far west it's in New Jersey.' But now it's like Gallery City."
Now the WPA Theater is facing another move because its building has been sold, and Mr. Renick is again beating the bushes for space. "In the 70's," he said, "I would have said to anybody interested in the performing arts, 'Learn p.r.' Since the 80's I would have told them, 'Learn real estate.' "
Some people were told as much and followed that advice. "When I first started in the theater in New York," said Casey Childs, the artistic director of Primary Stages, which has been presenting new plays by American playwrights since 1983, "someone told me: 'You have to learn real estate. You have to have a home if you don't want to find yourself in a perpetual floating crap game.' "
Ever since, Mr. Childs made sure that real estate people were on his board. So it is probably no coincidence that Primary Stages, with a building on West 45th Street with two small theaters and rehearsal space, appears close to buying another building on West 42nd Street, where it will have two 150-seat theaters.
The Joyce Theater is also in the anomalous position of owning real estate, yet still being short of space. The Joyce owns not only the 472-seat Art Deco theater on Eighth Avenue and 19th Street, a building it bought in 1977, but also what is now the 75-seat Joyce SoHo at 155 Mercer Street, which it bought in 1996. "Now we're looking for another building," said Linda Shelton, its executive director, "because even with three studios in Joyce SoHo, we can't fill the demand for rehearsal space."
The All Stars Project, a nonprofit theatrical production company that performs in the 71-seat Castillo Theater at 500 Greenwich Street and puts on 125 events a year in poor neighborhoods, rents a 9,000-square-foot loft in SoHo. It has raised $3 million of its $10 million goal for buying and renovating a building.
"We've been looking because we finally have the means to buy now," said Gabrielle Kurlander, the president of the All Stars. "But it's been very hard going because we'd like at least 25,000 square feet and between 199 and 250 seats. There isn't much available in our price range or with those specifications."
FOR every performance group in New York that finds itself without space or without enough space, there are any number that have never had rehearsal space nor even an office. These peripatetic artists include the Susan Marshall Dance Company and Yoshiko Chuma's aptly named School of Hard Knocks, both of which have been in New York for the better part of 20 years.
"We've had to scramble," Ms. Marshall said, "rehearsing one week here, one week there. But we never tried to get permanent space, because the overhead would have been too costly. We're strictly on an hourly basis."
The same is true for Ms. Chuma, who said that during her years in Manhattan, rental space has risen from $10 an hour to $15 to $25, and even then, it's often a scramble to book it when you want it.
To pay the bills, "we travel a lot," said Ms. Chuma, whose troupe has performed for paying audiences as far afield as Estonia. What's more, she was recently appointed artistic director of the Daghdha Dance Company in Limerick, Ireland, which, to her delight, has rehearsal space and will soon have a theater.
For all the hardship, both women say they wouldn't trade their profession for anything, and they would even have to think hard about trading their nomadic existence for one more stable.
"The Ping-Ponging between spaces isn't a lot of fun, but it does have its upside," Ms. Marshall said. "You don't have to go to work in the same place every day, so there aren't a lot of ghosts hanging around.
"Besides, we actually have two spaces all our own -- Manhattan Mini-Storage and a long-term storage place in Queens."
