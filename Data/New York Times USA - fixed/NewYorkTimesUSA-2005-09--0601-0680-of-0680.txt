HEADLINE: Something Like Happiness

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:

Directed by Bohdan Slama
6 p.m. Thursday, 3:30 p.m. Saturday; Alice Tully Hall
 The restless, hard-drinking characters in Bohdan Slama's drama ''Something Like Happiness'' live in a grubby housing development in a small, ugly industrial city in the Czech Republic. Because many still occupy the apartment building where they grew up together, these longtime neighbors enjoy the communal intimacy of an extended family. Many work in the same factory, which offers steady, dull, low-wage employment.
 The film's two main characters, Tonik (Pavel Liska) and Monika (Tatiana Vilhelmova), are decent, good-hearted people who have known each other since childhood. Tonik, a sensitive sad sack, ekes out a living as a mechanic, carpenter and plasterer. Monika has a boyfriend who, as the movie begins, leaves for the United States, where he has been offered a job. But once he is there, will he send for her? And if he does, will she have the courage to tear herself away from a life that is far from perfect but familiar with many deep ties? 
 Upstairs in the same building lives Dasha (Anna Geislerova), a distraught young mother of two unruly children, whose husband, Jara (Marek Daniel), is driving her crazy with his infidelities. When Dasha is hospitalized for depression, Tonik and Monika step in as surrogate parents. 
 ''Something Like Happiness'' might be described as a Czech slice of life from a society where economic hardship necessitates a communal closeness that reflects the lingering legacy of Communism. If these characters often go out of their way to help each other, they also share a common despair born of limited expectations. Monika, whom Tonik has loved unrequitedly since childhood, is torn between the dream of escape and staying to accept Tonik's devotion and reliability. 
 ''Something Like Happiness'' is well acted, but its storytelling is as rough-hewn as its characters, who chafe at each other while pulling together to create a livable existence in a joyless environment. STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
STRIKE 2 -- After the second hurricane in less than a month ravaged the Gulf Coast, the markets will be scrutinizing two speeches by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspeen, this week for signs he might be softening his monetary stance. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point last week, despite the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Katrina, and signaled there would be more increases to come in its bid to nip inflation. But the trail of destruction over the weekend -- and the prospect of more big storms -- are leading some analysts to wonder whether the Fed may pause its credit-tightening campaign. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to speak to the American Bankers Association's annual convention today and, via satellite, to the National Association for Business Economics tomorrow.

 HARD NUMBERS -- With Hurricane Rita on everyone's mind, investors will also be looking at hard numbers coming out this week to gauge the resiliency of the economy. The Conference Board will release its latest consumer confidence index tomorrow. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will report August durable-goods orders, which unexpectedly dipped sharply in July, and on Friday, the government will release figures for personal income and spending, jobless claims and third-quarter gross domestic product growth.

 HOT HOUSING MARKET -- The report on existing home sales in August, due out today from the National Association of Realtors, is expected to show continuing strength in the market. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for sales to run at an annual rate of 7.12 million, off a bit from 7.16 million in July. Figures on new home sales are due out tomorrow.

 TRADE TIFF ROUND 3 -- China and the United States will hold trade talks in Washington today and tomorrow, seeking a deal to set a three-year limit on Chinese textile exports to this country. Earlier this month, American textile producers asked the Bush administration to prolong emergency restrictions on imported clothing until a broad agreement was achieved. The two sides have met twice before but failed to come to an accord.

 END OF AN EXPERIMENT -- General Motors, which in June became the first automaker to offer employee-pricing discounts to the public, will end the program on Friday. Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which followed suit, have extended their incentives until Oct. 3. ... In a light week for earnings reports, Walgreen will announce results today and PepsiCo on Thursday. ... The government will unveil the new $10 bill at Ellis Island on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: New Sun Software to Work With Microsoft

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems is hoping to steal market share from the Microsoft Corporation with the release on Tuesday of a new version of its business software collection, StarOffice, with improved compatibility with Microsoft Office.
 StarOffice 8, which includes a spreadsheet, word processor, database and presentation software, allows users to import and export Microsoft Office files and to use Office macros, the tiny chunks of code that automate specific tasks.
Improving StarOffice's ability to work with Microsoft software is considered critical to expanding Sun's reach within companies that already use Microsoft products. 
 The release, which is the first upgrade to StarOffice in about two years, comes 18 months after the two companies announced a development partnership as well as an agreement not to sue each other over patent disputes. But Sun executives said most of the new compatibility features were in development at the request of some of Sun's largest customers even before Sun reached an accord with Microsoft.
 The retail price of StarOffice 8 is $99.95, though the program can be downloaded for $69.95. For corporate customers, Sun offers a per-user price of $35. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is also expanding StarOffice's sales through retailers. 
 StarOffice is the first commercial suite to support the OpenDocument format, an increasingly popular open-source approach to sharing files among computers, which is not supported by Microsoft. The format is being adopted by governments and other agencies attracted to the lower costs and independence of open-source programs. 
 Massachusetts, for example, announced last week that its state offices would use only those software programs that conform to OpenDocument, which was developed by the open-source standards body known as Oasis. That decision essentially locks out Microsoft, whose Office program stores files in so-called XML and other formats. 
 Massachusetts officials said the state government there would save millions of dollars by using only OpenDocument programs, in large part because those programs tend to cost less and are compatible with a range of inexpensive open-source programs. Officials there also said they felt it was critical they remain ''sovereign'' rather than be locked into a specific company. Several European governments are also considering mandating the use of programs based on OpenDocument.

HEADLINE: Phantom Constituents in the Census

 BODY:
A longstanding quirk in census rules counts incarcerated people as ''residents'' of the prisons where most are held for only a short time, instead of counting them in the towns and cities where they actually live. This practice was scarcely noticeable 30 years ago, when the prison population was insignificant. But with 1.4 million people in prison today, this padding of electoral districts' population figures shifts political power from the densely populated urban areas where most inmates live to the less populated rural districts where prisons are often built. 
 In 48 of 50 states the inmates cannot vote anyway. But they still count as constituents when state legislators sit down to draw up legislative districts. This bogus inflation gives prison districts undeserved strength in the state legislature and more influence than they would otherwise have in state affairs. Indeed, many legislative districts actually contain far too few people to be legal districts at all when the nonvoting inmates are subtracted. In some places, the phantom constituents account for more than 20 percent of the population count.
 This arrangement has an unfortunate resemblance to early America under slavery, when slaves were barred from the polls but counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportioning representation in Congress. In addition, legislators from the rural prison counties often use this purloined power to vote against the interests of the urban communities from which prison inmates most typically come. By counting impoverished inmates as citizens, the prison counties also reap more than a fair share of federal dollars that are earmarked for the poor. 
 Several experts, including a former director of the census, have suggested that the bureau count inmates at their preprison residences. A panel reviewing residency issues in general has heard compelling testimony that should drive it to the same conclusion. And instead of waiting until the next census in 2010, the Census Bureau should simply change its procedures now. Counting inmates where they live would cure what has clearly become a troubling flaw in the census process.

HEADLINE: Confronting Racial Inequality, Here and Abroad 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''French Lesson: Taunts on Race Can Boomerang'' (Letter From Europe, news article, Sept. 21) describes how the French press, critical of the racism and poverty in America highlighted by Hurricane Katrina, is now acknowledging similar problems at home. Recent apartment fires have disproportionately harmed blacks and Arabs, many of whom live in Paris's poorest neighborhoods.
But there is one notable difference between the two cases. 
 In France, most of those affected have been immigrants, who often enter on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. 
 The poor in New Orleans are primarily full-fledged United States citizens, not migrants or refugees. 
 We must ask why so much disparity exists among those born and raised as fellow Americans.

HEADLINE: At Google, The Workers Are Placing Their Bets 

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Like all search engines, Google helps people sort through information from the past. But a new service, being used inside the company, tries to forecast the future.
 Google has created a predictive market system, basically a way for its employees to bet on the likelihood of possible events. Such markets have long been used to predict world events, like election results. Intrade, part of the Trade Exchange Network, allows people to bet on elections, stock market indexes and even the weather, for example. 
In Google's system, employees can bet on how the company will perform in the future, forecasting things like product introduction dates and new office openings. It was devised under a program that allows engineers to spend one day a week on a project of their choice. 
 To help develop the system, Google consulted Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Varian (who also writes the Economic Scene column for The New York Times) said that the final product was not entirely what he anticipated.
 ''I was a little surprised,'' Professor Varian said. ''I expected this to be accurate because there's a lot of literature and experience with these systems. But this has been even better than I expected.''
 Google has not offered precise data on the system's accuracy, but a chart posted on the company's blog last week showed that, in the words of its accompanying entry, prices set for events through employees' wagering were a ''pretty close'' indication of the probability of events.
 The market is based on the idea that a price established for an event will reflect bettors' consensus of the likelihood that it will happen. Thus, something priced at 20 cents should happen 20 percent of the time. The system accepts bets in 10-cent increments up to a dollar (no actual money is involved). 
 On its blog, Google compares the market to its search engine software. ''Our search engine works well because it aggregates information dispersed across the Web, and our internal predictive markets are based on the same principle: Googlers from across the company contribute knowledge and opinions which are aggregated into a forecast by the market,'' the blog said.
 Professor Varian, who has consulted with Google on other projects, attributes the higher-than-expected levels of accuracy to the large number of employees participating. In general, the higher the number of bettors in such systems, the better the predictions.
 There is one issue, however, for which Google's market offers no prediction. ''It's a fun thing,'' said Professor Varian. ''Now one of the things we're thinking about is what to do with it.''

HEADLINE: Machinists Reach Tentative Accord With Boeing 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Boeing has reached a tentative agreement with its machinists' union, whose more than 18,000 members have been on strike for 24 days. A ratification vote is scheduled for Thursday, and the strikers are not scheduled to return to work before then.
 The strike has stopped almost all production at Boeing, the nation's largest commercial airplane manufacturer. The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, posted details of the settlement on its Web site, boasting, ''No takeaways, no sellouts,'' and saying the deal gave it much of what it was seeking. 
There would be no increase in premiums or deductibles in the workers' health plan, as Boeing had sought. Boeing also dropped its insistence that newly hired workers would no longer qualify for retiree health benefits. 
 In addition, Boeing agreed to increase its pension multiplier to $70 a month for every year worked, up from its previous offer of $66 a month. The union had originally demanded $80 a month, but recently indicated that it would settle for $70. That would mean a $10-a-month increase from the last contract, identical to the increases in its previous two contracts with Boeing.
 To help pay for these measures, the machinists agreed to a major concession: no wage increases during the three-year agreement. Boeing had proposed raises of 2.5 percent over three years as well as $6,000 in cash payments.
 Charles Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, said: ''It's a reasonable settlement that reflects compromise on both sides. It's an improved offer with economics that support our competitiveness.''
 Under the settlement Boeing would make cash payments to each worker totaling $10,800 -- $4,800 in the first year and $3,000 in each of the last two years. The workers would also receive a 1 percent annual cost of living increase.
 More than 16,000 strikers are in the Seattle area, with 1,000 in Gresham, Ore., and 900 in Wichita, Kan. Their average base pay is $59,000 a year.
 Boeing had proposed that the Wichita workers receive lower pay than the other workers, but that proposal was dropped from the tentative contract, the union said.
 Union and company officials said the agreement was reached late Friday night in Washington, with the help of Richard Gephardt, the long-time Democratic leader in the House, who was hired by Boeing to help mediate. Friday's talks included Alan R. Mulally, chief executive of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, and the machinists' president, R. Thomas Buffenbarger.
 Analysts had voiced concern that the dispute could last months and hurt Boeing's competitiveness.

HEADLINE: Rage and Ruin In Town Jarred By Rita's Punch

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN and MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: HOUMA, La., Sept. 25 

 BODY:
When Michael and Haley Rich evacuated their mobile home along Bayou Grand Caillou ahead of Hurricane Rita, they left by car. On Sunday, they returned by boat.
 The front porch had floated away. A scared kitten mewled on the raised doorstep, while a Labrador retriever sat mute on its doghouse in the flooded backyard. 
 ''Oh, Lord, it stinks,'' Sam Roblind, a brother-in-law, said as he entered the front door to find soft spots and buckled tile in the floor, a leaky roof and ants scurrying for dry ground. ''I'm not sure they'll get that smell out of the furniture.''
 Water began to retreat in the submerged low-lying bayou country of South Louisiana on Sunday, but anger welled as residents and officials of Terrebonne Parish, which includes Houma, began to survey the storm-surge damage. This is one place where Hurricane Rita was the worst recent storm; Hurricane Katrina brought only minimal wind damage to the area. 
 As Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco toured the area and called for $20.2 billion in federal money to strengthen the levee and pumping systems along the state's inundated coastal region, she found herself preaching to a sympathetic, if waterlogged, congregation. 
 For years, state residents and politicians have criticized what they believe is the federal government's indifference to the erosion of Louisiana's marshland and barrier islands that has lessened the state's buffer against major storms.
 The economy of this parish of 110,000, about 50 miles southwest of New Orleans, is driven by the fishing and oil industries. 
 The shrimpers and oyster fishermen have endured numerous hurricanes and floods. But to a person, those here said they had never seen a nine-foot tidal surge like the one that Hurricane Rita shoved into the canals and five prominent bayous of Terrebonne Parish. 
 ''People clean up after themselves here, so floods don't get a lot of attention,'' Iris Billiot, the sister of Ms. Rich, said as she stood along Highway 57, just beyond the pond of a front yard. ''But we need help.''
 Frustration seemed to spark like downed electrical wires in the bayou communities just south of here. Emergency management and law enforcement officials complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to declare the parish a disaster area. 
 ''FEMA? Who?'' Jerry J. Larpenter, the sheriff of Terrebonne Parish, said dismissively, echoing the complaints of many officials elsewhere after Hurricane Katrina.
 Michael Deroche, the parish's emergency management director, said he needed help from the agency to remove the 426 evacuees from Hurricane Katrina still housed in the local civic center. The center is now needed to shelter 916 evacuees from Hurricane Rita who are sleeping at two local schools and a recreation center, Mr. Deroche said.
 Sheriff Larpenter also expressed his impatience with other parish officials, who did not issue a mandatory evacuation for the 20,000 residents in the lower part of Terrebonne Parish. No deaths were reported and 3,500 residents were rescued, the sheriff said, but the toll in lives could have been significant if the hurricane had hit the parish directly. 
 ''When you have a Category 5 hurricane, the only word should be 'mandatory,''' Sheriff Larpenter said.
 Along Highway 57, which runs 25 miles from here to the Gulf of Mexico, floodwater that covered the road on Saturday had receded about eight miles. National Guard troops from Arkansas moved roadblocks southward as the water retreated. But water still stood several feet in yards on both sides of the highway as residents began to return to their homes.
 John LeBouef, 43, a carpenter, had his mobile home on stilts, but he lost a truck and some tools. His neighbor, Heath Monroe, 31, had his camper swamped.
 ''Two snakes came swimming out,'' Mr. Monroe, also a carpenter, said in a tone that suggested this was no more of an annoyance than mosquitoes. ''I'm used to gators in the backyard.''
 The two neighbors paddled about in pirogues, Cajun canoes, and spoke of seeing deer on a nearby levee and a couple of redfish, a saltwater variety pushed up from the gulf, swimming through the front yard.
 ''That's barbecue material,'' Mr. Monroe said.
 Cajuns here have burrowed into the bayous like mudbugs, and are famously independent and self-sufficient. Still, they appear to have grown weary of these watery confrontations with nature. The levees in Terrebonne Parish are earthen barriers designed for storm drainage, not for hurricane protection.
 Shrimpers, already facing depressed prices, said many processing plants were underwater. Oystermen feared that silt stirred by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would smother the mollusks in their reefs and set the industry back two to five years.
 ''It's that old saying, 'You can pay me now or pay me later,''' Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat who represents much of the flooded area of southeast Louisiana, said of the federal government and Louisiana's request for strengthened levees. ''If they had given us the $14 billion we were asking for before Katrina, we wouldn't need $200 or $300 billion to clean up now.''
 Up and down Highway 57, mobile homes and clapboard houses sat in or just above the storm surge, while flowerbeds drowned under opaque water that stood waist deep. Children played in the water by the roadside. Men sat on porches, waded or rowed between the road and their homes. Near the Intracoastal Waterway, which had overflowed its banks, Louis Phillips stood on the road with a rolling suitcase, waiting for a ride.
 ''We've been having this problem for the longest time, and it took something like this Katrina to hit New Orleans'' to bring national attention to the erosion of the Louisiana coastline, Mr. Phillips, 24, said.
 Even before he re-entered his mobile home, Mr. Rich, 24, the assistant manager of an auto parts store, said he would seek higher ground somewhere in the area. He had just spent $3,000 rebuilding the engine of his car, whose front bumper was sheered away by Hurricane Rita, the grill stuffed with marsh grass.
 ''We don't plan on living around here after this,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A 'Main Event' in Old New York

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It is called a trading book. In meticulous, spidery notations, it reveals just how the sloop Rhode Island, owned by Philip Livingston & Sons, New York merchants, traded rum, tobacco and cheese for guns, cloth and ivory in 1749. 
 Then, along the African coast, it traded those goods for 124 slaves.
The ledger is but one of more than 400 artifacts, documents, paintings and maps in a forthcoming exhibition on slavery at the New-York Historical Society that detail the vital connections between New York and the system of slavery that was an economic engine of the Americas for more than three centuries. 
 ''We all grew up with images of 'Gone With the Wind' and we thought slavery was a Southern institution, but for 200 years slavery was a dominant force in New York,'' said Richard Rabinowitz, the show's curator.
 The $5 million exhibition, ''Slavery in New York,'' will open to the public on Oct. 7. Its story begins in the 1620's and ends on July 5, 1827, when black New Yorkers celebrated emancipation in their state. Late next year, a sequel exhibition, ''Commerce and Conscience,'' will extend the chronicle past the Civil War.
 The show is a potentially controversial one for the society, a 201-year-old institution that has stirred debate since it was re-energized by two wealthy, conservative businessmen, Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman, the forces behind an Alexander Hamilton exhibition that earned mixed reviews from historians last year.
 ''Many people, blacks as well as whites, have some trouble having the story of slavery told in a major public venue,'' said James Oliver Horton, the Benjamin Banneker Professor of American Studies and History at George Washington University, who is the exhibition's chief historian. ''But we do not have the right not to tell the story.''
 Spanning 9,000 square feet in 10 galleries, ''Slavery'' will be half again as large as the Hamilton show. Since the topic ''is difficult and sensitive, we must be impeccable historically,'' said Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society's president. 
 And so in Gallery 2 there is an original letter from the Dutch West India Company to Peter Stuyvesant authorizing him to sell slaves; he hoped New Amsterdam could be the busiest slave market in North America. 
 New York's busy economy of importing, shipbuilding, borrowing, lending and insuring was based on a far-flung slave-labor force. Slave ships were good investments, Dr. Horton said, and slaves were owners' annuities -- property that could be rented out as a source of income for years. Even newspapers were complicit, making money from ads about auctions and runaways. ''Slavery was not a sideshow,'' Dr. Horton said. ''It was the main event.'' 
 But the exhibition also highlights overt and covert slave resistance, including coroner records of a 1712 revolt in which 9 whites were killed by 38 slaves. 
 A key curatorial challenge was that much of the historical evidence speaks solely in the voice of the enslavers, said Dr. Rabinowitz, president of American History Workshop in Brooklyn, an exhibition planning firm. But slaveholders revealed much unintentionally, as in ''runaway ads saying such things as 'there are whip marks on his back, but he loves me,''' Dr. Rabinowitz said. 
 In addition to offering interactive visual presentations about slavery, the exhibition tries to portray the experience of being enslaved -- through, for example, the saga of the 20-year-old Deborah Squash, who escaped the employ of George Washington, fleeing to freedom behind British lines. 
 Last fall's Hamilton show, though trumpeted as a blockbuster, drew smaller crowds than expected and was derided by some historians as a glorification of Hamilton revealing a new conservative bent at the society.
 No specific attendance predictions are being offered for ''Slavery,'' except that ''we will be mobbed,'' as Dr. Mirrer put it. The society has already kicked off an $800,000 advertising campaign and plans a robust school-outreach effort, a Web site and a companion book. 
 The show has been a magnet for money, including a New York City Council grant of $500,000 this year (and $625,000 for next year's installment), as well as $803,000 from the federal Department of Education. The lead sponsor is J.P. Morgan Chase. 
 Although the society's literature portrays the exhibition as an untold story, ''historians have, for decades now, been exploring the impact of slavery on the economic, cultural and racial foundations of the city,'' said Dr. Mike Wallace, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1999 for ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898,'' written with Dr. Edwin G. Burrows. Dr. Wallace wrote a scathing critique of the Hamilton show in The New York Review of Books, faulting the exhibition for amateurish museumcraft and charging that ''the show opts for one-sided, hagiographic boosterism.'' 
 The new exhibition is likely to be scrutinized by New York historians as well. ''It would be hard not to, given the unfortunate Hamilton show,'' Dr. Wallace said. ''But given who's worked on the slavery exhibition, I'm assuming it is going to be a worthy, and hopefully exciting, enterprise.''
 The exhibition's potential to enlighten, as well as to offend, is multiracial, said Dr. Howard Dodson, chief of the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which presented a 2000 exhibition on slavery. ''With blacks it has been a subject of embarrassment,'' he explained. ''I know that was true with me when I was growing up. And with whites, it's fear of being charged with being guilty because of the sins of the fathers.'' 
 Steven H. Jaffe, a former senior projects historian at the society who worked on plans for a show on slavery beginning in 2001 but was dismissed with other staff members after Dr. Mirrer took over, said the society had ''gotten really fine scholars on this subject as advisers.'' 
 He added: ''But the question is how the black communities in and around New York are going to respond when an institution that is perceived as white and patrician starts preening about 'what we're going to tell you about slavery because you don't know it' -- when a lot of people in the black community have known this for a long time.''
 Dr. Horton, a much-praised historian who was the adviser to ''Slavery and the Making of America,'' the recent PBS documentary series, disagreed. ''I do not believe that many blacks know this story,'' he said, adding: ''This is not a case of having an elite institution set up an exhibit on slavery without guidance. This exhibit is based on exhaustive research.'' 
 His ambitions for the show are large. ''This will help to provide historical context for the conversation we need to have about race in this country,'' he said, adding that it could be a corrective to historical hypocrisy. ''The patriots used antislavery rhetoric in reference to America's freedom,'' he said, ''but they were slaveholders -- Washington, Jefferson, John Jay, Ben Franklin.''
 And indeed, Philip Livingston, the owner of the slave-trading sloop whose ledger is part of the exhibition, had a son in the business, also named Philip Livingston, who signed the Declaration of Independence. For New York.

HEADLINE: Study Proposes Opium Licensing For Afghanistan

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
Afghanistan, the world's biggest producer of opium and its derivative, heroin, acknowledged Monday that it had considered licensing its vast illicit crop and using it to produce opium-based medicines, though it ruled out such a move in the immediate future. 
 The government said it welcomed the release on Monday of a feasibility study about the subject by the Senlis Council, a drug policy research organization based in Europe. 
But Afghanistan's counternarcotics minister, Habibullah Qaderi, ruled out adopting such a program until security conditions in the country improved.
 The idea of licensing poppy cultivation completely goes against current Afghan counternarcotics policy, devised with Britain's help, which calls for eradicating poppy fields and persuading farmers to adopt alternative crops through assistance programs, much of them financed by the United States Agency for International Development.
 Mr. Qaderi said the government could not consider a program for legalizing cultivation for the time being because Afghanistan had experienced such a rapid increase in poppy cultivation in the past few years. 
 Emmanuel Reinert, executive director of the Senlis Council, said that the group's research showed a world shortage of painkillers, like opium-based morphine and codeine, in the developing world in particular, and that a licensing system in Afghanistan and local production of painkillers could give farmers a steady legal income. 
 ''It is a tragic irony that the country which produces the most opium in the world has no access to painkillers,'' he said. He called for a plan to explore trade agreements to export Afghan opium-based medicines and to start scientific studies.

 BODY:
IN the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, there has been much talk of rebuilding Louisiana's coastal wetlands and barrier islands. This proposal, which could cost an estimated $15 billion, has been advocated by Louisiana scientists, engineers, politicians and environmentalists alike, who explain that the state is suffering the highest rate of land loss in the nation and imply that restoring this land would reduce the damage from future storms. 
 As coastal scientists, we are excited to see the idea of wetlands restoration so widely discussed. Yet we think the Louisiana plan is ill conceived. 
 When a major storm tears apart any coastal area, people tend to take on an attitude that we can win this ''war'' with the weather if we spend enough money. Sadly, then, hurricanes often bequeath gigantic urban renewal projects. Destroyed houses are replaced by bigger ones that lack even the protection of dunes that were eroded by the storm. Within a few years, more property than ever stands at risk. 
 Now we are being told that we should spend billions not just on rebuilding houses and roads but on re-engineering the environment as well. Louisiana's coastal scientists, engineers and politicians suggest that without this coastal restoration project, all other efforts will be endangered. But it's not that simple, for several reasons. 
 First, many people -- scientists and otherwise -- have insinuated that if we had begun wetlands restoration in the Mississippi Delta years ago, it would have reduced the impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and the coast. This is highly unlikely. Storm surge waters approached the coast from the east, pushed into Lake Pontchartrain by the counterclockwise flow of the hurricane's winds; the natural wetlands that used to exist downriver from the city would have done little to mitigate the damage. 
 Second, some have suggested that rebuilding the Louisiana barrier islands would protect the delta region in future storms. But just look what happened elsewhere: Hurricane Katrina's storm surge quickly inundated the barrier islands of the Gulf Islands National Seashore off Mississippi, which are far more robust and vegetated than the Louisiana islands ever were, on its way to devastating the state's shoreline. Let's face it, even if reconstructed, the Louisiana islands would be little more than a speed bump to a storm the size of Hurricane Katrina. 
 In addition, none of the restoration plans address the root causes of wetland loss: man-made alterations to the Mississippi River that reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the marshes, the saltwater allowed in by navigation canals cut through the delta, and a lowering of ground levels throughout the region brought on by natural and industrial activities. We are being sold a giant engineering project intended to fix problems caused by engineering projects elsewhere on the river and in the delta. We find it paradoxical that many of the people calling for wetland restoration are also calling for higher levees to protect populated areas, since the levees, which prevent flooding and thus the natural addition of sediment to the marshes, are a big reason the wetlands are disappearing. 
 And even if we could rebuild these wetlands, maintaining them at a time of rising ocean levels is probably untenable. We would be creating our own little Holland, with a need for ever-more expensive construction and maintenance far into the future.
 Last, if the government is going to spend $15 billion on restoration, let's put all the country's wetlands on the table. We seriously doubt that any objective scientific cost-benefit review would find that spending all that money in Louisiana makes sense.
 We believe there are many concerned and honest advocates for the project to restore coastal Louisiana. But their effort should not be mislabeled as ''storm protection,'' and we shouldn't allow our emotional response to a natural disaster to cloud our long-term thinking about the best way to spend our money on repairing America's coastal regions.

1,082 Ways You Can GetAttention at Parties
 This year Cosmopolitan turns 40, though it doesn't look a day over 17, and on Thursday there was a birthday party. The party was at Skylight Studios, which had been turned into a supper club with beaded curtains and communal tables. The crowd, the news release insisted, was made up of Fun Fearless Females; said females were garbed in designer jeans and expensive stilettos, sipping drinks, ordering drinks and, in one case, fearlessly falling down the stairs upon exiting one of the portable toilets. 
 The headline entertainer was ROB THOMAS, lead singer of Matchbox Twenty and denier of ludicrous rumors that will not be mentioned here. (Google if you have to, you sickos.)
We had a chance to chat with Mr. Thomas for a few minutes in his sparsely decorated dressing room. Not far into the conversation, he began talking about his early years.
 ''When you start out, you are only playing for free beer,'' Mr. Thomas, 33, said. ''So very early in your career you become a hopeless alcoholic. 
 Did you realize you had become sort of a rock star cliche?
 ''Oh sure,'' he said. ''I was bloated, I was unhappy and I was wheezing through the shows, you know. It just wasn't pretty." 
 When was this?
 ''This was about seven years ago,'' he said. ''And now I go out, and I see that guy, Mr. I-just-sold-my-first-500,000-records, you know, and I-am-throwing-my-money-around, and I hate that guy. And that was me, I would have hated me so, I'm so glad I've found a different way to do it. I still have a great time.''
 Ever consider venturing into non-music territory, BONO-style?
 ''I don't have the aptitude for it as he does,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But I am trying to -- well, I was reading JEFFREY SACHS's book ''The End of Poverty,'' where he talks about how nations become poverty stricken, and you're predisposed to how your life is going to be. Those things made sense to me, but then he started talking about taking economies and bringing them back, and changing them, and I was completely lost on it. It was like math again.''
 He said he now lives with his wife and their dog way out in the woods in Westchester.
 ''I always wanted to live in the woods,'' he said. ''My goal as I get older is to separate myself more and more from people. People are fine, but you know.''

The Sophisticates
 The New Yorker Festival took place over the weekend, and on Friday night, as the panel discussions were emptying out, the discussers stopped by Cafe Un Deux Trois to continue their discussions and pretend to have read everyone else's books. 
 JHUMPA LAHIRI arrived early in the evening, as did MICHAEL CHABON, GEORGE SAUNDERS and DAVID SCHICKLER. DOUGLAS FEITH, surrounded by family members, moved through the party, further explaining the points he had been making during his panel discussion on the Iraq war.
 In one corner, CALVIN TRILLIN was in deep discussion with E.L. DOCTOROW.
 And just to the left of them, looking far from home, sat GILBERT GOTTFRIED, discussing nothing but slowly and deliberately eating French fries from a paper basket.
 ''I came because of the free shrimp,'' he said. ''I don't know any of these people!''
 That's E.L. Doctorow next to you, we said.
 He shook his head sadly. 
 Well, what's your connection with this New Yorker thing?
 ''I'm doing a panel on the Three Stooges on Sunday,'' he said. ''I guess they'll ask was it funnier with the hammer or the saw.''
 You should take that subject up with Mr. Feith, we suggested.
 ''Yeah, I'll ask him what he thinks about SHEMP.''
 He laughed and then ate another fry.
 ''I don't know anybody here.''

PERSON: Urie Bronfenbrenner

HEADLINE: Urie Bronfenbrenner, 88, an Authority on Child Development

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Urie Bronfenbrenner, an internationally renowned psychologist and authority on child development who in the mid-1960's helped found the federal Head Start program, which aids poor preschool children and their families, died on Sunday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 88.
 The cause was complications of diabetes, according to Cornell University, where Dr. Bronfenbrenner was the Jacob Gould Schurman professor emeritus of human development and of psychology.
Throughout his career, Dr. Bronfenbrenner was concerned with the social forces that in his words, ''make human beings human.'' He argued that an awareness of these forces, chief among them strong family ties, should underpin social policy affecting children and families. 
 ''We think of the fact that learning is something you do in school, but what happens in a family enables you to learn in school,'' Dr. Bronfenbrenner told The Syracuse Post-Standard in 1996. ''Not because your parents are teaching you arithmetic, although that won't do any harm; it's because you learn from them how to relate to very complicated things.''
 A member of the Cornell faculty for more than 50 years, Dr. Bronfenbrenner was best known for his pioneering theory of the ecology of human development. Published in book form in 1979, the theory maintained that a person's development is the product of a constellation of forces -- cultural, social, economic, political -- and not merely psychological ones. In later years, the field Dr. Bronfenbrenner created came to be known as bioecology.
 Dr. Bronfenbrenner was also known for his comparative studies of child rearing in other cultures, including the Soviet Union. Among his best-known books is ''Two Worlds of Childhood: U.S. and U.S.S.R.'' (Basic Books/Russell Sage Foundation, 1970), written with John C. Condry Jr.
 Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review in 1971, Jay Haley called it ''a lively and readable book which is the most complete description of Soviet methods of child rearing and education yet available.''
 Urie Bronfenbrenner was born in Moscow on April 29, 1917, and was 6 when his family came to the United States. His father, a neuropathologist, got a job at Letchworth Village, an institution for the developmentally disabled in Rockland County, N.Y.
 His work there left a lasting impression on Urie, who recalled his father's despair when New York City courts sometimes consigned healthy children to the institution.
 ''Before he could unwind the necessary red tape to have them released, it would be too late,'' Dr. Bronfenbrenner told The Washington Post in 1988. ''After a few weeks as one of 80 inmates in a cottage with two matrons, their scores on intelligence tests administered as a compulsory part of the discharge process proved them mentally deficient: that meant remaining in the institution for the rest of their lives.''
 In 1938, Dr. Bronfenbrenner earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell, majoring in music and psychology. He earned a master's in education from Harvard in 1940 and, in 1942, a doctorate in psychology from the University of Michigan. During World War II, he was a psychologist in the Army. After the war, he taught briefly at Michigan before joining the Cornell faculty in 1948.
 Testifying before Congress on a proposed antipoverty bill in 1964, Dr. Bronfenbrenner argued that measures to prevent poverty should be directed in particular toward young children. His testimony produced an invitation to tea with the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, to discuss the early-childhood programs he had seen abroad.
 ''There was clearly a gleam in Mrs. Johnson's eye and, as she told me on subsequent occasions, this was when her enthusiasm for something like Head Start was kindled,'' Dr. Bronfenbrenner told The Chicago Sun-Times in 1991.
 Dr. Bronfenbrenner was appointed to a federal panel whose recommendations led to the creation of Head Start in 1965. Some 20 million children and family members have taken part in the program since its inception, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
 Dr. Bronfenbrenner is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Liese Price; two sons, Michael, of Seal Beach, Calif., and Steven, of San Anselmo, Calif.; four daughters, Beth Soll of Manhattan; Mary and Kate, of Ithaca; and Ann Stambler of Newton Center, Mass.; 13 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
 Among Dr. Bronfenbrenner's other books are ''The Ecology of Human Development'' (Harvard University, 1979) and, most recently, ''Making Human Beings Human'' (Sage Publications, 2005), which he edited.
 In recent years, Dr. Bronfenbrenner warned increasingly of the breakdown of the social support systems that had once helped American children to thrive.
 ''We've got all kind of forces that are interfering and blocking the process of civilizing human beings and making them competent and responsible,'' he told The Syracuse Post-Standard in 1996. ''As always, it shows itself first in the weakest link in the chain, the ones that are under the greatest stress, which are the poor.''

HEADLINE: Storm Victims May Face Curbs On Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
When Congress agreed this spring to tighten the bankruptcy laws and crack down on consumers who took on debt irresponsibly, no one had the victims of Hurricane Katrina in mind.
 But four weeks after New Orleans flooded and tens of thousands of other residents of the Gulf Coast also lost their homes and livelihoods, a stricter new personal bankruptcy law scheduled to take effect on Oct. 17 is likely to deliver another blow to those dislocated by the storm.
The law was intended to keep individuals from taking on debts they had no intention of paying off. But many once-solvent Katrina victims are likely to be caught up in the net intended to catch deadbeats.
 Right after Hurricane Katrina struck, several lawmakers -- mostly Democrats but including some Senate Republicans -- suggested that storm victims along the Gulf Coast should get relief from the new law's stricter provisions, which are intended to screen filers by income and make those with higher incomes repay their debts over several years. Under the old law, which remains in effect until mid-October, many more filers can have their debts canceled quickly in federal bankruptcy courts. 
 But House Republicans, who fought off a proposed amendment that would have made bankruptcy filings easier for victims of natural disasters, said there was no reason to carve out a broad exemption just because of the storm.
 Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the notion of reopening the legislation, saying it already included provisions that would ensure that people left ''down and out'' by the storm would still be able to shed most of their debts. Lawmakers who lost the long fight over the law, he said, ''ought to get over it,'' according to The Associated Press.
 A White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, said the administration ''doesn't see a lot of merit'' in calls to delay the law's effective date but was considering making allowances for hurricane victims. 
 In the meantime, many victims of Hurricane Katrina -- and the much smaller group ruined by Hurricane Rita -- will face a kind of Catch-22. Those who try to beat the Oct. 17 deadline in hopes of filing under the less-onerous current law may find it impossible to do so, because residence rules generally require that individuals seek protection against creditors in their hometowns. (Assuming people in New Orleans can find their lawyers and records, they can file for bankruptcy protection in their bankruptcy court, which has reopened and is sharing space with another court in Baton Rouge.)
 Moreover, most people displaced by the storm will probably not know for months if they even need to file for bankruptcy. By that time, the tougher new law will be in force.
 ''Six to nine months from now, FEMA will be gone, the church groups will be gone and creditors will once more be demanding their money,'' said Bradford W. Botes, a bankruptcy lawyer whose firm represented victims of Hurricane Ivan, which struck Florida a year ago.
 Keith and Bridget Cloud are among those already worrying about how to pay their bills while picking up the pieces of their lives. Mr. Cloud, 39, has owned a lawn care business in New Orleans for 12 years, employing four people. Ms. Cloud, 38, was a group-home manager for a nonprofit agency that sheltered homeless people. Two years ago, they bought a house, moved in with their five children and began paying down their mortgage.
 ''We weren't millionaires or anything, but we were just making it,'' Ms. Cloud said in a telephone interview from Houston last week, as the couple and their three oldest children were fleeing again, this time from the threat of Hurricane Rita, decamping temporarily in Laredo, Tex., and then in Corpus Christi. (Their two younger children are with relatives in Alabama.)
 ''If we have to file,'' Ms. Cloud said, ''don't make it harder for us than it already is.''
 Personal and business bankruptcy filings usually reach a peak two to three years after a hurricane, according to a study about bankruptcy and hurricanes, soon to be published in The Nevada Law Journal, by Robert M. Lawless, a law professor at the University of Nevada.
 Mr. Lawless said he was surprised by the pattern. Previous research on bankruptcy filings and natural disasters had not shown a connection, he said, apparently because analysts were looking only at the months immediately after floods or storms.
 He said his finding was in keeping with research on the overall level of economic activity after hurricanes, which shows there is often a short-term growth spurt as federal aid and construction money are pumped into disaster areas. The bankruptcy filings come later, as people who have lost their houses or jobs are overwhelmed by the debts they incur while trying to rebuild. 
 ''Areas hit by major hurricanes will suffer great financial distress and that distress will linger for long after the media glare has disappeared,'' Mr. Lawless writes.
 Defenders of the new law note that judges will still have the discretion to waive its strict restrictions on filing under Chapter 7, a faster and simpler type of bankruptcy that, among other things, allows consumers to walk away from some obligations.
 ''There's nothing in the bill to suggest that you can get blood from a stone,'' Todd J. Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University, said in an interview last week between Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. ''The new legislation is perfectly suited to deal with circumstances such as this.'' 
 Mr. Zywicki said that as drafted, the new law still gave judges the discretion to identify victims of ''special circumstances,'' like hurricanes, and to let them use Chapter 7 provisions.
 But consumer bankruptcy lawyers worry that there is little incentive in the law for judges to give hurricane victims a break. They also complain about a long list of new demands it makes on individuals.
 Among the hurdles in the new law that could most affect hurricane victims is a means test. It requires debtors to provide an estimate of their income by taking an average of their most recent six months' earnings before they can file under Chapter 7. Debtors with higher incomes are to be kept in bankruptcy status for several years, to pay off their debts.
 But ''someone who had a great job just before Katrina may have a very different income today,'' Mr. Botes, the bankruptcy lawyer, noted. 
 The new law also requires every individual to undergo credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy protection. ''It's not right to make people who lost everything go through a course about how to manage their finances,'' Mr. Botes said.
 The law has stiffer requirements as well for what records must be produced by the debtor. But hurricane victims will have a hard time doing that. ''Thousands and thousands of people no longer have checkbooks, insurance papers, car titles (or cars), birth certificates, Social Security cards or wallets,'' a group of Louisiana lawyers said in a letter two weeks ago to the state's Congressional delegation. 
 The harsher requirements already had thousands of consumers rushing to file bankruptcy petitions ahead of the deadline. Despite a strong economy, quarterly filings for the period from April through June jumped 11 percent from the quarter a year earlier, to a record 467,333, the American Bankruptcy Institute reported.
 Now, many previously solvent families and small businesses find themselves facing such pressure, but with little hope of getting into court ahead of the deadline.
 ''Think of the position of these debtors, many of whom would have not had to file bankruptcy otherwise,'' said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''They have until Oct. 17 to file under the old law that was less restrictive than this new law. But the odds that they can do that are pretty slim because the lawyers who would serve them are out in refugee camps somewhere.''
 The Cloud family is a good example. After Hurricane Katrina hit, they left for Houston, where they lived for a couple of weeks in the Astrodome. The day after they were given a temporary apartment, Houston was evacuated for Hurricane Rita and they drove in a borrowed car to Laredo. Bouncing from place to place, they have found it hard to determine the extent of their losses in New Orleans.
 Mr. Cloud has returned to New Orleans just once so far. He found that the family house had been spared, but that his company's three trucks, only two fully paid for, had been destroyed. So the company will have to pay off a loan for one vehicle that no longer exists.
 His insurer will cover only part of the loss, and it has warned that it will not cover the vehicles' contents. Mr. Cloud stored his riding lawn mowers and other costly equipment aboard the trucks, so he will bear those losses himself. 
 Ms. Cloud estimated that 80 percent of her husband's customers, mostly apartment complexes, were in the New Orleans flood zone. They have no idea when, if ever, the property owners will need his services again. While they wait, they are scraping together funds to buy new lawn care equipment and a truck.
 Ms. Cloud has already received her last paycheck, so they will have to dip into their savings, she said. She has requested a small-business loan application from FEMA, but the papers have not yet arrived. Meanwhile, bills are coming due.
 Ms. Cloud said she wondered if the family would end up in bankruptcy court. They had a near-miss once before, when her husband and his brother, then a co-owner of the lawn care business, had a dispute. They were able to resolve the problem without filing for bankruptcy, Ms. Cloud said, and she has been trying to call the New Orleans lawyer who helped them. So far, she has not been able to get a call through. 
 Professor LoPucki said: ''These people could, I guess, go to bankruptcy lawyers in the places where they are. But they are supposed to file in New Orleans.'' 
 Individuals are supposed to file wherever they have spent most of the previous 180 days. That will pose a problem for long-term evacuees.
 Michael D. Allday, a New Orleans lawyer, said he had one client, a single mother with medical bills exceeding $75,000, who had been planning to file for bankruptcy just before Katrina struck. 
 ''Now she's lost her job on a riverboat casino,'' he said. The woman resettled in Little Rock, Ark., and Mr. Allday said he thought she should file there. But before she can do so, other bankruptcy lawyers noted, she will have to wait several months to fulfill the residence requirement. By that time, of course, the new law will be in force.
 Professor LoPucki said he thought the majority of lawmakers were averse to enacting blanket bankruptcy relief for hurricane victims because that might raise questions about why victims of other uncontrollable events -- like accidents, major illnesses or mass layoffs -- should not get a break, too.
 ''If you admit that the bill is bad for Katrina victims,'' he said, ''then there's really no reason it isn't bad for the others, too. They're all in some kind of problem. For most of them, it's largely their fault. But for a lot of them, it isn't their fault.''

The Old and the New
Following are some of the differences between the current law and the new bankruptcy laws:

THE CURRENT LAW
 Was enacted in 1978 and became effective in 1979.
 Lets individuals choose between two forms of bankruptcy. The more popular, Chapter 7, lets people discharge unsecured debts, such as medical bills and credit card debt. But they can lose assets that secure debts, like houses or cars. 
 In the other type, Chapter 13, individuals try to pay their debts over three to five years, with protection from their secured creditors.

THE NEW LAW
 Was enacted in April and becomes effective on Oct. 17.
 Requires filers to provide more documentation.
 Requires all filers to complete a federally approved credit counseling program.
 Allows filers to use Chapter 7 only if a means test shows that they earn less than the median for their state, and do not have enough income, after living expenses, to repay at least $6,000 over five years.
 Requires filers with more resources to file Chapter 13.
 Gives judges discretion to let higher-income debtors file under Chapter 7, if they have ''special circumstances.''

HEADLINE: At the Vatican, Exceptions Make the Rule

BYLINE: By John L. Allen Jr.. 
John L. Allen Jr. is the Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter.

DATELINE: Rome 

 BODY:
THE forthcoming Vatican document on gays in seminaries will unleash a wrenching debate about Catholicism and homosexuality, but one thing it is certain not to mean is that in the future there will be no gays in the priesthood. The continued presence of gays in the priesthood will be the product not just of difficulties in enforcement, or the dishonesty of potential candidates, but also of design.
 Although this is a difficult point for many Anglo-Saxons to grasp, when the Vatican makes statements like ''no gays in the priesthood,'' it doesn't actually mean ''no gays in the priesthood.'' It means, ''As a general rule, this is not a good idea, but we all know there will be exceptions.'' 
Understanding this distinction requires an appreciation of Italian concepts of law, which hold sway throughout the thought world of the Vatican. The law, according to such thinking, expresses an ideal. It describes a perfect state of affairs from which many people will inevitably fall short. This view is far removed from the typical Anglo-Saxon approach, which expects the law to dictate what people actually do.
 While Italians grumble about lawlessness, fundamentally they believe in subjectivity. Anyone who's tried to negotiate the traffic in Italian cities will appreciate the point. No law, most Italians believe, can capture the infinite complexity of human situations, and it's more important for the law to describe a vision of the ideal community than for it to be rigidly obeyed. Italians have tough laws, but their enforcement is enormously forgiving. Not for nothing was their equivalent of the attorney general's office once known as the Ministry of Justice and Grace. 
 The British historian Christopher Dawson has described this as the ''erotic'' spirit of cultures shaped by Roman Catholicism. Catholic cultures are based on the passionate quest for spiritual perfection, Dawson writes, unlike the ''bourgeois'' culture of the United States, which, shaped by Protestantism and based on practical reason, gives priority to economic concerns. As one senior Vatican official put it to me some time ago, ''Law describes the way things would work if men were angels.'' 
 This value system means that while Vatican officials often project a stern moral image on the public stage, in intimate settings they can be strikingly patient and understanding. Policymakers in the Vatican tend not to get as worked up as many Americans by the large numbers of Catholics in the developed world who flout church regulations on birth control, for example. It's not that Vatican officials don't believe in the regulations. Rather, they believe the very nature of an ideal is that many people will fail to realize it.
 Of course, one can debate whether a ban on birth control, or on gays in seminaries, ought to be the ideal. The point is that although Vatican officials will never say so out loud, few actually expect those rules to be upheld in all cases.
 Some in the Anglo-Saxon world see this as a form of hypocrisy: the church apparently issues laws while winking at disobedience. But Vatican officials view it instead as a realistic concession to fallen human nature.
 On background, some such officials have said that the point of the forthcoming document is to challenge the conventional wisdom in the church, which holds that as long as a prospective priest is capable of celibacy, it doesn't matter whether he's gay or straight. Vatican policymakers and some American bishops believe that's naive. In an all-male environment, they contend, a candidate whose sexual orientation is toward men faces greater temptations and hence a greater cause for concern.
 That's a debatable proposition, but it does not add up to an absolute conviction that no gay man should ever be ordained a priest. Rather, it means that bishops should take a hard look at such candidates, but in the end, they'll still use their best judgment.
 Those determined to apply this decree in uncompromising fashion will be able to do so. But while the Catholic priesthood of the future may include fewer homosexuals -- and it will certainly have fewer gay seminarians and priests willing to speak openly about their situation -- it will not be ''gay free.''
 On the ground, as bishops and seminary teams make decisions, many will still draw on that classic bit of Italian clerical casuistry: ''If the pope were here, he would understand.''

HEADLINE: 'Fire Bell' In the Night

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
The most important decision we'll make in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita isn't whether to rebuild New Orleans. It's how to tackle global warming.
 Today we look back at the presidents who preceded the Civil War, and we can't understand how they could have sat on their hands in the face of a threat that proved so devastating to this country. Someday, I fear, Americans are going to look back at today's leaders and wonder the same thing.
Wait one second! You're trying to frightify Americans. 
 Mr. President! How did you get into my keyboard?
 It was intelligently designed. But you're evadering -- you know hurricanes aren't about global warming.
 No, Mr. President -- you're the one dodging the issue. Sure, there's no way to link any particular hurricane to global warming. But there's loads of evidence that global warming is already making hurricanes more intense. I don't suppose you saw the report this month in the journal Science that the proportion of hurricanes that are Category 4 or 5 has almost doubled since the 1970's?
 No, er, I missed that one. Laura might've read it. 
 And did you see the study published in Nature that says hurricanes have almost doubled in intensity over the last 30 years? Or The Journal of Climate study suggesting that global warming will triple the number of Category 5 hurricanes?
 Ugh, I'm waiting for the movie. But how can we believe these studies? Tree-huggers are always exaggificating. A few decades ago, they talked about global cooling; now they worry about warming. They've got less credibility than my Pentagon.
 Fair enough -- many environmentalists have been far too quick to cry wolf. But the worriers today aren't just greens. They're scientists. They're even your buddies in business. And no wonder -- a new study of insurance industry prospects concluded, ''We are witnessing a precipitous rise in weather-related losses in the U.S., and numerous projections that climate change will likely magnify those losses in the years ahead.'' Why bury your head in the sand?
 Don't be impermanent. This is all unproven, and you may be misoverestimating the danger.
 A person who smokes may not get lung cancer, but that doesn't mean it's prudent to light up. It's nuts to ignore a threat just because it's hard to measure. We spend about $500 billion a year on a military budget, yet we don't want to spend peanuts to protect against climate change, which is a greater potential threat than any foreign military power. And uncertainty cuts both ways: experts expect the seas will rise about 2 feet by 2100, and maybe it'll be less -- but maybe the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will melt and raise the sea level by 20 feet. 
 Look, the threat is pretty mushy, and the cost of cutting that carbon would be huge. You volunteering to pay a higher gas tax? To lose your job if the economy takes a hit? 
 I used to be suspicious of the Kyoto accord because economic models suggested that it might cost hundreds of billions of dollars to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But it's increasingly clear that there are initial steps we can take to reduce carbon emissions that are very cheap -- like encouraging mass transit, hybrid vehicles, better insulation and energy-efficient light bulbs. One study indicated we could reduce global emissions by one-third for just one-tenth of 1 percent of worldwide G.N.P. That's why mayors and governors are willing to take the lead on this issue, while Washington twiddles its thumbs. Under Bill Richardson, New Mexico just became the first state to join the Chicago Climate Exchange, and committed itself to reduce the state government's greenhouse gas emissions by 4 percent by 2006. There's a leader!
 I don't appreciate your insinufications -- you really irrigate me. What's it to you, anyway? Shouldn't you be hollering about Darfur or someplace else in Asia?
 Mr. President, I've just returned from Louisiana and Mississippi, and I was frankly blown away by what I saw. The old beachfront homes, they're gone. There isn't even rubble left, just empty lots where everything got dragged out to sea. If this hurricane season doesn't wake us up to the dangers ahead, nothing will.
 In 1820, Thomas Jefferson described the extension of slavery in the Missouri Compromise as ''a fire bell in the night'' and a mortal threat to the Union, but a series of ineffective presidents refused to listen or respond as we drifted toward catastrophe. Now, Mr. President, these hurricanes constitute another fire bell in the night, calling on us to act on global warming -- before it's too late.

HEADLINE: Gambling With History

BYLINE: By James Lighthizer. 
James Lighthizer is the president of the Civil War Preservation Trust.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
THE mere mention of Gettysburg conjures up images of beautiful, rolling Pennsylvania farmland and stone monuments commemorating the soldiers who fought there 142 years ago. Nearly two million tourists visit Gettysburg each year to pay tribute to the place where, as Abraham Lincoln said, this nation was given ''a new birth of freedom.'' 
 Sadly, there are investors who simply do not understand what Gettysburg means to the United States. They want to build a casino in the shadow of this great national landmark. 
These developers say they will create a tasteful establishment, one that will be in keeping with the area's historic character and appeal to both battlefield visitors and fans of gambling. Like casino proponents elsewhere in the country, the Gettysburg investors tempt local officials with promises of jobs and money. But most of these investors will have left town by the time residents discover how empty those promises are. According to economists who study the effects of casinos on local communities, for every $1 million a casino brings in, $3 million is needed for basic infrastructure and services. If this casino is built, the only prediction likely to prove true is that it will destroy the Gettysburg that generations of Americans have come to cherish.
 Of course, the casino's developers argue that the site they have chosen is not ''battlefield'' land. What they fail to realize, however, is that historical significance does not stop at the edges of the national park. Roads into and out of town were of huge consequence to the battle. Practically every farmhouse and barn for miles was used as a field hospital for the wounded and dying. 
 Regardless of how careful and sensitive the developers think their plans are, building a casino at Gettysburg will destroy the town's character. Poorly managed growth and traffic already plague Gettysburg, and the casino will make congestion worse. It's true that historians are already appalled at the encroachments that souvenir shops and big-box stores have made on parts of the battlefield, but the size of the 42-acre complex, and the pawn shops and check-cashing stores that the 2,500 slots will likely generate, are far worse than anything that's currently there.
 And rather than bringing jobs, the casino could easily damage the region's economic vitality. My organization recently released a study detailing the economic benefits of battlefield preservation, and the results are clear: Gettysburg National Military Park is the cornerstone of the local economy. Each year out-of-town visitors spend $121 million in Gettysburg stores, hotels and restaurants, for an average of $76.53 per person, per day. That concentration of spending and patronage supports 2,653 full-time jobs in the community, beyond those necessary to keep the park in operation. Furthermore, taxes on that spending generate more than $17.2 million in state and local revenue. 
 The casino developers maintain that their enterprise will appeal to both heritage tourists and travelers who might not have come for the history alone. But in July, local anti-casino volunteers questioned 300 tourists: 96 percent were opposed to building a casino in the area, 81 percent felt it would be a desecration to do so at Gettysburg and 53 percent would not return if a casino were built nearby.
 Even Gov. Edward Rendell of Pennsylvania, who was a driving force behind the state's gambling legislation, said this month that he opposed placing slots in historical places that draw families. Having a casino anywhere near Gettysburg, he said, would debase the experience of children visiting this ''great historic shrine.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Rendell contends that the final decision is up to an independent commission. But the governor and the Legislature appointed the commission members and are ultimately responsible for their decision. 
 Building a casino at Gettysburg would be more than a gamble; it would be folly. It cheapens the sacrifice of those who gave ''the last full measure of devotion'' on that field. Casinos are everywhere, but there's only one Gettysburg.

HEADLINE: With Storms Behind Them, Gulf Residents Begin Piecing Their Lives Together

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME and RALPH BLUMENTHAL; Peter Applebome reported from New Orleans for this article, and Ralph Blumenthal from Houston. Michael Brick contributed reporting from New Orleans; Simon Romero from Beaumont, Tex.; and Maureen Balleza from Houston.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
The lights came back on in the French Quarter on Monday, and residents streamed back across the Mississippi River to neighborhoods in Algiers. For the first time since Hurricane Rita compounded the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, glimmers of optimism began coursing through this battered and largely deserted city as Gulf Coast residents in Texas and Louisiana tried to put their lives back together.
 The death toll from Hurricane Rita rose to eight on Monday. Five people were found dead in an apartment in Beaumont, Tex., apparently overcome by carbon monoxide from a generator they had been using indoors to power a ceiling fan, the authorities said. A 3-year-old boy in Point Blank, Tex., was killed when a tree fell on his family's mobile home. 
 Residents of southwestern Louisiana were trying to return to the hard-hit towns where the storm obliterated homes, businesses and farms.
 Crude oil and gasoline futures rebounded on speculation that refineries near the Texas-Louisiana border might be offline longer than expected. Officials said refineries in Beaumont and Port Arthur, Tex., had suffered more damage than originally thought and could be closed for extended periods, Bloomberg News reported. None of the refinery operators said when production would resume.
 But under a sunny sky on a day with sweltering heat, residents across the region tried to move on after the storms. 
 Houston, which had feared a knockout blow from Hurricane Rita but received just a wet slap, continued to recover, with power restored to about 555,000 of the 700,000 CenterPoint Energy customers who lost service on Saturday.
 Paul Bettencourt, the tax assessor and collector for Harris County, which includes Houston, estimated that the county had suffered $41.6 million in damages, a fraction of the loss of $50 billion to $80 billion that had been expected if Hurricane Rita had remained a Category 5 storm and hit Houston head-on instead of veering off to the east.
 With evacuees streaming back to Houston, there were some traffic jams on southbound Interstate 45, but little of the gridlock that marred the mass evacuation on Thursday and Friday. Motorists appeared, for the most part, to be abiding by a staggered plan that designated different return dates for various sections of the city.
 In New Orleans, Mayor C. Ray Nagin resumed plans to reopen the city gradually, inviting people in the Algiers section to return on Monday. Business owners in other parts of the city, particularly the French Quarter, were also allowed back.
 But officials made clear that residents would not be coming back to the city they knew.
 ''We want people to return and help us rebuild the city,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''However, we want everyone to assess the risks and make an informed decision about re-entry plans.''
 An information sheet handed to returning residents said, ''Welcome home!'' But it also warned, ''You are entering the City of New Orleans at your own risk.''
 It added, ''There are still many health and safety issues.''
 In Algiers, an area with 60,000 residents before Hurricane Katrina struck, business owners and residents were allowed to start returning at 10 a.m. for inspections. Many stores had opened by then, and plenty of residents were returning. 
 Hulon Matherne put plywood signs by the road to point the way to his barbershop. He had an electric razor in his right hand and a pistol in his belt. He was giving a $12 haircut to Davis Mena, 4, and Pat Cargol was next in line. The other chairs had been stolen after the storm, and the other barber had quit to make quick money in construction.
 ''We're going to survive,'' Mr. Matherne said. ''Those that want to work will survive. That's why I busted my buns to get back here.''
 In the French Quarter, business operators became giddy when the power came back on around 11 a.m. on Monday.
 Within an hour, bartenders had rushed into the Bourbon Street Blues Company and the Famous Door. ''We're happy to be back, and we ain't going nowhere,'' said Phil Uson, the owner of both establishments. ''People have heard New Orleans is done, we're closed, we're not coming back. That's so far from the truth.'' 
 Mr. Uson predicted that his clubs would be ''seminormal.'' ''Mardi Gras will be the start of everything again,'' he said.
 Stephen Perry, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that all major conventions, the lifeblood of the tourist economy, had been canceled through March 31, when the convention center is expected to reopen after being repaired and refurbished. The center was the scene of widespread despair immediately after the flood, serving as a gathering place for thousands of hungry and homeless residents.
 Mr. Perry said 80 percent of the city's hotels could be back in operation by the end of October, and 90 percent to 95 percent by Christmas. Tourism, the city's largest industry with 85,000 jobs, will begin to recover near the end of the year, he said, first through rescue workers and contractors, then through individual visitors and small meetings and conventions, and finally with the major events.
 ''The outpouring of emotion and support from around the country has really stunned us,'' Mr. Perry said. ''People know this is a very special place.''
 And there were glimmers of that on Monday, like the sight of Scott Boswell, a celebrated local chef, handing out fliers for his newly opened restaurant Stanley (a counterpoint to his well-known Stella!), where he was selling cheeseburgers for $5. The place was full of excited rescue workers and French Quarter residents.
 Business owners conceded that there would not be enough customers for months for all the businesses that wanted to reopen, but they said everyone was eager to return, to show that they could and to keep their employees.
 ''I've told everyone, New Orleans is a feeling, it's a disease,'' said Jim Monaghan, owner of Molly's at the Market, which reopened hours after Hurricane Katrina passed and was host to a healthy collection of residents and others drinking beer on Monday. ''And once you've got it, it doesn't go away. I guarantee you, we'll help each other out, we'll frequent each others businesses, we'll do what's needed to get us through this.''

HEADLINE: A Steadfast G.M. Faces Strike By Union in Canada Tonight

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers made some progress in contract negotiations on Monday, but the company's continued demands for job cuts and reduced work breaks left open the prospect of a strike on Tuesday.
 While G.M. dropped its opposition to pension increases already accepted by its main United States rivals, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, it was standing firm on the other issues in the face of a possible walkout by 17,200 workers at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.
''Am I a little more optimistic? I guess you could say yes,'' Buzz Hargrove, the union's president, told reporters in a conference call from Toronto. ''The only problem we still have is there are still some offsets we find offensive.'' 
 A strike would have direct repercussions for the company's factories and dealers in the United States. G.M.'s main assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, where up to a million cars are built each year, is the company's only producer of several Chevrolet, Buick and Pontiac cars. It also makes full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, mostly for American buyers. Similarly, parts and engine plants in St. Catharines, Ontario, and an automatic transmission factory in Windsor, Ontario, supply components to several assembly operations in the United States. 
 G.M. is proposing to reduce breaks for assembly line workers by two minutes a shift in Oshawa, where one assembly plant was ranked as North America's most productive by a independent study released in June.
 ''That means two or three more vehicles per shift,'' Mr. Hargrove said. ''That's good for General Motors but not for the people who build them.'' Mr. Hargrove added that if the plan was still on the table by the strike deadline, it would be ''a showstopper.''
 Stew Low, a General Motors spokesman in Oshawa, said the reduction in breaks was a significant demand for the company. 
 ''Our overarching theme here is that we're trying to find ways with the union of reducing costs,'' Mr. Low said. ''That's 120 seconds in which you can build cars. It gets down to a production cost issue.'' 
 Another potential strike issue, Mr. Hargrove said, is a plan by G.M. to eliminate a unit of 385 workers in Oshawa that provides construction services. The company wants to use outside contractors in the future.
 Linked to that are production decreases that, by the union's calculations, could eliminate up to 1,020 jobs at the St. Catharines plants over the next three years.
 Mr. Low declined to discuss employment levels at specific plants. He said, however, that job levels remained open to negotiation.
 ''What we're saying is we want to make sure that the overall agreement doesn't increase our structural costs,'' Mr. Low said. ''We just have to be creative and find solutions.''
 According to Mr. Hargrove, G.M. wants those concessions to offset a disadvantage of 70 million Canadian dollars a year that it expects in pension costs compared with those of Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which have already reached deals under the so-called pattern agreement. That plan increases pension payments by 11.3 percent over three years.
 G.M. has 20,000 pensioners in Canada and about 5,000 employees eligible for retirement over the next three years, considerably higher numbers than its two rivals.
 The union, however, said that G.M. was not recognizing that its larger employee base also means that it will derive a greater benefit from dental plan restrictions and caps on payments for chronic care that are included in the contracts reached with the other automakers. The union says that a government pension change introduced in 1992 greatly reduces the cash contribution G.M. must make to its pension fund compared with the other two automakers.
 On Monday, the union left open the prospect that it might compromise on the cuts.
 ''We don't accept that the pattern agreement penalizes G.M.,'' Jim Stanford, a union economist, said in an interview. The basic economic package signed by Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which G.M. apparently has now accepted, includes modest wage increases of 1.5 percent in the first year followed by 1 percent rises in the next two years.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Storm Does Less Damage Than Feared

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fluctuated before closing modestly higher yesterday as oil prices neared $66 a barrel despite lower-than-expected damage estimates from Hurricane Rita.
 Wall Street made a strong early advance on reports that crucial petroleum facilities along the Texas coastline escaped the storm with relatively less damage than during Hurricane Katrina last month. Investors also welcomed new data showing that August sales of preowned homes reached their second-highest level ever.
 Volatile afternoon energy trading briefly led stocks into negative territory, even after President Bush said the government would tap the nation's reserves to make up for lost oil production from the recent storms. But despite higher oil prices, Wall Street rallied in the last hour of trading. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.04 points, or 0.23 percent, to 10,443.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.34 point, or 0.03 percent, to 1,215.63. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.62 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,121.46.
 The advance on Wall Street extends a brief recovery from the end of last week, when Hurricane Rita weakened and eased fears of damage similar to the havoc caused by Katrina in late August.
 Analysts said that with no major headlines driving the market, oil prices and interest rates were once again investors' primary concerns.
 Oil prices are 40 percent higher than year-ago levels, but linger below a record of $70.85 a barrel reached after Katrina knocked out 90 percent of the region's capacity. A barrel of light crude added $1.63, to settle at $65.82 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where gasoline futures rose 4.4 cents, to $2.129 a gallon.
 Investors spent part of the session assessing softer comments made by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, about the housing market. Mr. Greenspan, who recently expressed concerns about an overheating market, told people attending a California banking conference that most homeowners had enough equity to cushion the impact of a drop in prices if demand suddenly waned. Wall Street interpreted his remarks as a sign the Fed was comfortable increasing rates again when it meets in November.
 Mr. Greenspan's comments came after the National Association of Realtors reported existing-home sales grew 2 percent last month, dodging economists' predictions for a decline as an indication that the housing boom was finally starting to slow.
 In corporate news, Boeing climbed after reaching a tentative labor agreement with its mechanics, who walked off the job three weeks ago. Boeing rose $1.47, to $64.67.
 Shares of Delphi plunged on renewed bankruptcy concerns. The company warned on Friday of plant closings and layoffs if it could not secure more cash. Shares of Delphi slumped 47 cents, to $2.99.
 Walgreen, the drugstore chain, reported its quarterly profit rose about 1 percent after costs from Katrina. Excluding charges, Walgreen's earnings of 35 cents a share still missed Wall Street estimates by 2 cents. Shares of Walgreen fell $1.01, to $41.50.
 FedEx said income for the current period might also be hurt by Katrina as service to New Orleans continued to be disrupted. FedEx, however, did not estimate the hurricane's impact in its quarterly report filed Friday. FedEx rose 58 cents, to $83.68.
 Bonds continued to slide, with the price of the 10-year Treasury note falling 13/32, to 99 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.29 percent, from 4.24 percent on Friday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills.

These are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Grading the C.E.O. Speech

BYLINE: By SHARON McDONNELL

 BODY:
When the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, recently stopped dead for 32 seconds during the speech that kicked off her United States Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton -- before plaintively asking, ''Where's Page 10?'' -- it resonated with Barbara Corcoran. 
 Ms. Corcoran, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate firm owned by the Cendant Corporation, says she still cringes at her own gaffe during a speech.
It was her first public speech, at a Citibank seminar in 1974 for about 800 home buyers, and she began with a joke, as books on public speaking often recommend. The problem was, she forgot the punch line, and could not find the index card she wrote it on. Struck dumb, she was unable to continue, and crawled back to her seat in utter misery as the next speaker was introduced. 
 ''I was deathly afraid of public speaking and made up my mind never to do it again,'' she said in a call from Australia, where she was giving a keynote speech at the Australasian Agency Principals Conference in Noosa, Queensland. ''But by the time I woke up the next morning, I decided to force myself to speak in public often. So I signed up to teach a 10-class real estate course at New York University.'' Since then, she estimates that she has given 500 speeches all over the world.
 Why does she do it? Mostly to drum up business, she says. With that motivation, the bigger the audience, the better. ''Years ago I'd speak to groups of 30, 50 or 100,'' she said. ''Now it's 500 or more and I'm much more comfortable with 1,000.''
 For business leaders, public speaking is part of the job. A survey of 100 Fortune 1,000 companies this year by the public relations agency Burson-Marsteller found that their chief executives received an average of 175 invitations a year to speak at conferences.
 Business conferences are a $102 billion pillar of the business-travel industry, with attendance in the millions every year. According to the 2005 National Business Travel Monitor, a survey by Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown & Russell, a travel-marketing firm, 83 percent of all business travelers attend a corporate or association meeting on their trips.
 Some executives love public speaking and some do not, but many have been cutting back on the number of speeches, and not out of fear of making headline-grabbing mistakes. Rather, with corporate America coming under increased scrutiny in the post-Enron era, they are purposely lowering their profile, said Ed Trissel, a principal in the Vistance Group in New York, a communications advisory firm for business executives. 
 ''There's definitely a slowdown in the past few years in participating as a speaker in conferences,'' Mr. Trissel said. ''Since the spotlight is shining on C.E.O. behavior and compensation, it's less ego-driven and more content-driven.''
 Executives are being more selective about where they speak as well, experts say, generally preferring forums where they can bump into the highest number of powerful fellow executives. Their favorite, according to the Burson-Marsteller survey, is the star-studded weeklong World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
 John Chambers, the chief executive Cisco Systems, is one regular. ''John loves being at Davos,'' said Ron Ricci, a Cisco vice president and speech coach to Mr. Chambers. ''It's a captivatingly productive experience where stuff gets done, and you can't say that about too many places.''
 Some chief executives keep their speaking engagements to a minimum. Tony L. White, chief executive of the Applera Corporation, said he accepted only about a dozen engagements a year. ''I generally don't go to boondoggles in exotic locations,'' he said. He often uses his own allergies -- and his two-year search trying to find a medication that worked for him -- to illustrate the role trial and error plays in drug research.
 Steve Odland, the chief executive of Office Depot, also rejects most invitations. ''I don't like the 'celebrity C.E.O.' approach,'' he said. When he does accept speaking engagements, he often delves into a topic he champions: corporate ethics and his role as chairman of the corporate governance and ethics task force of the Business Roundtable, an organization for chief executives. 
 Experts are not shy about giving advice to executives on how to connect with listeners. ''Most presenters read their slides,'' said Carmine Gallo, a communications coach in San Francisco and author of a book on corporate speech-giving. ''Great communicators don't.'' 
 Herbert D. Kelleher, the former chief executive of Southwest Airlines and now executive chairman of the company's board, gathered his thoughts shortly before a speech, jotting notes on a legal pad or a napkin.
 ''People would ask after he spoke, 'Can I have a copy?' '' said Edward Stewart, senior director of public relations at Southwest. ''We'd say, 'Unfortunately, even Herb doesn't have a copy.'''
 Veterans of the speaking circuit have their own pointers. Ms. Corcoran urges brevity. ''A speech is a sales call,'' Ms. Corcoran said. ''Give just enough, and then stop.''
 Long or short, avoid at all costs ''the dreaded data dump,'' said Mr. Gallo, the speech coach. He lauded John S. Chen, the chief executive of Sybase, for keeping to a dozen slides in an hourlong talk, and Jeff Taylor, the founder of Monster.com, for limiting the information on his slides to about seven words each. But he reserved his highest praise for Mr. Chambers of Cisco, whom he called ''the most electrifying speaker in corporate America today.''
 Fond of strolling the stage and into the audience, Mr. Chambers asks a question or rests a hand on a person's shoulder in the style of an evangelist or television talk-show host. Speaking without notes, he merely glances at PowerPoint slides that he has memorized, and he maintains constant eye contact with his audience.
 It was not always so. Cisco measures the effectiveness of its executives' speeches from quality of content to quality of delivery, and often obtains audience feedback by passing out forms or asking audience members to post anonymous comments on its Web site. As a result of these comments, Mr. Chambers learned to be ''more linear in his storytelling,'' said Mr. Ricci, the Cisco vice president. ''He was good at the plot but needed to be better at the flow of the chapters.''

HEADLINE: Turmoil at the Drug Agency

 BODY:
The surprise resignation of Lester Crawford as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration was announced late Friday, just as Hurricane Rita threatened the shoreline in Texas, a time calculated to minimize attention. Given that Dr. Crawford, a veteran agency official, had been promoted to the top job only two months ago and had given no hint of wanting to quit, his sudden departure bore all the signs of a forced resignation. His stated reason, that at age 67 it was time to step aside, sounds preposterous. An administration spokeswoman called it a personnel issue. One official cited Dr. Crawford's failure to disclose all financial information before confirmation, a charge his wife, Catherine, denies. 
 Whatever the real reason, Dr. Crawford's departure offers an opportunity for improvement at the embattled agency. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's initial moves are not promising.
This page had never been enthusiastic about Dr. Crawford's promotion and had called for the Senate to reject him. There were just too many fiascoes on his watch, including a failure to mitigate the risks that emerged in antidepressant drugs for children and in painkillers for chronic arthritis, and laxness in allowing supplies of influenza vaccine to be disrupted by manufacturing problems. And it didn't help that he repeatedly refused to make a firm decision on whether the so-called morning-after contraceptive pill could be sold without a prescription, a step that would make it more readily available to women worried about pregnancy. 
 With Dr. Crawford now out of the way, it should be possible to reinvigorate the agency. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's stopgap solution -- to appoint Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, currently director of the National Cancer Institute, as the acting commissioner of food and drugs while leaving him at the cancer institute as well -- can only weaken both agencies.
 The F.D.A., with regulatory jurisdiction over huge swaths of the economy, surely needs a full-time steward. This interim appointment could stretch out for some time.
 Whether Dr. von Eschenbach, a urologic surgeon, would be the right man to lead the F.D.A. as a full-time commissioner, should the White House decide to nominate him, would require hard scrutiny by the Senate. His performance at the cancer institute has received mixed reviews. Like many cancer specialists, Dr. von Eschenbach emphasizes the need to get potentially lifesaving drugs approved quickly, a stance that could lead to looser regulation, but the F.D.A.'s recent problems suggest a need to monitor drugs more closely.

HEADLINE: Most Homeowners Not Overly in Debt, Fed Chief Says 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
With new evidence that the housing market remained red hot last month, Alan Greenspan said on Monday that the vast majority of homeowners are not yet stretched too thin. 
 But Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the use of ''exotic'' mortgages could be pushing prices higher and inducing some homebuyers to take on too much risk.
Even as he warned about the increasing use of interest-only loans and no-money-down loans, which can become risky if interest rates rise or housing prices fall, Mr. Greenspan argued that only about 5 percent of all families have borrowed more than 90 percent of the value of their houses. 
 ''The vast majority of homeowners have a sizable equity cushion with which to absorb a potential decline in house prices,'' he said. Mr. Greenspan told a banking conference on Monday that speculation in the housing market may have spilled over into the mortgage markets as more and more people use interest-only loans and other techniques to buy homes they might otherwise be unable to afford.
 ''The dramatic increase in the prevalence of interest-only loans, as well as the introduction of other, more exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages, are developments that bear close scrutiny,'' he said.
 Though such loans have appropriate uses, he continued, they could also provide a way for marginally qualified buyers to borrow heavily and buy homes at inflated prices.
 ''In the event of widespread cooling in house prices, these borrowers, and the institutions that service them, could be exposed to significant losses,'' he continued.
 Though Mr. Greenspan said the vast majority of homeowners were not overextended, his comments on Monday were his sharpest warning yet about the proliferation of new loans that have helped push the household savings to a rate below zero. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that the median sale price of existing homes hit a record $220,000 in August, up 15.8 percent from one year earlier.
 Sales of existing homes climbed 2 percent in August and reached an annual rate of 7.29 million. That was just short of the record 7.35 million, set in June.
 Analysts said there were some hints that the hot housing market may be cooling just a bit. The inventory of homes for sale edged up in August, and the amount of time that houses in many cities are sitting on the market is somewhat longer than earlier this year.
 But many economists contend that a housing bubble is evident in many parts of the nation, especially around big cities on the East and West Coasts, and that housing affordability has declined to an unusually low level even though mortgage interest rates remain at nearly historic lows.
 Mr. Greenspan's message on Monday was twofold: first, that the use of exotic new mortgages could be aggravating the run-up in prices and inducing some families to take on too much risk; second, that the finances of most households are still on solid ground.
 In an indication of his own intense interest in the issue, the Fed chairman cited new data that he had personally assembled in collaboration with his staff.
 With only a few months left before he is scheduled to retire in January, Mr. Greenspan seemed intent on defending his legacy against critics who contend that the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates low contributed to a speculative fever in the housing market.
 Citing new data collected by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan noted that there was little correlation between states with the biggest increases in prices and states with the highest concentrations of multiple loans, called ''piggy back'' loans, that allow people to borrow almost the entire purchase price of a home.
 According to the Fed data, the five states where piggy-back loans were particularly common this year were Texas, California, Utah, Oregon and Colorado. While prices in California have climbed faster than in almost any other state, those in the other four states did not climb faster than average.
 Indeed, the size of the mortgage as a share of the total purchase price tends to be lower in states with the most rapid price appreciation. The reason, Mr. Greenspan hypothesized, is that people in torrid markets like Southern California are selling houses as well as buying them. 
 By any measure, American homeowners have taken on far more debt in the last few years.
 The total amount of outstanding household debt climbed at an annual rate of more than 17 percent in the first half of this year and an average annual rate of 16.4 percent over the previous four years, according to an analysis of Fed data by the Federal Markets Center, a nonprofit research organization in Virginia.
 The amount of cash that people pulled out of their homes by refinancing their mortgages was equal to about 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product last year, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs. 
 Mr. Greenspan predicted on Monday that savings would climb again when interest rates rise and the housing market cools. Many analysts agree, but caution that spending could slow at the same time.

HEADLINE: Half a Step Forward to Rein In Iran 

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration threatened, cajoled and played every card it held to win the split decision Saturday on Iran's nuclear program before the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 Looking ahead, though, that was the easy part.
The agency's board voted by a slim majority to refer Iran to the United Nations Security Council because of an ''absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes,'' the resolution says. But the actual referral cannot take place until the board votes again. That will not be before November, and the outcome then is far from assured. 
 Western diplomats acknowledge that some countries that voted in favor of Saturday's resolution may not vote in favor of the actual referral. A senior diplomat said India, which surprised the West by voting in favor on Saturday, is not promising to vote the same way next time.
 What is more, the composition of the board will change in the weeks ahead, ''and not for the better,'' a European diplomat acknowledged Monday. At least two members that voted with the United States and its European allies will rotate off the board, to be replaced by two, Cuba and Belarus, that are very unlikely to vote with the present majority. 
 A Western diplomat suggested that the difficulties might not be insurmountable. ''Lots of people were saying we might not get a vote in favor of Security Council referral this time, too,'' the diplomat said. 
 Still, realizing that the drive to drag Iran before the Security Council is fraught with uncertainties, senior administration officials have begun talking up a new strategy, one they say they can adopt in concert with the Europeans if the current path reaches an unsatisfactory end. 
 If Iran does not meet the demands of the agency, the United Nations nuclear monitor, Europe has other leverage, a senior administration official said. ''If Europe exhausts the diplomatic options, it would have the leverage of diplomatic sanctions, and economic sanctions,'' the official said, given the ''commercial and trade relations with Iran that most Europeans have.''
 But several European diplomats, in interviews on Monday, said they were dubious at best about that idea. Most of their countries buy oil from Iran, and economic sanctions that led to a boycott of Iranian oil would drive record-high oil prices even higher -- as Iran has pointedly noted. 
 One senior European diplomat said he thought it unlikely that Europe would embrace the idea of trade sanctions.
 ''If you look at North Korea, it's a very poor country, and trade sanctions have not been effective,'' he said. ''How would Iran, a much more rich country, be coerced by trade sanctions?'' Besides, he added, ''oil is fungible, it is a commodity that you cannot easily keep from markets.''
 He and other diplomats insisted that they could not be identified by name under the rules of their foreign ministries.
 European officials say the United States has raised the sanctions idea with them. But ''nobody is ready to talk about that now,'' another European diplomat said, adding that Iran ''is the sort of problem that needs to be dealt with by the Security Council.''
 American officials readily acknowledge that the vote in favor of referral was in part the result of an unexpected, almost providential, act -- a bellicose speech by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran before the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 17. 
 ''It is clear to us that Ahmadinejad's speech at the United Nations last weekend backfired,'' R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said in a briefing for reporters on Saturday. ''It was seen as excessively harsh and uncompromising, and caught the attention of the international community.
 ''Before this speech was made,'' he added, ''most people we were talking to thought a vote like this probably wouldn't be possible.''
 Officials and diplomats acknowledge that they are not likely to be so lucky next time. The senior European diplomat said he and others were pleasantly surprised by Iran's low-key reaction to the vote. 
 ''They didn't come back with a clear condemnation,'' he said. ''They said they were interested in continuing to talk.'' 
 That is what the United States and its European allies are hoping -- that Iran, startled as it was by Saturday's vote, will back down, stop the uranium processing that was restarted last month and return to talks with the Europeans. 
 The next few weeks will ''give Iran a little space to reflect on its options,'' the senior administration official said. 
 That will also give the United States and its allies time to reflect on their own options if Iran does not respond as they hope, because their alternatives do not look so encouraging now.

HEADLINE: TO CONSERVE GAS, PRESIDENT CALLS FOR LESS DRIVING

BYLINE: This article is by David Leonhardt, Jad Mouawad and David E. Sanger.; Carl Hulse, in Washington, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
With fears mounting that high energy costs will crimp economic growth, President Bush called on Americans yesterday to conserve gasoline by driving less. He also issued a directive for all federal agencies to cut their own energy use and to encourage employees to use public transportation.
 ''We can all pitch in,'' Mr. Bush said. ''People just need to recognize that the storms have caused disruption,'' he added, and that if Americans are able to avoid going ''on a trip that's not essential, that would be helpful.'' 
 Mr. Bush promised to dip further into the government's petroleum reserve, if necessary, and to continue relaxing environmental and transportation rules in an effort to get more gasoline flowing.
 On Capitol Hill, senior Republicans called for new legislation that they said would lower energy costs by increasing supply and expanding oil refining capacity over the long run.
 Even though Hurricane Rita caused much less damage to the oil industry than feared, the two recent hurricanes have disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico enough to ensure that Americans are facing a winter of sharply higher energy costs. The price of natural gas, which most families use to heat their homes, has climbed even more than the price of gasoline recently. 
 Households are on pace to spend an average of $4,500 on energy this year, up about $500 from last year and $900 more than in 2003, according to Global Insight, a research firm.
 Mr. Bush's comments, while similar to remarks he made shortly after the disruption from Hurricane Katrina pushed gasoline prices sharply higher, were particularly notable because the administration has long emphasized new production over conservation. It has also opted not to impose higher mileage standards on automakers. 
 In 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney said, ''Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it cannot be the basis of a sound energy policy.'' Also that year, Ari Fleischer, then Mr. Bush's press secretary, responded to a question about reducing American energy consumption by saying ''that's a big no.''
 ''The president believes that it's an American way of life,'' Mr. Fleischer said.
 Mr. Bush, speaking yesterday after he was briefed at the Energy Department, did not use the dour tone or cardigan-wearing imagery that proved politically deadly for Jimmy Carter during the oil crisis of the 1970's. Nor did Mr. Bush propose new policies to encourage conservation. But he was more explicit than in the past that Americans should cut back.
 Oil companies spent much of yesterday assessing the damage from Hurricane Rita, which seemed to spare many oil and gas facilities. Still, the gulf's entire oil output and about four-fifths of its natural gas production remained shut yesterday, less than a month after Katrina left the industry stretched thin.
 The Gulf of Mexico produces about 7 percent of the oil consumed in the United States and provides 16 percent of the nation's natural gas.
 About half of the 16 refineries that were forced to shut by Hurricane Rita have said they plan to restart production soon. But delays in refining pushed the average price of gasoline up again for the first time since Labor Day, to $2.80 a gallon for regular gasoline, according to AAA. 
 Crude oil prices also rose yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing up 2.5 percent, to $65.82 a barrel. Natural gas futures rose 12 cents, to $12.44 a thousand cubic feet.
 ''We've been in a chronic situation here where supplies have not really caught up with demand,'' said Dave Costello, an analyst at the Energy Information Administration.
 In response to higher energy costs, households are likely to spend less on restaurant meals, clothing and other items. That would slow economic growth in coming months, but economists predicted that other forces -- like a continuing housing boom and rising corporate investments in factories and equipment -- would keep the economy growing.
 ''I don't think we're talking about a recession or a near recession,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, a research company in New York. ''I think we're talking about growth that is slower than people expected.''
 Households are now spending about $550 billion a year on energy, up by about $150 billion since the start of last year, according to Global Insight. Over the course of an entire year, the increase would be equal to almost 2 percent of overall consumer spending.
 Energy costs are likely to be a particular burden on low- and middle-income households, whose income growth has barely matched inflation over the last few years. Wealthier households have done better, government data show, and have helped keep economic growth healthy with spending on second homes, new vehicles and the like.
 Although more forecasters, including Federal Reserve officials, remain optimistic, some say that the spike in energy costs could lead to something of a tipping point for consumers. Families have already begun saving less money in response to higher energy costs, and they might eventually decide to rethink other parts of their budget.
 ''The best leading indicator of consumer spending is real average hourly earnings,'' which have been hurt by higher energy costs, said Joseph H. Ellis, a former Goldman Sachs partner and the author of a forthcoming book on the business cycle. ''I think we're heading into a very difficult 2006.''
 In Washington, two House committees are expected to consider proposals this week that have been blocked in the past by environmental objections. Beyond making it easier to build new refineries, one proposal would allow states to opt out of Congressional bans on coastal oil drilling, and another would allow drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has been controversial for years.
 ''Families who are paying more than $3 for a gallon of gasoline cannot afford to watch Congress block more clean U.S. energy production while they suffer,'' said Representative Richard Pombo, Republican of California and chairman of the Resources Committee.
 The oil and gas industry supported the moves. John B. Walker, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of American, said areas now off limits offshore and in Alaska ''could supply our nation with more than 100 years of natural gas -- and save U.S. consumers upward of $500 billion.''
 Environmental groups said drilling advocates were trying to take advantage of anxiety from the storms and rising gasoline prices to push proposals that did not survive in the recently passed energy bill. 
 ''It is kind of sad,'' said Kevin Curtis, legislative director at the National Environmental Trust. ''There is nothing here that helps the consumer at the gas pump short term.''
 While attention has been focused on gasoline prices, the spike in natural gas prices has the potential to pose a bigger economic threat.
 Households that use natural gas will pay an average $1,130 to heat their homes this winter, an increase of almost $400, according to federal government estimates. The price of natural gas in futures markets has more than doubled since 2000 and is six times what it was throughout the 1990's.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 28, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about President Bush's call for greater energy conservation referred incorrectly to the administration's efforts regarding higher fuel economy standards for automakers. While the standards for cars have stayed the same, the administration has indeed raised one standard -- the one for light trucks, which covers sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups -- to 22.2 miles a gallon in 2007 models from 20.7 in 2004 models. It has also proposed increases that the White House expects to raise the standard to 24 miles a gallon for 2011 models of light trucks.

HEADLINE: USAir Picks Its Path; Two Airlines Still Looking

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The ranks of airlines operating under bankruptcy protection thinned yesterday, when US Airways emerged from Chapter 11 status and merged with America West to form the country's largest low-fare airline.
 In a few months, United Airlines wants to be next to come out of court protection, after three tumultuous years in which it has made deep cuts in wages and benefits, terminated its pension plans and remade itself from an employee-owned carrier into one run like the others.
These differing approaches are the paths generally taken by airlines in bankruptcy: cut, as United did, or paste, as US Airways did with America West. But the strategies may offer little in the way of direction for Delta and Northwest, the two carriers that entered bankruptcy protection this month. 
 James P. Womack, a consultant and author of ''Lean Solutions,'' to be published next month, said what Delta and Northwest needed as a role model was an airline version of Toyota -- a big, efficient company able to stay ahead of industry trends and make tons of money doing so.
 On the surface, the two other major carriers, Continental and American, may seem to have role-model qualities. 
 But early this month, Continental -- which used two rounds of bankruptcy protection in the 1980's and 90's to slice its labor costs and develop an efficient, customer-focused operation -- warned that the spike in fuel prices would lead to a significant loss this year, even though it had obtained cutbacks from employees.
 And American, the only big airline that has not filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years, has no protection from sharp rises in fuel prices, a debt load in excess of $20 billion and overdue pension obligations for which it is trying to gain Congressional relief.
 Industry analysts and other specialists said that instead of looking to other airlines as examples, Delta and Northwest should come up with a business model that they insist is necessary for big carriers to survive and thrive.
 Jan K. Brueckner, professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine, said Delta and Northwest had the opportunity to use the bankruptcy filings to free themselves from the vestiges of the regulated era, which permeates the industry even though restrictions on routes and fares were eliminated starting in 1978.
 ''This is deregulation's bite,'' he said. ''These airlines were sheltered until basically 1980. The market has finally beaten them up so that they have to start thinking like carriers that were never regulated.'' 
 Whether Northwest or Delta will take such a tack is not clear. At the moment, Northwest is focused on its demand for $1.4 billion in cuts from its labor unions, including a second round of cuts from pilots. 
 Delta executives, meanwhile, say they are speeding up the reorganization plan they started last year, which was meant to cut costs and make the airline more nimble in the face of low-fare competition.
 Arguably, analysts said, Southwest -- the low-fare airline that carries the most passengers within the United States -- might serve as a Toyota equivalent, given its series of quarterly profits, productivity and superior market capitalization, which is greater than all the other big airlines put together. 
 Many of its work methods, like requiring flight attendants to help clean planes after every flight, and the quick way it turns planes around for the next flight, are being copied by rivals, Northwest and Delta among them.
 But Southwest's operations are fundamentally different than those of its bankrupt rivals. It flies one type of plane, the narrow-body Boeing 737, and it serves only domestic routes, has only one major hub in Chicago and judiciously chooses markets based on demand more than geography.
 By contrast, Delta and Northwest have more than half a dozen kinds of aircraft, operate several hubs, offer substantial international service and blanket their prime operating regions with service to cities of all sizes.
 The trick, analysts say, will be to streamline the way they use their assets and jettison those that are not profitable. Already, both airlines said they planned to eliminate planes and reduce service from less successful hubs, like Cincinnati for Delta and Memphis for Northwest.
 The chief executive of Southwest Airlines, Gary C. Kelly, was not optimistic that major changes would occur at Delta or Northwest.
 ''Bankruptcy laws simply perpetuate the inefficient competitors in this country,'' Mr. Kelly said. 
 None of the major airlines that have entered Chapter 11 in the last decade have vanished, in contrast to the years before, when Eastern, Pan Am and T.W.A. disappeared. ''Instead of allowing the marketplace to sort its way through,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''it actually exacerbates this problem.''
 Nonetheless, J. Douglas Parker, who will be chief executive at US Airways, as the combination of America West and US Airways is to be known, said that the company was starting ''a new chapter in airline history.'' 
 Mr. Parker, the former America West chief executive, who rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to open trading, said the company was set to become the largest low-fare airline, surpassing Southwest, and ranking as fifth-largest over all. 
 Specialists say that both Delta and Northwest could go much further and initiate the next phase in airline revamping: an extensive rethinking of precisely which employees and expertise an airline wants to keep. 
 Airlines already farm out many kinds of jobs, especially reservations agents. Northwest is using contractors and substitute workers to fill in for striking mechanics, and had temporary flight attendants on retainer in case their union went on strike, too. 
 While it is hard to imagine that an airline would not hire its own pilots, some day there could be no need for Delta or Northwest to employ anyone else working on, around or in their planes, labor analysts say.
 And though this may sound far-fetched now, it is the direction in which the world's auto companies seem headed -- farming out design, engineering and manufacturing work.
 Mr. Brueckner of the University of California, Irvine, said such moves represented how Delta and Northwest could teach the industry to move forward. After all, major airlines were responsible for frequent-flier programs and computerized reservations systems, he said. ''I don't think there's a shortage of smarts and creativity in the airlines.''

HEADLINE: Sakhalin's Offshore Reserves Are About to Make Their Debut

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; Jad Mouawad, in New York, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia 

 BODY:
Just north of Japan and across the Pacific from California, a long-forbidden Siberian island is about to join the global energy map. 
 On Oct. 1, three decades after vast pools of oil and gas were discovered off the lonely shores of this former Soviet-era prison colony, a consortium led by Exxon Mobil is to start pumping up to 250,000 barrels of oil a day, its first oil and gas from seven wells drilled deep in the Sea of Okhotsk.
That will be the start of major production from Sakhalin's offshore reserves, a rich energy island province that some geologists call, with a bit of swagger, this decade's Alaska North Slope. Noting the string of ministers flying here from Moscow in September to inspect the newest riches in oil, Galina N. Pavlova, Sakhalin's top energy official, boasted: ''They believe Sakhalin is the second Kuwait.''
 Mapped since the 1970's, the recoverable offshore reserves of Russia's easternmost major island now total 14 billion barrels of oil -- or just over 1 percent of global reserves -- and 96 trillion cubic feet of gas. In 2004 terms, this is the equivalent of four years of United States oil imports. It would yield about 28 years of American gas imports, which account for a relatively small share of consumption. Some of the energy will be headed to American shores. 
 After decades of debate, this long, spindly island eight time zones from Moscow is getting the largest inflow of foreign investment in Russian history. Analysts hope the Sakhalin projects will help increase Russia's output and bring much needed oil and gas supplies to energy-hungry world markets in coming decades. 
 The recent slowdown in Russian output and the Kremlin's tighter grip on its energy sector have raised concerns over the investment climate in Russia. But with much of the Middle East shut off to foreign oil companies, Russia still offers some of the best prospects for growth in oil supplies.
 The Exxon-led consortium is doling out $12.8 billion, and a second group, led by Royal Dutch Shell, is spending $20 billion to produce oil and gas and to build Russia's first liquefied natural gas plant. 
 ''This is the largest integrated gas project in the world,'' said Ate Visser, commercial director for the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, the Shell-led group that has an army of 17,000 workers on Sakhalin. 
 BP is exploring a third section for energy resources. Nine additional offshore sections remain virtually untouched.
 Sakhalin promises to be a cash cow that will loom large in calculations of Russian economic might. By 2050, the companies project it will have filled Moscow's coffers with $85 billion in oil revenues, royalties and taxes -- $45 billion from the Shell project and $40 billion from the Exxon project. 
 Twelve days by tanker across the North Pacific from California, Sakhalin may also prompt Americans to start looking to Russia for oil and gas. Until now, Russia, with 6 percent of the world's known oil and 27 percent of its known gas, largely produced in western Russia to sell to Western Europe. 
 Much of Sakhalin's energy will power China, Japan and South Korea. But recently, work started on a terminal in northern Mexico that is intended to receive liquefied natural gas shipments from Sakhalin in the summer of 2008. This gas will then head by pipeline to California.
 By 2008, Shell and Exxon should also be pumping a total of 550,000 barrels of oil a day into tankers, placing 10 percent of Russia's overall oil production onto Pacific waters and the international spot market.
 Starting with two huge offshore drilling platforms now in place up north, the Shell project is building two 400-mile pipelines, one for oil and one for gas. These will end at Aniva, where 7,250 workers, one third of them foreigners, are building a $2.5 billion liquefied gas plant and deepwater loading terminals on a bay 90 miles northeast of Japan.
 To Shell's chagrin, its gas-field-to-carrier project has become the largest in the world, partly because the overall 10-year project cost estimate doubled in July, to $20 billion. The overruns seem to stem from the difficulties of doing business in Russia and from rosy calculations made in 2003 to win final project approval by the Russian government, the ultimate owner of most oil and gas produced after constructions bills have been paid.
 Shell, which owns 55 percent of the project, says the cost overrun resulted from the dollar's 25 percent fall against the euro, the rising cost of Russian labor in the boomtown atmosphere here, rising costs of pipeline steel and oil, and expenses incurred to minimize disturbances to an endangered population of 100 western gray whales that feed every summer in Shell's production area.
 ''We will insist on a very meticulous audit of this,'' Ms. Pavlova, director of oil and gas for Sakhalin's regional government, said of the swelling cost. ''We will be meeting with Shell through the winter.''
 Last July, Shell disclosed the $10 billion cost overrun only one week after Shell and Gazprom, Russia's state oil monopoly, announced an asset swap. The swap was intended to bring a powerful Russian partner into an all-foreign project here. But now, the two companies are embroiled in what are to be yearlong talks to calculate a price difference that Shell needs to pay Gazprom to even the deal.
 ''It has been a hard swallow for our shareholders,'' Mr. Visser said of Japan's minority shareholders, Mitsui & Company, with 25 percent, and the Mitsubishi Corporation, with 20 percent. ''But it also has been a hard swallow for Shell. But people only see one side of the story, that costs have doubled, but not that the price of oil has also doubled.''
 Increasingly nationalistic, Russia restricts foreign investment to the most technically challenging energy developments, largely offshore and in the Arctic. Russian state companies, for example, have pumped oil from onshore wells here since the 1930's. But after production dwindled, Russia sought foreign expertise for offshore work. 
 ''Originally, Russia needed foreign companies for technology and for the money,'' said William Dinty Miller, senior vice president of BP Sakhalin. Referring to Russia's soaring foreign currency reserves in the era of $70-a-barrel oil, he added: ''Now the money argument has gone by the wayside.'' 
 Despite the controversy, work is on track at the liquefied gas plant here. From a window of a commercial flight one recent morning, a chalk-yellow trench for two pipelines, one for gas, the other for oil, could be seen coursing south from this island capital. 
 At present, two gas-processing ''trains'' are under construction, giving the plant an annual capacity of 9.6 million tons. Around the world, the plant here is rivaled in size only by Qatargas-2, a plant in Qatar that is to produce 15.6 million tons of liquefied gas by the end of 2007. On Sakhalin, room has been left to expand the project by a third. One future supply source would be the fields Exxon is to start tapping on Oct. 1. Exxon's oil and gas, from fields with recoverable reserves estimated at 2.3 billion barrels of oil and 17.1 trillion cubic feet of gas, will flow into an existing Russian-owned pipeline network, drawn from seven wells drilled by the Yastreb rig of Exxon. 
 The land-based rig allows for wells to be drilled to points seven miles offshore, a strategy to minimize the environmental impact and to minimize the number of offshore platforms in a harsh region known for Arctic cold fronts that blow down from Siberia.
 Stephen Terni, the president of Exxon-Neftegas Ltd., summed it up for Russian and American executives here on Sept. 12, echoing typical Texas-style talk of the past, now translated to Russia's energy frontier: ''The shore-based rig, the Yastreb, is the largest and the most powerful land rig ever built.''

HEADLINE: Income Down From 1999, Tax Data Show 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The total income of Americans in 2003, adjusted for inflation, was 4 percent smaller than in 1999, new tax return data showed yesterday.
 While the number of taxpayers grew by 5.6 million individuals and couples, average income fell even more -- by 6.5 percent -- while the average wage slipped slightly, with the average job paying $5 a week less.
 Over all, incomes were $263 billion lower in 2003 than in 1999 when adjusted for inflation to 2004 dollars, according to data that the Internal Revenue Service posted yesterday on its Web site. 
 Most of this decline occurred among investors and others with incomes of $1 million or more. The number of Americans making that much fell by 12 percent, to 181,300 taxpayers in 2003, from 205,124 in 1999. Their average income fell, too, to just under $3 million, a decline of more than $572,000, or 16 percent. Over all, the income of this group fell by $190 billion, or 72 percent, of the total decline.
 The figures at the top may be misleading, though, because the I.R.S. is much more accurate in capturing wage income than income from businesses and investments. 
 Because there is little independent reporting of some types of income, like small-business profits and real estate income, numerous studies have shown it is underreported, and the last two I.R.S. commissioners have warned that such cheating is on the rise.
 In addition, a sharp decline in audits combined with the marketing of devices to help people understate their true income make figures for the highest nonwage incomes less reliable. Generally these strategies, which range from the little known but legal to criminal tax evasion, do not work for wage earners.
 The I.R.S. final report on 2003 tax returns showed that accounting for inflation, the average adjusted gross income reported that year was $48,187, down $3,341 per taxpayer, from $51,528 in 1999. Average income peaked in 2000 at $53,231, almost $100 a week more than the average income in 2003. 
 Average wages in 2003 were $42,456, down 0.6 percent from $42,716 in 1999. That is the equivalent of an average pay cut of $5 a week, analysis of the tax data by The New York Times showed. The average wage peaked in 2000 at $43,761 and has been falling slowly each year since. The total adjusted gross income reported on tax returns in 2003, adjusted for inflation, was nearly $6.3 trillion, down more than a quarter of a trillion dollars, or 4 percent, from 1999.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court to Determine Fate of Business Tax Credits

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether a popular tax credit, which most states use to encourage businesses to make capital investments, violates the Constitution.
 The case is an appeal by the State of Ohio and the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, which received an Ohio investment tax credit for building a Jeep plant in a depressed area of Toledo, of a court ruling that a benefit of this type interferes unconstitutionally with interstate commerce.
The ruling, made in October by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, provoked an outpouring of criticism from tax experts and business groups. It created an unsettled situation within the Sixth Circuit because the Supreme Court of Michigan, one of four states in the circuit, has upheld a similar credit in that state. 
 Ford Motor and General Motors supported Chrysler's appeal, as did the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Governors Association and many other groups.
 In its ruling, the appeals court said it was unquestionably ''legitimate for Ohio to structure its tax system to encourage intrastate economic activity.'' But it said the tax credit at issue had the effect of hindering ''free trade among the states'' by providing an incentive for local expansion rather than out-of-state expansion.
 The constitutional source of the problem, in the appeals court's view, is the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress authority to regulate interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court's precedents, the clause also carries the implication that states may not adopt policies that interfere with interstate commerce. 
 Most recently in this line of cases, the Supreme Court in its last term invalidated state laws that barred out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in those states that permitted direct shipment by in-state wineries.
 The appeal that the court accepted on Tuesday, DaimlerChrysler Corporation v. Cuno, No. 04-1704, called the appeals court's decision ''an extraordinary departure from any common-sense understanding of the Commerce Clause.'' 
 The purpose of the Ohio law, the appeal said, was ''to reward intrastate investment,'' not to discriminate against any other state. The decision ''calls into question the constitutionality of all state income tax and related business incentives,'' the appeal brief added.
 Ohio's separate appeal, Wilkins v. Cuno, No. 04-1724, which the court also accepted, said that since 1995, business had invested more than $30 billion in Ohio, ''money that could just as easily have gone to another state or another country,'' because of the state's tax credit. The credit against the state's corporate franchise tax, which can be spread over 10 years, is 7.5 percent, raised to 13.5 percent if the capital investment is in a ''distressed area.''
 Ohio's brief said that 46 states offer some form of investment credit, often identified with special enterprise zone programs. The only four states without such credits are those that have no corporate franchise tax: Nevada, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming.
 The challenge to the Ohio tax credit was brought by several plaintiffs, including taxpayers who disapprove of the program, Michigan taxpayers who said they were harmed by Chrysler's decision to build its Jeep plant in Ohio rather than in Michigan and a property owner whose land was taken for the Jeep plant by eminent domain.
 The plaintiffs said the Sixth Circuit's opinion was correct but the Supreme Court should still hear the case. The issues ''are of broad national importance, because they will apply to a range of comparable business tax incentives offered by many states,'' the plaintiffs said.
 They added that they did not intend to single out Ohio, but rather wanted the Supreme Court to ''free all the states from the necessity of engaging in an escalating competition over incentives that deprives all of them of needed revenues.''

HEADLINE: Two-Year-Old Mall Fetches a Premium Price 

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 22 

 BODY:
Barely two years after it opened, the Source at White Plains, a gleaming four-story shopping center that cost $96 million to build and is home to Fortunoff, Whole Foods Market and Cheesecake Factory, has been sold.
 The imposing 260,000-square-foot complex, near Exit 8 of Interstate 287, fetched $153 million for the seller, R Squared, a three-year-old development partnership in New York City and Long Island led by members of the family behind the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust.
 ''It's not that anything was wrong with the property or that it was underperforming,'' said Mitchell Rechler, a principal with R Squared, noting that the complex is fully leased. ''It was about what was so right with the Source.'' 
 ''Basically,'' Mr. Rechler explained, ''over the last year, we noticed where prices in White Plains were going, and we decided that if we could, we'd sell this shopping center and deploy the proceeds elsewhere.''
 Patrice Duker, a spokeswoman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade organization based in Manhattan, said the sale of the Source just three years after construction began reflects the intense retailing and residential growth -- and the concomitant increase in real estate values -- taking place in downtown White Plains. ''Other cities are also going through growth spurts,'' Ms. Duker said, ''but the growth in White Plains is extraordinary.''
 The buyer of the shopping complex is Bloomingdale Road Investors, a unit of UBS, the Zurich-based bank. ''UBS acquired the property because it's in a densely populated area and has a strong roster of tenants,'' said Peter Casey, a spokesman for UBS Global Asset Management. He added that no changes in the tenants or the structure itself were planned. ''We see it as a long-term stable investment.''
 The complex is across Maple Avenue from the Westchester, a much larger mall that is the most upscale in the county, and about a half mile north of a stand-alone Bloomingdale's department store. It will continue to be managed by R Squared Management, an arm of R Squared. The tenant list at the Source also includes a Morton's steakhouse and Destination Maternity. 
 According to the 2005 Global Report from NAI Friedland Realty, a real estate company serving the New York area, sales of retailing properties in Westchester County averaged $225 a square foot. The price for the Source was far higher, at $588 a square foot.
 Malachy Kavanagh, another spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, attributed the premium price for the Source to its ''extremely high-performing tenants.''
 An affiliate of the buyer, UBS Realty, is one of the nation's largest managers of real estate investments, with approximately $11.3 billion in assets, including more than 29,000 apartment units, 19.5 million square feet of office space, 26.4 million square feet of industrial space, 4.2 million square feet of retailing space and nine hotels. 
 Last spring, UBS Realty Investors paid about $95 million to buy the 432-room Westin Galleria hotel in Dallas attached to the Dallas Galleria shopping mall, which UBS purchased in 2002.
 R Squared owns and operates more than seven million square feet of property in new and redevelopment projects in the New York region. It was founded by Mr. Rechler and a cousin, Gregg Rechler, and invests in retail, residential, storage, commercial lofts, hotels and industrial properties. Mr. Rechler said the company had no properties when it broke off from Reckson.
 The company said it was planning a residential project in TriBeCa in Manhattan and Big Box Crossing in Commack on Long Island, a 360,000-square-foot retailing center with a Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Kohl's. R Squared has also recently purchased a 59-unit apartment building in Hoboken for a redevelopment project, Mr. Rechler said. In all, the company is working on eight different developments, he said.
 Mr. Rechler said the company was not planning to sell any of its other assets. ''Usually, we're in something for the long run,'' he said.
 The Source was built on the site of a Saks department store, whose owners closed it in 2002 because it was underperforming. When White Plains officials learned of the planned closing, they contacted Fortunoff, which had been looking for a site in Westchester County for nearly 20 years. In turn, it brought the Rechlers and EDGE Partners, a related company, into the deal. Principals in all three companies share longstanding family relationships. 
 After acquiring the site from the city of White Plains for $14 million, R Squared demolished the Saks and hired the Boston-based architects Arrowstreet to design a new upscale shopping and dining center opposite from the Westchester, that would attract the shoppers who frequent that mall, which has Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom as anchors.
 Last spring, a majority stake in Fortunoff, an 82-year-old chain based in Westbury, N.Y., was sold for $250 million to two private investment groups: Trimaran Capital Partners and K Group. The 13-store chain offers jewelry, household decorations and other gift items. A stake in R Squared was held by individual members of the Fortunoff family, but not by the chain itself.
 Eastdil Realty in New York City brokered the sale of the Source, said David Robinov, a sales agent. He said the property was on the market for about two months and that there had been ''a number of bidders,'' although he would not name them.
 Eastdil was also involved in the construction financing of the Westchester, which was similarly sold shortly after it opened in the mid-1990's. The Westchester is now jointly owned by the Simon Property Group and the California Public Employees Retirement System.

HEADLINE: Shop Owners See Where a Storm of Scavenging Left Its Mark

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
Most business owners in the French Quarter of New Orleans were lucky. 
 The electricity was cut, yes, and clean water stopped flowing. And an unholy gumbo of food and beer and soggy trash has been cooking in the relentless heat for weeks since the hurricane. But on its tiny elevated plot (about half a square mile) along the Mississippi River, the French Quarter was left dry and intact. 
Mostly.
 On Monday, Mayor C. Ray Nagin officially invited business owners in several neighborhoods, including the French Quarter, to come back and have a look -- the first crucial step toward reopening the economic heart of Louisiana's tourist industry. 
 More than 10 million visitors spent nearly $5 billion in New Orleans last year, according to the city's Convention and Visitor's Bureau, accounting for about 60 percent of all visitor spending in the state. And roughly 85 percent of New Orleans tourism is concentrated in and around the French Quarter. 
 ''The Quarter, Central Business District and other areas are bustling with life,'' the bureau said in a cheery statement yesterday, ''as some businesses are cleaned and repaired and others are open for limited, but celebrated, operation.''
 But even having been spared the worst of Katrina, the news is not so good for some business owners in the Quarter, now making their way back from Texas, Georgia and Florida. And for a group of shop owners along the 200 block of Dauphine Street, in the northwest corner of the Vieux Carre between Iberville Street and Bienville Avenue, the homecoming is particularly grim. 
 About a foot of water had lapped into the area, and mildew and mold now crawl up the walls of four of Wallace Rodriguez's five clothing and shoe boutiques on that block. The shops, all named Dress to Kill, were established during the last four years by Mr. Rodriguez, who spent years outfitting showgirls at Rick's Cabaret on Bourbon Street. 
 What the flood did not destroy, looters did. The window of the Dress to Kill Eveningwear shop at 215 Dauphine was smashed, and nearly every item stolen. Maimed mannequin torsos lay strewn across the soiled carpet, while twisted clothes hangers and broken racks suggested the frenzy of lawless opportunism that took hold in the hours after the storm. 
 A few doors down, at the Dress to Kill Shoes and Accessories outlet, another window was shattered. Small mounds of emptied shoeboxes, stray pumps and toppled shelves covered the floors. ''On the one hand, it's quite a compliment,'' Mr. Rodriguez said in a phone interview on Monday. ''If people were willing to break in and risk getting shot in the dark to get my inventory, that's flattering.'' 
 But the grim reality, Mr. Rodriguez said, is that the mixture of Mother Nature and human nature has left him with nearly $1 million in structural damage and inventory losses, on top of lost sales. 
 ''It makes me sad,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, who has in the last few weeks opened up a store in Baton Rouge, where he planted stakes after first fleeing to stay with relatives in Houston. He estimates that it will take six months to reopen his shops in the French Quarter.
 ''It's sad because what we sell are nonessential items,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''and to think that people were in there looting, not trying to find something to eat or drink, but just looting, that's what bothered me more than anything.''
 It was a scene repeated up and down the block, including the French Quarter Florist shop, where Ruth Nix had been doing business for 15 years. 
 Ms. Nix and Mr. Rodriguez had exchanged cellphone numbers before she picked up her 86-year-old mother and drove to Baton Rouge on Aug. 27, the Saturday before Katrina hit. When power was lost in Baton Rouge, Ms. Nix made her way to Dallas, where she and her mother have stayed with family, for the most part. 
 Ms. Nix said in a phone interview on Monday that she planned to return to the French Quarter later this week. She had already learned from neighbors that her house, near the failed levee at 17th Street in the Lakeview section, was completely gone. Mr. Rodriguez called Ms. Nix on Monday to tell her that her shop had been looted, too, and probably flooded. 
 ''I'm really not sure what I'm going to do,'' Ms. Nix said. ''At this stage of my life -- I'm 55 -- and it's almost like starting again. I don't think the business is going to be there for the next couple years, and I'm dependent on the tourist trade.'' 
 Ms. Nix said that before she left, she had seen some of the employees at Annette's Cafe next door boarding up, but that she had not done the same, given the approach of Katrina. But even at Annette's -- a Dauphine Street fixture serving up a popular blend of jambalaya, Greek food and old-fashioned diner breakfasts for the last 14 years -- boarding the windows was not enough. 
 ''We'd boarded up the big windows for Mardi Gras and for other storms before,'' said Naomi Regan, the daughter of the cafe's owner, Annette Truschinger, who is now in Florida staying with friends. ''But we'd never boarded up the door window. Who would have thought?'' 
 Ms. Regan returned to New Orleans last Thursday. The window in the cafe's door had been smashed and the cash register beaten open. The refrigerator had been emptied, and debris littered the floor. The stench of rotting food and mold was so powerful that Ms. Regan was forced to leave quickly. 
 But Ms. Regan said there was no question that the cafe -- and the Quarter -- would rise again. 
 ''We're New Orleans-bound. We're not going anywhere,'' she said, adding that she would return to the cafe with an insurance adjuster this week, and begin the cleanup before her mother comes back to the city. 
 ''She needs to stay gone for a little bit longer,'' Ms. Regan said. ''I do not want her to see that.''

HEADLINE: DECLINE IS SEEN IN IMMIGRATION 

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
For years it seemed that immigration to the United States could only rise. Now a new study, based on a year-by-year analysis of government data, shows a startlingly different pattern: Migration to the United States peaked in 2000 and has declined substantially since then. 
 And in New York, the historic gateway to the nation's newcomers, the influx is now lower than it has been for more than 15 years.
Both phenomena underscore the growing importance of illegal immigrants from Mexico, said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior researcher at the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group, which released the study yesterday. And they indicate that post-9/11 security measures have had a greater impact on legal immigration than on illegal entry. 
 Though the level of immigration to the United States has subsided by about 25 percent from a peak of 1.5 million a year in 1999 and 2000, more annual immigration is now illegal than legal, the study found. Over all, the number of immigrants entering the country has followed the growth of the American economy. But in New York, the boom years did not draw the numbers of illegal Mexican immigrants that drove up immigration rates elsewhere.
 There are signs of a fresh upturn in immigration nationally, the study showed, but the level remains at roughly what it was in the early 1990's before the short-lived spike. 
 ''Immigrants are still coming to New York,'' Mr. Passel cautioned, noting that the state continued to receive more newcomers than all but three others, California, Texas and Florida. ''The foreign-born population continues to grow. What we're saying here about New York, specifically, is that their share of the new arrivals has clearly gone down a lot.''
 Indeed, the numbers Mr. Passel assembled show New York to be unique in an unfamiliar way, since immigration is the city's legendary life's blood, the heart of its claim to be the capital of the world: New York was the only state that showed no upturn in immigrant arrivals at the turn of the 21st century. 
 Instead, its inflow of newcomers peaked between 1990 and 1995, gradually declined as other states were peaking, and fell again after 2001, to about 90,000 annually, down from 168,000 in 1990. The vast majority of immigration to the state is concentrated in New York City.
 But Joseph Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division, said immigration itself was only one factor in the city's growth. With some 3.2 million foreign-born residents -- a record number -- high birthrates among immigrants are key. More than 6 in 10 babies born in the city since 2000 have at least one foreign-born parent.
 And the city's sheer diversity also makes a difference. 
 ''New York, as you know, has all these vibrant immigrant communities, and over time they serve as magnets for these immigrants,'' Mr. Salvo said. ''They keep coming here almost irrespective of economic conditions.''
 But not, Mr. Passel said, irrespective of more stringent security measures and backlogs that have cut back legal immigration everywhere. Since the Department of Homeland Security took over the gatekeeper role after Sept. 11, 2001, it has been much harder to get a visa, he noted, and the admission of refugees has plummeted. 
 The study calculated that the number of legal permanent residents entering the United States declined to 455,000 last year from 647,000 at the peak in 2000. The number of unauthorized immigrants, including those who overstay visitors' visas, surpassed the number of legal entrants at the peak with 662,000 and remained higher; it was estimated at 562,000 last year. Legal, temporary residents declined to 174,000 from a peak of 268,000.
 ''There seems to have been a tradeoff here between legal and illegal immigration,'' Mr. Passel said. ''Basically, we got about 1.1 to 1.2 million throughout the '90s and post-2002. We're getting roughly the same number, but the legals went down.'' The proportion of authorized immigrants went from more than half to 4 out of 10, he said.
 That affects New York more than other places, because it has a very high percentage of legal immigrants, in contrast with states like Texas, Illinois and even North Carolina and Arizona, he added, citing an earlier study that estimated the percentage of immigrants who are legally in New York at more than 80 percent, compared with about 50 percent in many other states. 
 ''On the legal immigration side, it's like a crowd pushing against a gate: There's only room for so many to get through,'' he said. ''We have a real drop in legal inflows. Illegal inflows went up. New York's affected by that, because it doesn't get its proportionate share of illegals.''
 In terms of immigrant destinations, the study confirms a long-recognized trend away from the ''big six'' traditionally immigrant states -- California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas -- which still receive 57 percent of immigrants, toward so-called new growth states like Iowa and North Carolina. The foreign-born pioneers to such states in the 1990's now serve as a magnet for friends and relatives from abroad, especially when jobs are plentiful, Mr. Passel said.
 The study draws on five different types of data gathered by the Census Bureau, including information about what year foreign-born respondents to the census entered the country, and where respondents to interim surveys lived the year before. 
 Mr. Salvo praised the study, but he pointed out that it did not address domestic migration of the foreign born, which is now bringing more Mexican and Central American immigrants to New York from the Southwestern states where they first settled.
 And Nancy Foner, a sociology professor at Hunter College who has written widely on three centuries of immigration in the city, put the study's bottom line in perspective.
 ''This is a decline, but it's still incredibly high,'' she said. ''If we're getting 90,000 a year, that's huge. And the story of immigration in New York is not just the story of continued new immigrants, but also the story of the children of immigrants.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about a study showing that migration to the United States has been declining substantially after a peak in 2000 referred incorrectly in some copies to the study's estimate of temporary residents who entered the United States legally last year. It was 174,000, not 185,000.

HEADLINE: The Little Engine That Could

BYLINE: By Otis White. 
Otis White, a public policy consultant, is a columnist for Governing magazine.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
WE'VE learned a lot about evacuating cities in recent days, much of it deeply troubling. But if the failures of New Orleans and the gridlock of Houston show anything, it's that we urgently need a third way out of cities, something other than flying or driving. Fortunately, there is such a way: passenger rail. 
 If local and federal authorities had worked with Amtrak to make better use of its trains in New Orleans, thousands could have been evacuated before the worst of Katrina hit. And if Houston had gone ahead with earlier proposals to develop high-speed rail links, the same might have been true there.
For decades, two myths have stymied efforts to develop intercity rail systems outside the Northeast: that rail can't compete with cars and airplanes and that the only region where passenger rail has been successful, the Northeast, has unique characteristics. Both are wrong. 
 True, long-distance rail will never work as anything other than a tourist attraction. (And this is what Amtrak delivers in most parts of the country: long, slow, nostalgic, ultimately useless train trips.) But trains -- and in particular high-speed services like Amtrak's Acela -- work wonderfully for trips of 100 to 500 miles. These middle distances are too short for efficient air travel, where you spend more time in airports than in the air, and too long for comfortable auto travel. At these distances, rail passengers can travel downtown to downtown in about the time it takes to fly and catch a cab, and have a more comfortable, productive journey to boot.
 But what about the Northeastern myth -- that rail works there only because of the spacing of the cities? Are there other big cities 100 to 500 miles apart? There are dozens of them. To name one pair, Houston and Dallas are 246 miles apart, about the same as New York to Washington or New York to Boston. Or Chicago and Detroit (279 miles); Eugene, Ore., and Seattle (310 miles); or Miami and Orlando (264 miles). 
 The challenge with passenger rail has always been its financing and management. On the one hand, high-speed rail requires big upfront investments: you have to retrofit tracks for 125-mile-an-hour trains, build stations and buy locomotives and cars, investments that are seen as too great for private enterprise. On the other hand, the Amtrak experience shows that governments usually don't run good railroads. The answer, then, is a public-private partnership, with federal and state governments paying upfront costs and helping private companies buy the trains, and private companies running the routes and maintaining the equipment from that point forward.
 So why hasn't this happened already? Because, as with so many other things in government, it was hard to see the most tragic consequences of our inadequate and overwhelmed urban transportation systems until a crisis struck. Before Aug. 29, when Hurricane Katrina came ashore, most people knew only the annoyances of delayed flights and crowded highways. Now, thanks to the people left in New Orleans and those stuck on the roads outside Houston, we understand the dangers as well. 
 If the federal government needed another reason to support the development of modern, high-speed passenger rail, then here it is. Not only can it reduce congestion, save energy and strengthen regional economies, in times of emergency it could be a critical third way out.

HEADLINE: Interior Secretary Says U.S. Will Push Search for Energy

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said Tuesday that after the two destructive gulf hurricanes that battered the nation's energy heartland, the Bush administration would intensify its push to expand energy development on public lands including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in the nation's coastal waters.
 ''The vulnerability of having all the energy supplies and refining and processing capacity in one geographic area reinforces the idea that we need diversity of supply,'' Ms. Norton said in an interview.
Citing government reports on the increasing demand for petroleum and natural gas and the sustained high prices that tend to result, she said, ''The hurricanes have brought more attention to the fundamental issue.'' 
 While Ms. Norton took no position on a Congressional proposal to end a 25-year moratorium on oil leases on the outer continental shelf and to eliminate internal departmental appeals of administration decisions to lease public lands, she did not reject its approach. 
 She said she had read only a two-page summary of the measure, which is before the House Resources Committee, but she was open to the idea of alternative energy development on public lands. 
 In a wide-ranging interview in her spacious, wood-paneled office, the secretary -- one of the few Cabinet members to serve since the opening days of the Bush presidency -- spoke of what she deemed the flaws in the Endangered Species Act and of her worries about restrictions on some activities in national parks. But she carefully sidestepped any endorsement of final solutions. 
 Ms. Norton's remarks came at a time of intense debate over efforts by Congress or the administration to reshape longstanding laws and policies on matters within her department's purview, among them oil leasing practices, protection of endangered species and management of the national parks. 
 But while cautious about endorsing legislation or making new policy pronouncements, Ms. Norton left little doubt that she would continue her efforts to reshape the policies and practices that have restrained private interests -- be they energy exploration companies or the makers of recreational vehicles like motorized water scooters and all-terrain vehicles -- that seek greater access to public lands.
 Craig Manson, an assistant interior secretary, who joined Ms. Norton for the interview, defended the review of national park management policies. 
 Permissible ''impacts'' on park lands, Mr. Manson said, are confused with impermissible ''impairments.''
 ''Footprints are going to be made if people are in the parks,'' he said. ''But that's not necessarily an impairment.''
 The 1916 law creating the park service, known as the Organic Act, says its purpose is ''to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife'' of parkland and ''to provide for the enjoyment'' of these in a way that ''will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.'' 
 Citing this law, Mr. Manson said, ''It's important that there be a balance between the two aspects of the mandate.'' 
 He added, ''From time to time those two aspects sometimes get out of balance.'' 
 The ''bulk of the work'' of the current rewrite of department policies set in 2001 -- a rare occurrence, as rewrites are not usually done so frequently -- will be handled by ''park service management,'' Mr. Manson said. 
 A draft revision of the management policies that govern more than 390 units of the park system produced sharp denunciations by the National Parks Conservation Association and a group of retired park employees, who said it was catering to commercial interests, like the manufacturers of often noisy recreational vehicles, at the expense of conserving park resources.
 While saying that the revisions were a work in progress, Ms. Norton did say that she found it hard to see how noise, like the noise of recreational vehicles, impaired park resources. 
 ''Sound is an instantaneous issue,'' she said, adding: ''There are things that need to be dealt with in terms of the enjoyment of current visitors. Clearly, current visitors are the ones impacted. But we tend to lump all of that under impairment.''
 Construction of cellphone towers, Ms. Norton said, is not necessarily deleterious to park landscapes.
 ''Cellphone towers are an issue,'' she said, ''but the scale of land use of a cellphone tower is a very tiny impact. We have some cellphone towers that are disguised within buildings, or fake tree cellphone towers. There are ways you can do it without impact.''
 The two officials took no stand on the rewrite of the Endangered Species Act that the House is scheduled to consider Thursday. But they made clear their openness to the act's two major proposed changes. 
 The first would replace the current process of designating areas of ''critical habitat'' deemed essential by biologists for the recovery of an endangered species with a slower and less binding process of identifying ''specific areas that are of special value to the conservation of the species.''
 It also proposes the use of financial inducements to win landowner cooperation and the reimbursement of landowners who, because of the law, must forgo economic benefit their property would have provided.

HEADLINE: Mississippi May Move Its Casinos Ashore

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Sept. 27 

 BODY:
Just a month after Hurricane Katrina smashed Mississippi's casino gambling boats, the state Legislature opened a special session Tuesday devoted to how and whether to salvage an industry that has been central to the economy of the Gulf Coast.
 Saying that placing such structures on the water is no longer safe, Gov. Haley Barbour instantly generated controversy by proposing that casinos, previously restricted to boats moored along the state's southern coast or the Mississippi River, be allowed to move as much as 1,500 feet inland. The casinos had been built on barges because, under Mississippi law, they had to float to keep them physically separate from nearby communities. 
Mr. Barbour called the moment an opportunity to rebuild the coast into a world-class destination resort made up of sprawling, state-of-the-art entertainment complexes rather than simply rebuilding what was there. ''In 30 years, when I'm dead and gone, people will look at the south coast and look at what it has become,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''If it has become just another version of what it had been, we will have failed.''
 But many of the state's religious leaders, who have opposed casino gambling from the beginning, were trying to seize the moment to shut down the casinos. ''It is unfortunate that with all the human needs in Mississippi right now, the gambling-political complex has chosen this unfortunate time to try to expand its influence,'' said William Perkins, spokesman for the Mississippi Baptist Convention Board.
 Other proposals made by the governor on Tuesday included a $25 million package of bridge loans for small businesses; a short-term line of credit of up to $500 million to keep state and local governments running until federal relief money arrives; and various bills intended to waive deadlines and limit penalties for those whose lives were uprooted by the storm.
 But the emergence of gambling as the central issue of the session highlighted how crucial the tax money generated by casinos has become to the economy of Mississippi and other states that have gradually allowed the expansion of the industry over the last two decades.
 In Mississippi, which has among the nation's lowest tax rates for casinos, 12 percent of gambling revenues go to the government -- 8 percent to the state and 4 percent to the county where the casino is. The casinos were projected to bring in $189 million to state tax coffers in the coming fiscal year, a number that has been steadily and rapidly rising since casinos first became legal here in 1990.
 The governor teared up twice in his speech, once when praising his wife's efforts to help hurricane victims and again at the end, describing how he would not allow Mississippi to miss this opportunity. ''Let's lead a renaissance for Mississippi,'' he said.
 Many of the state's religious leaders were unmoved.
 ''When he was running for governor in 2003, he sat in my office twice and told me he would not expand the gambling industry,'' said Donald E. Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, a conservative social policy organization based in Tupelo. ''His constituency was the money people and the moral people, but he's chosen to split his constituency and side with the money people. Well, they may have the money, but we have the people, we have the votes, and he's going to pay.''
 Mr. Barbour, a Republican who was once the national party chairman, said his position was entirely consistent with what he said during his campaign, since all he had promised was to stop the spread of gambling to new Mississippi counties.
 But Mr. Perkins said: ''Well, it all depends on what you mean by expand. We certainly understood him to mean that the way the casinos were was the way they would remain. What he's talking about here sure sounds like expansion to us.''
 When casinos were first legalized in Mississippi, gambling was limited to a few boats that would pick up customers and ferry them offshore to gamble. Then, legislators decided to allow the casinos to operate even if they were permanently moored to the shore, as long as they remained on the water.
 And last year, the legislature voted to allow the casinos to sink pilings into the sea floor, to more safely secure the structures. But before such construction could be undertaken, Katrina came along and destroyed most of the coast's gambling boats.
 Under Mr. Barbour's proposal, operators could build casinos as much as 1,500 feet inland, as long as they also had some sort of structure right on the beach like a hotel that linked the casino to the water.
 Religious leaders, however, said the proposal could eventually lead to casinos overrunning the state until there were slot machines in almost every gas station and saloon, as there are in neighboring Louisiana.
 ''We keep taking little baby steps toward what we fear is a total takeover of the state by the gambling-political complex,'' Mr. Perkins said.
 Hearings on the new legislation opened this afternoon, and Representative Bobby Moak, the House Gaming Committee chairman, said he expected the bill might go to the House floor as early as Wednesday. It is then that antigambling advocates intend to try to add amendments aimed at maintaining the status quo, or perhaps even rolling back gambling in the state.
 ''You have as many proposals out there as you have groups,'' Mr. Moak said. ''The governor says 1,500 feet. Industry folks want it to be more. Religious leaders don't want the casinos to move at all. Frankly, it's a big row over what has come down to a few feet.''
 But some religious leaders say they see an opportunity to change the law in a way that might, potentially, end all gambling in the state. One amendment almost certain to be proposed would allow a statewide referendum to end gambling. ''That would be dangerous,'' said Representative Ferr Smith, a Democrat who supports the governor's proposal. ''They could vote the whole thing out.''
 If religious groups were trying to rein in gambling, political and business leaders from the stricken coastal region were pleading for passage of new casino legislation.
 In a front-page editorial on Tuesday, The Sun Herald in Biloxi said, ''If decisive action is not taken by the Legislature this week, then the ruin on the coast will reverberate all the way to the Tennessee state line.''
 Some form of casino gambling is all but certain to return to the Mississippi coast. Representative Moak said he still hoped to work out a compromise with the church groups.
 But Mr. Perkins said: ''I don't think so. We will not compromise on this issue. We will never compromise on a moral issue and, to us, that's what gambling is.''

HEADLINE: Cleveland Pulls Back From the Edge

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
As the presidential election of 2004 was in full swing and John F. Kerry and George W. Bush seemed to be holding events every other day in northeast Ohio, Cleveland was declared the poorest big city in America.
 The hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs and exodus of Fortune 500 company headquarters had finally pushed Cleveland to the top of an ignominious list at a time of heightened attention.
But in fact, Cleveland had quietly been suffering a long, slow decline, despite the momentum gained during its comeback attempt of the 1990's when the city built the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and new sports stadiums for the Cleveland Indians, the Cavaliers and the Browns.
 Now, downtown Cleveland is almost completely devoid of major retailers, and the office vacancy rate has climbed from 10 percent in 2000 to more than 20 percent in 2005, even though not a single new commercial office building has been built in more than 10 years. 
 The situation has galvanized both the public and private sectors to address the downtown commercial district's plight. ''We have really had to get involved in a multipronged approach to improve demand,'' said David Browning, managing partner of the CB Richard Ellis real estate brokerage firm in Cleveland. 
 More than two years ago, Mr. Browning and a group of commercial real estate brokers and civic leaders began meeting once a month to plan a strategy for breathing new life into Cleveland's downtown, and those efforts have recently borne fruit. 
 Cleveland was one of the few cities of its size without a downtown business improvement district until business owners recently approved one. The new Special Improvement District is to have a $3 million budget from fees assessed on all businesses with sidewalk frontage; the money will pay for cleanup and beautification.
 The city also enacted legislation in July that gives any new downtown employer a tax rebate for bringing 25 or more jobs downtown, or to current downtown employers that add 10 or more jobs.
 The tax rebate is based on a payroll tax formula, but is equivalent to 50 percent of income taxes paid by each employee. In other words, the city would refund to the employer approximately half of each new employee's income taxes that would have been paid to the city.
 The tax rebate is based on a model developed in Columbus, Ohio, which helped to lure 25 employers downtown and reduced that city's office vacancy rate by four percentage points in two years.
 Cleveland's taxpayers have also subsidized new downtown housing, both rental and owner-occupied, at a rate of about 500 new units a year for the last five years. The Pinnacle, for instance, is a new condominium in the historic warehouse district that has received an estimated $20,000 in tax credits and abatements for each unit.
 ''A huge civic conversation has been sparked,'' said Joe Cimperman, a member of the City Council who represents downtown and attends the monthly strategy sessions. ''We're the No. 1 poor city in America, and people are now saying, 'We have to make this happen for ourselves. We have to get this city back on track.'''
 The city's fortunes are indisputably dependent upon the downtown commercial district, according to a study conducted by the Maxine Levine Goodman College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University. The study found that more than 60 percent of the city's general revenue is generated by income and property taxes from the central business district. As revenues have declined, so have services for the entire city. 
 A stark case in point is the sale of the Tower at Erieview, a commercial office building and shopping mall that was bought by Minshall Stewart Properties two and a half years ago. Despite a high vacancy rate, the building's previous owner had been paying taxes based on a $70 million assessment; it sold for only $30 million, a price that cost the city $1 million in taxes annually.
 The Tower at Erieview is now 88 percent full, but the high occupancy rate comes at a price. Minshall Stewart Properties aggressively courted tenants from other office buildings, particularly Cleveland's historic skyscraper, the Terminal Tower, by offering space at half the going rate, or about $9 a square foot compared with about $18 at Terminal Tower. 
 ''There is a sense of panic in the community,'' said Werner Minshall, chief executive of Stewart Minshall Properties, based in Bethesda, Md. ''But I do think things will turn around, partly because of the efforts being made by Cleveland and also because the market seems to have bottomed out. There's nowhere to go but up, and that's what I do. I identify areas like that and buy real estate in them.'' 
 Mr. Minshall said he was looking seriously at purchasing another downtown Cleveland office building with a vacancy rate of more than 50 percent. 
 Other commercial real estate firms seem to have caught on that there are deals to be had in Cleveland. The BP building, one of the city's three skyscrapers (and only one of two Class A commercial properties), was purchased in June by the Harbor Group, which is based in Norfolk, Va. 
 The Harbor Group closed on the BP building, a 1.2-million-square-foot office tower built in 1985, for $131 million. Robert Friedman, managing partner of Harbor, said his company specialized in acquiring Class A commercial properties in second-tier markets, and the BP building is the company's largest purchase to date.
 ''When you can get a quality property at below replacement cost, that's a good opportunity,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''That translates into lower rents for tenants.'' Mr. Friedman expects to lease space at $18 to $22 a square foot. 
 The Richard E. Jacobs Group, the owner of Key Tower, Cleveland's other Class A building, designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates, is said to be negotiating with the Wells Real Estate Funds, a real estate investment firm, to sell the 1.5- million-square-foot building, according to people close to the negotiations. 
 Despite interest in Cleveland's better commercial properties, there is still plenty of excess capacity, especially when it comes to older historic buildings that are in disrepair. Facing Key Tower across Public Square -- the center of downtown Cleveland -- is the Park Building, a nine-story historic office building that is completely vacant, and it is hardly the only one.
 ''We estimate that for every percent of vacancy, that represents 570 lost jobs,'' said Joe Marinucci, president of the Downtown Cleveland Partnership, a nonprofit economic development organization. ''Cleveland experienced more than a 10 percent swing in occupancy; that's more than 5,700 direct jobs lost and many more service-related jobs. There are only 130,000 people currently employed downtown, including office and retail. So that loss is very significant.''
 In addition to pushing for the formation of the improvement district and the tax rebate legislation, the Downtown Cleveland Partnership has undertaken an outreach program to identify downtown companies with leases that are about to expire and to persuade them to stay. ''Last year we met with 82 companies,'' Mr. Marinucci said, ''and the vast majority of them renewed their leases.'' 
 But for those who have already left downtown, the effort to attract and retain businesses is too little, too late. Dinah Howey's eight-person advertising and communications firm, H2N, left Cleveland two and a half years ago after being downtown for 10 years.
 ''Our rents were high, and when we needed to renew our lease, the landlord did absolutely nothing to entice us to stay,'' Ms. Howey said. ''By then, most of our clients had already left downtown, if not Cleveland altogether, so we moved to the suburbs where you can get parking for free.''

HEADLINE: New Home Sales Fall as Consumer Confidence Hits 2-Year Low

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in more than two years this month, hurt by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and by high energy prices, while new home sales fell sharply in August, according to two reports released yesterday.
 The latest data do not necessarily signal a worsening trend because both home sales and consumer confidence are volatile indicators that can fluctuate widely from month to month, analysts said.
History indicates that consumer confidence could rebound in a few months if the recent hurricanes do not have a lasting impact on the economy. Also, the large decline in new home sales came a day after another report showed a surprising increase in existing home sales in August. 
 In a speech yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, credited limited government intervention in the economy for allowing the nation to survive higher energy costs. ''Most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years,'' he told an annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economics via satellite.
 In a speech that was largely a paean to free-market policies, Mr. Greenspan, who is retiring in January, again warned that investors were becoming too complacent about taking on risks because of the economy's ''prolonged stability.'' He further noted that the Federal Reserve may be partly responsible for encouraging risky behavior by smoothing out the economy's ups and downs through its control over interest rates. 
 The Conference Board indicated yesterday that it was beginning to find less complacency, reporting that its consumer confidence index fell to 86.6, from 105.5 in August, its sixth-biggest drop since the index was created in 1967. The decrease was larger than the 17-point decline in confidence after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, said Lynn Franco, the director of the board's consumer research center, who also noted that confidence returned to pre-9/11 levels early in 2002.
 ''Consumers tend to be pretty resilient. It really depends on what the economic consequences are and if it's a prelude to significant job loss,'' she said of Katrina.
 The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households that ended Sept. 20, long enough to include the impact of Hurricane Katrina and worries about the approach of Hurricane Rita. Analysts were expecting an index reading of 95.
 Katrina contributed to the higher energy costs by knocking out considerable production on the Gulf Coast. Gasoline prices topped $3 a gallon in much of the country over the Labor Day weekend and home heating bills are expected to set records this winter. Nationwide, a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was selling for $2.813 on Tuesday, up from $2.80 on Monday and $1.886 a year ago, according to AAA.
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales fell 9.9 percent, to an annualized pace of 1.24 million, from a record-setting July, and were at their slowest pace since January. There was a 4.7-month supply of homes on the market in August, up from a 4.1-month supply in July. The median sale price, however, rose 2.5 percent, to $220,300. Economists had been expecting an annualized pace of 1.35 million new home sales.
 By comparison, the National Association of Realtors said Monday that existing home sales rose 2 percent, to an annual rate of 7.29 million, in August and the median sale price hit a record of $220,000, up 15.8 percent from a year earlier. Existing homes make up about 85 percent of all home sales.''You shouldn't think that this is a sign of apocalypse now, that things are collapsing on us,'' Anthony Chan, an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase, said of the new home sales data. ''This is clearly not that. When I look at these numbers, I see that this is a year that most Realtors would be proud of.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Reassurance Helps Shares Close Mostly Higher 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly higher yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the economy had weathered the increase in oil prices ''reasonably well.'' 
 Earlier in the session, stocks fell after consumer confidence hit its lowest point in two years, raising fears that shoppers might cut their spending and slow the economy.
 But Mr. Greenspan calmed investors by emphasizing ''the incredible resilience of the U.S. economy in terms of flexibility,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist for the investment strategy group at Bank of America. 
 Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics in Chicago, Mr. Greenspan said that before policy makers respond to disasters, financial markets react through prices, interest rates and exchange rates, which work together to cushion the economy. 
 That was just what investors wanted to hear after the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped even more than analysts had expected, falling 18.9 points in September to 86.6, down from 105.5 in August. Economists were expecting a reading of 98. 
 The consumer confidence drop was the largest fall from month to month in 15 years. With consumer spending driving the economy, investors worried that the dive in confidence after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita could dampen retail sales. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.58, or 0.12 percent, to 10,456.21. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.03, to 1,215.66, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.04, or 0.24 percent, to 2,116.42. 
 Crude oil futures sagged. A barrel of light crude fell to $65.07, down 75 cents, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The prevailing feeling on Wall Street now is that some of the issues Katrina raised will linger. 
 ''There's a lot of issues and questions in front of the market, but I don't think there's going to be an easy resolution to any of them, or a quick resolution,'' said Stephen J. Massocca, co-chief executive of Pacific Growth Equities. ''I think a lot of people are frozen until they get a better idea of what it all means.'' 
 In other economic news, new home sales also fell in August, dropping 9.9 percent, according to the Commerce Department. 
 Companies began to give damage assessments from Hurricane Rita. While the damage was generally lighter than expected, stocks in oil companies and others with a large Gulf Coast presence were mixed. 
 The Exxon Mobil Corporation rose 2 cents, to $64.62, after it said it had not yet found serious damage from the hurricane. Tyson Foods, the world's largest producer of processed chicken, fell 16 cents, to $17.36, after it said two of its meat processing plants in Houston suffered virtually no damage and that operations would resume this week. 
 The insurer, WellPoint, fell 8 cents, to $75.01, after it said it would buy WellChoice, the largest health insurer in New York State and the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, for about $6.5 billion. WellChoice rose $4.91, to $75.51. 
 Taser International fell 96 cents, to $6.35, after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission had stepped up an inquiry begun in December to a formal investigation of the company.
 Bond prices were slightly higher, with the 10-year Treasury note at 9925/32, up from 9921/32 on Monday, and the yield, which moves inversely to the price, slipping to 4.28 percent, from 4.29 percent. 
 The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills.

HEADLINE: As Natural Gas Prices Rise, So Do the Costs of Things Made of Chemicals

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
In one sense, chemical industry executives should be sighing with relief. Hurricane Katrina damaged some of their plants, but repairs are proceeding quickly. Hurricane Rita left barely a physical mark. For the next few months, orders will drop but, the executives say, demand will probably ratchet up quickly as rebuilding along the Gulf Coast begins.
 ''Net-net, it will be a wash, because our industry's products will be used to rebuild the devastated areas,'' said Andrew N. Liveris, chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. 
 But while the industry may have dodged these immediate bullets, a thornier problem still interferes with executive sleep: natural gas prices that have been soaring since 2001.
High prices are a double whammy for the chemical industry. Natural gas is both its main fuel and its main raw material, the starting point for the basic chemicals from which the fibers and compounds in shirts, eyeglasses and even the wrappers for single-serve soups are derived.
 ''Chemical companies have been under assault for several years,'' said Robert Koort, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an attractive rating on the chemical sector. Diane H. Gulyas, chief marketing officer of DuPont, said that, if anything, the hurricanes ''acted as a wake-up call.'' 
 ''It made us all realize how shocking the underlying fundamentals of our business have become,'' she said.
 The industry has passed along costs, and it is likely to continue doing so for now. Since Katrina, almost every chemical company has announced price increases. The trickledown effect to retail shelves is inevitable -- soda and water come in plastic bottles, computers use plastic housings, even organic greenmarkets pack fruits and vegetables in plastic bags.
 ''Consumers can expect to pay more for everything, from medicines to auto parts to computers to shampoo,'' said Kevin Swift, chief economist for the American Chemistry Council, a trade association. 
 But industry specialists worry that if high gas prices curb consumer spending, the days of passing along constant price increases may end. 
 ''The uncompetitive natural gas price in the U.S. is a long-term problem,'' said Gordon E. Slack, business director for Dow energy business, who said that high gas prices had turned the chemical industry from a net exporter to a net importer.
 Those rising prices have effectively wiped out the American chemical industry's main competitive edge. Whereas most overseas chemical plants derive most of their raw materials from oil, gas has long been the feedstock of choice here. According to Mr. Swift, natural gas accounts for about 60 percent of the value of chemicals made here. Indeed, many chemical companies clustered their plants along the Gulf Coast, where so much gas is produced, to take advantage of what Mr. Slack called ''the best natural gas prices in the world.''
 As recently as 2000, natural gas was selling for $2 per million British thermal units. But since then, environmental regulations have impelled many companies to switch from burning oil or coal to gas, even as other rules restricted drilling for new sources of gas.
 Unlike oil, which is considered a global commodity, gas is generally moved through regional markets. Liquid natural gas can be shipped long distances, but the liquefaction process is expensive, and only about 3 percent of natural gas comes into the United States that way. 
 Around 2001, demand began to exceed supply, and gas prices have soared since. On Aug. 26, the Friday before Katrina hit, gas prices had already topped $8 per million B.T.U.'s. Then Katrina knocked out natural gas rigs and otherwise stanched the flow of gas. Since then, gas prices have hovered around $12, the highest in the world. Few experts think they will drop again soon.
 ''This unfortunate new reality of elevated oil and gas prices is going to be with us for at least the next 12 to 18 months,'' Ms. Gulyas predicted.
 The effect on chemical company costs has been huge. Most have already shuttered energy-guzzling plants and installed productivity-enhancing programs in the remaining ones. Yet the savings have not kept pace with the costs. 
 Gas and oil accounted for 43 percent of Dow's costs this year; in 2002, they represented 29 percent. 
 Jeff Worden, a spokesman for PPG Industries, which makes chemicals, glass and paints, described it another way. ''We use between 60 trillion and 70 trillion B.T.U.'s of natural gas a year, so if the price goes up one dollar, our costs are up $60 or $70 million,'' he said.
 If the winter is severe, those costs could go even higher. In fact, the industry might even face shortages. 
 ''No utility will shut the gas off in someone's home to give it to a chemical company,'' Mr. Swift said.
 Few executives anticipate the situation to become that dire. ''The industry's growth may be down a few percent this year, but it will increase by the same amount in 2006,'' said Klaus Peter Lobbe, chairman of BASF. 
 William H. Joyce, chairman of Nalco Holdings, is similarly sanguine. Nalco, which makes water treatment and process chemicals, estimates that the effect of the storms will add $15 million to its costs, even as customers whose operations were hurt buy as much as $10 million less from them. Yet in a statement Mr. Joyce referred to the problems as a ''short-term disruption'' that will be resolved in 2006. 
 Most analysts have lowered their estimates of chemical company profits this year, according to Thomson Financial, yet they still recommend that investors buy the shares. 
 ''Margins may be low now, but they'll be picking up by next quarter,'' said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical industry specialist at Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent research firm. ''And this industry is going to have a good 2006.''

HEADLINE: Finland Again Ranks First Among Global Competitors

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: GENEVA, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Nordic countries remain more competitive than those of any other region, while Japan and the major economies of Europe have become less so, the World Economic Forum said Wednesday in its annual study. 
 Finland once again ended up in first place in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks 117 countries, while four other Nordic countries made the top 10. The United States, the world's largest economy, again ended up in second place.
The study assigned scores to nations by looking at factors like government economic policy, the strength of local institutions and the degree to which technology has been used to bolster growth. 
 Japan fell to 12th place, from 9th; Britain slipped to 13th, from 11th; Germany dropped to 15th place, from 13th. Spain fell to 29th, from 23rd; and France fell to 30th, from 27th. Italy remained in 47th place, between Greece and Botswana.
 ''High labor market rigidities, and, in particular, the ease of hiring and firing, contribute to explaining why Europe lags behind U.S. performance,'' Beatrice Weder di Mauro, an economics professor at Mainz University, wrote in a paper for the forum. ''Improving the flexibility of labor markets should be high on Europe's reform agenda.'' Japan's rating fell because of ''the deterioration of its public finances,'' she wrote, though it the country more than compensated for it with its ''impressive technology performance.'' 
 The Nordic countries, in contrast, drew praise. 
 Margareta Drzeniek, a senior economist at the World Economic Forum, said, ''The reasons for the strong performance by the Nordic countries is that they have very transparent systems, high levels of technology penetration, a well-educated work force and good macroeconomic management.''
 African and Latin American nations filled most of the bottom spots, with Chad in last place. Two of Latin America's largest economies fell in the rankings: Mexico to 55th place, from 48th, and Brazil to 65th, from 57th. Chile, however, came in 23rd, outscoring some of the European Union economies on government transparency.
 The performance of the Asian economies was mixed. Many of the so-called tiger economies in Asia ranked well, with Taiwan in fifth place and Singapore sixth. Tiger economy countries are nations that achieve high growth by pursuing an export-driven trade strategy.
 One of the biggest gains came in South Korea, which jumped to 17th place, from 29th last year, in part because of high scores in technology. The World Economic Forum report said that rapid growth in China and India, which placed 49th and 50th, respectively, could be threatened in the long term by factors like poor education systems and low use of technology. These factors were ''likely to slow down their ascension to the top tier of the most competitive economies in the world.''
 China dropped from 46th place, while India rose from 55th. China and India lagged in the index because of ''serious problems'' with corruption, bureaucracy and education, Ms. Drzeniek said. 
 The high rankings of Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Norway highlighted the countries' ability to foster a climate in which business can flourish while they also run large social welfare systems. Their success can in part be explained by high taxes, which most citizens accept in exchange for free health care and education, affordable child care and generous unemployment benefits.
 But the high taxes have not discouraged entrepreneurs. The World Economic Forum praised Finland, home to global companies like Nokia, as ''one of the most innovative business environments in the world.'' The forum also highlighted Finland's ability to run a budget surplus while many European countries face large deficits.
 The United States remains at the cutting edge of technology, the report said, citing its ''pipeline of innovation second to none in the world.'' But a growing budget deficit and other macroeconomic concerns kept it out of the top spot, according to the report.

HEADLINE: Michael Crichton, Novelist, Becomes Senate Witness 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL K. JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
His last book, ''State of Fear,'' was published more than nine months ago, but the reviews were still pouring in on Wednesday, even as Michael Crichton folded his 6-foot-9-inch frame into a seat to testify before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
 ''More silly than scary,'' the flier dropped off by the Natural Resources Defense Council said.
 ''Notable mainly for its nuttiness,'' an analysis from the Brookings Institution said.
 ''Does not reflect scientific fact,'' the Union of Concerned Scientists said. 
 For all his previous works as a writer (13 novels, 4 nonfiction books, numerous screenplays) and his prominent career in Hollywood as a writer, producer or director of 13 films and as the creator of the popular television series ''ER,'' little has yanked Mr. Crichton so deeply into political controversy as ''State of Fear,'' an environmental thriller that casts doubt on the widely held notion that human activities contribute to global warming.
 It has become a hugely divisive policy issue in recent years, gaining a new urgency, perhaps, by the recent hurricanes that slammed into the Gulf Coast. Many prominent scientists, no friends of Mr. Crichton, to be sure, believe that man-made greenhouse gases are causing the earth to warm and are urging lawmakers to pass new regulations that govern carbon dioxide emissions.
 But after considerable study of his own, leading to ''State of Fear,'' Mr. Crichton has concluded that the science is mixed at best, and that lawmakers should take that into consideration when they decide what they might do about it.
 His is an unpopular and contrary stance when measured against the judgment of groups like the National Academy of Sciences. But it was not those organizations that asked Mr. Crichton to Washington to counsel Congress on how to consider diverse scientific opinion when making policy. It was the committee chairman, Senator James M. Inhofe, a plainspoken Oklahoma Republican who has unabashedly pronounced global warming ''the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.''
 In Mr. Crichton, a Harvard medical school graduate who never practiced medicine, he had found a kindred spirit -- and a star witness for his committee.
 ''I'm excited about this hearing,'' Mr. Inhofe said, nodding toward Mr. Crichton as the proceedings began. ''I think I've read most of his books; I think I've read them all. I enjoyed most 'State of Fear' and made it required reading for this committee.''
 Over the next two hours, Mr. Crichton and four other witnesses offered their thoughts, Mr. Crichton hewing to his firm belief that lawmakers should examine more closely ''whether the methodology of climate science is sufficiently rigorous to yield a reliable result.''
 He took notes. He raised his hand to make points. He responded to criticism evenly and never lost composure. But it seemed like a lot less fun than winning an Emmy, as he did for ''ER,'' or a citation as one of the ''50 Most Beautiful People,'' as People magazine ranked him in 1992. And all he could do was sit there quietly, as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton scolded him for views that ''muddy the issues around sound science'' and Senator Barbara Boxer said, ''I think we have to focus on facts, not fiction.'' 
 In an interview later, Mr. Crichton said with a pained expression: ''Comfortable with this? ''I'm very uncomfortable. Who wants this?''
 Several of his previous books led to national debates and criticism, he said, recalling ''Rising Sun,'' a murder mystery that suggests that Japan is economically devouring the United States, and ''Disclosure,'' which examines sexual harassment when a woman is the predator. Both became popular movies.
 ''But this has been worse,'' he said of the aftermath of ''State of Fear.''
 Still, he retains enough of his scientific background to thrust himself into the debate, insisting that the environmental movement ''did a fabulous job in the first 10 years, a pretty good job in the second 10 years and a lousy job in the last 10 years.''
 As a result, he said, its influence on policy needs to be reined in, at least until alternative views are given equal airing and fair consideration by independent reviewers. Only then, he said, can policy makers make informed decisions.
 But he never figured that he would be offering lawmakers an opinion on how they should legislate. His years of writing have taken on a pattern, he said. Research. Write. Move on.
 ''When I'm finished, I'm done,'' he said. Except when he's not, which is the case with ''State of Fear.'' But that may not be true for his next book, which is almost complete. ''It's extremely uncontroversial,'' he said, offering no details.
 And even though the global warming debate endures, it's not likely that ''State of Fear'' will, beyond the book. ''No studio has optioned it,'' he said, insisting: ''It'll never be made. It's way too red hot.''

HEADLINE: Irish Eyes Are Burning Bright, Irish Feet Are Stepping Light

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
Leather pants, chesty blondes, flag-waving bravado. ''Celtic Tiger'' is almost entirely a vehicle for Michael Flatley's ego. Depending on your feelings toward Mr. Flatley, the Lord of the Dance, this is very good or very bad. 
 The phenomenon elevated by ''Riverdance'' brought his new show to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday for its American debut. Philistines cheered while traditionalists rolled their eyes as the barbarians step-danced through the gates, heralded by pyrotechnics and explosive video displays. The dancers also sashayed, shimmied and, in one memorable number, stripped. As Irish-tinged music blared and smoke billowed across the stage, screaming audience members, many of whom had been well served by the beer vendors, surged to their feet.
Mr. Flatley is the consummate showman, and ''Celtic Tiger'' is more spectacle than dance. This is a shame for those who actually hope to see Irish dancing. His bare chest and prancing antics are no match for his flying feet, and those long lines of dancers stamping in pounding unison still impress. But Ronan Hardiman's overheated score obscures the rhythms that should take center stage, while erotic writhing replaces militarylike precision and kicking leaps. Anyone looking forward to rigidly held arms or delicate fiddle melodies should look into ticket refunds.
 The show takes its name from the phrase used to describe Ireland as it enjoys a fast-growing economy. ''Celtic Tiger,'' created, produced and directed by Mr. Flatley, follows a loose history of struggle and perseverance in Ireland and the United States. (During certain numbers the Irish nationalistic fervor overwhelms.) But it's clear who the show's real tiger is, whether he is an Irish street tough, Al Capone wielding a machine gun or a dashing pilot swaggering for a stewardess. 
 ''Everyone in the world will tell you, 'No it can't be done,''' Mr. Flatley announces in the program. ''Every time I hear that I know I'm close to success.'' When a contingent of British Redcoat baddies pillages and plunders an Irish thatched cottage, sending a stream of scantily clad women staggering from the flames, Mr. Flatley follows in priestly garb. Stroking his rosaries as the soldiers descend, he murmurs, ''Deliver us from evil.'' But the glint in his eye leaves no doubt that Mr. Flatley will be doing his own saving. To the tune of ''Yankee Doodle,'' no less.

HEADLINE: Jets and Giants Near Deal on New Jersey Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In a sudden turnabout after weeks of jostling, name-calling and bitterness, the Jets and the Giants were close yesterday to signing a 50-50 partnership agreement to finance and build a football stadium in the Meadowlands, the first of its kind for teams in the National Football League, according to executives involved in the negotiations.
 The breakthrough in the tempestuous negotiations came late Tuesday night during a five-hour meeting at the Meadowlands racetrack between Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey; John Mara, co-owner of the Giants; Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner; their respective lawyers; and Carl Goldberg, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which oversees the Meadowlands sports complex.
 The owners of the two teams, which are rivals on the field but co-occupants of the existing stadium, agreed to submit many of the most contentious issues -- including the size and shape of the new stadium and the location of practice fields -- to binding arbitration, according to two executives involved in the discussions. Although the partnership agreement would put to rest for now any talk of the Jets building a stadium in Queens and would allow Governor Codey to claim victory, there is no guarantee that the two sides will not have a falling out and scuttle the deal at some point in the future. 
 If it holds, however, the Giants and the Jets will be able to develop a modern stadium complex on 75 acres, up from 29 acres today, with luxury boxes, premium seating, sports-oriented stores, a hall of fame and a new rail connection. The teams would split the cost of the project, which is expected to be more than $800 million, and would, presumably, develop their own advertising and marketing while sharing revenues from naming rights.
 The stadium would also have a connection to Xanadu, the $2 billion retail and entertainment complex that will share the property.
 ''I am very encouraged by the progress in keeping both teams in New Jersey,'' said George R. Zoffinger, president of the sports authority. ''Our next objective is to make sure there is a retractable roof, so we can attract the Super Bowl and other events, something that is supported by the commissioner of the N.F.L.''
 Yesterday afternoon, the team owners and their lawyers gathered again at 2:30 in Mr. Goldberg's office at the Meadowlands in hopes of coming to terms. The meeting broke up at 7:15 p.m. without a final deal, but the teams agreed to meet again this morning to settle the outstanding issues. Several officials involved in the talks said they were optimistic that an agreement could be reached by 5 p.m. today, the deadline.
 ''We feel like we have made progress,'' a Giants spokesman, Pat Hanlon, said last night, ''and we are going to sit down again tomorrow in hopes of reaching an agreement.''
 Never before have two football teams agreed to build a stadium together. The Jets joined the Giants at Giant Stadium in 1984 because they had nowhere else to go after fleeing the confines of Shea Stadium in Queens. But the Jets have always resented playing in a stadium named after a rival team.
 ''This would be the first example of a stadium being developed from the outset for two N.F.L. teams,'' said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a sports business consulting firm based in Chicago. ''The cost of these buildings has skyrocketed to such a degree that it makes far more economic sense to share the debt service and the revenues. The net revenues for the two teams are likely to be significantly better than if they each built their own stadium.''
 That does not mean that it was easy for the teams to get even this far. At separate moments over the last month, each team has been cast as a villain by the other parties in the negotiations.
 Then early this week, L. Jay Cross, the Jets' president, formally told Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League, that the team was also considering building a $1.3 billion stadium on 15 acres in a park near Shea Stadium, infuriating New Jersey officials who said Mr. Cross had committed to New Jersey.
 Mr. Cross then gave the sports authority a list of ''preconditions'' to a partnership with the Giants that included items sure to be unacceptable to the Giants, Xanadu or the sports authority. Talks seemed headed for a breakdown. But at least two issues continued to loom large in the teams' negotiating calculus, and prevented a total collapse. Both teams realized that if the Giants refused to relinquish their role as the marquee tenant at the Meadowlands and failed to accommodate the Jets, the tentative deal for a new stadium on 75 acres was unlikely to get sweeter.
 Both the Democratic candidate for governor, Senator Jon S. Corzine, and his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, have been critical of what they view as the overly generous terms of the deal offered by Governor Codey.
 And the sports authority refused to budge on its deadline -- today -- for the two teams to form a joint venture. This left the Jets with too little time to play out their strategy. The Jets had pursued stadium deals in both the Meadowlands and Queens ever since their five-year, $65 million effort to build a stadium in Manhattan died in June.
 But while the team was able to line up support for a Queens stadium among local elected officials, it could not hope to gain the support of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg until after Election Day.
 The sports authority and the Giants insisted that the Jets choose between New York and New Jersey. The Jets could have bailed out of the negotiations with New Jersey and, under the terms of its lease at the Meadowlands, sued to block the Giants from building their own stadium. 
 According to two people involved in the negotiations who insisted on anonymity because of the continuing talks, Mr. Tagliabue told the Jets that it would not be a good idea for the team to try to foil plans for a new Giants stadium if it was truly interested in moving to Queens. That meant the Jets would have been left as a tenant of the Giants in New Jersey with the hope of getting a New York stadium at some point in the future. Hours later, on Tuesday evening, the Jets and Giants neared an agreement to form a partnership and submit to binding arbitration.

HEADLINE: Cut-Rate Homes For Middle Class Are Catching On 

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: NOVATO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Janice Quinci likes nice things: fashionable clothes, dinner out with her husband, a private school for her daughter. With a household income in the six figures, Ms. Quinci can pretty much enjoy it all.
 With the notable exception, until now, of a home of her own.
''We figured we would rent our whole lives,'' Ms. Quinci said. ''We didn't really think that we could afford to have a place to ourselves.'' 
 Ms. Quinci, 29, was speaking from the front porch of her three-bedroom townhouse here in suburban Marin County, north of San Francisco. She and her husband, Vito, a salesman for a wine distributor, bought it new from a developer last November with no money down and at a steep discount. Inside, the refrigerator was pushed aside as workers laid a new kitchen floor -- at no cost to the Quincis -- because the original one was not up to snuff.
 The Quincis might not look the part, but they are the beneficiaries of an unusual form of public housing that is gaining popularity in real-estate-obsessed America. 
 Some middle-class families are buying homes at budget prices made possible by government agencies, private developers, not-for-profit groups and employers.
 Affordable housing, once shorthand for low rents for the poor, is being stretched like never before to include homeownership for people who are more likely to have Starbucks cash cards than food stamps in their wallets. These middle-income earners, priced out of homes from Burlington, Vt., to Santa Fe, N.M., are being offered financial breaks to live in hot real-estate markets and near their jobs. 
 ''Our thinking is that a healthy middle class is important to the city,'' said Geoffrey Lewis, assistant director of policy at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which has overseen the building of hundreds of units reserved for middle-income earners. ''We want to keep these people in Boston; they are the glue in the neighborhoods and the glue in the economy as well.''
 Sometimes called low-cost, work force or inclusionary housing, the cut-price units are most popular in places ''suffering from success,'' as one study described the cities where real estate costs outpaced incomes and where government officials, businesses and housing advocates were struggling to increase homeownership for all but the rich. 
 Unlike traditional government programs intended for the most disadvantaged, the emphasis is on people with full-time jobs who earn too much to qualify for federal assistance but too little to obtain a conventional mortgage, at least not in the cities or neighborhoods where they want to live. 
 Typically, those household incomes are 80 percent to 120 percent of the median income, which, in expensive metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Boston and New York, can extend into six figures for a family of four.
 Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said, ''In many places where housing costs have escalated, that historical social contract appears to have been voided, the contract that if you work you can find a decent place to live.''
 The price breaks are usually not achieved through direct subsidies but a range of cost-cutting programs, including cities making zoning changes for developers, providing land at reduced cost, expediting approvals of building plans and allowing the construction of bigger and more expensive homes elsewhere. 
 In some programs, like that of Burlington Community Land Trust in Vermont, the units are subsidized with state property transfer taxes. Elsewhere, employers and lenders offer financing packages direct to buyers.
 Even in New York City, where efforts to reach out to the squeezed middle class began decades ago with construction of Mitchell-Lama buildings, the ever-growing affordability problem has led to a flurry of new programs, city officials said.
 About 200 blocks in the Greenpoint and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn were rezoned in May to include incentives for developers to build housing for a range of incomes, including households earning as much 125 percent of the median, something that had previously been reserved for high-priced Manhattan.
 ''By creating ownership, you are giving moderate income residents a financial stake in their neighborhoods, so they benefit from the improvement rather than be hurt by it,'' said Shaun Donovan, the housing commissioner in New York.
 The spread of the phenomenon is too new and dispersed to be quantified, government officials and housing advocates say, and so far it occupies only a small piece of the nation's affordable housing pie. Still, it is catching the attention of home builders, city planners, educators and business people across the nation, leading to workshops and seminars on the subject as well as a spate of local laws that make it simpler for developers to offer the units. 
 Public and private investors are also discovering the trend. Investment funds totaling $190 million have been created in the past year in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties for the purpose of building middle-income housing in so-called urban infill areas that have access to public transportation.
 The funds' manager, the Phoenix Realty Group, expects to finance more than 3,000 homes in the next five years. As in many work force projects, the builders will be allowed to construct more units than typically permitted under zoning laws. The ''density bonuses'' enable the developer to make up the lost profit on each unit by selling more of them. 
 ''It's an unserved niche,'' said Tammy Harpster, Phoenix's vice president for acquisitions in San Diego. 
 Conrad Egan, president of the National Housing Conference, an affordable housing advocacy group in Washington, said the stepped up focus was due in part to a ''turnaround on the part of political leaders and office seekers'' that the market cannot provide affordable housing for many Americans, even those who are financially secure.
 ''The picture has shifted because more and more constituents of these local and state leaders are affected,'' Mr. Egan said. 
 A lottery is under way for condominiums in a seven-story building on the harbor front in East Boston, with all 30 units reserved for people earning 80 percent to 120 percent of the median income, or as much as $99,000. 
 More than 550 other subsidized homes have been built in Boston over the past few years -- some in buildings where other units sell for millions of dollars -- that have been reserved for middle-income earners at prices as low as $190,000 for three bedrooms.
 In South Burlington, Vt., a 60-unit condominium project opened in February, with half of the units reserved for people earning up to 140 percent of the area median income. The Burlington Community Land Trust provided a direct subsidy of $25,000 on the homes, which sold for $119,000 to $169,000. 
 As in most of the arrangements around the country, the Vermont buyers agreed to restrictions on the resale of the homes, including how much profit they could make in order to keep the units affordable.
 ''There are seven teachers in there, and a couple of them are college professors,'' said Brenda Torpy, executive director of the land trust. ''The gap between what people earn and what they can afford is really creeping up. These people are not who you would think of as low income.''
 In Lincoln Heights, a neighborhood just north of downtown Los Angeles, families making double the county's median income, or about $100,000, are eligible for reduced-price condominiums now under construction. Without even advertising, the developer, AMCAL Multi-Housing Inc., has compiled a list of 2,000 hopeful buyers a year before the homes will be available.
 ''It's not surprising,'' said Percy Vaz, the company's president. ''The alternative is for people to go out to Riverside, Palmdale or Lancaster and spend two and a half hours on the freeway.''
 Not so long ago here in Novato, a bedroom community in Marin County about 30 miles north of San Francisco, the Quincis' household income of roughly $111,000 would have disqualified them from any housing breaks. But in Marin County the median sale price for houses in June was about $925,000. The Quincis would need to triple their income to afford that.
 Under a complex formula devised by Novato city officials, some new housing on the former Hamilton Air Force Base is being offered at reduced prices to people with household incomes up to 120 percent of the median.
 The Quincis are at the top end of that scale, meaning they had to pay more for their townhouse than families that earn less, but they qualified just the same. The couple paid $390,000, about 30 percent below market value; while single-family houses on the former base not part of the program sell at market value, recently as much as $1.8 million, real estate agents say. 
 ''Often in our culture, it is the middle class that gets left out of everything,'' said Roderick J. Wood, the city manager in Beverly Hills who held the same post in Novato when the Hamilton project was conceived. ''We wanted to help that group.''
 Ms. Quinci, who grew up in Novato but had been living out of town with her husband at his grandmother's house, said the special housing was the only way she could afford to move back home. A high school friend lives a few doors away, as does a high school science teacher.
 ''We see deer out back and wild turkey, and there are rabbits in the morning,'' said Ms. Quinci, a stay-at-home mother, her year-old son cuddled on her shoulder and her 3-year-old daughter rubbing her eyes after an afternoon nap. 
 Preferences in Novato were offered to police officers, firefighters, teachers and other public employees, but some of the 351 affordable homes are also available to the general public through lotteries, the most recent one in August. 
 On lottery day, it is a lot like Christmas, said Laura Levine, the Hamilton project manager for Northbay Family Homes, a nonprofit housing company that has overseen the sales.
 ''If you're over 18,'' Ms. Levine said, ''come on down. It's a beautiful place.''

HEADLINE: Fear Exceeded Crime's Reality In New Orleans

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER and CHRISTOPHER DREW; Nathan Levy contributed reporting from Austin, Tex., for this article.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 25 

 BODY:
After the storm came the siege. In the days after Hurricane Katrina, terror from crimes seen and unseen, real and rumored, gripped New Orleans. The fears changed troop deployments, delayed medical evacuations, drove police officers to quit, grounded helicopters. Edwin P. Compass III, the police superintendent, said that tourists -- the core of the city's economy -- were being robbed and raped on streets that had slid into anarchy. 
 The mass misery in the city's two unlit and uncooled primary shelters, the convention center and the Superdome, was compounded, officials said, by gangs that were raping women and children.
A month later, a review of the available evidence now shows that some, though not all, of the most alarming stories that coursed through the city appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations, the product of chaotic circumstances that included no reliable communications, and perhaps the residue of the longstanding raw relations between some police officers and members of the public. 
 Beyond doubt, the sense of menace had been ignited by genuine disorder and violence that week. Looting began at the moment the storm passed over New Orleans, and it ranged from base thievery to foraging for the necessities of life.
 Police officers said shots were fired for at least two nights at a police station on the edge of the French Quarter. The manager of a hotel on Bourbon Street said he saw people running through the streets with guns. At least one person was killed by a gunshot at the convention center, and a second at the Superdome. A police officer was shot in Algiers during a confrontation with a looter.
 It is still impossible to say if the city experienced a wave of murder because autopsies have been performed on slightly more than 10 percent of the 885 dead.
 [On Wednesday, however, Dr. Louis Cataldie, the state's medical incident commander for Hurricane Katrina victims, said that only six or seven deaths appear to have been the result of homicides. He also said that people returning to homes in the damaged region have begun finding the bodies of relatives.
 [Superintendent Compass, one of the few seemingly authoritative sources during the days after the storm, resigned Tuesday for reasons that remain unclear. His departure came just as he was coming under criticism from The New Orleans Times-Picayune, which had questioned many of his public accounts of extreme violence.]
 In an interview last week with The New York Times, Superintendent Compass said that some of his most shocking statements turned out to be untrue. Asked about reports of rapes and murders, he said: ''We have no official reports to document any murder. Not one official report of rape or sexual assault.'' 
 On Sept. 4, however, he was quoted in The Times about conditions at the convention center, saying: ''The tourists are walking around there, and as soon as these individuals see them, they're being preyed upon. They are beating, they are raping them in the streets.''
 Those comments, Superintendent Compass now says, were based on secondhand reports. The tourists ''were walking with their suitcases, and they would have their clothes and things taken,'' he said last week. ''No rapes that we can quantify.''

Rumors Affected Response
 A full chronicle of the week's crimes, actual and reported, may never be possible because so many basic functions of government ceased early in the week, including most public safety record-keeping. The city's 911 operators left their phones when water began to rise around their building. 
 To assemble a picture of crime, both real and perceived, The New York Times interviewed dozens of evacuees in four cities, police officers, medical workers and city officials. Though many provided concrete, firsthand accounts, others passed along secondhand information or rumor that after multiple tellings had ossified into what became accepted as fact. 
 What became clear is that the rumor of crime, as much as the reality of the public disorder, often played a powerful role in the emergency response. A team of paramedics was barred from entering Slidell, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, for nearly 10 hours based on a state trooper's report that a mob of armed, marauding people had commandeered boats. It turned out to be two men escaping from their flooded streets, said Farol Champlin, a paramedic with the Acadian Ambulance Company. 
 On another occasion, the company's ambulances were locked down after word came that a firehouse in Covington had been looted by armed robbers of all its water -- a report that proved totally untrue, said Aaron Labatt, another paramedic. 
 A contingent of National Guard troops was sent to rescue a St. Bernard Parish deputy sheriff who radioed for help, saying he was pinned down by a sniper. Accompanied by a SWAT team, the troops surrounded the area. The shots turned out to be the relief valve on a gas tank that popped open every few minutes, said Maj. Gen. Ron Mason of the 35th Infantry Division of the Kansas National Guard. 
 ''It's part of human nature,'' General Mason said. ''When you get one or two reports, it echoes around the community.''
 Faced with reports that 400 to 500 armed looters were advancing on the town of Westwego, two police officers quit on the spot. The looters never appeared, said the Westwego police chief, Dwayne Munch. 
 ''Rumors could tear down an entire army,'' Chief Munch said. 
 During six days when the Superdome was used as a shelter, the head of the New Orleans Police Department's sex crimes unit, Lt. David Benelli, said he and his officers lived inside the dome and ran down every rumor of rape or atrocity. In the end, they made two arrests for attempted sexual assault, and concluded that the other attacks had not happened. 
 ''I think it was urban myth,'' said Lieutenant Benelli, who also heads the police union. ''Any time you put 25,000 people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.''

Crimes of Opportunity
 The actual, serious crime began, in the recollection of many, before the catastrophic failure of the levees flooded the city, and much of it consisted of crimes of opportunity rather than assault. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 29, in the half hour or so that the eye of Hurricane Katrina fell on the city -- an illusory moment of drawn breath, sunshine and fair breezes -- the looters struck, said Capt. Anthony W. Canatella, the police commander in the Sixth District.
 Using a chain hitched to a car, they tore open the steel doors at the back of a pawn shop called Cash America on Claiborne Avenue. ''Payday Advances to 350,'' read a sign where the marquee would have been.
 ''There was nothing in there you could sustain your life with,'' Captain Canatella said. ''There's nothing in there but guns and power tools.''
 The Sixth District -- like most of New Orleans, a checkerboard of wealth and poverty -- was the scene of heavy looting, with much of the stealing confined to the lower-income neighborhoods. A particular target was a Wal-Mart store on Tchoupitoulas Street, bordering the city's elegant Garden District and built on the site of a housing project that had been torn down.
 The looters told a reporter from The Times that they followed police officers into the store after they broke it open, and police commanders said their officers had been given permission to take what they needed from the store to survive. A reporter from The Times-Picayune said he saw police officers grabbing DVD's. 
 A frenzy of stealing began, and the fruits of it could be seen last week in three containers parked outside the Sixth District police station. Inside were goods recovered from stashes placed by looters in homes throughout the neighborhood, said Captain Canatella, most but not all still bearing Wal-Mart stickers.
 ''Not one piece of educational material was taken -- the best-selling books are all sitting right where they were left,'' Captain Canatella said. ''But every $9 watch in the store is gone.''
 One of the officers who went to the Wal-Mart said the police did not try to stop people from taking food and water. ''People sitting outside the Wal-Mart with groceries waiting for a ride, I just let them sit there,'' said Sgt. Dan Anderson of the Sixth District. ''If they had electronics, I just threw it back in there.'' 
 Three auto parts stores were also looted. In a house on Clara Street, Sergeant Anderson picked his way through a soggy living room, where car parts, still in their boxes, were strewn about. On the wall above a couch, someone had written ''Looters'' with spray paint.
 ''The nation's realizing what kind of criminals we have here,'' Sergeant Anderson said.
 Among the evacuees, there was gratitude for efforts by the police and others to help them get out of town, but it was clear that some members of the public did not have a high opinion of the New Orleans Police Department, with numerous people citing cases of corruption and violence a decade ago.
 ''Don't get me wrong, there was bad stuff going on in the streets, but the police is dirty,'' said Michael Young, who had worked as a waiter in the Riverwalk development.

French Quarter Is Spared
 As the storm winds died down that Monday, small groups that had evacuated from poor neighborhoods as far away as the Lower Ninth Ward passed through the historic French Quarter, heading for shelter at the convention center.
 ''Some were pushing little carts with their belongings and holding onto their kids,'' said Capt. Kevin B. Anderson, the French Quarter's police commander. He said his officers gave food, water and rides. ''That also served another purpose,'' he said. ''That when they came through, they didn't cause any problems.''
 The jewelry and antique shops in the French Quarter were basically left untouched, though squatters moved into a few of the hotels. Only a small grocery store and drugstores at the edge of the quarter were hit by looters, he said. From behind the locked doors of the Royal Sonesta hotel on Bourbon Street, Hans Wandfluh, the general manager, said he had watched passers-by who seemed to be up to no good. ''We heard gunshots fired,'' Mr. Wandfluh said. ''We saw people running with guns.''
 At dusk on Aug. 29, looters broke windows along Canal Street and swarmed into drugstores, shoe stores and electronics shops, Captain Anderson said. Some tried, without success, to break into banks, and others sought to take money from A.T.M.'s.
 The convention center, without water, air-conditioning, light or any authority figures, was recalled by many as a place of great suffering. Many heard rumors of crime, and saw sinister behavior, but few had firsthand knowledge of violence, which they often said they believed had taken place in another part of the half-mile-long center. 
 ''I saw Coke machines being torn up -- each and every one of them was busted on the second floor,'' said Percy McCormick, a security guard who spent four nights in the convention center and was interviewed in Austin, Tex. 
 Capt. Jeffrey Winn, the commander of the SWAT team, said its members rushed into the convention center to chase muzzle flashes from weapons to root out groups of men who had taken over some of the halls. No guns were recovered.
 State officials have said that 10 people died at the Superdome and 24 died around the convention center -- 4 inside and 20 nearby. While autopsies have not been completed, so far only one person appears to have died from gunshot wounds at each facility.
 In another incident, Captain Winn and Lt. Dwayne Scheuermann, the assistant SWAT commander, said they both shot and wounded a man brandishing a gun near people who had taken refuge on an Interstate highway. Captain Winn said the SWAT team also exchanged gunfire with looters on Tchoupitoulas Street.
 The violence that seemed hardest to explain were the reports of shots being fired at rescue and repair workers, including police officers and firefighters, construction and utility workers.
 Cellphone repair workers had to abandon work after shots from the Fischer housing project in Algiers, Captain Winn said. His team swept the area three times. On one sweep, federal agents found an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, Captain Winn said.
 For military officials, who flew rescue missions around the city, the reports that people were shooting at helicopters turned out to be mistaken. ''We investigated one incident and it turned out to have been shooting on the ground, not at the helicopter,'' said Maj. Mike Young of the Air Force.

HEADLINE: Abuse of Electroshock Found in Turkish Mental Hospitals

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Turkey's psychiatric hospitals are riddled with horrific abuses, including the use of raw electroshock as a form of punishment, according to a human rights report issued in Istanbul on Wednesday, just days before Turkey begins formal talks to join the European Union.
 The report, by Mental Disability Rights International, a Washington-based group, came after several visits in the past year by the group's investigators to psychiatric hospitals and other facilities for people with developmental or mental disabilities.
While the report details many types of abuses, it said the most disturbing involved the use of electroconvulsive therapy without anesthesia to treat a wide range of illnesses in adults and children. The World Health Organization has called for a ban on ''unmodified'' or ''direct'' use of the treatment and states that children should never be subjected to it in any form. 
 The therapy, in which an electrical current is passed through the brain, was developed in the 1930's and continues to be used in mainstream psychiatry to treat a limited number of ailments. But it is normally administered with anesthesia and muscle relaxants. 
 Without them it can be painful, terrifying and dangerous. Patients can break jaws or crack vertebrae during the induced seizures. The report quotes a 28-year-old patient at Bakirkoy Psychiatric Hospital in Istanbul as saying, ''I felt like dying.''
 The Health Ministry, which is responsible for psychiatric hospitals, said it had not yet read the report and declined to comment, other than to say that the director of the electroconvulsive therapy center at Bakirkoy denied administering unmodified electroshocks there.
 But on one day in April when the rights group's staff visited the center, 24 people received such treatments, the report said. Technicians at the center told the group that only patients who had broken bones, presumably from previous treatments, were given anesthesia.
 The human rights group estimated that unmodified shock treatment was used on nearly a third of patients undergoing psychiatric crises at the government-run hospitals, including children as young as 9. The treatment is also administered for many illnesses, like postpartum depression, that are not generally considered by the international psychiatric community to warrant electroshock.
 The investigators also found that the treatment was used as punishment. The report describes patients being dragged to electroshock therapy in straitjackets and forcibly held down during the procedure.
 ''If we use anesthesia the E.C.T. won't be as effective, because they won't feel punished,'' the report quotes the director of the electroconvulsive therapy center as saying.
 Referring to that statement, Eric Rosenthal, the founder of the rights group, said in a telephone interview from Istanbul, ''That was one of most horrifying statements I've ever heard in 12 years of doing this work.'' 
 Turkey has been criticized for using unmodified electroshock before. In 1997 the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture called on Turkey to stop the practice, and the Health Ministry promised to do so.
 Now, the new report is likely to complicate Turkey's talks with the European Union, because of the organization's strict human rights requirements for membership.
 ''There's no question that what's described in the report counts as torture under the European convention and shouldn't exist in Turkey or anywhere in Europe,'' said Richard Howitt, a British member of the European Parliament who sits on the joint European Union-Turkish parliamentary committee. 
 He said he would bring up the report as part of the membership negotiations, because to join, a nation must be judged to follow democratic principles, respect human rights and be on its way to meeting certain economic and institutional standards.
 The report, which includes testimony from former patients and videos taken inside some institutions, reported other abuses as well. 
 Much of the documented abuse took place in orphanages and rehabilitation centers for children with developmental or intellectual disabilities. Investigators saw emaciated and neglected children, many of whom had behavioral problems that were likely to have been the result of mistreatment rather than pre-existing illness, Mr. Rosenthal said.
 ''We saw children who were essentially abandoned, starving, tied down to their beds,'' he said, adding that investigators had not been allowed to see the worst wards.
 Photographs and videos taken at the Saray Rehabilitation Center, the largest of Turkey's government-run rehabilitation centers, show skeletal children, some with plastic water bottles taped over their hands to prevent them from biting their fingers. Other children with only minor disabilities are mixed in with the rest.
 Although the center keeps no mortality records, a footnote in the report notes that the large number of admissions without a corresponding number of discharges suggests that many children die at the center.
 ''We believe there's a very high death rate in these facilities,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. 
 Officials at Turkey's Directorate for Social Services and Child Protection could not be reached for comment.
 The report said that there were no enforceable laws in Turkey to protect mentally ill people from arbitrary detention or forced treatment and that there were virtually no community services that might keep them out of institutions. As a result, according to the report, thousands are institutionalized for life.
 Mr. Rosenthal founded Mental Disability Rights International in 1993. It now has a staff of nine people, including one in Turkey.

Massacres of Armenians Recalled
 STRASBOURG, France, Sept. 28 (Reuters) -- The European Parliament gave only a grudging blessing on Wednesday to membership talks with Turkey starting next week and said Ankara must recognize the massacres of Armenians during the years around 1915 as genocide before it can join the Euopean Union.
 The resolution, which is nonbinding, was a political slap for Turkey, which insists that the killings, carried out by the Ottoman Empire, did not constitute genocide.

HEADLINE: Some Makers Move to Revive Beloved Battery-Run Cars 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Alexandra Paul, a former star of ''Baywatch,'' is not a satisfied General Motors customer -- to put it mildly. 
 In 2002, G.M. sent a tow truck to her house to reclaim a car she had leased from the company. When it was done, she went inside and cried.
''I've never had any emotional feelings toward a car in my life,'' Ms. Paul, 42, said in an interview recently. But this particular car was the EV1, a low-slung, battery-power car that zipped out from a standing start without releasing emissions from the tailpipe. 
 G.M. and other automakers had decided to discontinue their electric vehicle programs that had been started in response to a California clean-air law, contending that they were economically unsustainable. The companies reclaimed most of the vehicles they had leased. 
 Ms. Paul, who is now making movies for Lifetime, would plug in her EV1 at home through an adapter, and in the seven years she leased the car never stopped at a gas station. She keeps pictures of it in an album.
 ''To me, it heralded a new wave of people's thinking about cars, maybe a new era of clean cars,'' she said.
 These days, everyone paying $40 or $50 at the gas pump would like a silver-bullet alternative to gasoline. There are none. But devoted pioneers around the country are trying something else -- driving cars that do not use gasoline, or even combustion engines.
 And this year, while much of the interest in electric motors among major automakers is focused on building gas-and-electric hybrid vehicles, the battery-powered electric car is showing signs of a pulse. 
 Recently, Mitsubishi said it was developing one for sale in Japan by the end of the decade, and Subaru plans to start testing a prototype version in March. Shinichi Murata, a spokesman for Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company, said electric vehicles would be more realistic ''if we can develop a high-efficiency, high-performance battery.''
 Fuji Heavy Industries and other companies are working on that, and the technology can also be used in developing hybrid-electric cars and other variations of the electric vehicle. A futuristic industry project, cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells, would also produce electric vehicles, but ones equipped with an onboard power-generating system fueled by hydrogen. 
 Battery-electric cars continue to have drawbacks that bedeviled Thomas A. Edison a century ago, in the days when steam and electricity vied with combustion for hegemony under the hood. Even now, a typical electric vehicle travels less than half as far as most gasoline cars before it needs recharging -- something that often takes hours.
 And they are emissions-free only in the sense that pollution may not come from the tailpipe; power plants that produce the electricity to run the cars generate emissions.
 Still, for all their drawbacks, electric cars, like G.M.'s EV1, inspired deep devotion among their drivers. Tens of thousands of vehicles that ran on electricity stored in cumbersome battery packs were produced in the 1990's because of a California regulation forcing automakers to sell zero-emission vehicles in the state.
 Some automakers put electric motors under the hoods of conventional vehicles, and enough batteries for 50 miles to 130 miles of driving -- Toyota did so with its RAV4 sport utility vehicle and Ford with its Ranger pickup truck.
 G.M. built its EV1 from the ground up as an electric car. The vehicles are noticeably different, from the whine of their electric motor to their instantaneous acceleration. ''It was like being in a rocket ship compared to the cars I've had before,'' Ms. Paul remarked.
 But these cars have become an endangered species. After California amended its regulations in 2003 in the wake of a legal challenge from G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, automakers began reclaiming and dismantling their electrics as they came off lease. Among other things, they said they would face lawsuits over safety issues if the cars remained on the road without adequate replacement parts. 
 Electric cars, however, have advantages. Electricity can be domestically produced and is potentially cleaner. 
 ''EV's generally have less of a deleterious impact on climate and urban air quality than do gasoline vehicles,'' said Mark A. Delucchi, a research scientist at the University of California, Davis, who has studied transportation technologies and fuels. ''The only general exception to this would be if relatively dirty coal-fired plants are used, relatively near to cities.''
 Electric vehicles are also much more efficient in translating energy into motion than gasoline-fueled cars, though higher manufacturing costs to this point have wiped out cost advantages.
 And driving them over longer distances also means more expensive batteries. Toyota, which mostly leased the electric RAV4 sport utility vehicle, briefly sold it for $42,000 -- more than double the base price of the gasoline-powered vehicle -- but they cost the company more than $100,000 to make. 
 A spokesman for G.M., Dave Barthmuss, said the company stopped producing the EV1 because it had little to show for more than $1 billion in investment. 
 ''We couldn't afford to lose any more money on a program that appealed to a very small number of people,'' Mr. Barthmuss said. ''As great as it was, it would go about 100 miles and take about six to eight hours to charge.''
 The company has refused offers to sell the vehicles to lessees, like Ms. Paul. Toyota and Ford, though, relented and sold some of their remaining electrics. 
 People who still drive the vehicles say the auto industry never wanted to give them a real chance, and resented being forced by California to produce them. 
 ''Most of the people who complain about range and recharging time haven't used EV's,'' said Tom Gage, a former Chrysler engineer who is now president of AC Propulsion, a small company that builds electric cars. ''There certainly are times when using an EV would be an inconvenience, but one idea that has to be replaced is the idea that EV's would replace gasoline cars 100 percent. Nobody is saying they will or they should.''
 Bill Reinert, Toyota's national manager for advanced technologies, said: ''Maybe as we make some progress with the batteries, maybe it will result in EV's as an acceptable product.
 ''Or maybe the conditions regarding transportation throughout the world as a result of, say, geopolitics, will mean that there's a strong case to be made for EV's.''
 Several hundred electric vehicles are still up and running, mostly in California. Their drivers say admiringly that they are quiet, fast and futuristic. 
 Ms. Paul has had electric cars since 1990, when she bought an old Datsun that was converted in someone's garage. She had consulted with her friend Ed Begley Jr., another actor-environmentalist. 
 ''I first decided to get an electric car in 1989,'' the year of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, she recalled. ''I was all on my high horse about Exxon, and then I realized hey, you know what, the reason that boat was out there is because I need gasoline for my car. I was part of the problem.''
 Her perspective on conservation was inherited, she said, from a mother raised in wartime Britain. 
 ''When I go to the grocery store to buy peanut butter,'' Ms. Paul added, ''I check to see if there are any glass containers because to me they're better than plastic.'' 
 She and other former EV1 lessees have formed a small but voluble group that has protested the dismantling of their vehicles. 
 In March, Ms. Paul was arrested during a protest at a Burbank, Calif., installation where G.M. was stockpiling reclaimed EV1's. She and another protester locked themselves in a car parked at the building's exit, blocking trucks that were ready to ferry the cars away. Burbank police officers converged on the scene for more than an hour before jimmying the lock and hauling Ms. Paul and the other protester away to jail. She spent five hours in the lock-up, and received a $1,600 fine and 80 hours of community service. 
 But she has faced worse: After G.M. took her car away, she could not quickly find an electric car to buy. That meant going back to the gas station. 
 ''It was months, torturous months,'' she said, before she found a used electric RAV4. In the meantime, she had to drive her husband's Toyota Prius hybrid, which to many Americans is the height of eco-wizardry.
 Not to her.
 ''I'm not particularly impressed with going 50 miles per gallon,'' she said. ''To me in the 21st century, 50 miles per gallon doesn't impress me when we can go to the moon.''

HEADLINE: In Japan, Merrill to Form a Joint Venture in Private Banking

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
A year after Citigroup was ordered to shut its private banking operation in Japan, another American financial giant is moving to fill the gap left in this huge but hesitant Japanese market.
 On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch announced it would join with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, the Japanese megabank, to open a private banking joint venture catering to Japanese individuals who have more than $1 million to save or invest. Private banks offer personalized service and investments to just such wealthy clients.
The venture, which would open in the middle of next year, would be Merrill Lynch's first big push into Japan, the world's second-largest market for financial services after the United States, since the company pulled out of a failed retail brokerage business in 2001 under heavy losses. 
 ''This time, we are trying to approach the client differently,'' Robert J. McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private banking operations, said in an interview. ''We're taking a very targeted approach at a particular market segment using a partner with local knowledge.''
 The new venture joins a recent rush by global financial companies like the Swiss bank UBS, Standard Chartered of London and Nomura Holdings and Sumitomo Trust of Japan to fill the need left by the exit of Citigroup. 
 In September 2004, the Financial Services Agency, a Japanese government watchdog, ordered Citigroup to close its private bank here after finding lax money-laundering controls and improper trading practices. Some customers were overcharged for publicly traded derivatives. In other cases, Citigroup brokered real estate and art deals, activities expressly forbidden under Japanese law. 
 Some of Citigroup's former private bankers said that many of the newcomers, including Mitsubishi Tokyo, had been competing to hire them to build their own operations. 
 The move also underscores the allure of Japan's extensive but largely untapped private banking market. Merrill Lynch says Japan has some 1.4 million people who have more than $1 million to invest, second only to the United States, which has about twice that many.
 Globally, Merrill Lynch says there are about 8.3 million such investors, who collectively hold assets worth $30.8 trillion.
 One challenge, analysts say, will be persuading rich and often elderly Japanese to shift money from the safety of bank accounts, which barely pay interest, into riskier but more lucrative investments like stocks and bonds.
 Japanese of all income levels are notably conservative investors, having suffered through a stock market and real estate bubble and almost 15 years of tepid economic growth. They have frustrated most previous attempts to develop a wealth management industry here.
 ''Japan always seems to be the land of opportunity,'' said Jason Rogers, a banking analyst at Barclays in Tokyo, ''but private banking has never been big here. People prefer to manage their own assets, usually in banks.''
 Merrill Lynch wants to avoid the mistakes of its last big foray into Japan in 1998, when it tried to attract middle-class savers by taking over the retail network of the failed Yamaichi Securities, once Japan's No.4 brokerage. The effort fell apart after investors proved unwilling to move into mutual funds and securities, where Americans put a big chunk of their savings.
 Merrill Lynch kept only the wealthier clients, giving it a private banking presence in Japan of about 8,000 clients with 1 trillion yen, or $8.8 billion, in assets. It said these accounts would be folded into the new joint venture. 
 Citigroup will not say how big its client base was before it closed, but analysts and bankers say it was probably twice as large as that of Merrill Lynch right now.
 Merrill Lynch will own 50 percent of the still unnamed venture, with Mitsubishi Tokyo companies holding the rest. The new company's chief executive will be Junji Okabayashi, a vice chairman and the head of Merrill Lynch's private banking operations in Japan.
 Mr. McCann said Merrill wanted to avoid past missteps by affiliating with a strong local partner, which would allow it to reach clients without building a costly sales network.
 Mitsubishi Tokyo is to become the world's largest bank by assets on Saturday when it completes a takeover of another Japanese lender, UFJ Holdings. After the merger, Mitsubishi will have more than 800 branches across Japan, which the joint venture can use to reach potential clients.
 Mr. McCann said that timing was right for the venture: the recovery in Japan's economy has gained traction and a decade-long banking crisis has ended, allowing Japanese investors to invest with greater confidence.
 ''People are shifting away from being pure savers,'' Mr. McCann said. ''I do think there's a cultural shift going on here.''

HEADLINE: Investors Keep an Eye on Oil Prices and Durable Goods 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street trading ended mixed after a volatile session yesterday as investors welcomed ngovernment data showing a reinvigorated industrial sector but wrestled with an increase in oil prices that briefly sent crude futures above $67 a barrel.
 Crude oil futures surged after the Energy Department reported a larger-than-expected drawdown in the nation's crude oil reserves, although data also showed a surprise surplus in gasoline inventories. A barrel of light crude was $66.35, up $1.28, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after reaching $67.40. 
 The inventory report cost the market early gains that were spurred by the Commerce Department's bullish report on durable goods orders, which shot up 3.3 percent in August after falling 5.3 percent in July. Economists had expected minimal gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.88 points, or 0.16 percent, to 10,473.09. Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,216.89. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.02 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,115.40.
 For analysts, the late-session rally showed the market's overall strength in the face of continuing uncertainty over energy prices, a slowdown in consumer spending and higher interest rates.
 ''There are still some significant headwinds out there, but I have to say, the market has held up pretty well,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments in San Francisco. But, he said, ''We're still stuck in the same trading range we've seen for months, and it'll take better news to break out of it.''
 While the market has been tracking closely the fluctuation in oil prices, the long-term effects of higher energy costs have yet to cycle through much of the economy, and could show up later in the year, the time when investors hope for their ''Santa Claus'' rally in November and December. If high gasoline and heating costs erode holiday spending, that rally could be in jeopardy.
 ''I look around, and I'm thinking, give me a rationale why I should own stocks right here,'' said Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck & Company. ''Clearly you can pick stocks, pick sectors, find ways to make money. And the economy has shown amazing resiliency. But in the aggregate, that rationale is getting tougher to find.''
 In corporate news, DaimlerChrysler rose $2, to $54.83, after it said it would cut 8,500 jobs in its Mercedes division as it works to restrain costs and return Mercedes to profitability. 
 The spice maker McCormick & Company increased $1, to $32, after it posted a modest rise in quarterly profits on improved sales, beating Wall Street profit forecasts by a penny a share. 
 Eastman Kodak fell 12 cents, to $24.89, after it said that its revenues from digital products would exceed expectations for the year, but that operating profit would come in below the company's earlier targets because of a sluggish economy and high employee health care costs.
 Bonds rallied. The 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32, to 9931/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.25 percent, from 4.28 percent on Tuesday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price -- 99.819
High Yield -- 4.095
Low Yield -- 4.000
Median Yield -- 4.075
Accepted at low price -- 60%

HEADLINE: New Austerity for German Car Industry

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
The German auto industry, saddled with some of the highest labor costs in the world, is embarking on a stringent belt-tightening campaign, prodded by a pair of German ex-colleagues who made their names with an even tougher austerity drive in the United States.
 DaimlerChrysler said on Wednesday that it would cut 8,500 jobs in Germany within the next year. A day earlier, Volkswagen said that it would build a new sport utility vehicle at its main plant in Wolfsburg rather than in Portugal -- but only after extracting a 20 percent wage reduction from its workers.
At DaimlerChrysler, the man wielding the scalpel is Dieter Zetsche, the former head of the Chrysler division, who was named last July to succeed Jurgen E. Schrempp as the group chief executive. The job losses will fall on the struggling Mercedes-Benz unit. 
 At Volkswagen, the cost-cutter is Wolfgang Bernhard, who was Mr. Zetsche's deputy at Chrysler and is now a top executive at Volkswagen with responsibility for its troubled namesake brand.
 Together, Mr. Zetsche, 52, and Mr. Bernhard, 45, are credited with turning around Chrysler, which was hemorrhaging money in 2000 when DaimlerChrysler installed the two rising stars at its American subsidiary. Their remedy involved 26,000 job cuts and six closed plants, among other steps.
 How much of an American-style overhaul they will try to transplant from Detroit to Deutschland is one of the most closely watched issues in German industry these days. But already, analysts say, these executives are shaking up two of Germany's stodgiest industrial empires.
 ''In their heads, they have no taboos,'' said Jurgen Pieper, an analyst at Metzler Bank in Frankfurt. ''They have this experience, they know what is possible, so they will push harder.''
 In a country where the political system has been virtually paralyzed since a deadlocked election earlier this month, business executives like Mr. Zetsche and Mr. Bernhard suddenly find themselves on the vanguard of Germany's effort to tackle its high-cost labor market.
 Pursuing job cuts of any magnitude is treacherous here -- job-protection laws are strict, the unions still exert great power and unemployment is close to a post-World War II record. The lack of political direction in Berlin, however, is emboldening some companies to act, analysts said.
 ''If there were a new conservative government, they would be more careful to support it,'' Mr. Pieper said. ''But there is a kind of vacuum, so they don't care what people think. They feel a bit more free.''
 On Sept. 19, the day after the election, Siemens announced that it would lay off 2,400 workers in Germany. The conglomerate's chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, headed its American division until 2004.
 Mr. Zetsche, who took over the Mercedes division only this month, moved swiftly to tackle its bloated costs. ''We have to learn to do the same with less, or even more with less,'' he said two weeks ago at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
 DaimlerChrysler's board, meeting at the Chrysler headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., approved the cuts Wednesday. They will result in a charge of 950 million euros ($1.14 billion) in the fourth quarter. 
 Still, as Mr. Zetsche and Mr. Bernhard push their reductions, both are constrained by existing labor contracts, as well as a deeply ingrained German reluctance to let even a single worker go.
 In July 2004, Mercedes offered a seven-year job guarantee to its 93,000 workers in Germany in return for their giving up a wage increase in 2006. The deal saves 500 million euros ($600 million) a year in labor costs.
 In November, Volkswagen guaranteed the jobs of 103,000 workers in Germany until 2011, in return for a 28-month wage freeze. The carmaker claimed the deal cut its labor costs by nearly one-third.
 The contracts are subject to renegotiation if business conditions deteriorate -- which arguably, they did, for both carmakers. But neither company has yet taken the step of forced layoffs. DaimlerChrysler said it would achieve the reduction of 8,500 jobs through voluntary buyouts. 
 The company said the reductions would help keep production in Germany. Last year, during the labor talks, it threatened to move the production of a new Mercedes car to South Africa.
 Some analysts were unimpressed with the target, suggesting that DaimlerChrysler could reach it through normal attrition. ''Yes, they're bringing down costs, but not aggressively,'' said Christoph Dolleschal, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt.
 Others, however, said it was significant, given that last summer, more than 20,000 Mercedes assembly-line workers walked off the job to protest a proposal to curtail their hourly coffee breaks.
 Volkswagen is in an even tougher position than DaimlerChrysler, since its labor contract sets wages 20 percent higher than those at other German carmakers. Its largest shareholder is the state of Lower Saxony, which makes it politically delicate to push for sweeping layoffs.
 In early September, Volkswagen warned there were ''several thousand'' surplus employees at its German factories, particularly in Wolfsburg. But this week, Wolfsburg won a partial reprieve when the company decided to build its compact S.U.V. there rather in Palmela, Portugal.
 The tradeoff is that the 1,000 employees who work on the S.U.V., known as the Marrakesch, will be on a new contract, with a 20 percent lower wage, than the standard contract. That is a stipulation Mr. Bernhard is likely to seek with every new vehicle, said Volkswagen officials.
 Lest anybody think his pruning was finished, Mr. Bernhard said in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, ''This is just the first step on a long way. We cannot lean back and be complacent.''

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Recovered Strongly in August

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods showed a surprisingly robust recovery in August, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the manufacturing sector was picking up its pace after a sharp drop in July and before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast.
 Separately, the president's top economic adviser, Ben S. Bernanke, said yesterday that the storms could cut economic growth by one-half to one percentage point in the third quarter but added that the slowdown would be short-lived.
Orders for durable goods rose 3.3 percent last month, to $210.9 billion, after falling 5.3 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. Economists expected an increase of 0.7 percent. The July figure was revised from an initial reading that showed a decline of 4.9 percent. 
 Excluding the transportation industry, orders were up 4.2 percent in August. 
 Followed as a barometer of manufacturing and of economic activity as a whole, the monthly report measures new factory orders for goods that will last more than three years. 
 ''At least in August, the manufacturing sector was doing O.K.,'' said Brian Jones, an economist at Citigroup, who noted that analysts would be ''groping around for a while'' before the hurricanes' impact on the economy became clear.
 The first major report to cover the poststorm period will be the monthly employment report, due on Oct. 7.
 Mr. Bernanke, who is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the hurricane would temporarily dent the economy.
 ''I don't see any significant risk of a recession,'' he said. ''I think consumer spending is going to remain strong; underlying momentum is good; income, job creation is good; and, of course, the rebuilding itself is going to create jobs and activity.''
 Reports issued in the last couple of weeks showed that the economy was moving briskly last month in a range of areas, but they also showed rising inflation, mostly because of higher energy costs. Oil, gasoline and natural gas prices have all climbed since then, leading some analysts to wonder whether and how soon those increased costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for other goods.

HEADLINE: Pataki Solution on Museum Flies in Face of Planning 

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
OBVIOUSLY, Gov. George E. Pataki got more than he bargained for 15 months ago when he announced that the Freedom Center museum would be one of four cultural tenants at the World Trade Center site.
 But in another sense, he and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg got exactly what they bargained for. The Freedom Center that Mr. Pataki evicted from its site yesterday emerged from a planning process going back three years. 
A growing number of critics -- whom Mr. Pataki was trying to mollify -- contended that the center would take away space that could be used for a museum devoted solely to 9/11 and that it would detract from the solemnity of the memorial by focusing on geopolitics and on national and international social history. But the notion of a freedom museum was one of the earliest elements considered for ground zero.
 And it was one the governor endorsed.
 In an April 2002 blueprint for downtown, the development corporation said one possibility was ''a new museum dedicated to American freedom, tolerance and the values that the World Trade Center represented,'' referring to a proposal by Tom A. Bernstein, the president of Chelsea Piers, and Peter W. Kunhardt, a documentary filmmaker.
 Three months later, the development corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey noted the plan for the Museum of Freedom and Remembrance in their preliminary urban design study for the trade center site.
 In June 2003, the corporation invited cultural proposals for ground zero. It encouraged those who had already come up with ideas -- like a museum that would interpret the terrorist attacks ''within the context of freedom, democracy and the history of New York'' -- to submit them formally. Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Kunhardt did so.
 As it evaluated these submissions, in February 2004, the corporation listed some ''possible and desirable'' uses of the cultural buildings adjacent to the memorial site:
 ''Civic organizations that would create humanities programs and conduct forums drawing from cultural and academic resources in the region, building an identity for the World Trade Center site as a place for inquiry and discussion.''
 ''International programming allowing for the exploration of issues and traditions around the world, both secular and religious'' that ''could highlight the values of tolerance, diversity and understanding among nations.''
 A committee drawn from the corporation, the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and the state's Council on the Arts reached a consensus in June 2004 on the prospective tenants: the Freedom Center, as the museum was then called; the Drawing Center; the Signature Theater Company; and the Joyce Theater Foundation.
 AT the time, the Freedom Center said it would feature exhibits in collaboration with the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience -- including the Gulag Museum at Perm-36 in Perm, Russia, and the District Six Museum in Cape Town -- among others. It also said it would develop lectures, films and other programs ''in partnership with leading arts, cultural, media and academic institutions.''
 Governor Pataki himself described the center in a Nov. 22, 2004, speech.
 ''The Freedom Center has formed a committee of outstanding individuals to create vibrant content on the global quest for what our own Declaration of Independence deems the inalienable rights of humanity,'' the governor said.
 Linking the opening of the Freedom Center in 2009 to the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth and the 80th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the governor said: ''The Freedom Center will unveil a major exhibit that explores the birth, rearing and maturation of liberty in America. 
 ''The Freedom Center will also convey stories of courage and inspiration like those of Amchok Thubten, a Tibetan monk, and Yousif Hasan, a Sudanese citizen, two brave men who fled to America after peaceful political protest subjected them to years of brutal imprisonment in their own countries.''
 Of the four cultural institutions chosen for ground zero, only the Freedom Center secured seats on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, which will build and own the memorial and cultural buildings. Paula Grant Berry, the center's vice chairwoman, was named to the board in December 2004 and Mr. Bernstein in April 2005.
 The point of this timeline is to suggest that Mr. Pataki's decision to evict the Freedom Center flies in the face of a long planning process, a point that the mayor has acknowledged.
 Perhaps the result will be salutary. It is not hard to imagine the cultural building in the memorial quadrant, now emptied of the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center (which is looking for alternative space), serving usefully as an extension of the underground memorial museum devoted to 9/11.
 Now the question is what else in the master plan is open for revision. If ground zero is too hallowed for a freedom museum, how much longer will a performing arts center be considered appropriate? Or a million square feet of retail space? Or four office towers? Especially if one of them is named Freedom.

HEADLINE: Forrester Woos Democrats With Tax Pitch

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:

''Property Taxes Are Outrageous'' is a 30-second commercial for Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee for New Jersey governor, that began running this week on network television stations in Philadelphia and New York City.

PRODUCERS -- Stevens, Reed, Curcio & Potholm.

ON THE SCREEN -- The ad alternates between shots of beleaguered New Jersey residents pleading for property tax relief and a buoyant Mr. Forrester, consoling clean-cut families outside their modest (and, no doubt, highly taxed) suburban homes. Some of those who appear in the ad were also featured in a previous commercial about Democratic voters crossing party lines to support Mr. Forrester -- although one Democratic defector depicted in the earlier ad, who was later revealed to be a former Essex County employee fired for taking money -- does not make a return appearance. At one point, the narrator discusses Mr. Forrester's Democratic opponent, Senator Jon S. Corzine, and the bright colors are suddenly replaced by a jarring black and white photo of Mr. Corzine with his hand extended and a graphic that reads ''Corzine raised taxes 133 times.''

THE SCRIPT -- Several people are shown, each delivering a brief message: Property taxes are outrageous. I'm fed up with the high property taxes. Only Doug Forrester has a plan to cut property taxes 30 percent in three years. More relief for more people, that's the Forrester plan. Jon Corzine? He's voted 133 times for higher taxes. Corzine won't change New Jersey. Doug Forrester will. I'm a Democrat who's voting for Doug Forrester. We need Doug Forrester.

ACCURACY -- Few homeowners would dispute that New Jersey's property taxes, the highest in the nation, are outrageous. But Mr. Forrester's tax-cut proposal was ridiculed by his Republican primary opponents in the spring. Since then, Democrats have seized on the same criticisms of Mr. Forrester's proposal: that it is based on dubious economic assumptions, would only provide a temporary drop in property taxes and would require big and as-yet-unspecified cuts in spending to avoid a multibillion-dollar deficit. Mr. Forrester's contention that Mr. Corzine cast 133 votes to raise taxes is misleading. Some of the votes cited by Mr. Forrester were procedural measures and others were actually votes for tax cuts that were simply smaller than alternatives being pushed by Republicans. The ad also neglects to mention that as mayor of West Windsor 20 years ago, Mr. Forrester doubled property taxes.

SCORECARD -- Republicans are so badly outnumbered and outgunned in New Jersey that it is shrewd of Mr. Forrester's campaign to use testimonials from Democrats to appeal for crossover voters and pre-empt criticism that the Republican candidate's attack on Mr. Corzine is partisan. Despite its factual problems, this ad taps into frustration over property taxes to neatly encapsulate Mr. Forrester's essential pitch to weary and independent-minded voters: that he is the candidate most likely to bring change.

HEADLINE: A Normal Political Crisis in an Abnormal Country 

BYLINE: By Ian Fisher

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Pretty much every adult Italian has now called for Antonio Fazio to step down as governor of the Bank of Italy. Yet he has glued himself to his chair, despite pleas from the prime minister on down, despite setting off another crisis for a wobbly government, despite comments on the issue from a leading opposition politician that invariably begin, ''In a normal country .'' 
 Italians generally show little interest in living in a ''normal'' country. ''We never forget who we are, and we take pleasure in confounding those who observe us,'' the writer Beppe Severgnini noted in his recent best-selling book, ''The Italian Mind,'' to be published in English next year.
But in this case, ''normal'' is shorthand for something specific: politics that work like the rest of Western Europe's, which is to say, where institutions count more than individuals, where accountability flows toward a nation's voters. 
 The word is often used to attack the reign of Silvio Berlusconi, who is not only the prime minister but also the country's richest man, and whose Forza Italia is often considered less a traditional political party than a cult of personality groomed by his money, his vast media holdings and his ability to pass self-interested laws.
 To critics, Mr. Fazio's stubborn refusal to step down -- over allegations that he improperly influenced the takeover of two Italian banks -- is especially worrisome in this context: the Bank of Italy, they say, has been one of the few institutions in an era of personalized rule respected for being above the fray, both in Italy and in Europe. 
 ''This is another blow to a country that does not have many credible institutions, and that is why this is important,'' said Roberto D'Alimonte, a professor of political science at Florence University. ''It is another sign of the Italian malaise that is spreading.'' 
 Other signs of that malaise are recession, high prices, the Chinese threat to Italian goods, an aging population and a surging public debt, not to mention a political universe always on the brink of implosion. 
 And the Fazio scandal adds many other distinctly Italian elements: the Roman Catholic Church; the enduring hand of the ''poteri forti,'' or the elite business class; the influence of the coming national elections; even an embarrassing whiff of the Mafia, if not from its traditional shinbone-crunching wing. 
 ''If you don't go away, I'll have you roughed up a bit.'' 
 This was a joke, growled to reporters in Washington by the new Italian economy and finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, after he arrived there last week on a mission devoted, apparently, to humiliating Mr. Fazio out of his job. The tough talk was a mocking imitation of Mr. Fazio, who once famously threatened reporters with words like those. 
 This was not the only humiliation: at the last minute, Mr. Tremonti substituted a junior bank official for Mr. Fazio in an important meeting at the World Bank in Washington. Mr. Fazio, infuriated, stormed back to Italy on a private jet.
 But still he did not resign. 
 Even by Italy's rigorous standards, the Fazio scandal has been entertaining and complicated from the start. 
 It began last summer, when wiretaps were released to newspapers suggesting that Mr. Fazio favored Italian suitors of two banks over foreign bidders. One fact seemed particularly juicy: that this seemed to be a Fazio family affair. Mr. Fazio's wife, Cristina Rosati, was taped talking cozily with the head of an Italian bank that wanted to take over the Antonveneta bank. 
 ''Stay calm, stay calm,'' Ms. Rosati told the Italian suitor, Gianpiero Fiorani, chief of Banca Popolare Italiana, as the deal unfolded. ''Relax.''
 With ordinary Italians ever more frustrated about the economy, calls grew over the summer for the discredited Mr. Fazio to resign. This reached a peak last week when Domenico Siniscalco, the competent economy and finance minister, abruptly quit, saying he had lost confidence in Mr. Berlusconi's government. 
 ''I'm resigning because of the government's absolute immobility,'' Mr. Siniscalco said. ''The problem is not so much Fazio as the people who are incapable of resolving the question. I'm not bitter about this. I'm shocked.'' 
 The defection of so highly regarded a minister became too much for Mr. Berlusconi, who finally broke his silence on Mr. Fazio. He said last week that the Bank of Italy chief had become ''incompatible with the country's credibility.'' 
 The opposition center-left called for immediate elections, which polls show they would probably win. Mr. Berlusconi replaced Mr. Siniscalco with Mr. Tremonti, who himself had quit the same job last year in another row with Mr. Fazio, and so would seem hungry for a little revenge. 
 Still, Mr. Fazio, claiming no wrongdoing, has stayed put.
 Meanwhile, with pressure on Mr. Fazio high this week, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the respected head of Confindustria, the Italian business consortium, warned that the scandal had been deeply damaging: much bank business has been on hold, and the Bank of Italy's role as a chief commenter on the Italian economy undermined. And Italy's image, both internally and abroad, is suffering because of one man. 
 ''We are a dynamic country, very active since forever in exports, with a very important brand: 'Made in Italy,''' he said. ''We need a good image for our producers, for our entrepreneurs, for our people, for our country. We need credibility. And the credibility of a country is based on respectable institutions.''
 Now, the question is asked in every news cycle: How is it that Mr. Fazio has kept his job? The answer seems at once technical, cultural and political. 
 Technically, the governor of the Bank of Italy is appointed for an indefinite term, which amounts to life. The arrangement was intended to protect him from political meddling, and thus he can be removed only though a complicated combination of action by 13 bank trustees and various government officials. But many of the 13 trustees were appointed by Mr. Fazio himself. 
 ''The mechanism that was introduced to insulate the governor from political interference is now protecting the governor in a case where he has lost completely credibility,'' said Mr. D'Alimonte, the Florence University professor. 
 But beyond this, Mr. Fazio, as a churchgoing Roman Catholic, apparently has backers among leading prelates. And with elections at most a few months away, many politicians do not want to go against the wishes of a church still influential with voters. 
 The Northern League, one of Mr. Berlusconi's partners in the shaky coalition government, has also been hesitant about abandoning Mr. Fazio -- another reason, some experts say, that Mr. Berlusconi had been reluctant to be too tough. 
 Moreover, Mr. Fazio appears to have support among the high rung of the business elite, which, along with his family, may be providing him with the psychological crutch to hang on -- a circle of support that Mr. Severgnini, the writer, says has a time-honored history among Italians in stress. 
 ''Fazio can resist because he's found enough people around him telling him he is like St. Sebastian,'' he said. Mr. Severgnini noted that Mr. Fazio, in fact, has a painting of St. Sebastian hanging in his office. The arrows, it might be noted, did not kill him.

HEADLINE: Corzine Makes Property Taxes a Rallying Cry

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

 BODY:

''Control,'' a 30-second television commercial for United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, began running yesterday on cable and network stations in New York and Philadelphia. 


PRODUCERS -- S.D.D. Media and Message & Media.

ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with a sinister-sounding synthesizer theme that could have been borrowed from a direct-to-video horror movie. The music rises as a small image of the Republican candidate, Douglas R. Forrester, appears on screen. While the narrator provides a voice-over, Mr. Forrester's image is bracketed by text that says he raised property taxes 200 percent. About a third of the way through the ad, the soundtrack abruptly changes to a bright, up-tempo guitar-driven theme and Mr. Corzine appears -- backed by an oversize American flag -- giving a speech. After a quick cut to an image of Mr. Corzine in a diner, a text block appears and remains on screen for nearly a third of the commercial. It describes the central points of Mr. Corzine's tax rebate plan. After briefly switching to a smiling image of Mr. Corzine, the ad closes with a scene of the senator shaking hands with a firefighter and the words ''Jon Corzine Governor.''

THE SCRIPT -- ''Question: Who is the only candidate for governor who has ever raised property taxes? Answer: Doug Forrester. In fact, the only time Forrester had any control over property taxes, he raised them 200 percent. Jon Corzine has proposed a real plan to lower property taxes. It increases property tax rebates by 40 percent over the next four years. And it's paid for by cutting waste, controlling spending, and growing New Jersey's economy. Jon Corzine. Honest. Effective. Experienced.''

ACCURACY -- It is somewhat disingenuous for Senator Corzine to point out that Mr. Forrester is the only gubernatorial candidate to have ever raised property taxes since Mr. Corzine, whose only elected post has been as a member of the Senate, has never been in a position to raise or lower property taxes. But the senator is correct in noting that Mr. Forrester voted to double property taxes while mayor of West Windsor, N.J., in the early 1980's. Mr. Forrester says he did so to pay for a sewer system for the township.

SCORECARD -- This ad marks Senator Corzine's most direct attempt to deflect Republican criticisms of his tax rebate plan. But even though the commercial suggests how Mr. Corzine intends to pay for the rebate program, phrases like ''cutting waste'' and ''growing new Jersey's economy'' have a ring of vagueness and ambiguity that still leave many lingering questions about the proposals. RICHARD LEZIN JONES

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about distortions in the advertising campaigns of the major candidates for governor of New Jersey gave an erroneous figure in some copies for the property tax increase in West Windsor during the years when the Republican, Douglas R. Forrester, was a mayor and council member. (The error also appeared in two articles on Sept. 29 analyzing specific ads.) Taxes rose 200 percent; they did not double.

HEADLINE: Bed, Breakfast, Gas

BYLINE: By RICH BEATTIE

 BODY:
WHEN Matthew and Jennifer Hase of Beecher, Ill., were planning their first-anniversary getaway this month, they had no idea that apple cider would help fill their gas tank. Not literally, of course. Mr. Hase learned of a promotion offered by the bed-and-breakfast where he booked a reservation: buy a gallon of apple cider at a nearby orchard and the inn would give him a credit for two gallons of gasoline.
 So last weekend, the couple stocked up on cider and received $10.80 -- the equivalent of four gallons of gas from the local station -- off their bill at the Kingsley House in Fennville, Mich. It was hardly retirement cash but, Mr. Hase said, ''Hey, a few bucks here, a few bucks there, it makes the trip a little better.'' 
The Hases had a wonderful weekend. But on their return, they learned that President Bush may have disapproved of their trip. On Monday, he asked people to ''pitch in'' and avoid nonessential travel in order to combat repercussions from the hurricanes.
 Businesses don't seem to be listening. With stratospheric gas prices sidelining even short getaways, offbeat promotions like this one are on the rise. Businesses that rely on the motoring customer -- from inns to casinos to amusement parks -- have had to grab their share of the diminished revenue, and they are differentiating themselves by rewarding travelers with a prized commodity: gasoline. 
 Free-gas promotions, which began a few years ago when gas prices were moving up but the economy wasn't, have spilled over from the lodging industry into everyday life. Banks have used gas cards to lure new customers, apartment complexes have used them to attract new tenants. The American Red Cross even got into the act in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey region, giving away $2,000 of gasoline to one lucky blood donor in the summer.
 But it's small B&B's that are dreaming up the most eye-catching ways to couch gas discounts, like the offer at the Kingsley House. Those discounts are especially popular now, with lovers of fall color ready to start taking leaf-peeping trips, which generally require driving. 
 ''We needed to save the fall foliage season,'' said Marti Mayne, spokeswoman for BedandBreakfast.com, a worldwide database of small inns. ''And right now gas has a high perceived value. So we asked our members to create fuel promotions.'' Some 250 B&B's responded, she said.
 One of the more innovative responses came from the Hummingbird Inn in Goshen, Va., where guests can earn a gallon of gas for every bag of leaves they collect. Raking may be an activity that causes childhood flashbacks, but ''we don't expect people to work that hard,'' said owner Dick Matthews. ''It's like picking strawberries.''
 The inn felt the need to guard against overly ambitious guests by imposing a five-bag limit. But whether people want to take up a rake on a quiet weekend getaway has yet to be seen -- so far, no one has. 
 Other inns make free gas an easier proposition. At the Munro House B&B in Jonesville, Mich., guests get a $20 gas card by mentioning the password ''petroleum'' (when booking within 48 hours of the stay). And at the Homespun Country Inn in Nappanee, Ind., a $30 gas card is the reward for asking for the ''one-tank getaway'' -- an easily remembered phrase, as the inn is just 120 miles from Chicago.
 Depending on the price of gasoline on a given day -- and the car you're driving -- these promotions can vary drastically in worth. Some, like the Hases' cider deal, barely break double digits. But the Inn at Cedar Falls in Logan, Ohio, will refund the price of a tank of gas (November to March, Sunday to Thursday) when guests fuel up their cars at a local station -- no matter how big the tank. ''Someone comes to me with a receipt for $75, that's how much I'll give them,'' said the owner, Ellen Grinsfelder. In other words, bring the Hummer.
 The president and his entourage, perhaps, would prefer to opt for the deal at the York Street House in Lambertville, N.J.: its discount is tied to a car's fuel-efficiency rating. Bring a car that gets 10 miles a gallon, for example, and take 10 percent off (for the second night of a midweek stay); for 30 m.p.g., get 30 percent off. Ditch the car and ride mass transportation, and there's a full 50 percent off. Prufrock's Garden Inn by the Beach in Santa Barbara, Calif., is also rewarding mass transit riders, refunding the fare (Sunday to Thursday) for those who arrive on Amtrak's Pacific coastal trains, which stop a block from the inn. 
 Some of the discounts aren't tied to fuel efficiency, but to distance. The Colonial Capital Bed & Breakfast in Williamsburg, Va., gives its greatest reward to long-haul drivers. Guests who come from up to 100 miles away receive $25 in discounts; up to 200 miles, $30; 300 miles, $35; and over 300 miles, $40. 
 While inns may have some of the most imaginative deals, they are not alone. Even travelers who haven't yet bought their wheels can win free gas. Mitsubishi is offering a debit gas card worth $1,500 to $2,500 (depending on the model) for customers who buy before the end of October.
 Take that free gas and go get more. Wild Adventures Theme Park in Valdosta, Ga., offered a $5 gas card for every admission ticket bought in September, and the park is considering extending the deal. Or head to Niagara Falls in the next couple weeks, stay at a hotel on the American side of the river and enter the Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation's contest to win a year's supply of gas, worth $1,500.
 Even unlucky travelers -- and gamblers -- can get free gas. The Isle of Capri Casino in Bettendorf, Iowa, is giving away 7,777 gallons of gas starting tomorrow until Nov. 6. Play the slots at the Golden Phoenix in Reno (after joining the casino's free club) and accumulate points toward free gas. And those who sign up for the free club at Casino Hollywood in San Felipe, N.M., can take a spin on the ''Fuel-Pump'' slot for a chance to win gas vouchers worth up to $3,000. 
 Marinas, too, are offering deals. The Hontoon Landing Resort & Marina in DeLand, Fla., is offering a free tank of gas with a houseboat rental in October and November.
 If all this free gas seems heaven sent, it may just be. Earlier this month, the Clearview Community Church in Sioux City, Iowa, began handing out $10 fuel vouchers to first-time visitors. It's inspired at least two other churches to offer free gas as well. In explaining his brainstorm, Clearview's pastor, the Reverend Shawn Raloff, seemed to speak not just for shepherds looking to expand their flocks, but for the immense number of businesses offering gas promotions these days: ''We're confident in our program,'' he said. ''We just need to get people here.''

HEADLINE: First-Time Jobless Claims Fell Last Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits last week unexpectedly fell by 79,000, a sign that many workers idled by Hurricane Katrina completed their applications for benefits shortly after the disaster. Claims fell to 356,000 in the week ended Sept. 24 from a revised 435,000 the week before, the Labor Department said yesterday. 
 About 60,000 claims last week came from people who lost their jobs because of Katrina, down from 108,000 the week before, a department spokesman said.
 Claims surged after Hurricane Katrina the Gullf Coast on Aug. 29. Even with the effects of that storm and, more recently, Hurricane Rita, claims figures nationwide suggest that the economy this year may generate about as many jobs as last year, when it added 2.2 million, economists say. 
 A separate report yesterday from the Commerce Department showed that the United States economy grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, indicating strength before the hurricanes slowed growth this month.

HEADLINE: Heat Costs Expected To Surge 

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Natural gas prices set a record yesterday, pointing to sharply higher heating bills for a majority of Americans this winter and soaring costs for makers of plastics and chemicals, which use natural gas as their main fuel and raw material. 
 Since the beginning of the summer, the price of natural gas has doubled. But unlike crude oil or gasoline, whose recent price increases have been widely felt by most Americans, the price surge in natural gas -- the most popular source for home heating across the colder regions of the country -- has so far gone largely unnoticed.
That is about to change as colder weather sets in. After the hot summer pushed up natural gas consumption by electricity companies, the prospect of a harsher winter than last year's on top of two devastating punches to the nation's energy hub on the Gulf Coast has led to a significant tightening of natural gas supplies. And unlike the situation with petroleum, which can be readily stored in bulk for long periods of time, there is no National Gas Reserve to turn to when shortages arise. 
 ''It's still under most people's radar screen right now,'' said Carl Neill, an analyst at Risk Management Inc., a natural gas consultant and brokerage firm in Chicago. ''The public has absolutely no idea how high prices are going to be this year. It's going to be mind-boggling.''
 According to recent estimates by the Energy Department, Americans are likely to pay roughly $400 more for their natural gas this winter than last year, with average bills jumping to $1,130. Many analysts, however, warn that these figures may prove too low and are likely to be updated when the government issues its winter price outlook next month.
 While commercial stockpiles of natural gas are currently above a five-year average, prices are now being driven by the uncertainties surrounding the impact of Hurricane Rita on energy installations in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Natural gas prices for November delivery closed at $14.196 a thousand cubic feet, a gain of 9.6 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil rose 44 cents and closed at $66.79 a barrel. Natural gas now costs more than three times its average of $4.70 from 2000 to 2005 and seven times the 1990's average price of $2 a thousand cubic feet.
 President Bush, who called on Americans this week to conserve gasoline by driving less, did not mention natural gas in his remarks. While high prices will increase the incentive to drill for more gas, there is little to restrain the market in the short term. 
 Some government and industry officials are now warning consumers to expect higher heating bills. Guy F. Caruso, the administrator of the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the Energy Department, told the National Association for Business Economics in Chicago on Sunday that he did not expect natural gas prices to drop below $10 per thousand cubic feet this winter, and warned of ''substantial price increases this winter.''
 Only 20 percent of natural gas production in the gulf has been restored nearly a week after Hurricane Rita hit. The region supplies 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, or 16 percent of what is used in homes, businesses, industries and power plants across the nation.
 On shore, dozens of gas-processing facilities, which act like refineries for natural gas, were disabled by the storm and remain closed, creating another bottleneck. The Henry Hub terminal for natural gas in Louisiana, the trading point for the Nymex gas spot contract, has been shut for more than a week. That prompted Nymex to declare ''force majeure'' for September and October deliveries, meaning there is no guarantee the contracts will be fulfilled.
 Natural gas prices have been setting records since Hurricane Katrina pushed prices beyond $10.10 a thousand cubic feet for the first time.
 ''Call it supply constraints or whatever, we have a natural gas market that is tight,'' said Chris McGill, the managing director for policy analysis at the American Gas Association. ''We're meeting demand but at significantly higher prices.'' 
 Gas suppliers will still be able to meet residential demands and most other uses. But some industrial companies might be briefly cut off from natural gas supplies this winter.
 ''We've had huge supply dislocations from the gulf and now the question becomes, Will supplies come back in time to meet winter demand?'' said Owen Kean, an analyst at the American Chemistry Council. 
 The United States produces about 80 percent of the natural gas it consumes. The rest is mostly imported by pipelines from Canada, with a small proportion, about 3 percent, shipped in as liquefied natural gas from North Africa and elsewhere. 
 Even if Canada can export more gas to the United States, there are few other alternatives to make up for the loss in domestic gas supplies. 
 ''Because we have little import capacity, the United States has a recipe to see very high natural gas prices very quickly,'' said Kenneth B. Medlock, a research fellow in energy studies at the Baker Institute of Rice University. 
 Households that rely on government assistance to pay bills could face an especially difficult winter. 
 Congress has budgeted about $2 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or Liheap, for the 2006 fiscal year. But that is no more than last year, when costs were markedly lower.
 Families qualifying for the assistance would receive an average of $300 a year under the current allocation. Billy Jack Gregg, a state consumer advocate in West Virginia, said that was expected to fall well short of the estimated $600 to $700 increase that many families on the East Coast and Midwest will face this winter.
 For months, Tim Thompson, the municipal administrator for the town of Lewisport, Ky., has been watching natural gas prices go up. He is in charge of buying the town's yearly supplies and he kept waiting for an opportune time to lock in a better price.
 ''Prices used to fluctuate pennies from year to year,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Now, I have to knock on doors and try to figure out how much people will be able to pay. This is going to be very hard on ordinary folks.''

HEADLINE: In Minnesota, a Community of Mexican Immigrants Takes Root 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and ELISABETH MALKIN; Eduardo Porter reported from Minnesota for this article, and Elisabeth Malkin from Axochiapan, Mexico.

DATELINE: ST. PAUL 

 BODY:
At first blush, Mexico's newest American consulate might appear out of place. Far from the Mexican border, this prosperous state capital, along with Minneapolis and the surrounding suburbs, form a sprawling metropolis with Scandinavian overtones. 
 Yet by the time the Mexican government opened its 46th consulate in the United States here in June, it was already a latecomer to a bustling Mexican-American community that includes, according to consular officials, 22 churches offering services in Spanish, 9 Spanish-language newspapers, 3 tortilla makers and 9 Hispanic -- mostly Mexican -- soccer leagues.
''We are responding to the needs of the Mexican community,'' said Nathan Wolf, the new consul. ''We are just following the movement of people.'' 
 The location of Mexico's latest American consulate provides a stark illustration of how economically improving groups of Mexican immigrants are establishing themselves across the country, in ways that experts say point to the futility of current attempts to plug the border and stem the flow of illegal migrants in search of a better life.
 [Indeed, while overall migration to the United States peaked in 2000, according to a new study by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, the number of illegal immigrants -- mostly from Mexico -- rose sharply last year after three years of decline that started with the 2001 recession.]
 When the governors of New Mexico and Arizona declared states of emergency in August and called on the federal government to help stop the tide of illegal immigrants coming across the border, their move did nothing to interrupt the consulate's busy preparations to start four Mexican ''hometown associations,'' linking immigrants with their home states.
 ''They call Minneapolis the new Axochiapan,'' said Ramiro Hernandez, a successful businessman who arrived in the United States illegally 20 years ago from Axochiapan, a small town in the central Mexican state of Morelos. ''Ninety percent of the population there has people over here. Kids come here as soon as they come of age.''
 The 2000 census recorded 41,600 Mexican-born people in Minnesota, up from 3,500 counted in 1990. Locals in Minneapolis say that new arrivals have multiplied even faster over the last five years, coming from Mexico and from Mexican hubs in the United States, notably Chicago. ''We think there are around 200,000,'' Mr. Wolf said. 
 A strong local economy helps pull Mexicans from steamy Morelos to the chilly Minnesota plain. The state's unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation; at 3.3 percent, the jobless rate for Minneapolis-St. Paul is the lowest among big metropolitan areas. The forces driving migrants into the United States are even broader, however, and are increasing the supply of working-age Mexicans willing to do whatever it takes to cross the border. 
 ''Immigration trends are virtually unaffected by spending on border enforcement,'' said J. Edward Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who has surveyed migrants in Mexico about their experiences. ''It means the things driving migration are too big to be counteracted by enforcement.''
 Demography plays the biggest role. The Mexican government projects that the 11- to 40-year-old population -- the prime age for migration -- will continue to grow over the next decade, by roughly 6 percent, to 59 million people, before starting to decline over the subsequent 35 years as Mexico ages.
 Economic dynamics also contribute to the flow. Mexico's backward rural economy, which produces only 5 percent of Mexico's output but employs more than a fifth of its labor force of 40 million, is poised to remain a plentiful source of migrants.
 ''There's an unexpectedly high share of workers still in agriculture,'' Professor Taylor said. ''That's like a fault line.''
 While Mexican demographics are pushing, American demand for cheap labor is pulling just as hard. Gordon H. Hanson, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego, argues the immigration boom of the last 20 years resulted from two factors: the growth in the Mexican working-age population and the decline in high school dropout rates in the United States, which reduced the domestic supply of low-skilled workers. ''It was a match made in heaven,'' he said. 
 A Mexican government agency, the National Population Council, forecasts that about 400,000 Mexicans will migrate to the United States every year for the next decade and that the flow should then decline gradually to an estimated 325,000 a year by 2050. Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, argues that at least in the near term, even this estimate seems low.
 To try to stem the flow, the United States government has increased annual spending on border policing in the last 10 years by more than fivefold in real terms. The Border Patrol has swollen to 10,000 agents, equipped with sensors and cameras, planes and drones.
 Yet if the border has become tougher, so, too, have migrants. These days, only a third make it into the United States on their first try, according to a survey by the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies of the University of California, San Diego. But 59 percent make it across on their second to fifth attempts. Only 8 percent give up and go home.
 ''Once I was caught five times,'' said Arnulfo Pliego, 44, a migrant from Axochiapan who first came to the United States in 1989 and has shuttled between Morelos and Minnesota for the last nine years. ''I said to myself, 'I must pass, I must pass,' and I passed.''
 From 1991 to 1994, some 450,000 illegal immigrants were coming to the United States annually, mostly from Mexico. In the first four years of this decade, the average exceeded 600,000, according to the Pew Hispanic Center report.
 Mr. Passel estimates that the Mexican-born population in the United States has swollen to 11 million people, some 60 percent of them here illegally. ''If you look at the numbers,'' he said, ''it seems that anybody that wants to get in does.''
 Indeed, the stepped-up border policing is deterring immigrants from returning home and encouraging them to settle in the United States indefinitely. Meanwhile, the sheer numbers provide new incentives to migrate, as strong networks of immigrants emerge, linking communities on both sides of the border, making migration somewhat easier and effectively transforming it to a routine.
 Consider Rosalba Cano. When she followed her husband north, leaving Axochiapan with her 2-year-old child 10 years ago, there were very few of her compatriots in Minneapolis. ''I only came because my husband said he was leaving and wouldn't be back in a while,'' said Ms. Cano, 33, a former preschool teacher. ''I was all alone here for a long time.''
 But then one of Ms. Cano's sisters arrived, followed by her brother and a couple of cousins. She now has three uncles in town. Ms. Cano's husband, Osvaldo Garcia, a former farmworker from Axochiapan, has two brothers and two sisters living in the Twin Cities. 
 The latest arrival is Ms. Cano's sister-in-law, Obsidiana Enriquez Navarro, 25, who quit her job with the Axochiapan municipal government last year, paid a smuggler $2,000 to get her across the border, then trudged through the Arizona desert before catching transportation to Minneapolis.
 There are so many men from Axochiapan in the area that the village priest came to visit. ''Father Miguel came to look for the husbands and take them back, but he didn't manage to get any,'' Ms. Enriquez Navarro said.
 Migration is leaving a deep mark on Axochiapan, a county seat at the center of a cluster of villages with a population of some 30,000. In one village, Quebrantadero, people talk of closing the primary school because there are so few young children left.
 In Tlalayo, another village, the streets are paved and lined with two-story concrete houses, the product of a construction boomlet financed by remittances from the United States. But with crop prices low and government subsidies limited, the traditional agricultural economy has withered, leaving only elderly men to till the fields. 
 Municipal officials in Axochiapan estimate that at least a third of the population has moved. The mayor wants to honor the migrants with a 10-foot statue of a man carrying a bag and leaving his wife and two children behind. That may seem paradoxical but he has his reasons. 
 ''I realize that Mexico has moved ahead thanks to remittances,'' said the mayor, Leopoldo Rodriguez Galarza. ''In part, they have helped reduce poverty.''
 The human flow is changing the Twin Cities, too. East Lake Street in Minneapolis, formerly gang-ridden and drug-infested, has become a lively Mexican commercial center.
 Mr. Hernandez, who is now a legal resident in the United States, first went into business bringing in Mexican cuts of meat like the salt-cured cecina steak and the heavily spiced pork al pastor from Chicago, and Mexican videos he bought from a bankrupt Blockbuster in California.
 He now owns several jewelry shops, a money remittance business, three cowboy-wear stores and a video-rental shop. He is a partner in a local Spanish-language radio station and a supermarket. 
 And in an echo of the planned Axochiapan monument, he is working with other local community leaders to persuade the governor of Morelos to donate a statue of Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary hero.
 These cross-border connections have become so strong, officials say, that nothing is likely to stop Axochiapan's citizens from continuing to seek jobs in the Twin Cities.
 In the Cano-Garcia household, Mr. Garcia earns $15 an hour driving a dump truck for a landscaping business and Ms. Cano makes $11 an hour as a supervisor at a taco grill. It is money they could never dream of earning in Mexico. 
 With two more children, they now own a house, a small duplex in a leafy neighborhood across from a park. The state government has provided extensive help to care for their second son, who is autistic.
 ''I am very happy with Minnesota,'' Ms. Cano said. ''I have done very well here. It's the best for the future of my children.'' 
 Meanwhile, the Mexican government is making plans for its next consulate. According to Mr. Wolf, it should open in Little Rock, Ark., before the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Some Earnings Forecasts Lift Hopes and Share Prices 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, ending four days of malaise, as better-than-expected earnings forecasts from companies like PepsiCo suggested that profit growth can withstand higher energy prices.
 ''We are looking for another good earnings season,'' said David Chalupnik, who oversees $41 billion as head of equities at First American Funds in Minneapolis. ''If energy could just stabilize, I think it would be a positive for the market.'' Aiding yesterday's advance were reports showing that consumer and business spending grew and that jobless claims fell more than previously estimated in the second quarter. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,227.68 after gaining 0.1 percent or less each day since Sept. 22. The Dow Jones industrial average added 79.69, or 0.8 percent, to 10,552.78.
 Red Hat, the world's biggest distributor of Linux software, fueled a rally in the Nasdaq market after the company said sales and profit might exceed analysts' estimates. The Nasdaq composite index gained 25.82, or 1.2 percent, to 2,141.22.
 Stock indexes bounced between gains and losses in morning trading as oil for November delivery rose and fell in New York. Oil prices gained 0.7 percent, to $66.79 a barrel. Oil reached a record $70.85 on Aug. 30, the day after Hurricane Katrina hit the United States mainland.
 About 10 stocks rose for every 3 that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Almost 1.63 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 11 percent more than the three-month average.
 PepsiCo, the world's No. 2 soft-drink maker after Coca-Cola, climbed $1.44, to $56.50. Excluding a charge, the company said it would earn $2.64 to $2.65 a share this year, more than the July forecast of at least $2.60. 
 Shares of Red Hat rose $4.93, to $21.44. The company said it expected sales of as much as $71.5 million and profit of 9 cents to 10 cents a share this quarter, higher than analysts had forecast.
 Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage lender, rallied $3.18, or 7.6 percent, to $44.89 for the best performance in the S.&P. 500. The company's estimated $10.8 billion earnings restatement may require only a small increase after a report of new accounting errors, analysts said. Shares of Fannie Mae tumbled 11 percent on Wednesday after Dow Jones reported that an inquiry had turned up more accounting violations. 
 Shares of Research in Motion retreated $7.25, to $70. The company, which makes BlackBerry e-mail pagers, said it had added 620,000 subscribers in the second quarter, missing some analysts' estimates ranging as high as 650,000. 
 Treasury securities fell in price after a government report showed that weekly initial jobless claims had declined more than forecast. The report bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates twice more this year to keep rising commodity prices from leading to faster inflation.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.29 percent, from 4.25 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Chatting Among the Hedges

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Hedge funds make an unlikely interest group. 
 They prize secrecy, for one thing, and operate as lone wolves, fiercely guarding their trading strategies. Their clients are mostly wealthy individuals and large institutional investors, so hedge funds have not seemed to need a public voice.
Yet with so many hedge funds clustered in towns like Greenwich and Stamford in Connecticut, it is perhaps not surprising that a new hedge fund association has sprung up. 
 The Connecticut Hedge Fund Association says about 100 people in the hedge fund business have signed up as members since it started taking applications in July. There are at least 512 hedge funds in Connecticut, and those funds managed about $111 billion as of July, according to Tremont Capital Management, a company that tracks hedge funds.
 ''If there's a need for an association like this regionally, it's here in Connecticut, where we have arguably the No.1 or No.2 concentration of hedge fund managers,'' said Bruce McGuire, president and founder of the association and also the founder of BluePoint Partners, a marketing consultancy serving hedge funds in Darien.
 Mr. McGuire said the association planned to reach out to about 200 of the top hedge funds in the state as well as about 30 large institutional investors. Membership costs $900 a year for managers who oversee more than $1 billion, and $700 for those who oversee lesser amounts. The association aims to be a public voice for the funds as well as a forum for sharing ideas and practical business discussions. It will also hold social events, he said.
 ''It's a good idea to have an association that can act as a single-voice amplifier to speak to people in state government, to educate people up in Hartford, about what this industry is all about,'' Mr. McGuire said.
 The words ''hedge fund'' and ''Connecticut'' have been linked in the news of late, but chiefly in reference to the fraud and collapse at the Bayou Group, based in Stamford. 
 Mr. McGuire acknowledged that his group had been concerned that the Bayou scandal might tarnish the industry's reputation. The Connecticut association is preparing a report on Bayou for a conference at the International Center for Finance at the Yale School of Management next week. 
 Despite the new effort to educate the public on the hedge fund business, the group remains secretive on some counts. Mr. McGuire declined to name any of the group's 100 members or say how many of them are hedge fund managers, as opposed to institutional investors and service providers who market to hedge funds.
 The association's board includes Chris Patterson, the chief compliance officer at Tudor Investment Corporation, and David W. Wiederecht, co-head of alternative investments at GE Asset Management, which invests in hedge funds. Neither of the two board members would comment on the association.
 Robert J. Shiller, an economist from Yale, is listed as an adviser to the association, but Professor Shiller did not reply to inquiries about his involvement with the group. 
 For top hedge fund managers, ''there is absolutely no need at all to discuss their returns or strategies or even share that they exist,'' said Andrew Ang, an associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Business, who is also a consultant to several hedge funds. ''What sorts of people would reveal information or report returns or join these industry bodies? It's not clear.''
 Timothy Ng, president of FAM Global Investments, a fund of funds, was one of the first board members Mr. McGuire recruited. 
 ''We can be helpful and informative for the regulators,'' Mr. Ng said. ''They are not up to date on the complete nuances and how these things really work on an ongoing basis.''
 Mr. McGuire insisted, however, that the association was not a lobbying group, and would serve educational purposes.
 There are other, similar regional hedge fund associations, including groups in Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Georgia, and for many of them the social aspect is as important as the work. The Connecticut association, for example, held a large social event this summer at Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich.
 Indeed, founders of other regional hedge fund associations said networking was one of the main purposes of their groups. 
 ''Managers were just craving to talk with other managers,'' said Lauren C. Templeton, a hedge fund manager who founded the Southeastern Hedge Fund Association in Atlanta in 2001. ''We were going to conferences in Bermuda and Switzerland just to meet people that ran the same type of business as you down the street.''

HEADLINE: 'JUNEBUG' 

BYLINE: By DANA STEVENS

 BODY:
In Phil Morrison's film ''Junebug,'' a Chicago art dealer (Embeth Davidtz) travels South to research the work of a self-taught artist named David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor, above.) The paintings attributed to the fictional Wark -- strange, visionary tableaus of racial and sexual violence during the Civil War, painted with acrylic, ink and house paint on found surfaces, including plywood, linoleum and book covers -- were actually made for the film by a Brooklyn-based artist, Ann Wood. What is it like for a trained painter to be commissioned to produce work that deliberately invokes that of an untrained, or ''outsider,'' artist? In an interview, Ms. Wood recalled her working process for the film: ''Phil and I spent a lot of time together looking at things -- naive art and Civil War photography and the murals at Pompeii -- and experimenting during the week or so before he went to North Carolina to begin filming. The first few attempts weren't successful, but in each step of the process, we solved a problem or found a piece of the puzzle. Phil's got a giant imagination.'' She acknowledged the influence of well-known outsider artists like Howard Finster, Horace Pippin and Henry Darger on the ''Junebug'' paintings. She said of Darger: ''There are some obvious similarities -- the uniformed soldiers, violence and weird sexuality but what I love about them, am inspired by, and refer to them for is composition.'' 
 Like the film itself, Ms. Wood raises some objections to the concept of ''outsider'' art as a category: ''I'm not sure what the adjective is for, and I dislike it. Does it mean your art is only art, or valuable or important, in the context of your race or sex or economic status or geography or whatever combination of those things constitutes an 'outsider'? I think work is either interesting and worthy, or it isn't.'' (A show of 23 of Ms. Wood's works, including some of the paintings from ''Junebug,'' is on display at Johnson, 179 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, www.johnsonshop.com, through Oct. 9.)

HEADLINE: Within Images of Excess, A Glint of Moral Theater 

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''We are very rich, and the world is ours to have.'' If art could speak for its owners, that is what 17th-century Dutch still-life paintings might say. And they might add something else: ''We are very afraid.''
 You can hear those bold and nervous voices speaking in ''Pieter Claesz: Master of Haarlem Still Life,'' a chamber-music-size exhibition installed in a suite of wood-paneled rooms at the National Gallery of Art. Or rather you can see their conflicted emotions playing out in paintings of flatware, beakers and food.
 Here, for example, is a table set for a simple but sumptuous breakfast, with a fresh hard roll, a plump mince pie, a glass of wine and one expensive, exotic treat: a Mediterranean lemon, just peeled and sliced, still succulent. All this is presented on a crisp white cloth, along with a little book, an almanac, which will tell the merchant how the weather will be for ships at sea. 
 And here is another painting with most of the same components, but with everything slightly changed. Judging by a dusting of crumbs, the hard roll is going stale; the pie looks depleted and tired. The wine glass is upside down, and a gilded cup, a gaudy addition, lies on its side. A napkin appears to have been discarded, as if the diner had rushed away. There is an atmosphere of interruption, even alarm.
 Both pictures exemplify a specific art genre within a genre, the tabletop still life, popular in what is called the Dutch Golden Age. And both are exercises in art as moral theater. With their shared cast of inanimate characters, they might be the first and last acts of a tragedy, one that begins with a scene from a prosperous, get-ahead, everyday life, and ends with a scene of that same life brought fatefully low.
 Both paintings, along with 23 others in the show, are by Pieter Claesz, an artist who gained a degree of fame in the era of Rembrandt, Frans Hals and Jacob van Ruisdael, but about whom we know little. 
 He was born in 1596 or 1597 in the village of Berchem, near Antwerp, where still-life painting had an early vogue, and where he probably trained as an artist. Around 1621, perhaps in search of a less competitive market, he moved to Haarlem. There he was twice married and twice a widower, raised a family (a son, Nicolaes Berchem, became a landscape painter), and seemed to have lived until his death in 1660.
 At the time Claesz settled in Haarlem, the Dutch Republic was hugely rich. It controlled grain supplies on which its much larger neighbors depended, and had developed a lucrative international maritime trade. It also purposefully distinguished itself as a Calvinist nation of industrious, hard-headed, God-fearing people, for whom wealth was a badge of grace, ostentation a mark of decadence and salvation a promise that could be withdrawn in a twinkling. 
 And for the burghers of Haarlem, hungry for tangible signs of grace to fill their homes, Claesz's still lifes were just the ticket: subdued in scale and tone, jewel-like in execution and judiciously edifying. 
 In some cases, a moral message was subtly disguised. But in the type of picture known as the ''vanitas,'' at which Claesz excelled, it was baldly stated. There is no mistaking, for instance, the mortal import of a 1628 painting of a skull surrounded by a smoldering lamp, a worn-down quill pen, and a tipped-over goblet. 
 Even in this relatively early, straightforward work, however, Claesz isn't content with a simple lineup of symbols. Instead, he choreographs a witty and macabre little dance. The feather end of the quill tickles the skull's cheek. The skull leans against the base of the tipped-over glass, like someone eavesdropping through a wall. The glass itself reflects the light-filled windows of a room, presumably the one where the painter -- and the viewer -- is sitting.
 Interpreting such pictures, with their slippery conventions and hallucinatory realities, is a chancy business, easily overdone. Scholars disagree on what means what, and on where moral or religious significance ends and plain old over-the-fireplace decoration begins. 
 And what about personal content? Is Claesz's art the work of a religious man? (Surviving documents suggest he may have been Roman Catholic.) A moralist? A patron-pleaser? A melancholic? The individualistic pulse of a Chardin may be beating in his work, but if so, it is muffled under layers of period artifice.
 What we do know is that the tabletop still life as a genre grew ever more elaborate toward mid-century, as social proscriptions on the showy display of wealth weakened. The sort of decorous, near-monochromatic breakfast scenes that established Claesz's Haarlem reputation swelled into pageant-like depictions of banquet tables, feasts crowded with game, shellfish, fruit, pastries and beakers of wine and beer. 
 At the same time, vanitas-type images became cataclysmic. In a painting from 1647, Claesz shows a laden table in chaotic disarray with, center stage, a skinny roast capon lying like a sacrificial victim, a knife protruding from its breast. With its air of decay in progress, the picture is like a snapshot of a flooded and abandoned city after the waters have begun to subside. 
 Unsurprisingly, as Dutch taste for extravagance continued unchecked, interest in a conscience-pricking art declined, as did Haarlem's economic fortune. The market for paintings crashed. Maybe that explains why, after Claesz's death, his twin daughters had to be sent to a city orphanage. 
 Certainly the admonitory impulse in his painting feels quaint, at best, in the context of our own materially fixated culture. For most viewers the virtuosity of his work -- its technical finesse, its uncanny illusionism -- is its point. We marvel at his skill in depicting details of his world that are also details of our world: the sheen on ripe fruit, the glint of gold, light welling up from a half-filled glass. 
 Even devotees of modernist abstraction will find Claesz rewarding. Viewed close up, an expanse of white tablecloth in one of his pictures is almost identical, in its restrained but vivacious brushwork, to a passage of white in a Mondrian. And surely Mondrian himself scrutinized Claesz's compositions, monumental in their ordered probity, but also inventive, varied, never rigid.
 The mention of Mondrian raises the question of moral purpose in art. Mondrian's art is utopian; utopias are absolutist. They are about yes or no, right or wrong. They are based on an idea of perfection. Perfection requires control, creates dominion, believes in its own election. Such a sense of election fueled, for a little while, the superpower Dutch Republic of the 17th century, and will continue to fuel, for a little while, the superpower United States of today. 
 Claesz's paintings, even with their Calvinist roots and formal perfections, offer a different vision: unutopian, worldly, realistic, tragic. They speak of power, and the contingency of power; of materiality, and the vulnerability of material; of absolutes, and the absolute law of constant change. Their voices will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, but Washington is a place they should be heard. 

''Pieter Claesz: Master of Haarlem Still Life'' is at the National Gallery of Art, Fourth Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, (202)737-4215, through Dec. 31. The show was organized in Washington by Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., curator of Northern Baroque painting at the National Gallery, in collaboration with the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem and the Kunsthaus Zurich.

HEADLINE: Housing for Storm's Evacuees Lagging Far Behind U.S. Goals 

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and LESLIE EATON; Leslie Eaton reported from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
After Hurricane Katrina left hundreds of thousands of people homeless, the Federal Emergency Management Agency signed contracts for more than $2 billion in temporary housing, including more than 120,000 trailers and mobile homes. But the agency has placed just 109 Louisiana families in those homes.
 A month after the disaster, the federal government's temporary housing effort is stumbling.
 The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that FEMA was freezing many orders for trailers, although the agency disputes that. Members of Congress, complaining that a $236 million deal to lease three ships to house evacuees was far too expensive, are calling for an investigation. And under an alternative FEMA program to give victims cash to find their own housing, 332,000 households have been approved in just a week. 
 Federal officials acknowledge that the installation of mobile homes has moved slowly, especially in Louisiana. But they are blaming the disruption caused by Hurricane Rita, as well as local officials in Louisiana.
 ''We as a federal government can't come in and just place anything anywhere,'' said James McIntyre, a FEMA spokesman. ''This is not a takeover. We have to work within the limitations set by state and local officials.''
 Louisiana officials, though, have been working tirelessly to find spots for the trailers, said Kim Hunter Reed, director of policy and planning for Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco.
 Ms. Reed described the process as too cumbersome and in need of streamlining, but said: ''We are working as fast and as hard as we can to make this happen. We have thousands of people in shelters who are past ready to move.''
 Almost 48,000 people remain in shelters in Louisiana, according to the governor's office, and about 30,000 Louisiana citizens are in shelters in other states. For those who want to stay in Louisiana, FEMA's new cash and voucher programs are not a solution, Ms. Reed said, because there is no vacant housing. 
 Some housing experts say it would make sense to scrap plans for large-scale installations or even for the smaller 500-unit trailer parks the agency now envisions.
 ''There are a lot of problems with trailers,'' said Susan J. Popkin, a researcher for the Urban Institute in Washington. ''You're concentrating people in the middle of nowhere, and once they're there, it's very hard for them to get out.''
 Especially if displaced families get relocation help and other social services, Ms. Popkin said, they would be better off moving to places with existing schools, hospitals and other infrastructure. ''People's basic needs go beyond a roof,'' she said.
 FEMA is leasing three ships from Carnival Cruise Lines and a fourth from Scotia Prince Lines; together, they can hold 8,116 people. 
 As of Wednesday, 3,726 people were on the ships when a census was taken, suggesting they may be less than half full. FEMA officials say that understates occupancy, because not all guests are on the ships at any given time. Based on the number of people registered to stay on the ships -- most of whom are doing recovery work -- FEMA officials believe the ships are more than 80 percent full and will be at capacity in a few days.
 ''It serves quite a big need to put people in the right location,'' Natalie Rule, a FEMA spokeswoman, said. ''People needed to rebuild.''
 But the ship deal has drawn rebukes from several lawmakers, some of whom are calling for an investigation into how the Carnival contract was negotiated. The three Carnival ships are costing the government $236 million, or about $1,280 per person per week, assuming full occupancy. The Scotia Prince ferry, less luxurious, is costing $13 million, or about $500 per person a week. 
 ''Where was the judgment?'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
 Mr. Coburn suggested that the government could have saved money by simply sending people on a six-month cruise, as the advertised weekly rates for some Carnival cruises to the Caribbean are lower. ''I don't know anybody who has experience in finance or in business who says that the price they paid is appropriate,'' he said. 
 Carnival has said that the government payments would simply replace the revenues it would have collected if it sailed its planned cruises. Four analysts who track the industry said that Carnival had negotiated a good deal, but that there were too many variables involved -- including lost gambling revenues -- to determine whether it would prove to be a windfall for the company. 
 The temporary housing FEMA has provided was made available fairly quickly in Alabama and Mississippi. Nearly 4,000 travel trailers or mobile homes are ready for occupancy in those two states, and many of them are already filled.
 But progress has been much slower in Louisiana. Only 1,397 travel trailers or mobile homes have been installed, and just 109 are occupied. About 1,000 trailers have been given to businesses, like the Folger's coffee operation of Procter & Gamble, for temporary housing for workers.
 Ron Albright, program manager for the Fluor Corporation of Aliso Viejo, Calif., the engineering consulting firm hired by FEMA to install the units, acknowledged that the work had gone slower than the company would like. Mr. Albright said getting approval to occupy land that has access to basic utilities and other infrastructure had been difficult.
 Several big trailer parks are in the works, but FEMA is nowhere near a goal that it set earlier this month of delivering 30,000 units of housing every two weeks.
 Officials from FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency, said they were still committed to providing temporary housing through mobile homes and trailers. But they said they wanted to give evacuees choices.
 ''It may be some will voluntarily choose to go where there are jobs, and for the time being use temporary housing assistance,'' Ms. Rule, the FEMA spokeswoman, said. ''Maybe they'll want to rebuild on their lots and they'll want to put a trailer there. We're not going to make them do it, but we're going to enable them to do it.''
 So, a week ago, the federal government announced it would provide two kinds of rental assistance to evacuees for up to 18 months. It can be used anywhere in the country.
 Homeowners and renters are eligible for cash payments; people who had been living in federally subsidized housing are eligible for a voucher program.
 Edgar O. Olsen, an economist at the University of Virginia, said that this kind of program made more sense than installing a lot of trailers, even though it might result in a steep drop in population.
 ''Let the individuals decide what makes most sense,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''If it means the population of New Orleans is less, that may bother some politicians in Louisiana. It doesn't bother me in the slightest.''

HEADLINE: A Job as Big as Texas, From Dawn Till Long Past Dusk 

BYLINE: By NATHAN LEVY

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
Somehow, he managed to sleep at night. But in the three feverish weeks he catered to the needs of hurricane victims, Refael Eizraelov never really got a break. 
 ''Everything you do during the days, it's still alive during your dreams,'' said Mr. Eizraelov, a 28-year-old native of Jerusalem. 
Finally, after two hurricanes and volunteer work in two cities, he rested this week. 
 ''I feel very good,'' he said Tuesday by telephone from his home, the Austin apartment he shares with his wife, who was raised in Texas. ''Today was the first day in which I woke up, called friends in Israel, checked e-mails.'' 
 Mr. Eizraelov, who is unemployed and waiting to get his green card, drove to Houston a few days after Hurricane Katrina to help the bedraggled arrivals from New Orleans.
 ''In the beginning, I was serving food in the Astrodome, sorting piles of clothing and shoes, things people donate,'' he said.
 His mother-in-law, Dr. Mary Gasal, an obstetrician-gynecologist, assisted in the triage area, he said, and Mr. Eizraelov became a ''runner,'' shepherding the sick to doctors gathered inside the stadium.
 ''I carried a few babies with fever,'' he said in a thick accent. ''You can feel them when you carry them. They were very hot and dizzy.'' 
 Mr. Eizraelov is used to challenges. He served in the Israeli Army, and cared for his ill mother before her death from cancer three years ago; his father, he says, was abusive and dealt drugs. 
 ''You learn in the Israeli Army that there are situations you need to solve,'' he said. ''There's nothing that's hard or easy. It depends on how much you're willing to do.'' 
 After a few days in Houston, Mr. Eizraelov decided to work closer to home, with the American Red Cross at the Austin Convention Center. Several hundred evacuees with special needs -- those in wheelchairs, the blind, the elderly and some with mental illnesses -- had to be identified, tracked and checked every half-hour, said Mr. Eizraelov, who headed the operation.
 He would start at 7 a.m. and get home after 10 p.m., exhausted.
 ''I would be watching 'The Daily Show,''' he said, ''and that's when my eyes would turn off.''
 His wife, Sarah Mogab, would drag him to bed, a process he described by using the Hebrew verb ''legared.'' His translation: ''To scrape something off the floor.'' 
 Last weekend Mr. Eizraelov turned to helping evacuees from Hurricane Rita. But he took a break at several points to accompany his wife and mother-in-law to the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
 ''That's something I cannot say no to,'' he said sheepishly. ''If you're going to say no, it's a family incident.'' NATHAN LEVY

HEADLINE: A Letter From the Shores of Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Umm Qasr, Iraq 

 BODY:
To reach the headquarters of the Iraqi Navy in the port of Umm Qasr, my U.S. Navy escort and I had to drive in from Kuwait. We were met at the border by two jeeps with the Royal Marines who escorted us to Umm Qasr at dusk. Even though this is the safest part of Iraq, we had to be outfitted in body armor, and the Royal Marines had their automatic weapons loaded and ready. They kept every civilian car we passed, every kid on a bicycle, in their sights, just in case one was a suicide bomber.
 And no wonder -- roadside bombs have suddenly started to appear on this route. And the enemy just keeps getting smarter. After the coalition forces introduced jamming devices to block roadside bombs detonated with cellphones, the insurgents started using infrared devices from garage door openers. So much ingenuity for so much malevolence. And this is the safe, Shiite part of Iraq. 
The British Royal Navy is in charge of training the 1,000-man Iraqi Navy, which I wanted to see for two reasons. First, the effort to get Iraq's Navy back afloat is a microcosm of all the good, the bad and the ugly that is involved in trying to rebuild Iraq's military. And second, the Iraqi Navy has a very important job: with U.S., British and Australian help, it oversees Iraq's only port and the two oil pumping platforms off the coast of Umm Qasr. This is where virtually all of Iraq's one million barrels of oil -- nearly 90 percent of Iraq's G.D.P. -- gets loaded onto tankers daily. 
 The good news? The Umm Qasr port is busy today -- 50 cargo ships a month offload air-conditioners, refrigerators, microwaves, satellite dishes and cars for Iraqi consumers. Virtually every Iraqi naval officer I encountered had his own cellphone. Three years ago no one here had one. And considering that 18 months ago Iraq had no working navy, the fact that it now has a cadre of officers who have taken over the training, so the British and U.S. Coast Guard contingents here can focus on training the trainers, is also real progress.
 But progress is slow. One day last week a whole boatload of Iraqi sailors decided to take a long lunch break and blew off the afternoon training. Too hot. When sailors misbehave, the Iraqis fall back on Saddamist discipline. The other day, an Iraqi officer suggested to his British adviser that a misbehaving sailor be buried in sand up to his neck. 
 The biggest challenge, explained Capt. John Clink of the Royal Navy, is getting middle-management Iraqis to take the initiative, especially when things go wrong. This requires a huge cultural shift.
 Saddam's tyrannical rule over nearly three decades conditioned people here never to assume responsibility.
 ''There is a huge problem with fear of blame, fear of failure,'' Captain Clink said. ''The result is a tendency to look away when a problem arises, to ignore it or just not do anything in the hopes that it will all go away.'' A vast majority of Iraqi military personnel, Captain Clink added, ''have had the initiative kicked out of them by decades of repression. When Patrol Boat 1 breaks down, it is amazingly difficult to get them to decide how to get around the problem. They want to refer everything to the operational commander. 
 ''At the younger level, though, the 25-year-olds, you start to see a completely different outlook on life. They are not superstars, but you see better English, more initiative, better leadership. And these are the guys out driving the patrol boats.'' 
 The problem is that the Iraqi Ministry of Defense in Baghdad is so dysfunctional that it is next to impossible to get these Iraqi junior officers promoted. And one month last summer the whole Iraqi Navy didn't get paid. 
 The Iraqi government ordered three new fast patrol boats from a contractor in Baghdad for millions of dollars. They are being finished on the dock in Umm Qasr, but no one knows whether they will stay afloat, because of all the extras that were added by the Iraqis without regard to seaworthiness. 
 The Iraqi Navy has a couple of terrific, dedicated commanders -- real leaders, respected by their men. But when they go back home to lawless Basra, they never know whether masked men will attack them, as has happened to colleagues. And behind these few real leaders, there is no effective middle management.
 So yes, we've trained a lot of Iraqi soldiers in the last 18 months, but that is not the relevant number. The relevant number is how many will be paid on time, how many will get promoted when they've earned it, how many will show up for training after lunch, how many will follow when their commander says charge, and how many can go home on weekends and tell people what they really do. That number has a long way to go.

HEADLINE: Levee Reconstruction Will Restore, but Not Improve, Defenses in New Orleans

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ and ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The costly federal effort to rebuild New Orleans's flood defenses in time for next year's hurricane season will leave the city no less vulnerable to major storms than it was to Hurricane Katrina, engineers and other experts say. 
 And it will take years or decades, these experts say, to provide New Orleans and nearby communities with protection against hurricanes stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which was nowhere near the worst-case storm when it arrived. Its winds over the city and Lake Pontchartrain were apparently far below the Category 3 standard that was chosen in 1965 as the storm to defend against.
''It took us 30 years to get to a Category 3 standard,'' Brig. Gen. William T. Grisoli, the deputy commander of Task Force Katrina for the Army Corps of Engineers, said of the defenses in an interview. ''You're not going to be at Category 5 by the next hurricane season.'' 
 Citing the 350 miles of levees in the region, General Grisoli added, ''Put it in perspective: It's not going to happen.''
 The corps is now involved in an arduous process to restore the levees to their previous level of protection, beginning with quick patches and ending, if all goes according to schedule, just before next year's hurricane season with the levees restored to their level of strength before the storms hit.
 Solutions for the longer term are not yet on the drawing boards, but experts have wide-ranging ideas that include strengthening the current levee system, finishing long-planned projects that have limped along because of court fights and tight budgets, and even reshaping the city to recognize that some of its lowest-lying areas might serve as future flood basins in the guise of parks or other undeveloped land. 
 For now, the Corps of Engineers acknowledges that with two months left in this year's hurricane season, New Orleans is without any defense against a major storm. Its patched levees can barely withstand a modest storm surge, and flood walls and the taxed drains and pumps can handle only six inches of rain, as last week's renewed flooding in the Lower Ninth Ward showed.
 ''We don't have hurricane protection,'' General Grisoli said.
 Senator Mary L. Landrieu, who is co-sponsor of a $225 billion legislative proposal that includes upgraded flood protection and regional rebuilding, said the job ahead ''goes beyond building a higher wall'' against storm waters. ''As this hurricane season tapers off,'' she said, ''we have to be well on our way to drafting a master plan to create the most sophisticated levee system in the world,'' with many elements working together. 
 ''It's not a local problem -- it's not a regional problem,'' Ms. Landrieu said. Because of the economic importance of the area for energy and commerce, ''It's a national problem, and it's a very expensive problem to fix.'' 
 In the long run, the challenges will only grow. Sea levels are rising around the world, and the land around New Orleans -- including the levees -- is sinking. The Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico have entered a cycle of intensified hurricane activity that could last a decade or two, and two recent studies have found that global warming might already be causing storms to be stronger than they otherwise would be.
 Craig E. Colten, a professor of geography and anthropology at Louisiana State University, said that what could protect against even a Category 5 storm today ''might not stand up to the worst kind of storm in 50 or 100 years.''
 Many experts agree on basic measures that could be taken to prevent further flooding, if Congress opens the purse strings. 
 Alfred Naomi, senior project manager for the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers, has studied ways to bring New Orleans up to Category 5 protection and says any defense against such storms would start with barriers in the channels connecting Lake Pontchartrain with the Gulf of Mexico.
 The gates, which would be shut during storms, would prevent the surging gulf waters from adding to any surge from the lake. 
 This would in turn reduce the amount of water coursing up the drainage canals that carry the pumped runoff out of the city and into the lake. The failure of thin flood walls along those drainage canals caused most of the flooding of central New Orleans. 
 Smaller gates at the mouths of those canals could stop residual surges of floodwater from the lake, Mr. Naomi said. The city's pumping system can be modernized and improved, and levees and floodwalls will have to be made higher. But the added weight would cause them to sink even faster, and added width -- three feet for every vertical foot -- would require costly condemnation of nearby real estate. A Louisiana flood control official said that much could be accomplished for the New Orleans area by completing projects currently on the books and rethinking the regional patchwork of programs.
 ''Right now we have a piecemeal system,'' said the official, Ed Preau, the assistant secretary for public works with the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. 
 While the current projects offer protection only to the Category 3 level, Mr. Preau said, they could be strengthened. ''The big issue is going to be to get past the environmental concerns,'' he said, adding that wrangling with environmental groups over big projects has slowed the process. Harold Schoeffler, a local official with the Sierra Club and Audubon Society, called the accusation that projects had been significantly slowed by environmental groups ''a bunch of baloney.''
 Environmental groups never tried to block projects like a flood gate for Lake Pontchartrain, Mr. Schoeffler said; they have only demanded that the corps address the environmental impact.
 Mr. Schoeffler said the Atchafalaya River and its basin, west of the city, could play a much larger role in defense against floods. He noted that the tangled delta of the Atchafalaya naturally protects the region against storm surges, and added that the corps could enhance that protection by dredging deeper channels. 
 ''The deltas are very beneficial,'' he said, ''but you've still got to get the water out.''
 Professor Colten of Louisiana State, the author of ''Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans from Nature,'' said engineering work must be accompanied by efforts to restore nature's own systems for fighting floods. With the delta sinking, he said, ''The most fundamental activity outside of the city would be to restore the wetlands.'' 
 Like many environmentalists and other experts, he advocates shutting down the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a 40-year-old shipping channel that is lightly used by industry but appears to have served as a superhighway for the Katrina storm surge, contributing to the devastation of levees and flooding in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward.
 Robert Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was important not to rush into an ill-conceived plan. 
 ''Don't just try to throw $200 billion at it,'' said Dr. Bea, who has worked for the corps and who lost his home when Hurricane Betsy struck New Orleans in 1965. ''We really know how to do it better,'' but ''we do need to slow down and think how to do it.'' 
 Professor Bea's ideas include eliminating many of the city's open canals entirely and replacing them with powerful underground drainage and pumping systems. He said he would also like to see barrier islands built in front of major inlets to block storm surges. 
 Thomas L. Jackson, a longtime resident of New Orleans who is vice president in the local offices of DMJM Harris, a large engineering company, said the federal government needed to rethink the way it protects against hurricanes. 
 After the great Mississippi River floods of 1927, Congress gave the Corps of Engineers broad powers and ample financing to do whatever was needed to prevent a similar disaster in New Orleans, including extremely strong riverside levees. By contrast, hurricane protections, which were approved after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, have greater Congressional oversight and control, and projects are subjected to a cost-benefit balancing test. 
 ''Dams are built based on avoiding the catastrophe that would result if they failed, not on a benefit-cost ratio,'' Mr. Jackson said, adding that the same standard should apply equally to hurricane protection systems for New Orleans. 
 William F. Marcuson III, the former director of the Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss., and president-elect of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said that even though elected officials have vowed the city would be rebuilt, in the long run it would be foolhardy to redevelop many of the most flood-prone areas. 
 Essentially, he said, those areas want to be bays and wetlands. ''Buy the lots back and let insurance pay for the houses,'' he went on. ''Then maybe make it a golf course or bird sanctuary.''
 Recovery after a disaster generally takes far more time than people expect, said Robert W. Kates, emeritus professor of geography at Brown University. Dr. Kates, who has developed a well-regarded four-stage model of disaster recovery, said that the fourth stage -- the one in which greater levels of protection are put in place -- is rarely accomplished because it can take many decades. 
 As the rebuilding proceeds to the final stage of reconstruction, he said, the tensions that arise after every disaster are sure to emerge in New Orleans -- especially the very common conflict between those who insist on putting things back in place quickly and those who say, ''Let's do it right. Let's do it better.''

HEADLINE: 2 Teams Identify Chinese Bat As SARS Virus Hiding Place

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
The SARS virus, which has killed 774 people worldwide, has long been known to come from an animal. Now two scientific teams have independently identified the Chinese horseshoe bat as that animal and as a hiding place for the virus in nature.
 The bats apparently are healthy carriers of SARS, which caused severe economic losses, particularly in Asia, as it spread to Canada and other countries. In Asia, many people eat bats or use bat feces in traditional medicine for asthma, kidney ailments and general malaise. 
The Chinese horseshoe bat does not exist in the United States. 
 The finding is important in preventing outbreaks of SARS and similar viruses carried by bats because it provides an opportunity for scientists to break the transmission chain. 
 One team from China, Australia and the United States reported its findings yesterday in the online version of Science. The other team, from the University of Hong Kong, reported its findings on Tuesday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 ''It's pretty pleasant to see two teams that did not know each other reach similar findings,'' Dr. Lin-Fa Wang, a virologist at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, said in a telephone interview. After collecting hundreds of bats from the wild and from Chinese markets, each team reported identifying different viruses from the coronavirus family that are very closely related to the SARS virus. 
 SARS, or sudden acute respiratory syndrome, first appeared in China in 2002. It spread widely in early 2003 to infect at least 8,098 people in 26 countries, according to the World Health Organization. The disease died out later in 2003, and no cases have been reported since.
 SARS now appears to join a number of other infectious agents that bats can transmit. Over the last decade, bats have been found as the source of two newly discovered human infections caused by the Nipah and Hendra viruses that can produce encephalitis and respiratory disease. In the SARS outbreak, attention focused on the role of Himalayan palm civets in transmitting it after scientists identified the virus in this species and in a raccoon dog sold in markets in Guangdong. But W.H.O. officials and scientists elsewhere cautioned that these species were most likely only intermediaries in the transmission, largely because no widespread infection could be found in wild or farmed civets. So, the teams assembled a variety of specialists, including veterinarians, zoologists, virologists and ecologists.
 Dr. Wang said his group focused on bats largely because of the team members' earlier pioneering work on the Hendra and Nipah viruses. One member, Dr. Jonathan H. Epstein, a veterinary epidemiologist at the Consortium for Conservation Medicine in Manhattan, led the scientists in gathering bats from the wild and market places.
 After obtaining fecal and blood samples, the scientists released the bats into the wild or returned them to the markets. The specimens were tested for a variety of viruses that infect animals.
 Laboratory analysis of the coronaviruses' makeup provided strong genetic evidence of the close relationship between those found in the bats and the SARS virus.
 Although it is logical to assume that the bat viruses infected the animals in the live markets to cause the outbreak, the studies were not planned to prove that point.
 ''The genetic relationships do not tell you anything mechanistically about if or how the virus moved from the bats to civets and from the civets to the humans,'' said Dr. Donald S. Burke, a virologist and professor at Johns Hopkins. ''It's not a perfect story yet. But until I see otherwise, the working assumption will be that this is the reservoir species.''
 Dr. Wang said that ''there is no rule'' to establish proof that a certain species is the reservoir, or hiding place, of a virus, but that scientists make the judgment based on criteria like how widely the infectious agent is distributed in a species, the absence of symptoms among the animals and finding high levels of antibody but low amounts of virus in the animal.
 The Chinese horseshoe bat fits those criteria and the civets do not, Dr. Wang said. The bat feeds on moths and other insects and generally does not bite animals. It was highly unlikely that insects transmitted the SARS viruses to bats, because the viruses do not grow in insect cells in the laboratory, Dr. Wang said.
 Most civets that are sold in China as a delicacy are farmed, Dr. Wang said, and the government should ensure civet farms are distant from bat colonies, monitor farmed civets for SARS-like viruses and allow just noninfected animals to go to market.

HEADLINE: House Votes for New Limits On Endangered Species Act

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
By a vote of 229 to 193, the House of Representatives moved Thursday to undo some of the central provisions of the 32-year-old Endangered Species Act and to require that agencies enforcing the law reimburse property owners if the law's impact reduces the value of their land.
 Environmental groups expressed dismay at the measure, which, if enacted, would represent one of the most far-reaching reversals of environmental policy in more than a decade. Leading House Democrats also said it created an unlimited financial entitlement for landowners.
The prospects for Senate passage are cloudy at best; even the bill's sponsor, Representative Richard W. Pombo of California, the chairman of the House Resources committee, said he did not expect quick action in the Senate. 
 The vote, which came after the defeat of a rival measure that reworked the law but required enforceable protections for animals and plants in danger of extinction, was the culmination of a 12-year legislative mission by Mr. Pombo. The Bush administration gave its formal support to the measure a few hours before the vote.
 A former rancher and City Council member from Tracy, Calif., Mr. Pombo has made property rights and opposition to the Endangered Species Act the lodestar of his political career. ''I'm really happy,'' he said after Thursday's vote.
 Under his bill, the process of putting a species on the federal list of threatened or endangered species would become more difficult, with a new requirement for economic analyses of such decisions.
 But its core provision -- one that was, in some respects, mimicked in the rival bill -- eliminates the current system of designating ''critical habitat,'' territory deemed critical to a species' survival. Such a designation can open the door to significant land-use restrictions. But environmental groups argue that the designation of habitat is a crucial prerequisite to the survival and eventual recovery of an endangered species.
 The Pombo measure would create ''recovery teams'' that prepare ''recovery plans'' based on ''the best available scientific data.'' The teams could delineate lands that would help a species. But as compared with the current system of critical habitat, federal agencies would have less obligation to take a species' needs into account in making land-use decisions. And such teams would not always be required; the law also allows the political leadership of the Interior Department to undertake this function.
 The legislation also has provisions for the reimbursement of property owners whose land values are reduced by the law and financial incentives for those who work for species conservation, which several Democrats derided as federal payments for obeying the law.
 Mr. Pombo argued that under current law, federal wildlife management agencies had little incentive to negotiate.
 ''With this bill, there is a cost,'' he said in an interview on Thursday. ''So the incentive is there not just for the property owner but for the Fish and Wildlife Service to work out a deal.''
 But Jamie Rappoport Clark, the executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife and the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Clinton administration, said the Pombo measure was ''a deadly blow to the protections of the Endangered Species Act.''
 ''This is an irresponsible developer's dream,'' Ms. Clark said, and she noted that the bill ''makes it easier to use deadly pesticides'' of the sort that were implicated in the previous declines of the bald eagle and peregrine falcon. 
 The decline in such species -- a focus of Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring,'' one of the first major tracts of the environmental movement -- has long since been reversed.
 The debate on the House floor between supporters of the Pombo bill and those backing its rival, a measure sponsored by Representatives Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York and chairman of the House Science Committee, and George Miller, Democrat of California, provided competing views of the act's effectiveness.
 Those supporting the rival measure, which gave federal agencies more power to manage land use to benefit species than Mr. Pombo's bill did, argued that species like the bald eagle, the manatee, the sea otter and the grizzly bear were saved from extinction by the act. Those in the Pombo camp argued that barely 1 percent of the more than 1,200 listed species had recovered to the extent that they could be removed from the endangered species list.
 The 1973 law allows federal wildlife agencies to regulate directly only federal lands, but it also requires these agencies to sign off on federal permits -- like Army Corps of Engineers permits for development in wetlands -- that govern private property.
 The act has been a particular lightning rod in California, where farmers, ranchers, developers and advocates for endangered aquatic species, like the fairy shrimp, are in bitter competition over scarce water resources.
 Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the House Resources Committee, said in an interview that the $10 million estimate on the cost of the bill's provisions for compensating property owners would prove to be a significant underestimate.
 ''Who knows how high it will reach?'' Mr. Rahall said.
 Chuck Cushman, founder and director of the American Land Rights Association, a property rights group in Washington State, said in an interview: ''We're excited that they've taken the first step toward updating and modernizing the Endangered Species Act so that for a change it will actually recover species and be less threatening to landowners. It goes a long way to make landowners allies in recovering species.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''Iran Issues a Counterthreat'' (news article, Sept. 28):
Regarding Iran's threat for the first time to retaliate economically against countries that back a resolution calling on the United Nations Security Council to punish Iran for its nuclear enrichment activities, it is clear that the American war in Iraq has emboldened both North Korea and Iran to maintain their nuclear programs.
 They see the United States and its allies bogged down in a costly war, that the American military is struggling to find recruits and that the country is in deep debt. 
 They realize that the United States is too weak to insist that Iran and North Korea end their programs.

HEADLINE: Democrats Attack Radio Host's Remarks on Crime

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
William J. Bennett, the former Republican secretary of education, came under fire from Democratic Congressional leaders on Thursday for comments he made on a radio program about the potential for reducing crime by aborting all black children.
 ''I do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime, you could, if that were your sole purpose, you could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down,'' Mr. Bennett, now a radio talk show host, said in a broadcast earlier this week. ''That would be an impossible, ridiculous, and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down. So these far-out, these far-reaching, extensive extrapolations are, I think, tricky.'' 
 In a radio broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Bennett called the criticism of him ''ridiculous, stupid, totally without merit'' and said his critics had taken his comments out of context.
 ''I was pointing out that abortion should not be opposed for economic reasons, any more than racism or for that matter slavery or segregation should be supported or opposed for economic reasons,'' he said. ''Immoral policies are wrong because they are wrong, not because of an economic calculation. One could just as easily have said you could abort all children and prevent all crime, to show the absurdity of the proposition.''
 Mr. Bennett, who was the secretary of education in the Reagan administration and is the author of a best-selling book on morality, said he was referring to a debate in the online magazine Slate that had discussed race in the context of an argument about whether abortions contributed to lowering the crime rate. That debate, involving Steven D. Levitt, an author of the best-seller ''Freakonomics,'' apparently appeared in Slate six years ago.
 In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, Mr. Bennett charged that his critics had distorted his comments by omitting his assertion that the idea of aborting all black babies was ''morally reprehensible.'' 
 ''When that is included in the quote, it makes it perfectly clear what my position is,'' Mr. Bennett said, ''They make it seem as if I am supporting such a monstrous idea, which I don't.''
 The Democratic Congressional leaders, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, both sought to put the remarks in the context of a Republican effort to court African-American voters who traditionally back Democratic candidates. Mr. Reed said Mr. Bennett's comments would ''feed the fires of racism,'' and Ms. Pelosi called the comments ''shameful words.''

HEADLINE: Guard Clings to a Bronx Redoubt

BYLINE: By SHADI RAHIMI

 BODY:
There came a time when the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx was in such bad shape that the state gave it away.
 The armory, a once-grand Romanesque fortress, had been revered by the National Guard artillery unit that relocated there from Manhattan in 1917, when it was built. By 1994, however, the armory was a cracked and leaking liability, deserted by the Guard for the two more modern annex buildings behind it. The state ceded title to the armory property to the city in 1996. In the years that followed, the building fell into further disrepair. 
Today, the red brick armory, a city landmark that with the annex buildings covers an entire block at 29 West Kingsbridge Road, sits empty. Local groups and elected officials want to move ahead with plans to redevelop the site to house schools and retail space they say are badly needed in the northwest Bronx. First, though, the city must find new headquarters for the two Guard units that still train in the annex buildings. 
 Since last year, the city's Economic Development Corporation has been scouring the five boroughs for a site of 8 to 10 acres, ideally with a building of about 59,000 square feet -- without much luck, according to a spokesman for the agency, Michael Sherman. Complicating the search is that one of the Guard units, the 258th Field Artillery, will stay in the annex, officials from the state's Division of Military and Naval Affairs said, although the other, the 145th Maintenance Company, will move out eventually. Together the Guard units have about 300 soldiers.
 ''We just aren't planning to move,'' a Guard spokesman, Lt. Col. Paul Fanning, said of the 145th. ''How would you like it if somebody came to your house and said, 'We really like your house, and we'd like to move in?''' The two annex buildings, built in 1957, are ''aging out,'' a civilian spokesman for the Guard, Kent Kisselbrack, said, and the 145th Maintenance Company, a 200-member unit that returned from Iraq this month, has outgrown its space. The unit uses the annex to store weapons, train soldiers and house administrative offices, but it must park most of its vehicles at Camp Smith in Peekskill, N.Y., and the Staten Island armory, Mr. Kisselbrack said, and its soldiers often must train at other locations. Meanwhile, city officials are seeking to relocate both units. Mr. Sherman of the economic development agency said that while the military had conveyed its specifications for new headquarters, it had not communicated its desire to keep the 258th Field Artillery in the annex.
 ''Our goal is to relocate all of the National Guard units that are at the site,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''We are looking for a space because our goal is to redevelop the armory and the annex buildings.''
 City officials have been touring unoccupied city-owned sites that meet the military's criteria, Mr. Sherman said. Upon the military's approval of a site, the city will ask the state and federal governments for money to finance relocation of the units, he said. Mr. Sherman said the city had no timetable for completing the project.
 Some community groups and elected officials, including the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., and a Democratic assemblyman, Jose Rivera, have been pushing for redevelopment for more than a decade. Expressing impatience with City Hall, they have embarked on their own searches for a site. Relocating the Guard units to new headquarters in the Bronx is ''the biggest hurdle'' in trying to redevelop the armory site, Mr. Carrion said.
 The push for redevelopment began around 1994, when officials at School District 10 asked that public schools be built on the armory site. Since then, residents and merchants have worked with consultants to draw up proposals, according to Ronn Jordan, president of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition.
 ''We've jumped through every hoop, but the space is still sitting empty,'' Mr. Jordan said.
 The 408,000-square-foot armory building, which water has damaged, is one of the largest in the world. Built with two towers rising high above the metal and glass roof of its 180,000-square-foot drill hall, it is ''an outstanding example of military architecture,'' in the words of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. The armory was designated a landmark in 1974. By early next year, after the November city elections and with ''all our attention turned to the armory,'' Mr. Carrion said, plans for redevelopment should be getting under way.
 ''I know how slow government can be,'' he said. ''We could have done this a long time ago.''
 Attempts to identify a new site for the Guard units in 2000 failed because neither the state nor the city had budgeted funds to proceed with the project, city and military officials said. After a revived push for redevelopment of the armory in 2004, the military and the city renewed talks about a site, Mr. Kisselbrack, the Guard spokesman, said. 
 But there is no telling when a site will be found, he said.
 ''Soldiers are soldiers, they're going to go where their marching orders tell them to go,'' Mr. Kisselbrack said. ''But to put a timeline on it is probably unrealistic.''
 Bronx and military officials said they would prefer that the units remain in the Bronx.
 At the Iraq base of the 145th Maintenance Company , where members repaired vehicles during a six-month deployment, the troops displayed hometown pride by hanging an official Bronx flag with the Latin slogan ''Ne Cede Malis,'' or ''Yield Not to Evil,'' military officials said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about plans to redevelop the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx misidentified the National Guard unit that Lt. Col. Paul Fanning, a Guard spokesman, was referring to when he said, ''We just aren't planning to move.'' As noted elsewhere in the article, it was the 258th Field Artillery, not the other unit housed in the armory, the 145th Maintenance Company. That unit has agreed to relocate.

HEADLINE: Lenovo Evolves With Its I.B.M. PC Unit in Tow

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Lenovo's purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business was unquestionably a bold move and a striking symbol of China's economic globalization. But the challenge facing the combined company is to find a way to prosper in the fiercely competitive PC business, a sector where I.B.M. consistently lost money over the years. 
 Now, five months after the deal closed, the Lenovo and I.B.M. operations are being combined in earnest as the company tries to chart a path to success. With a management realignment, announced today, Lenovo hopes to advance its strategy. 
Crucial elements in the plan, described by Lenovo executives in interviews this week, include a focus on notebook PC's, exploiting the fast-growing markets of China and India, and a move into the American consumer market early next year with Lenovo-branded machines.
 So far, Lenovo has managed to avoid the steep fall in sales that have battered some computer companies after a merger. But the growth pace for Lenovo, the world's third-largest PC maker, has trailed Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Acer, a fast-rising No. 4 in the industry.
 ''Lenovo hasn't demonstrated an ability to get new growth yet,'' said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a research firm.
 Until now, the Lenovo and I.B.M. operations have been run somewhat independently. But the combined company will be led by global teams in areas like product development, sales, the supply chain of procurement, manufacturing and logistics. So the product team, for example, will be responsible for designing notebook and desktop computers sold under the ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and Lenovo brands worldwide.
 Growth prospects may be brightest in China and India. But Lenovo executives say they believe that there are also attractive opportunities in America -- opportunities that went untapped by I.B.M. because of its business culture and strategy.
 I.B.M.'s strength is in catering to large corporations. ''But I.B.M. is not focused on really small companies -- with, say, 50 workers or less -- or on individuals,'' said Stephen M. Ward Jr., Lenovo's chief executive and former head of I.B.M.'s PC business. ''It's not a consumer company.''
 Early next year, Mr. Ward said, the company will begin introducing Lenovo-branded products in the United States. He did not disclose details, but industry analysts say Lenovo products in China or under development that would be strong candidates include a white laptop with a 13.3-inch screen and translucent keys (similar to Apple's iBook), expected to be priced at about $1,000; a desktop machine designed to handle video, music and Internet telephone service; and powerful, colorful notebooks and desktops for gamers.
 Within weeks, Lenovo will introduce ThinkCentre desktops, aggressively priced, with small-business customers in mind. The machines will cost less than $400 without a monitor, but include advanced security and backup features developed by I.B.M., according to analysts who have been shown the desktops in advance.
 The ThinkPad and ThinkCentre brands, Mr. Ward said, will be pitched mainly to business and professionals, while Lenovo will be the global consumer brand with more entertainment and media capabilities. The company has the right to use the I.B.M. logo on products for five years. But market research has shown the Lenovo name is gaining recognition outside China, helped, no doubt, by the 15,000 articles published since the Lenovo-I.B.M. deal was announced last December.
 ''We're on a track to establish the Lenovo brand more quickly than we had anticipated,'' Mr. Ward said. 
 To succeed, the new Lenovo, Mr. Ward said, must combine operational excellence and innovation. The new Z-series ThinkPad notebooks, introduced last week, offer a glimpse of both values, with prices starting at $800, and yet they are wide-screen models loaded with features that have been praised by reviewers.
 After a merger announcement, computer makers often see a decline in sales as customers hold off orders until the strategy of the combined company is clear. Lenovo, analysts say, has done a solid job of navigating the postmerger uncertainty. 
 Growth in shipments of the merged company slipped to 6.9 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with growth of about 15 percent in the second half of 2004, combining sales of both companies, according to IDC, a research firm. 
 But Lenovo's growth rate picked up slightly, to 8.2 percent, in the second quarter of 2005, the most recent quarterly statistics.
 By contrast, the combined PC sales of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq fell immediately after the companies merged, and so did the sales of Gateway and E-Machines after they merged, Loren Loverde, an analyst at IDC, noted.
 The new management team at Lenovo seems to relish the challenge, and they see mostly opportunity. The company has also been able to attract senior executives eager to join the hybrid multinational. 
 Steven J. Bandrowczak started this week as chief information officer, coming from DHL Express. Wu Yibing, the chief strategy officer, came from McKinsey & Company. Steve V. Petracca, vice president for business development, had been the chief executive of BuilderDepot.com, an Internet store for home improvement supplies. Kevin Burns, the chief integration officer, came from Texas Pacific Group, one of three private equity firms that invested $350 million in Lenovo last spring. Deepak Advani, chief marketing officer, used to be the country manager for I.B.M. in India.
 William Matson, the senior vice president for human resources, joined from I.B.M., though from the company's big services group. Lenovo, according to Mr. Matson, may well be a leading example of a new breed of truly global companies, with talent plucked from around the world and senior managers often living in different countries. 
 The model, he said, is very different from the traditional multinational that becomes powerful in its home market and then ventures out to set up colonial-style outposts around the world.
 ''Lenovo will be written about as a Harvard Business School case,'' Mr. Matson said, ''and studied in business schools everywhere, whether we are successful or not.''
 Inside Lenovo, it seems, the learning is well under way. ''Thinking globally is new for all of us in the former Lenovo operation,'' said Liu Jun, the chief operating officer. ''That's exciting, all the new possibilities.''

HEADLINE: Will Bubbles Spoil Fed's Reputation? 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
MAYBE they should call him J. Edgar Greenspan. Not since J. Edgar Hoover approached the supposed mandatory retirement age as director of the F.B.I. has an American official seemed to be as indispensable as Alan Greenspan, whose tenure as Federal Reserve chairman must end early next year.
 Hoover managed to persuade two presidents to waive the rule, and he died in the job. If Mr. Greenspan wanted to do so, he too might be able to get the rules changed. 
But he evidently has no intention of doing so, and in his final months on the job he is dealing with the only realistic threat to his reputation: that he failed to deal with the stock market bubble of the late 1990's and, perhaps, with a current housing bubble.
 Edward Yardeni, an economist and chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, is one who thinks that Mr. Greenspan has failed to act responsibly. As he wrote this spring: ''The Fed chairman cleaned up the mess caused by the bursting of the tech and telecom bubble by creating another bubble. This time it is in real estate finance. He refused to raise stock margin requirements to stop the previous bubble. Now he has failed to stop the alarming deterioration of mortgage lending standards to stop the housing bubble.''
 Mr. Greenspan answered such criticism this week. ''Relying on policy makers to perceive when speculative asset bubbles have developed and then to implement timely policies to address successfully these misalignments in asset prices is simply not realistic,'' he said, adding that ''we at the Fed were uncomfortable with a stock market that appeared as early as 1996 to disconnect from its moorings.''
 Transcripts of Fed meetings do show that, but they also show that by the time the bubble really started to expand, the talk of stocks in Fed meetings dealt mostly with how much impact the rising stock market was having on consumption. 
 WHEN the Fed met on Nov. 16, 1999, the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was hitting records every day and was up 35 percent over the previous six months, but Mr. Greenspan did not call attention to that index. Perhaps thinking of the Dow Jones industrial average, he pointed to ''the fact the stock market is unchanged over the past six months'' as evidence that the Fed's rate increases were starting to have some impact on the economy.
 A month later, Mr. Greenspan allowed that some arguments for still higher Internet stock prices were nonsense, but he seemed sanguine. What was ''really quite unprecedented,'' he said, was ''that productivity growth continues to rise.'' 
 Now Mr. Greenspan is worried about housing speculation. He warned bankers this week that borrowers using the more exotic mortgages -- and the banks that made the loans -- ''could be exposed to significant losses'' if home prices fell. He is frustrated that 30-year mortgage rates are now lower than they were when the Fed began to raise short-term rates 15 months ago.
 The ''greatest irony of economic policy making,'' Mr. Greenspan said, is that successful monetary policy over a long period can lead people to think that there is less risk than there really is.
 That is a good argument, but if the American economy were to have significant problems dealing with the aftermath of a housing bubble, then future historians may conclude that Mr. Yardeni was right to say, as he did this week, that the Fed failed to live up to a responsibility to deal with bubbles as they expanded. 
 ''Bubbles,'' Mr. Yardeni said, ''are always created by easy money. That is all there is to it, and it is something that the Fed chairman has never addressed.''

HEADLINE: Officials Fear Chaos if Iraqis Vote Down the Constitution

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and THOM SHANKER; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 

 BODY:
Senior American officials say they are confident that Iraq's draft constitution will be approved in the referendum to be held Oct. 15, even though Sunni Arabs in Iraq are mobilizing in large numbers to defeat it.
 In testimony before Congress on Thursday, the senior American military commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr. of the Army, said the most recent analysis of intelligence from across the country supported the Bush administration's optimistic predictions that the referendum would pass.
But if the constitution is defeated, several officials said they feared that Iraq would descend into anarchy. 
 Approval ''is critically important,'' a senior administration official said, ''to maintain political momentum. That is the critical thing for holding this whole thing together.''
 Private organizations in Iraq, many working with government financing, say their own analyses, based on discussions with hundreds of Iraqis, polling data and other information, have also led many of them to believe that the constitution would be approved. 
 Their calculations are complicated, because by law the constitution will fail if it is rejected by two-thirds of the voters in any three of Iraq's 18 provinces, even if a majority of voters nationwide approve it. 
 In regions dominated by Sunni Arabs, opinion polls have shown sentiment running just about two to one against it. It is unclear, in those provinces, how get-out-the-vote campaigns by the opposing factions may tilt the balance, or how much the turnout on either side may be suppressed by the continuing violence.
 But no matter how the vote goes, several officials said in interviews, the violence in Iraq is likely to increase significantly.
 That prediction stands in contrast to the upbeat previous assessments from President Bush and others in his administration before other major turning points in Iraq, like the transition to Iraqi sovereignty in 2004 or the national elections early this year. The administration argued that insurgents would be demoralized by the success of democracy and that violence would decline. 
 Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, asked General Casey in a pointed exchange during the hearing on Thursday, ''If there's a strong majority of Sunnis, which is very possible, that vote against that constitution, could that not possibly lead to a worsening political situation rather than a better one?''
 ''I think that's entirely possible,'' the general replied. ''I mean, as we've looked at this, we've looked for the constitution to be a national compact, and the perception now is that it's not, particularly among the Sunnis.''
 Officials say that if the constitution is defeated, insurgents will most likely believe that they have won a significant victory and be encouraged to fight on. Conversely, it is said, the insurgency will grow stronger if the voters approve the constitution, because that will anger Sunnis who opposed it and empower Sunni insurgents who can claim that their views were ignored. 
 ''A vote for the constitution doesn't mean we're headed for peace and prosperity,'' Gen. John P. Abizaid, head of the Central Command, said in an interview this month. ''Iraq is going to be a pretty difficult security environment for a while.''
 A senior official said the Bush administration believed that the insurgency was likely to continue for years and would start to decline only ''when Iraq's political and economic system begins to consolidate.'' The administration officials agreed to talk only if their names were not used, under administration policy for their departments.
 Sunni Arabs, who held power when Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq, boycotted the election in January. But now, American officials and officers of private organizations working in Iraq say Sunnis are registering to vote in record numbers that exceed 80 percent in many areas. 
 ''There's a massive, massive effort, in mosques and other places, to get them to register,'' the Iraq country director for the National Democratic Institute, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. He asked that his name not be used, because of security concerns. The institute is an organization financed by the United States government that works to promote democracy abroad.
 Many Sunni Arabs are upset that the draft constitution grants Kurds and Shiite Arabs significant new authority to set up semi-independent areas but offers little specifically for them. 
 Still, the country director and others say they do not believe that the Sunni vote is likely to be monolithic. Many Sunni moderates, they say, are likely to vote in favor of the constitution and hope to influence how it is put into effect. The constitution seems likely to be approved by substantial majorities in the heavily Kurdish north and the predominantly Shiite south. In ethnically mixed Baghdad, the situation is more fluid.
 Senior Pentagon and military officials who have been closely monitoring reports from Iraq predict that the referendum will fail by the two-thirds majority in the Sunni-dominated -- and violence-plagued -- Anbar Province in western Iraq. But intelligence reports indicate that only one other province at most will vote no by two-thirds.
 ''Nobody will be surprised to lose Anbar, and maybe one other province,'' one Pentagon official said. ''We're not going to lose three.''
 American political and military officials say a large Sunni vote will be a sign that democracy is taking hold in Iraq. Still, the United States is working hard to be sure that the Sunni opponents will not prevail. Among many steps, State Department officials said, Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador to Iraq, is meeting with Sunni Arab leaders almost every day, trying to persuade them to vote yes.
