Business Aid For Districts In 5 Boroughs

BYLINE: By Richard D. Lyons

 BODY:
EIGHTEEN New York City neighborhoods have formed Business Improvement Districts, in which assessments paid by commercial properties and businesses support a variety of services and programs. Ten such districts, called BID's, are being developed and 18 others in all five boroughs are considering forming such local civic groups.
This year the existing districts have raised more than $10 million to support street sweeping and security services, beyond those provided by the Sanitation and Police Departments, as well as other programs. The amounts collected and the programs are increasing in volume and sophistication. 
From midtown Manhattan north to Washington Heights and east to Jamaica, Queens, and Flatbush in Brooklyn, BID's are raising funds from their assessments and from government and private grants. In the Grand Central BID in Manhattan, for example, $8 million raised by local assessments is being spent to restore the viaduct that carries Park Avenue traffic around Grand Central Terminal.
In this district, the agreed-upon annual assessment is 10 cents a square foot on commercial properties. The district is also developing programs to help the homeless in the area.
''BID's are incredibly positive neighborhood programs and the proliferation of their number in the last several years demonstrates their proven value,'' said Commissioner Gary Kesner, who heads the city's Office of Business Development. The agency assists in the creation of BID's. Mr. Kesner noted that since legislation allowing them was passed in 1982, their number and influence have grown steadily.
One embryo BID embraces the Metrotech area in downtown Brooklyn, where three large colleges and commuter and communications companies are seeking to broaden the concept.
''We are looking forward to the time when the Metrotech BID will play a major role in offering day care to workers in our area, as well as programs that would help train people to both operate and maintain such equipment as word processors and computers,'' said Bob Ohlerking, the acting director of the Metrotech BID.
One company involved in Metrotech is the Securities Industries Automation Corporation, which is to provide computer services for the New York and American Stock Exchanges and employ 800 workers when its 500,000-square-foot building at Myrtle Avenue and Lawrence Street opens about a year from now.
Mr. Ohlerking also noted that Nynex has two large buildings within the Metrotech BID boundaries, at 360 Bridge Street and 101 Willoughby Street, that are scheduled to be used to train 40,000 management and technical workers a year in the 1990's.
In addition, it is hoped that the Metrotech BID will provide extra street and sidewalk cleaning, put up holiday lighting and other seasonal promotions, and provide assistance to merchants on signs and window displays.
Mr. Ohlerking said he expected that the budget of the Metrotech BID would be about $2.2 million in its first full year, which might be as early as 1991. It takes an average of three years to create a BID, according to officials of the city's Office of Economic Development.
Jack Rainey, the city official in charge of fostering the BID's, noted that under local law a plan for a BID requires about a year to educate merchants and property owners on the value of the concept and how the assessments would be used. Legally, 51 percent of the property owners and merchants in a proposed BID must agree to join before the district can be established. In practice, however, the founders seek 90 percent agreement.
Once the BID is created, the assessments take on the legal force of taxes on all property owners and businesses in the area. The assessments are based either on the value of commercial buildings or on the business generated by their tenants. Yearly assessments average $350.
The next step is at least a year of approval processes, during which public hearings are held and the proposal is reviewed by the City Planning Commission, the Board of Estimate, the State Comptroller and the City Council. Then it takes about a year to carry out the plan agreed upon by the property owners, often with a small amount of start-up funds from the city.
Mr. Rainey said that at times there had been local opposition to the creation of a BID, in some cases by residents who believed erroneously that such municipal services as street cleaning would be reduced if an improvement district was created.
''What we're trying to do is supplement services, not reduce them,'' Mr. Rainey said. He added that in the 1960's and 70's there had been a decline in interest in community improvement almost citywide, in part because of changes in neighborhood social patterns, and that this had undermined local interest in improvements. But with a resurgence of such interest, support for BID's has grown.

HEADLINE: A MAN OF INFLUENCE: POLITICAL CASH AND REGULATION - A SPECIAL REPORT;
In Savings Debacle, Many Fingers Point Here

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH with PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
To his critics, Charles H. Keating Jr., the Phoenix financier who built and lost the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, represents all that is wrong with a political system in which wealth grants access and influence. To his defenders, Mr. Keating is simply a hard-driving entrepreneur who is being made the fall guy for the savings industry's plight.
But there is no dispute that Mr. Keating has become the central figure in the savings and loan crisis, a breakdown stemming from lax regulation and speculative excess. The Federal bailout of the industry will cost taxpayers more than $100 billion over the next decade, and Lincoln's collapse alone will cost at least $2 billion.
Mr. Keating has never minced words about buying political influence in defense of his financial interests. 
''One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause,'' he told reporters in April after Federal regulators had taken over Lincoln, with its $6 billion in insured deposits, almost $4 billion of which went to speculative investments in real estate and high-risk ''junk bonds.''
''I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''
Mr. Keating, who is scheduled to appear before the House Banking Committee soon to discuss the Lincoln failure, stands accused of fraud and making illegal loans. And members of Congress, many of whom have been the recipients of his largess, are left deeply embarrassed.
For his part, Mr. Keating protests his innocence, denying any wrongdoing, saying that if you do not have money your chances of being heard are greatly reduced. Influence is the way the political system works, he says, and he intends to use it. If regulators had permitted him to keep running Lincoln, he argues, he could have earned his way out of the hole.
By all accounts, he was a frenetic and effective advocate for his business interests - here distributing campaign funds, there offering a former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board a job or pushing the Reagan Adminsistration to appoint one of his business associates to the bank board. Mr. Keating was for years almost ubiquitous in Washington and at the state and local level.
Regulators maintain that the contributions came almost entirely from the federally insured deposits of Lincoln Savings; they have accused him of looting Lincoln for his own personal gain, and have referred the case to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are also conducting inquiries.
 
Driving Up Cost of Crisis
And though in the end the intervention by five Senators to whom Mr. Keating had contributed $1.3 million did not halt the Government takeover of Lincoln Savings on the morning of April 14, his contributions were successful in delaying the process almost two years, driving up the ultimate cost of the failure.
Friends and employees call the 66-year-old Mr. Keating shy, moral and devout. Many in Phoenix, where he still runs the lavish Phoenician Hotel, remain faithful.
In a surprisingly candid statement, Mr. Keating said he found out in early April that regulators were going to move in and commandeer Lincoln. In an effort to shield as many of Lincoln's assets as possible from the Government, he put the American Continental Company, Lincoln's parent company, and almost a dozen Lincoln subsidiaries into bankruptcy, protected from regulators.
But the crisis at Lincoln and his ongoing battle with regulators has beaten him down, he said.
''It's ruined me and my family,'' he said last summer. The regulators ''have taken everything that I have, my family has.'' He added: ''If Lincoln and American go down, there is nothing left for me. I have every nickel I have tied up in this thing.''
 
Cincinnati Beginnings
 
Making His Mark In Nixon Years
A thin 6-foot 5-inch former Olympic swimmer, Mr. Keating has his roots in a prominent Cincinnati family.
A lawyer by training, and with good Republican connections, Mr. Keating came to national attention in September 1970, when as President Richard Nixon's sole appointee to the Federal Commission on Obscenity and Pornography he successfully sued to delay publication of its report.
Later, Mr. Keating was one founder of Citizens for Decency Through Law; he continues to contribute heavily to antipornography groups.
It was also in the 1970's that Mr. Keating became right-hand man to Carl H. Lindner, the Cincinnati takeover artist. As Mr. Lindner was amassing vast holdings, Mr. Keating rose to become executive vice president of Mr. Lindner's American Financial Corporation.
 
Run-In With Regulators
It was at American Financial that Mr. Keating had his first major run-in with regulators. In 1979, after a three-year investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Lindner and Mr. Keating with using company funds for their personal benefit, including making large preferential loans to Mr. Keating's family and others.
Both men, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to a consent order not to violate securities laws.
They had already parted ways. By that time, Mr. Keating had bought Mr. Lindner's struggling real estate development company in Phoenix for $300,000, which became the basis for American Continental.
 
Getting Into the Big Time
 
From Real Estate To Savings
As American Continental was becoming a major real estate developer, Mr. Keating began seeking to buy a saving and loan association.
With Federal regulations rolled back, states loosened their regimes even more, and in California a savings and loan owner could take all insured deposits and channel them into investments far riskier than home mortgages.
In 1984, Mr. Keating bought Lincoln Savings for $51 million and began using Lincoln deposits to buy junk bonds to finance the development projects of American Continental, one of which was the $250 million Phoenician resort.
''We looked around and saw that California had deregulated the S.&L. industry in a way we felt was the salvation of the industry, so we bought Lincoln,'' Mr. Keating said.
 
Problems With Gray
But almost immediately Mr. Keating ran into problems with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who had begun a big push to limit the direct investments by the savings industry in real estate projects to only 10 percent of an institution's assets, arguing that a rash of such investments had left scores of institutions insolvent.
Mr. Keating went into high gear, hiring, among others, Alan Greenspan, then a private economist and now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to do a study that concluded that direct investments were not jeopardizing industry stability.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan wrote the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco in February 1985, supporting an application by Mr. Keating for an exemption for Lincoln to the 10 percent rule.
 
A Growing Conflict
But an exemption for Lincoln was never granted, and the Gray-Keating conflict grew. In late 1986, Mr. Keating said, he became aware of an opening on the bank board, and proposed a business associate, Lee Henkel Jr., a former chief counsel at the Internal Revenue Service, for a seat on the board, to counteract Mr. Gray. Federal regulators say that with the help of Donald T. Regan, then White House chief of staff, Mr. Henkel got the seat.
But Mr. Henkel's tenure was short. Soon after arriving, Mr. Henkel proposed a regulation that would have granted Lincoln relief on its direct investments. When Mr. Henkel's business dealings with Mr. Keating surfaced, the Justice Department began an inquiry, and he resigned. Mr. Henkel was later cleared of wrongdoing.
Mr. Keating tried other avenues to neutralize Mr. Gray.
''We heard Gray had announced his intention to resign,'' Mr. Keating said, adding that a friend called him and said, ''Why don't you talk to him.''
Over a lunch with Sharon Fairbanks, Mr. Gray's assistant, Mr. Keating told her, he said, that if Mr. Gray ''wanted to come on board, we would at least talk to him about it.'' According to some reports, Mr. Keating would have offered Mr. Gray $300,000 a year.
Mr. Gray rejected Mr. Keating's overtures.
 
Stepping Up Contributions
 
Large Sums Given To Key Politicians
With Mr. Gray apparently at the bank board to stay, Mr. Keating began to step up his contributions to those he considered key members of Congress.
Regulators note that to get around individual contribution limits, Mr. Keating would pay high salaries to his employees and either directly or indirectly instruct them to contribute to certain campaigns; Keating family members would also make contributions.
Deborah Karbo, a former vice president at American Continental, disputed this suggestion. ''There was no pressure,'' she said.
Large sums obviously went to Arizona politicians - $112,000 to John McCain, the state's Republican senator, and $55,000 to Dennis DeConcini, his Democratic colleague. Three Republican House members from the state also benefited handsomely -Jim Kolbe getting $14,000, Jon Kyl $24,900 and John J. Rhodes Jr. $9,000.
He also contributed to other key members of the House and Senate Banking Committees - $10,000 to Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat from Colorado; $76,000 to Donald W. Riegle, Democrat from Michigan; $41,000 to former Senator Chic Hecht, Republican from Nevada, and $20,000 to Representative Douglas Barnard, Democrat of Georgia.
 
Liberal Causes, Too
In defense of his financial interests, Mr. Keating cast a blind eye politically. Not only did he contribute to the re-election campaign of Senator Alan Cranston, the liberal California Democrat, but in 1987 and 1988 Mr. Keating and associates gave $850,000 to three political organizations championed by Mr. Cranston that were aimed at registering minority voters in California. Mr. Cranston, running in a tough race for re-election, was next in line to head the Senate Banking Committee.
In 1987, the five senators, who received a total of $1.3 million, arranged and attended two meetings -one with Mr. Gray - in which they leaned on the bank board to give Mr. Keating a break.
In early 1987, Mr. Keating sued both the bank board and Mr. Gray, alleging intentional leaking of confidential Lincoln documents.
 
Home Base in Phoenix
 
'Commitment To Decency'
In Phoenix, where he has created the lavish Phoenician Hotel to his own design, Mr. Keating has a strong base of support.
The 130-acre resort, with a spectacular view over the Valley of the Sun, has 605 rooms, including two 4,000-square-foot presidential suites, an 18-hole golf course, seven swimming pools, two croquet lawns, a 165-foot water slide for children and a cabana pool lined with mother-of-pearl tile.
Mr. Keating is often seen around the resort, welcoming guests, chatting with the staff, many of whom are local college students, and stopping in at afternoon tea.
''He is one of the great men of the 20th century,'' said Benjamin W. Bull, a corporate counsel of American Continental. Mr. Bull said he has long been associated with Mr. Keating through Citizens for Decency. Mr. Keating's anti-pornography campaign, Mr. Bull said, ''has to do with his deep spiritual commitment to decency - which I realize is contrary to the popular notion that he's something just short of Attila the Hun.''
Mary Jo Colucci, one of Mr. Keating's personal secretaries until she resigned earlier this year, said Mr. Keating often arrived at the office by 3 A.M., at times leaving for a 6 A.M. mass.
She recalled traveling with him through some of the poorest parts of Mexico. ''He would occasionally stop his Jeep and walk out to the people, these poor people, and hand them money,'' she said. ''I think he handed one lady a $100 bill.''
James J. Feder, a Los Angeles lawyer for American Continental in recent months who is dealing with its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, argued that Mr. Keating was being treated unfairly by regulators with a ''vendetta'' who intended ''to bury'' him.
Mr. Feder disputed regulators' assertions that $34 million in salaries, bonuses and proceeds from stock sales went to the Keating family, saying that compensation levels were not excessive.
But not everyone in Arizona is a Keating booster.
Edward Korrick, a city councilman in Phoenix until his resignation last year, calls him ''amoral.'' Mr. Keating, he said, started handing out money to local politicians almost as soon as he arrived in Phoenix, back in the 70's, and by 1983 was providing city council candidates with more than $100,000 in donations.
''We'd never experienced anything like that before,'' Mr. Korrick said.

HEADLINE: How France Is Providing Child Care To a Nation

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

 BODY:
AS the debate on how to meet the growing need for child care intensifies in Congress, corporate headquarters and communities across the nation, a panel of experts says the United States should look to France for ideas.
''Coming from a country mired in turmoil over child care, it was striking to see in France a shared consensus about the importance of children and the willingness to put the necessary financial resources behind it,'' said Faith Wohl, director of work and family programs for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
Ms. Wohl was a member of a delegation that spent two weeks in France this year studying that country's extensive child-care system. Sponsored by the French-American Foundation, which promotes understanding of issues of common concern to the two countries, the group was made up of 14 professionals in economics, medicine, business, education, labor, law and other diverse fields.
The delegation is to issue a report today on its findings, which are to be distributed to members of Congress, governors, business and union leaders and child-care experts. It concludes that France is ''a country at a level of economic development similar to that of the United States, but far ahead of us in insuring that its young children are well and safely cared for.'' 
The report describes a system largely financed by tax revenue: a blend of child care, education and health services based on free full-day preschool programs, subsidized day-care centers and licensed care in private homes for infants and toddlers. The noncompulsory preschool programs, which serve nearly 90 percent of French children 3 to 5 years old, offer language arts, exercise, crafts and play.
The report says the system also features intensive training and fair compensation for preschool teachers and others who take care of younger children, a free preventive health program for all young children, and attention to the architecture and safety of day-care centers.
''It all adds up to a systematic approach to young children,'' said Hillary Rodham Clinton, a delegation member who is a lawyer and chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group. ''The problem in the United States is that we have no approach.''
Despite their enthusiasm for what they saw, delegation members said the system in France was not without flaws. They expressed misgivings about the ratio of preschool teachers and child-care workers to children, and the Government's firm, centralized control of the system. They also said France has a shortage of infant-toddler care, although the problem is much less acute than in the United States.
The report acknowledges that differences between the nations ''rule out simplistic imitation'' of the French child-care system.
It also points out that a comprehensive child-care system does not develop overnight. The French system has roots that go back 175 years, to shelters that were created for children of the working poor.
Nearly 80 percent of the cost of French child-care services are covered by public funds. Parents provide the rest. The French manage to finance their child-care system ''because of their priorities and political leadership,'' said Barbara R. Bergmann, a panel member who is Distinguished Professor of Economics at American University in Washington.
The report says the French spend 49 percent of their per-capita income in taxes, compared with 31 percent in the United States. France spends the equivalent of 7.1 percent of its gross national product on public education, including preschool programs, compared with 5.5 percent for the United States.
Delegation members said they found in France that child care was not a subject for political debate, as it is in the United States.
''I was surprised that the commitment to child care has support across the political spectrum,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The observers also found that unlike child-care services in United States, those in France are intended for children in all strata of society. ''We tend to target programs for poor children, for children at risk,'' said Barbara Reisman, another panel member who is also executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign, a national advocacy organization based in New York City.
Members of the panel said they were particularly struck by the quality of workers who teach or care for young children. ''In France,'' their report says, ''staff training and experience are considered the foundation of quality care.''
French preschool teachers are required to have the equivalent of a master's degree in early-childhood education. The directors of infant-toddler programs are pediatric nurses or midwives who have additional training in public health and child development. Staff members must have a degree equivalent to two years of college in the United States and two additional years of training in early childhood education and child development. The salaries are competitive with those for other jobs in France requiring similar credentials, like elementary-school teachers or nurses.
The report concludes that the level of staff training and compensation has enabled France to create a stable child-care system. It says that in the United States, by contrast, ''trained caregivers are in short supply and their wages are low,'' and that ''child-care centers lose, and must replace, 40 percent of their staff each year.''
One member of the delegation, David Edie, said that while he was impressed by the ''comprehensive'' nature of the French system, he objected to its centralized control by the Government. ''I did not like the lack of parental involvement, the sense that the professionals know how to do everything and parents should stay out of it,'' said Mr. Edie, day-care coordinator for the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services.
There was also criticism of the ratio of preschool teachers and child-care workers to children. Each preschool teacher is assigned an average of 22 students. In infant-toddler centers, each worker tends to eight toddlers or five infants.
''We feel in the United States that children need more adults,'' said Bettye Caldwell, Distinguished Professor of Education at the University of Arkansas, who served on the panel. ''But the children we saw were happy and engaged. The French have a trade-off between these ratios and the high level of staff training.''
One problem France shares with the United States is a shortage of child care for infants and toddlers now that more mothers are entering the work force. ''But they have a plan to fix it,'' Ms. Wohl of the panel said.
In Paris, new infant-toddler centers are being opened at the rate of two a month, and the French Government is giving municipalities money to expand the availability of centers and family day care.
France also has a widespread system of adults who care for infants and toddlers in their homes. The report says that about 75 percent of these family day-care providers are licensed, compared with 10 percent in the United States. France also offers incentives for providers to become licensed; these include retirement benefits, disability insurance and a minimum wage.
Parents pay for care at infant-toddler centers on a sliding scale, depending on income and where they live. In Paris, parents typically pay annual fees ranging from $1,750 to $4,000 per child, or about 14 percent of their annual income. The poorest families pay $195.
Licensed family day care costs parents from $11 to $18 a day per child. Parents receive a special tax deduction for using licensed rather than unlicensed family day care.
To meet the needs of working parents, preschool programs offer additional care before and after school and during vacations. While most of the schools are free, parents pay $210 a year for these special services.
The delegation visited programs in Paris, and in Nantes and St. Herblain, in Brittany. The group also met with Government officials, business leaders, doctors, nurses and parents.
''We have seen the future,'' Mr. Edie said, ''and we're behind.''

From a Life of Privilege, a Woman of Substance

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
Daughter of one of the Philippines' most respected men and the sister of another, Leticia Ramos Shahani has had a privileged life. It has also been one of extraordinary accomplishment and self-discovery.
Currently chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mrs. Shahani freely admits that she has been a beneficiary of the clannish, male-dominated and semi-feudal society that the Philippines remains. But in both her personal life and her career, she has made significant efforts to break out of traditional patterns of insularity to become one of the country's most cosmopolitan voices, one of an influential group of respected women politicians.
In the process, she has become a model for some women, with a set of credentials that owe little to her late husband, an Indian writer and professor who died suddenly 20 years ago, leaving her three small children to raise. 
 
Adopting a Major Role
Now, in her Senate position, she will play a substantial role in the heated debate about the renewal of a military bases treaty with the United States, an accord that requires ratification in the Senate, where 12 of 23 Senators have already declared their opposition.
Mrs. Shahani, 60 years old, was born to an elite household. Her father, Narcisco Ramos, served in the first congress after independence in 1946 and became Foreign Minister before the rise of Ferdinand E. Marcos, Mrs. Shahani's second cousin. Her brother, Fidel V. Ramos, made his way through the military and is now Defense Minister under President Corazon C. Aquino, whom it is said he would like to succeed.
Mrs. Shahani was sent to Wellesley College, where she majored in English; she went on to earn a master's in comparative literature from Columbia University in 1954 and a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 1961.
It was not until then that she agreed to marry Ranjee Shahani, an Indian with whom she had fallen in love 10 years before. Women who want to establish themselves, she says, are probably best advised to delay marriage.
She returned home to teach and wrote a book about the Philippines, then joined the foreign service, serving with the Philippine Mission to the United Nations. She then joined the United Nations Secretariat, focusing on women's issues, which at the time, she said, were ''a big joke'' among male colleagues.
In time, she headed the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, before being named in 1975 as her country's first ambassador to a Communist country, and also, as it happened, the first woman Rumania had received as ambassador.
''They didn't know what to make of me,'' she said. After three rather lonely years - ''I couldn't make friends with Rumanians, so as not to harm them'' - she was named Ambassador to a rather more carefree nation, Australia.
It was there, she said, that she ''started to see signs of Marcos's desire to muzzle everything and everyone,'' preventing any open criticism of his Government while lining his own pockets and those of his cronies. #1985 Conference on Women In 1981 she returned to the United Nations, to become Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs, based in Vienna. In 1985, she ran a world conference in Nairobi to evaluate the United Nations Decade for Women.
''But I was becoming very concerned about matters back home,'' she said. And she was becoming disillusioned. ''At the U.N., despite all the talk about 'one world' and 'the global village,' unless your own country is strong and has developed its own stance, it doesn't have much say in international affairs.''
She talked of returning to run for Mayor of her hometown in Pangasinan Province, a Marcos stronghold. ''I thought there should be some corner of democracy, and that even if Marcos cheated, I would probably win,'' she said.
But events moved quickly, with Mr. Marcos calling an early presidential election. Visiting the YWCA in her hometown, she was asked whether she favored Mr. Marcos or Mrs. Aquino. ''I said rather casually: 'Well, I'm for change. I'm for Cory.'
''It turned out I was the first high-ranking Filipino official to come out for her, and it was quite stunning, and I didn't, honestly speaking, realize the drama it would create,'' she recalled. ''It spread like wildfire, because that is really Marcos country. I got word from him, my second cousin - What was I doing? - and he tried unsuccessfully to suppress it.''
Mrs. Shahani returned to Vienna. A week after the military-led popular uprising that followed the presidential elections in February 1986, Mrs. Aquino, now President, asked Mrs. Shahani to return to Manila as deputy to the new Foreign Minister, Vice President Salvador H. Laurel. Mr. Laurel has long since broken with Mrs. Aquino and is now a leader of the opposition.
After the passage of a a new Constitution in 1987, Mrs. Shahani said, ''I felt I should take a crack at politics. Maybe that would give me a better base.''
With Mrs. Aquino then at the height of her popularity, Mrs. Shahani secured a senatorial slot on the President's slate, one of two women.
The arena of politics, she says, was yet another revelation. Campaigns require a sort of theatricality she found distressing, but also, despite herself, rather fun.
''As a diplomat, you develop certain reflexes. You learn to be proper and sober and show no emotion, and of course that's fatal for a politician.''
It seemed she did not smile enough. ''I'd say to them that I was grinning from ear to ear, but they'd say, 'You must smile all the time, it's expected of you.' And I'd look at the others, and it was true. They have a permanent smile. They all do.''
She was also told she needed a jingle for television and radio, and that her Indian name would be a disadvantage. So to the tune of a cha-cha-cha, she was plumped as ''Sha-Sha-Sha,'' and the jingle became popular.
''I think it was one of the main reasons I won. It wasn't my program! It's one of the reasons Imelda Marcos did so well for so long: she would smile and sing. So I discovered politics as theater. It was very humbling.''
 
Seizing the Middle Ground
Mrs. Shahani has proved in politics, too, to be a quick learner. She has distinguished herself in the Senate, and has worked to balance her support for Mrs. Aquino with criticism of governmental inefficiency, corruption and lack of planning.
But her critics say that in the flamboyant atmosphere of Filipino politics, Mrs. Shahani seems too cerebral and cautious, following too closely the professionals in the foreign service.
Mrs. Shahani has tried to argue a middle ground on the issue of the American military bases here, saying that Filipino sovereignty and maturity require their removal, but not before a carefully planned handover to reduce security risks and economic disruption.
She has also been outspoken on the need for an effective program of population control, an unpopular position in this largely Catholic country. Without one, Mrs. Shahani says, all the gains made in the economy and against the Communist insurgency will come to nothing.
''The policy is there, but the capacity to deliver to the people isn't,'' she said. ''Part of the task of leadership is to lead.''

HEADLINE: 2 Superpowers Failing in Geography

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
People in the Soviet Union and the United States know there is a world out there that the superpowers want to influence. They just can't place it.
The first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the Soviet Union, made public today by the National Geographic Society, shows that Americans and Soviet citizens share ''an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them,'' the organization said.
Soviet adults scored slightly lower than Americans, who took an identical survey last year, in being able to identify the locations of other nations of the world, an unexpected result that a Soviet pollster termed ''a shock'' for a nation that prides itself on education. 
''The results are unbelieveable,'' said Vladimir G. Andreyenkov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which conducted the survey with the Gallup Organization. ''They will have very great repercussions in the Soviet Union.''
 
Younger Russians Do Better
A bright spot for the Soviet Union is that younger people, between ages 18 and 24, did significantly better than their American counterparts. Young Americans scored in last place for geographical knowledge among the 10 nations where the test was given.
The young Soviet citizens correctly identified an average of 9.3 of 16 locations on a world map, ranking fourth along with Canadians and Italians. Young Americans came in last, with an average of 6.9 correct selections.
Soviet citizens in general identified an average of 7.4 of a possible 16 locations, which put them at the bottom, tied with Mexico. American adults ranked sixth among the 10 nations, with 8.6 correct.
The overall scores were Sweden, 11.6; West Germany, 11.2; Japan, 9.7; France, 9.3; Canada, 9.2; United States, 8.6; Britain, 8.5; Italy, 7.6; Mexico, 7.4, and the Soviet Union, 7.4.
Thirteen percent of the Soviet citizens could not find their own country on a map, and 14 percent of the Americans could not find the United States.
 
'Mostly Discouraging'
Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society, said at a news conference that the surveys showed that people in the United States and the Soviet Union ''have little understanding of the world around them.''
''We have learned a lot from this process, mostly discouraging,'' Mr. Grosvenor said. ''In today's world, if you don't know where you are, you are nowhere.''
An indication of the depth of geographical ignorance, he said, was that only 38 percent of Russians surveyed could find Afghanistan on a map, even though it borders the Soviet Union to the south and Soviet soldiers fought Afghan rebels for nearly a decade before pulling out this year. The Afghan question was added to the Soviet survey but not included in the previous one.
Just as surprising, the survey said, was that only 32 percent of Americans could find Vietnam on a map.
Almost 11,000 people in nine nations were tested in their homes in the spring of 1988 and asked to locate the same 13 countries, Central America, the Pacific Ocean and the Persian Gulf.
About 1,500 Soviet citizens took part in the survey last spring in Moscow and Kursk, an industrial city of 425,000 people, 300 miles south of the capital. Mr. Andreyenkov and Neil A. Upmeyer of Gallup said the results might not apply to all of the Soviet Union because of its size and cultural diversity, but were accurate for the European section of the country. A wider survey would have been impractical, they said.
 
Opinion Polls Allowed Now
Public opinion surveys were banned in the Soviet Union for decades, but the practice has been allowed again under a recent liberalization of policies.
Russians and Americans were good at locating each other. Seventy-six percent of Russians could find the United States on the map. For Americans, 66 percent correctly identified the Soviet Union.
Nearly 90 percent of the Russians surveyed - compared with 47 percent of the Americans - said they had taken a course devoted entirely to geography. Mr. Andreyenkov said total school education was the biggest independent factor found in determining who would be best at identifying locations on the map.
In examining attitudes on what subjects people considered important to be well-educated and competitive, participants were asked a series of questions. Knowledge of geography was rated absolutely necessary by 52 percent of Russians, compared with 37 percent of Americans. Computer skills were rated higher by Americans than Russians, 64 percent to 42 percent, and knowledge of history was rated necessary by 72 percent of Russians, compared with only 36 percent of Americans.

HEADLINE: Without Braniff, Nebraska City Suffers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND ISLAND, Neb.

 BODY:
Of all the cities served by Braniff, this city of 45,000 people in central Nebraska now has a distinction no one wanted.
With the airline suspending all passenger flights as of Tuesday and putting itself up for sale, travelers in many cities now face more difficult flight schedules and higher costs. But Grand Island's situation is more troublesome: the city has lost its only direct link with a major airline. It had a passenger exchange and ticketing arrangement with Braniff through two commuter carriers. 
Before Braniff sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court on Sept. 28, the two commuter carriers made six flights a day here, and passengers who continued on Braniff jets from Kansas City received fare breaks. Now only one carrier, Midcontinent Airline, offers service to Kansas City, with two flights a day out of Grand Island. But it does not provide the passenger exchange and ticketing arrangements or the fare breaks that were available before.
 
'Has a Big Impact'
''Braniff offered through fares for the entire trip, including the flight from here to Kansas City,'' said Dick Brown, owner of First Holiday Tour and Travel in Grand Island. ''That kept us competitive. Now if you fly from here, the fare is an add-on to whatever the major airline charges. And if you drive over to Lincoln or Omaha, that's 95 or 150 miles, and more expenses.''
''All that has a big impact,'' Mr. Brown added. ''When you are in rural America, and you want to promote economic development, your airport is one of your more important assets.''
The broadest impact of Braniff's collapse, of course, has fallen on Kansas City. Through much of the 1980's it had enjoyed superior air service as Eastern Airlines established one of its main route centers there. After Eastern withdrew most of its operations a year ago, Braniff moved in and rapidly expanded a hub-and-spoke system of its own.
From Kansas City, it offered direct flights to 32 cities, including Orlando, Fla., the company's headquarters. All told, it offered 93 flights a day on its major routes.
Then, on Sept. 28, Braniff, which has been owned since 1988 by a group represented by Paine Webber Inc., ran out of operating money. It halted most flights and sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court while it reorganized. When it resumed flying, it offered a schedule shrunken to 46 flights. Then, on Monday night, it suspended the rest of its flights and said it would run only its charter operations.
 
Fewer Nonstop Flights
Kansas City still has service from a dozen other major airlines, among them American Airlines and USAir. But Braniff offered the only nonstop flights from Kansas City to major airports at these 14 cities: Albuquerque, N.M.; Boston; Cleveland; Indianapolis; Miami; LaGuardia in New York; Ontario, Calif.; Orlando; Philadelphia; San Antonio; San Diego; Seattle; Tampa, Fla., and Tucson, Ariz.
Other airlines, though, have scheduled nonstop flights to begin soon to three of those: LaGuardia, Cleveland and Indianapolis.
 
Impact on Business Travelers
''The big impact was on the business travelers, people who want to get there as fast as they can,'' said Marcy Moreno, an agent at Heart of America Travel in Kansas City. ''We had been spoiled. Often they could get there and back the same day.''
''Take flights to Boston and Philadelphia, for example,'' Ms. Moreno continued. ''Before Braniff's troubles you could get there in less than three hours. Now, with connections through Chicago, St. Louis or Detroit, you're adding one to three hours, and the fares have gone up, too.''
But it is in the smaller communities that had depended on Braniff's commuter lines where the cuts became more than an inconvenience. In that way the Braniff failure has been similar to the cutbacks at Eastern in March. The Eastern retrenchment forced four commuter airlines to eliminate routes serving 20 cities.
Braniff's collapse has delivered its harshest blows to the commuter lines Air Midwest and Midcontinent Airline. Both, operating under the name Braniff Express, had generated passengers for Braniff's major routes, and Braniff had shared its revenue with them.
When Braniff filed for bankruptcy-court protection, Air Midwest cut its flights from 74 to 48 and Midcontinent temporarily grounded all its planes.
In addition to cutting the number of flights, Air Midwest eliminated service to seven cities. Besides Grand Island, they are Joplin, Mo.; Sioux City, Iowa.; Moline, Ill.; Madison, Wis.; Peoria, Ill., and Tulsa, Okla.
When Midcontinent resumed flying Sunday, it had eliminated three cities from its schedule: Sioux Falls, S.D., Fort Smith, Ark., and Springfield, Mo.
Except for Grand Island, those cities have passenger exchange and ticketing arrangements with other major airlines in other cities.
 
'Problem Is the Lost Time'
Doyle Hulme, general manager of the Ford New Holland farm machinery plant in Grand Island, explained what the changes will mean for his company. His employees, he said, must make about 15 flights a month to Philadelphia to get to a home office in Lancaster, Pa. Now, Mr. Hulme said, instead of flying out of Grand Island, they have to drive to the Lincoln airport 95 miles away or the Omaha airport 150 miles away.
''The biggest problem is the lost time,'' Mr. Hulme said. ''In the past you could get there in three hours and still get half a day's work done. Now you blow an entire day just getting there.''
The only one benefiting at the moment from Grand Island's trouble is George Poullos, owner of GP Express, a commuter line that flies from Grand Island to Lincoln, Omaha, Denver and several neighboring small cities. Its traffic has increased as the competition faded.
''In the short term we are benefiting,'' Mr. Poullos said. ''In the long run, though, it could hurt us. We could wind up losing that business to other airports.''

HEADLINE: Minimum Wage Rise Wins Final Senate Vote

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The Senate gave final legislative approval today to a bill raising the minimum wage to $3.80 an hour next year and to $4.25 an hour in 1991. The increases would be the first since 1981.
The bill, adopted on a vote of 89 to 8, is the product of months of negotiations between Congress and the White House. The measure now goes to President Bush, who has said he will sign it. Under an agreement worked out last week, Democrats accepted a smaller increase in the wage floor than they sought initially, and Mr. Bush accepted a more narrowly defined subminimum wage that would apply to teen-agers in the first 90 days of their employment. 
''Both sides in this controversy have compromised,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who was the chief sponsor of the measure. ''The amount of the increase is much less than I wanted and much less than the working poor deserved.'' #8 Conservatives Oppose Bill If the wage rate had been adjusted for inflation each year since 1981, he said, the minimum would now be $4.79 an hour.
All eight of the Senators voting against the compromise were conservative Republicans, several of whom offered amendments to permit new migrant and seasonal farm workers to be paid at the subminimum rate and to prevent the Federal Government from mandating future increases in the minimum wage or other employee benefits. Both amendments were defeated on 64-to-34 votes.
Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican who was one of the opponents, said the rise in the minimum wage would hurt the very workers that supporters of the increase were trying to help. In a view echoed even by some of the Republicans who eventually voted for the bill, the Senator said the higher hourly wage would eliminate job opportunities for poor and unskilled workers while forcing price increases in the goods and services they purchase.
About 4 million of the 60 million American workers paid by the hour receive the minimum wage, which is now $3.35 an hour. Several million others earn more than the current minimum but less than $4.25 an hour. According to the Labor Department, more than three of every 10 workers earning the minimum wage are teen-agers, and 70 percent of the minimum wage earners are women.
 
Election Campaign Pledge
The first 45-cents-an-hour rise in the minimum wage will take effect next April 1, and the second installment will take effect on April 1, 1991.
Mr. Bush, making good on an election campaign pledge, initially sought legislation that would raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over three years and create a new subminimum wage that employers could pay to all newly hired workers for as long as six months. Earlier this year he vetoed legislation that would have increased the minimum wage rate to $4.55 an hour over three years and limited the subminimum wage to first-time workers for a period of 60 days.
Under the compromise urged by Republican leaders in the Senate, the President accepted a modified version of the subminimum wage applicable only to workers between the ages of 16 and 19 and then only for the first 90 days of their employment. The submininum would be $3.35 an hour beginning next April 1, and 85 percent of the regular minimum wage rate thereafter.
The measure approved today also expands an existing exemption from the minimum wage law for certain small retail and service businesses. It also increases the percentage of earnings received from tips that can be counted against the minimum wage.
As the outcome of the final vote was announced, there was a burst of applause and cheers from lobbyists for labor organizations who were waiting in a room outside the Senate chamber.
In a statement issued afterward, Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he was delighted with the result and urged the President to sign the bill promptly.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Chooses Continuity

 BODY:
New Jersey voters, leaving no doubt about their choice for governor, elected Representative James Florio over Representative Jim Courter by a 24-point margin. The outcome was a triumph of Democrat over Republican, of an activist philosophy of government over a minimalist view. Mostly, though, it was an expression of a widespread desire for continuity and moderation. 
When Mr. Florio takes office in January, he'll succeed Tom Kean, a Republican who narrowly defeated him in his first bid for governor eight years ago. Party labels aside, Mr. Florio and Mr. Kean are more alike than different in their approaches to government. In exit polls many voters described themselves, Mr. Kean and Mr. Florio as moderates, and the personable Mr. Courter as unacceptably conservative.
Under Governor Kean, New Jersey's state spending doubled. The state pioneered in welfare and education reform and began formally pursuing regional and statewide development. All of that was made possible by an economic boom that produced jobs in abundance and made New Jersey's per capita income among the highest in the nation.
Mr. Florio comes to office as the boom has started to fade and with the state facing a deficit of as much as $600 million. He'll need all the imagination and perseverance he showed as a Congressman to close that gap and still pursue new solutions to problems like pollution and solid-waste disposal.
In addition to the governorship, the voters gave Mr. Florio a legislature of his own party by returning a Democratic majority to the State Assembly. The Senate was already under Democratic control. That could be crucial in contriving a solution to New Jersey's most vexing problem, if not necessarily its most important: automobile insurance.
It was in their approaches to the auto insurance issue that the differences between Mr. Florio and Mr. Courter were most vividly demonstrated. Mr. Florio wanted tougher state regulation of insurance companies; Mr. Courter wanted to foster more competition to bring prices down.
The voters decided that the business of government is to govern. Mr. Florio is their quite sensible choice.

HEADLINE: How We Can Help Gorbachev and Ourselves

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal, in his column of Oct. 20, fears that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is using perestroika, his policy of restructuring, to save ''the Communist system.'' Four facts, however, indicate that the Soviet President is trying to change the system into something resembling a Scandinavian combination of social welfare and democracy: (1) The adoption of regular and competitive elections to national and regional legislatures that debate and pass new laws rather than passively rubber-stamping them. (2) Much greater (although not complete) freedom to express unorthodox, antigovernment ideas. (3) His repeated emphasis on the need for the rule of law under a new constitution being drafted by the Supreme Soviet. (4) The cautious encouragement of private enterprises, including foreign ones.
These steps are all loosening the Communist Party's noose around the Government, the press, private lives and the economy. They have also opened a Pandora's box of unrest and protest by consumers, workers and non-Russian ethnic groups, as well as resistance by party members, whose privileges are threatened. 
President Gorbachev walks a thin line between moving too fast and moving too slowly. If he gives away power too soon by conceding every economic or political demand, he exposes himself to a counterperestroika coup by conservative party members. If he moves too slowly, he risks total collapse of the Soviet economy and the breakdown of law and order.
Perestroika, as Mr. Gorbachev defines it on page 255 of his book of that title, means ''democratization, economic reform and transformation of the political system.'' Give him credit where credit is due. He has initiated positive changes in all three areas, changes that have considerable potential for long-range growth.
There is one big way we can and should help encourage further the evolution of the Soviet Union toward a freer form of government and a market system that can meet the people's economic needs. That is by cooperating with Mr. Gorbachev in promptly reducing spending by both our countries on unnecessary military hardware and personnel.
This will transform us into a freer people as well - less enslaved by a crippling national debt, huge annual budget deficits, unfavorable balances of trade, paralyzing fears of Communism, and preparations for an unlikely war that could destroy us all.
We have but to follow Abraham Lincoln's advice in his 1862 annual message to Congress, and recognize that ''the occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.''
''As our case is new,'' he continued, ''so we must act anew. We must disenthral ourselves, and then we shall save our country.''

HEADLINE: Errors in Management Preceded Our Deficits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In noting the disadvantages of United States companies competing with Japan, and their failure to get ready for the long haul, you state that ''Federal budget deficits have raised interest rates and forced U.S. companies to seek quicker paybacks on their investments'' (''Rights and Wrongs of Blaming Japan,'' editorial Oct. 16).
It is undoubtedly true that many American companies (that is, those that are publicly held) are willing to sacrifice long-term growth for short-term profits. Federal budget deficits, however, can't be blamed for this shortsightedness.
The preoccupation of United States managers with today's bottom line predates huge Federal deficits by 30 to 40 years and is traceable, I believe, to the practice of compensating management with stock options. In my experience, the overriding concern of management engaged in making a corporate decision is not the long-term corporate benefit, but ''What will it do to the price of our stock?'' Until this situation is addressed, the quick fix will probably remain the preferred choice of United States managers.

HEADLINE: New York Housing Officials Redefine Family to Block Evictions

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS

 BODY:
New York State housing officials expanded the definition of family yesterday to block landlords from evicting unrelated people from the more than 1 million rent-stabilized apartments in the state.
The new definition follows a ruling in July by the state's highest court that said two gay men who had lived together for more than a decade could be considered a family under the city's rent-control regulations.
In announcing the new rules, the Housing Commissioner, Richard L. Higgins, said that emergency action to expand the court's ruling is necessary to prevent any evictions from going forward.
''We must assure that nontraditional family members of tenants, especially those most vulnerable such as the elderly, disabled and persons infected with the AIDS virus, are not unfairly subject to eviction,'' Mr. Higgins said in a statement. A broad range of people would be affected by the new rules, including many poor and elderly people who often form nontraditional households out of economic and social need. 
Reaction to the emergency regulations, which take effect immediately, came swiftly as gay- and lesbian-rights organizations hailed the state's decision while representatives of New York City landlords promised to file suit against the new rules in State Supreme Court today.
''The government is basically saying that property owners must bear the brunt of the societal question of what is family,'' said John Gilbert, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a lobbying organization for landlords. ''What they are attempting to say to a property owner is that you don't have the right to determine who lives in your building.''
David A. Hansell, the legal director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the country's largest AIDS service organization, said the state action was ''fair and compassionate.''
''Many times the eviction cases that we handle involve survivors, usually lovers, of people who have died of AIDS and who themselves have been diagnosed with AIDS,'' he said. ''This removes from them the dual burden of dealing with their illness and the threat of eviction.''
Paula L. Ettelbrick, the legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which had joined with many other gay-rights and tenant organizations in lobbying the housing department, called the new regulations a ''tremendous step forward for the gay and lesbian community.''
''They have taken seriously the Court of Appeals instruction that we look at the reality of family life in this country,'' she said. ''And the reality of family life includes gay and lesbian life partners.''
The regulations, which had been the object of intense negotiations throughout the summer and fall, specify that people unrelated to a tenant can remain in a rent-stabilized apartment if they meet two primary requirements, including living with the tenant for no less than two years or for one year for elderly or disabled people.
Tenants would also have to show ''emotional and financial commitment and interdependence'' between themselves and the person on the lease.
Under the new regulations, a tenant may - at any time - advise their landlord of all people who live in the apartment and whether anyone is entitled to be named as a tenant on a renewal lease and when their relationship began. If the do not provide the landlord with such information it could be more difficult for their partner to remain in the apartment.
 
'Reality of Family Life'
In July, the Court of Appeals wrote that protection from eviction under rent-control rules ''should not rest on fictitous legal distinctions or genetic history, but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life.''
Because the apartment in question in that decision was regulated under rent-control rules, the decision did not affect the state's rent-stabilized buildings.
Rent-control guidelines in New York, which cover apartments built before 1947 that have been occupied by the same tenant at least since 1971, affect about 167,000 apartments, most of them in New York City.
The rent-stabilization laws, in contrast, are less strict. They affect residents of more than 900,000 apartments in New York City as well as 74,000 apartments in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties. Another 162,000 apartments throughout New York State are also affected by the housing department's decision.
 
Subject to Public Hearings
The new regulations will be subject to public hearings before they are finalized by the department.
In addition to expanding the definition of family, the new regulations also change a provision of the current rent-stabilization law to allow tenants to remain in their apartments even if the original lease holder moves. Since 1987, even people related by blood, marriage or adoption could be evicted if the leaseholder moved from a rent-stabilized apartment.
Throughout the summer, the housing department was criticized for not issuing the regulations immediately after the Court of Appeals decision.
 
Omnibus Housing Bill
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had proposed legislation very similiar to yesterday's emergency regulations as part of an omnibus housing bill before the Legislature this year, but the bill died in the final days of the legislative session.
The new regulations are expected to have broad implications for many unrelated people living together in rent-stabilized apartments. The rules were seen as a particular victory for gay-rights groups, however.
The new rules ''represent the most far-reaching recognition of lesbian and gay relationships ever granted by any government agency in the United States,'' said William B. Rubenstein, staff counsel to the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
''It is an important recognition that lesbians, gay men and other functional family members are threatened by eviction from their family homes in the very same way other New Yorkers are,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The 1989 Elections: Seattle First Black Is Elected Mayor, Defeating Busing Opponent

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Norman B. Rice has been elected Seattle's first black mayor, defeating an opponent who built his campaign on a ballot measure to end busing for school integration.
The voters split so evenly on the ballot measure that its fate remains undecided.
Mr. Rice, a three-term City Councilman, won by a wide margin yesterday in a city with a black population of 10 percent. In the campaign he favored a tax increase to pay for more police officers and trumpeted his managerial experience. 
Mr. Rice, a Democrat, carried all but a few precincts of the city with 93,491 votes, or 58 percent. His Republican opponent, City Attorney Doug Jewett, received 67,276 votes, or 42 percent.
 
'Seattle Set an Example'
''Seattle set an example for the rest of the United States,'' Mr. Rice said. ''This is a can-do city and a thinking city.''
His campaign manager, Charles Rolland, said: ''We made history. The conventional wisdom has always been that a city needs to have at least 40 percent minorities to elect black mayor. We proved that wrong.''
New York City, where blacks make up 25 percent of the population, also elected its first black mayor, David N. Dinkens, on Tuesday.
Mr. Jewett had built his campaign around an initiative to end busing of schoolchildren to achieve racial balance. Mr. Jewett's strategists had hoped the initiative would bring out Republican voters and those dissatisfied with busing.
 
Busing Measure Is Dead Even
With several thousand absentee ballots still not counted, the busing measure was running dead even.
Mr. Rolland said the anti-busing measure failed to carry Mr. Jewett to victory because about 35 percent of those who favored the initiative also voted for Mr. Rice. Mr. Rice had called the measure divisive and ''a terrible ingredient'' in Seattle politics. And in an effort to draw attention from the issue, he proposed his own plan to phase out busing over four years.
Unlike the mayoral contest in New York or the Virginia gubernatorial race, where surveys had overestimated the support of black politicians, the Seattle race proved just the opposite. Mr. Rice's margin of victory, 16 percentage points, was twice the margin of his lead found in polls completed last week.
Mr. Rice said in an interview today that crime proved to be a much bigger issue than race or busing. A central platform of Mr. Rice's campaign, a measure to raise the city's business and occupation taxes to hire 102 more police officers, passed easily Tuesday.
''There was a feeling in the neighborhoods that people were threatened, that they wanted more security,'' Mr. Rice said. ''The feeling was widespread.''
 
No Watermelon Buttons Here
Mr. Rolland, a former Chicago resident who was the Washington State campaign manager in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's two Presidential bids, said Mr. Rice's candidacy brought out only a few racial slurs. ''It was pretty minor because racism here is much more hidden and subtle,'' he said. ''It's not Chicago, where people were wearing watermelon buttons during the last mayor's race.''
Mr. Rice, who is 46 years old, has always been a low-key politician. In fact, his caution was blamed by some for his loss four years ago to Mayor Charles Royer, a three-term Democrat, and in an unsuccessful Congressional race last year. Mayor Royer is leaving Seattle to head the Institute of Politics at the Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
During the campaign Mr. Rice often spoke of his skill in helping to balance the city's budget in the recession during the 1980's. As a Councilman, he was the chairman of the finance committee.
This year, Mr. Rice entered the mayor's race reluctantly, he said, considering his two previous failures and announced his candidacy on the last possible filing day. His campaign began slowly, but he picked up momentum in debates with Mr. Jewett.

HEADLINE: A Year of Tribulation for Pan Am

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Pan Am has been vigorously searching for a buyer or partner for several years. The last thing it needed was a year like the last one.
More than 10 months after a terrorist bomb destroyed a Pan American World Airways jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, many travelers, particularly business people, continue to avoid the carrier. The Scottish tragedy and subsequent introduction of time-consuming security checks will have cost the airline up to $250 million in forgone ticket sales by the end of this year, said Thomas G. Plaskett, the airline's chairman, chief executive and president.
And in recent months, regulators have advocated new restrictions on investments in American airlines and sales of international routes, making it more difficult for Pan Am to find a foreign partner or raise money. American carriers have not expressed interest in buying Pan Am. 
 
Buyout Limits Proposed
Also, members of Congress have called for limits on airline buyouts, which could help deter both domestic and foreign deals.
During this year Pan Am has gone through an expensive and unsuccessful attempt to take over Northwest Airlines and has seen the collapse of partnership talks with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. And while Pan Am obtained concessions from its unions last year totaling about $500 million over three years, its accumulated losses have left it with debts exceeding assets by $458 million. The airline also has an unfunded pension liability totaling $550 million at the end of last year.
Troubled labor relations, the lack of a well-developed domestic route network and growing competition on trans-Atlantic routes have also made it difficult for Pan Am to find a financially strong partner.
Some people are not optimistic about Pan Am's future. ''They have gone through eight of their nine lives,'' said Edward J. Starkman, an airline analyst with Paine Webber. ''One bad winter and they could run out of cash.''
Pan Am said yesterday that it earned $458,000 in the third quarter, its peak season, compared with a $67.4 million profit in the corresponding quarter last year. Quarterly revenues, at $1.02 billion, were down slightly from $1.04 billion.
In the first nine months of this year, Pan Am has lost $158.3 million on sales of $2.66 billion, compared with losses of $21 million on sales of $2.73 billion in the first nine months of 1988. Pan Am's operating losses have been the largest and most consistent among American airlines.
While Pan Am needs help to prosper, it remains a viable business, Mr. Plaskett said. ''How much longer can we go on without a partner? Years,'' he said. But he added, ''My objective is to do something and do it soon.''
Although most industry experts say that recent sales and leasebacks of aircraft have given Pan Am enough cash to survive this winter, some are predicting that the airline may have to sell its shuttle, which flies between Boston, New York and Washington, to raise money for the following winter. The shuttle, which competes against the Trump Shuttle, has 50 to 60 percent of the market.
The financial thunderstorms now towering over Pan Am have cast a shadow on an airline that once symbolized America's dominance of international aviation. Pan Am was the world's first international airline, the first to offer scheduled service across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the first to democratize international air travel after World War II with economy-class fares.
In the 1970's, Pan Am became an efficient air bridge between New York and Europe, ferrying up to 375 passengers in each Boeing 747. But it relied largely on other carriers to bring Americans to New York first.
Partial deregulation of international air travel in the late 1970's allowed more of Pan Am's competitors to fly across the Atlantic from more American cities. Many business travelers now fly directly to Europe from their hometowns, starving Pan Am of traffic through New York and leaving it with tourists who buy discounted tickets that generate scant profits.
 
A Troubled Domestic Operation
Even worse than the lack of passengers fed to the international flights is the huge cost and inefficiency of operating planes on a limited domestic network without a hub, Mr. Plaskett said. The typical narrow-body plane at Pan Am is operated only six hours a day between just two cities, while rivals with hubs can put a plane on a succession of routes that keep it busy for 9 or 10 hours a day, he said.
In 1987 and 1988, Pan Am had operating profits of $207 million on its Atlantic and Latin American routes but lost $395 million domestically.
Pan Am ticket sales continue to be affected by the Lockerbie disaster, Mr. Plaskett said. After the crash on Dec. 21, which killed 270 people, many large companies warned their executives not to fly on American carriers because of the risk of terrorist attacks. Lingering fears continue to hurt Pan Am's efforts to attract business customers, Mr. Plaskett said. Analysts agree. In September, nine months after the bombing, Pan Am flew 11 percent fewer first-class passengers and 9 percent fewer business-class passengers than in September 1988, a company spokesman said. Declines in previous months were even worse, he said. Economy-class travel fell 3 percent in September and 7.2 percent for the first nine months of this year , but overall bookings are up for this winter, he said.
By comparison, British Airways P.L.C. had a 5.5 percent increase in trans-Atlantic first-class traffic in September and a 17 percent gain in business class from a year ago, a spokesman said.
 
Lost Ticket Sales
In the first six months of this year, Mr. Plaskett said, the Lockerbie disaster caused Pan Am to lose at least $100 million in ticket sales from passengers who chose to fly another carrier or stay home. That total for the year, he added, is likely to be about $150 million.
In addition, Mr. Plaskett said, the increased security measures required of American carriers after the bombing have irritated business travelers, who dislike the delays involved. Many of them are flying on foreign carriers, which are not subject to the new requirements. This has cost Pan Am $50 million to $100 million in revenues this year, he said. On top of all that, Pan Am faces numerous lawsuits over the Lockerbie crash.
What Pan Am really needs is a partnership or merger with another airline, or a significant amount of fresh cash from outside the airline industry, Mr. Plaskett said. Pan Am has two big assets not reflected on its balance sheet: an internationally recognized name and the right to fly many flights into some of Europe's most heavily used airports, like Heathrow, outside London.
Pan Am is actively pursuing all possible ways to raise money or form alliances, Mr. Plaskett said, but he declined to elaborate on progress.
Two prospects crumbled last spring. Partnership talks with KLM broke up in mid-March when the Dutch carrier realized that it would not be able to exercise the strong influence over Pan Am that it sought, Mr. Plaskett said.
But Peter van Vliet, KLM's vice president and general manager of United States operations, said, ''With respect to Pan Am, KLM's analysis was based primarily on the fact that the financial risk was, in KLM's opinion, unacceptable.''
Pan Am then made an unsuccessful bid for Northwest Airlines, losing $28 million in fees in the process. An investor group that includes KLM bought NWA Inc., Northwest's parent, for $3.65 billion in August.
 
Government Actions
Mr. Plaskett's alternatives have since been sharply limited by two moves by the Department of Transportation, and could be further curtailed by legislation now in Congress. Samuel K. Skinner, the Secretary of Transportation, sent a letter on June 13 to the presidents of 28 commercial air carriers, expressing concern about the buying and selling of international routes, which are granted to airlines by the Government.
In 1985, Pan Am sold its Pacific routes to United Airlines for $900 million. During labor negotiations last year, Pan Am threatened to sell its Latin American routes. Mr. Plaskett said Pan Am currently had no plans to sell more routes.
Then in September the Transportation Department developed a new interpretation of Federal legislation prohibiting foreign companies and individuals from owning more than 25 percent of an American carrier. Mr. Skinner decided in a case involving Northwest Airlines that the law pertained not only to the percentage of voting stock owned by foreign companies but also to the percentage of equity, which includes nonvoting preferred stock.
The department's willingness to change an already completed deal affected the decision of British Airways to pull out of a buyout bid for the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said Lord King, the chairman of British Airways.
British Airways' decision on UAL was the ''death knell'' for Pan Am because no other foreign carrier is likely to be as adventurous in pursuing American carriers as KLM and British Airways have been, said a European airline executive who asked not to be identified.
But Mr. Plaskett said the Transportation Department's action had not diminished foreign carriers' interest in buying into American airlines.
 
A Possible Exception
The Government may be willing to make an exception for Pan Am because if the airline goes bankrupt, the Government would face difficult negotiations with foreign governments over Pan Am's international routes, said L. John Eichner, an airline economist and consultant. A Department of Transportation spokesman declined to comment.
Another potential hindrance to Pan Am's plans is legislation before Congress that would require the Transportation Department to disapprove any acquisition of more than 15 percent of a United States carrier if it would reduce the carrier's ability to compete, to operate safely or to stay in business without asset sales, or if the deal would eliminate jobs or cut wages. Mr. Skinner has said he will recommend that President Bush veto the legislation if Congress passes it.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Heavy U.S. Debt Sales Awaited

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Dealers in the credit markets are scrambling to cope with a rapid-fire succession of Treasury auctions.
When they conclude on Tuesday, $56 billion in securities will have been brought to market.
The Treasury, which would have run out of cash today had Congress not raised the nation's debt limit on Tuesday night, yesterday auctioned $16 billion worth of three- and six-month bills that had been delayed since Monday. Today, the Treasury will hold the first of its quarterly refunding auctions, a $10 billion offering of three-year notes.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board, which surprised market participants on Tuesday when it appeared to sanction a drop in the overnight Federal funds rate to 8.50 percent from 8.75 percent, did nothing to change that view yesterday. Indeed, movements in the funds rate yesterday prompted some speculation that the Fed may have eased policy even further. 
 
No Open-Market Operations
The Fed chose not to conduct open-market operations yesterday when the funds rate was trading at 8.50 percent. The funds rate softened further later in the day, trading as low as 8 5/ 16 percent before rising to a late offered rate of 8 3/8 percent.
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were unchanged to slightly higher in moderately active trading.
A number of analysts said technical factors associated with the end of a two-week reporting period for banks had much to do with the erratic movement in the funds rate yesterday. The Fed, which has been engaged in a policy of lowering the funds rate in increments of 25 basis points, or hundredths of a point, since late spring, has not changed its tactics, they said.
But others said they were not so sure. After looking at movements in the funds rate yesterday, Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, ''At this point, we are comfortable in saying that the new trading range for Fed funds is at least 8 3/8 percent to 8 1/2 percent, and it may be even lower.''
 
Debt Limit Raised Tuesday
Congress voted on Tuesday to raise the nation's debt limit to $3.12 trillion, through Sept. 30.
The Treasury's refinancing auctions will continue on Friday with the sale of $10 billion worth of 36-day cash management bills and will wind up early next week, when $10 billion of 10-year notes and $10 billion of 30-year bonds will be sold on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
At the bill auction, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, down from the average rate of 7.78 percent at the auction on Oct. 30.
The six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.49 percent, down from last week's average rate of 7.62 percent.
In when-issued trading, the three-year notes to be sold today were offered at a price to yield 7.77 percent. The 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 7.82 percent. And the 30-year bonds to be sold on Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 7.88 percent.
The Treasury will sell the new bonds by reopening the current outstanding 8 1/8 percent issue of 2019.
Among secondary Treasury issues, the 8 1/8 percent bond was offered in late trading at a price of 102 29/32, mostly unchanged on the day, to yield 7.87 percent.
Much of the day's activity was in intermediate- to short-term notes, where prices inched higher. 5-Year Notes at 7.77% By late in the day, the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 7/8, up 6/32, to yield 7.77 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes rose by 3/ 32, to a late offered price of 99 3/4, to yield 7.76 percent.
Because of the shortened when-issued trading period, some traders said that to drum up demand in the Treasury auctions interest rates may have to move higher.
''Unless strong demand shows up, I would be shocked if there is not one significant up-tick in this whole series of auctions,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''The most logical candidate looks like the 30-year bond. It is a reopened issue that is trading above par, or $100. But that auction is also the most difficult to predict because the make-or-break demand for it comes from outside the country.''
 
Heavy Municipal Calendar
In other developments, participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market faced a heavy new-issue calendar yesterday as five deals were priced at competitive bid.
Among the issues offered was a $225 million sale of general obligation bonds from New York State. A bid from a syndicate led by Marine Midland Capital Markets won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1990 to 2019.
The bonds were reoffered with coupons ranging from 5.90 percent on the securities maturing in 1990 to 7.20 percent on the bonds maturing in 2019.
Investment bankers close to the deal said that demand for the securities was strong. The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the corporate bond market, the Pennzoil Company priced $400 million worth of notes and debentures in a two-part offering through an underwriting syndicate led by Shearson Lehman Hutton.
The $200 million worth of 9 5/8 percent 10-year notes were priced at 99.65 to yield 9.68 percent, 1.80 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the 8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. The notes mature Nov. 15, 1999. The $200 million worth of 10 1/8 percent 20-year debentures were priced at 99.11, to yield 10.23 percent, 2.35 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bond at the time of pricing. The debentures have a final maturity date of Nov. 15, 2009.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's and A- by S.&P.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Japanese Move Into Stock Swaps

BYLINE: By Phillip H. Wiggins

 BODY:
STOCK swaps, a technique commonly used for financing acquisitions in the United States, may become more prevalent among Japanese companies as a result of the recent deal by the Kyoto-based Kyocera Corporation to acquire the AVX Corporation, the Great Neck, L.I., manufacturer of electronic capacitors, through an exchange of stock.
The acquisition was not easy. It took considerable legal agility to leap the hurdles presented by Japan's stringent commercial code that many had viewed as prohibiting such transactions.
But stock swaps are attractive to Americans because, unlike cash deals, they can be tax-free. Also, the deal allayed growing concerns about Japan's large purchases of American assets. Consequently, some Wall Street analysts speculate that this $561 million deal could start a new trend in American-Japanese mergers and acquisitions. 
Recently, Kyocera, a maker of ceramic packages for semiconductors, said AVX stockholders would receive a partial American depository share in exchange for each of their AVX shares. A.D.S.'s are virtually the same as American depository receipts, although actual shares, not receipts, are issued. AVX holders will receive a minimum of 39-hundredths of a Kyocera A.D.S. for each AVX share. The exact exchange ratio will be determined by a formula involving the average trading price of Kyocera's A.D.S.'s over a still to be specified three-week period.
The Kyocera-AVX transaction marks the first time a Japanese public company has merged with an American concern through a stock swap. Last week, the acquisition received American regulatory clearance on antitrust and national security grounds. If the agreement is approved in Japan, it could well provide a new model for similar deals in the future.
''As the outcry over the Sony deal for Columbia Pictures demonstrates, cash purchases of U.S. companies by the Japanese do not sit well with Americans,'' said Jack Barbanel, portfolio strategist with First Global Asset Management, a money-management firm based in Princeton, N.J. ''The Kyocera stock-swap arrangement might mitigate this problem.''
In the Kyocera case, Americans owning AVX stock will become shareholders of the Japanese company, creating what the managements of both companies refer to as a partnership.
''You have to look at the broader ramifications of this transaction for it potentially represents a major breakthrough in bilateral relations between the U.S. and Japan and could help diffuse the political obstacles confronting Japanese companies seeking to gain entree to the U.S. market,'' Mr. Barbanel said.
Some suggest that, if successful, the Kyocera-AVX deal might also pave the way for American companies to acquire Japanese concerns. ''At least theoretically, an American company could simply pattern a transaction after the Kyocera deal and use it to initiate a purchase,'' Mr. Barbanel said. ''As a practical matter, however, the higher multiples enjoyed by Japanese public companies would seem to cast doubt on the economics of such a transaction.'' In any event, the intricate structure of the Kyocera-AVX stock swap underscores the imposing legal and cultural obstacles that had to be overcome. The Japanese commercial code prohibits wholly owned subsidiaries from owning stock in the parent, thus seemingly preventing any acquisition involving an exchange of stock.
To bypass this legal roadblock, Kyocera effected a rarely used acquisition technique termed a ''forward triangle merger.'' In the Kyocera case, a company named the K C Subsidiary Corporation will be formed and incorporated in Delaware. The ownership of K C Subsidiary includes a 5 percent position by the Kyocera Finance Corporation, a Japanese computer-equipment leasing company that is 40 percent owned by Kyocera and 60 percent held by a consortium of 12 Japanese banks. The other 95 percent interest is held directly by the Kyocera Corporation.
''Since K C Subsidiary is not wholly owned by the Kyocera Corporation, we capitalized the partially owned entity, which will use the funds to buy the new American depository shares to be exchanged for AVX stock once the transaction receives shareholder and appropriate government approvals,'' said Rodney N. Lanthorne, president of Kyocera International Inc., the wholly owned American subsidiary of the Kyocera Corporation, and a director of the Japanese parent company.
Such a transaction is called a forward triangular merger, he said, because AVX will be absorbed by K C Subsidiary, which will then change its name to the AVX Corporation. ''From an operating standpoint, nothing has changed, but we believe the mechanism satisfies the Japanese restrictions on stock swaps and will enable AVX shareholders to realize a tax-free exchange,'' he said.
After the transaction is completed, AVX will become a subsidiary of Kyocera International, which is based in San Diego.
Despite its complexity, the Kyocera triangular merger is being done without the assistance of investment bankers. Kyocera retained the Los Angeles law firm of Spensley Horn Jubas & Lubitz and the Japanese firm of Tomotsune, Kumura & Mitumi to develop and carry out the strategy for structuring the transaction.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Asset Allocation's Effect on Volatility

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
JOHN J. PHELAN Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, suggests that a form of computer-assisted program trading used by some large pension funds has the potential to become as destabilizing to the market as ''portfolio insurance,'' or using stock index futures to hedge a position in the stock market.
After the stock market crash in 1987, the Brady Commission cited portfolio insurance for its role in exacerbating the market's decline and volatility.
Money managers engaged in the version of program trading known as tactical asset allocation, which involves using computer models to signal when to shift assets among stocks, bonds and cash equivalents like Treasury bills, concede their trades may be disruptive. But they disagree with Mr. Phelan that the technique is as potentially destructive as portfolio insurance. 
In fact, they charge that Mr. Phelan's attempt to limit program trading in falling markets - last week the Big Board asked Wall Street brokers and institutional investors to refrain voluntarily from program trading - is a misguided violation of ''free markets'' and is an unrealistic effort to legislate away bear markets.
''I'd like to legislate away John Phelan,'' said Michael A. Petrino, president of Matrix Capital Management, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that invests almost $800 million for its clients and uses tactical asset allocation for some of them.
Mr. Phelan's concern about tactical asset allocation stems in part from the size of pension assets involved. Some of the two dozen or so firms that use this technique for an estimated $40 billion of assets buy or sell stock index futures as well as stocks when they move their clients' assets into and out of the markets.
The asset allocation models signal asset switches in anticipation of changes in corporate earnings, short-term interest rates and other economic factors. The managers using these models have different interpretations and forecasts, and so far this year, they have not moved in lockstep.
Money managers who used portfolio insurance, on the other hand, bought or sold stocks or stock index futures solely in reaction to stock price changes. Almost all of their models reacted to the same data in the same way, and thus when they began selling, a market decline could turn into a rout.
Nevertheless, the size of stock transactions unleashed by firms using tactical asset allocation has the potential to disrupt the market on a short-term basis. ''We have to allow for the possibility that there will be disruptive implementation of these strategies,'' Mr. Petrino said. Wall Street brokers have found trading big blocks for the asset allocation firms highly profitable. They can ''position'' large blocks of stocks, hedge their risks in the futures markets and charge more than the 5 cents a share ordinarily paid by large investors. On Oct, 17, for instance, a large buy program by Paine Webber Inc. executed for at least one firm using tactical asset allocation helped move the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 80 points, traders said.
Paine Webber has declined to comment on that transaction. But according to market sources, the firm agreed to execute the buy program as long as the money manager was willing to agree in advance that he would buy the stocks at the mean price for the day, instead of at the broker's actual purchase price or the closing price.
In such an arrangement, the broker takes as profit any difference between what the firm originally pays for the securities and the mean prices over the entire day. If prices fall, there might be less profit on the stock portion of the trade, but the broker would earn an additional return from his hedged position in the futures market.
Such arrangements have become common in recent years. Some brokers can accommodate these customers by hedging in futures, and managers using these computer-driven strategies are willing to pay slightly higher commissions to move large parts of their pension clients' portfolios.
But Mr. Phelan remains disturbed by the power of those using this strategy. In the past, he said, ''the good news is that they were buyers.'' But, he noted, their models could change. ''Then we have to ask, 'What happens if their signal is not buy but sell?' '' he said. ''That will create more problems than index arbitrage.''
Money managers at firms using this strategy concede that if the fundamental characteristics of the economy - interest rates and corporate earnings - begin to weaken, the managers would begin shifting their clients' assets out of stocks. And any simultaneous sell programs would send the stock and stock index futures markets into disarray.
''Any bear market is characterized by a consensus that fundamentals are deteriorating,'' Mr. Petrino said. ''And if the fundamentals are deteriorating, why shouldn't you sell?''

HEADLINE: Stocks Up on Signs That Fed Eased Policy

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose broadly yesterday, on signs that the Federal Reserve had eased its monetary policy.
The Federal funds rate - the rate the central bank most closely controls - fell to 8 3/8 percent yesterday, a 12-month low.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 26.23 points, or exactly 1 percent, to 2,623.36.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded declines by about 5 to 2, with 1,091 issues up in price and 418 lower. 
Federal funds are considered the basic cost of credit because that is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board added reserves to the banking system and thus lowered the Federal funds rate, which was widely interpreted as an indirect effort by the Fed to ease monetary policy.
The Southwestern Bank of St. Louis, yesterday lowered its prime lending rate to 10 percent from 10 1/2 percent.
 
Big Board Volume Expands
Volume on the Big Board expanded to 170.2 million shares, from 163 million on Tuesday.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.34 points, to 338.15, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 1.74 points, to 187.48.
''Although market breadth was fairly good, the real strength was concentrated among interest-sensitive, defensive issues such as money center banks, insurers, soft drink and drug stocks,'' said Edward P. Nicoski, market strategist at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Mineapolis.
J.P. Morgan, rose 1 7/8, to 43 1/2; American International Group 1 3/4, to 107 1/8; Schering-Plough 2 3/4, to 78 1/2, and Coca-Cola 2 1/4, to 74 1/2.
''Many economic-sensitive issues, however, failed to respond such as the steels, chemicals, papers and large capitalized technology stocks,'' he said.
Bethlehem Steel dropped 1/8, to 15 1/2; Dow Chemical 1/2, to 92 7/8; Weyerhaeuser 1/4, to 26 1/4, and Digital Equipment 1 1/2, to 87.
 
Yesterday's Movement in Dow
Yesterday's Dow gain, combined with the 14.96-point rise on Tuesday, recaptured almost all of the average's 47.34 loss on Monday. The Dow was up about 16 points after the first hour of trading, 24 points about 11 A.M.; nearly 29 points at noon; about 36 points at 12:30 P.M., where it hovered for the next two hours, before sliding to the close.
UAL jumped 5 1/4, to 185, after a report in The Wall Street Journal that the company's chairman, Stephen Wolf, has been cleared to explore possible transactions, like a buyout or recapitalization, for the carrier, traders said. Arbitragers said this indicated that the parent of United Airlines was headed for some kind of deal.
The jump in the price of UAL helped lift the Dow transportation index to a 10.85-point gain and a close of 1,199.15. Other airlines were narrowly mixed, with AMR, the parent of American Airlines rising 3/4, to 72; Delta Air Lines up 5/8, to 65; USAir unchanged at 35 1/4, and Pan Am off 1/8, to 3 1/8.
Wyse Technology was the most active Big Board issue, slipping 1/8, to 9 3/8, on a volume of more than 3.6 million shares. The company said it was in discussions with an undisclosed third party regarding the potential acquisition of the company at $10 a share.
Woolworth slipped 1 1/8, to 58 1/4. The company reported that its third-quarter operating profits rose 12 percent over the 1988 three months but that operating profits for general merchandise did not change from the $53 million a year earlier.
Warner Communications rose 1 point, to 63 1/8. The Tonka Corporation said it had agreed to acquire toy and game license rights for Batman products from Warner Brothers Inc., a subsidiary of Warner.

HEADLINE: St. Louis Bank Sets 10% Prime

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Southwest Bank of St. Louis, often a bellwether on interest rate trends, said yesterday that it would lower its prime lending rate to 10 percent from 10 1/2 percent, effective Thursday. The move followed signs that the Federal Reserve is pushing down short-term interest rates. 
The prime rate, once a key corporate lending rate, is more commonly used now as a peg for consumer loan rates.
Southwest's cut was duplicated late in the day by the First Federal Savings Bank of Boston.
If the prime rate cut is followed by other major banks, it would be the first reduction in the rate since July, when banks lowered it to 10 1/2 percent from 11 percent previously. That move was led by the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which lowered its prime on July 10.
Other banks followed suit at the end of the month.
No leading banks immediately followed Southwest's lead yesterday. Spokesmen for Citibank, Chase Manhattan and Morgan Guaranty, all of New York, and the San Francisco-based BankAmerica said they had no immediate announcements on their prime rates.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Up Modestly While Gold Also Advances

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose modestly against most currencies yesterday, showing resilience despite widespread expectations that interest rates will fall.
Gold prices also rose. In New York, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid for gold at 4 P.M. of $387.50 an ounce, up from $384.75 late Tuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for current delivery closed at $388.80 an ounce, up from $386.20 on Tuesday. 
Currency traders said the dollar showed fundamental strength despite a perception in the market that the Federal Reserve is relaxing its credit policy, which is likely to encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress the dollar's value.
 
Fed Injection of Funds
That perception was fueled by the Fed's action in the bond market on Monday and Tuesday, when it unexpectedly injected several billion dollars of reserves.
''The dollar is basically absorbing the lower interest-rate scenario rather well,'' said Robert Hatcher, a vice president of corporate trading at the New York office of Barclays Bank P.L.C. ''It's hanging in there.''
He said traders were looking toward a report on wholesale price inflation in October, due out today, for further signs of an economic slowdown. Such indications could spur the Fed to ease credit further.
In Tokyo, where trading ends before the business day begins in Europe, the dollar fell to a close of 142.97 Japanese yen, from 143.63 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar declined further, to 142.73 yen. But in trading in New York, the dollar recovered and finished at 143.18 yen, up from 142.95 yen late Tuesday.
 
British Pound Rises
The British pound rose in London to $1.5860, from $1.5810 late Tuesday. Later, in New York, the pound fetched $1.5885, up from $1.5865 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.8445 West German marks, up from 1.8430; 1.6168 Swiss francs, up from 1.6165; 6.2515 French francs, up from 6.2470; 1,347.25 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00, and 1.1698 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712.
Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid of $384.75 an ounce, up from $384.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold was unchanged from Tuesday, closing at a bid of $384.00.
Silver bullion slipped in London to a late bid price of $5.25 an ounce, from $5.26 on Tuesday. On the Comex, silver contracts for current delivery closed at $5.295 an ounce, up from $5.265.

HEADLINE: AQUINO SEEKS AID FROM U.S. BUSINESS

BYLINE: By RICHARD HALLORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines met with President Bush, senior Administration officials and Congressional leaders today as she sought to encourage American investment in and American imports from her island nation.
During a welcoming ceremony at the White House, President Bush took note of Mrs. Aquino's objective. ''You deserve our help, and you will get it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I pledge our continuing assistance to your Government, and that means security assistance as well as aid to economic development.'' 
Mrs. Aquino focused on economic issues, ''particularly the means by which the Philippines and the United States can cooperate in more areas to our mutual economic benefit.'' She did not mention the future of American military bases in the Philippines, which has become an increasingly contentious issue.
 
No Public Stand on Bases
Filipino nationalists have demanded that the United States evacuate the bases or grant greater Philippine sovereignty over them. So far, Mrs. Aquino has declined to take a public stand on the issue.
Negotiations over the emotional issue are to begin next month. The Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base are the principal United States military installations in Southeast Asia and among the largest outside the United States. They are important links to American deployments to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.
When Mrs. Aquino was last here three years ago, she received an enthusiatic welcome after taking over from Ferdinand E. Marcos. Since then, her Government is generally considered to have made progress in restoring democracy and some advances in fighting a leftist insurgency, but it has been less successful in developing the economy and in improving basic services to the poor, who constitute the majority of the population.
American officials and others asserted that the situation in the Philippines is still fragile.
 
Doubts About Her Leadership
''Questions have been raised about the President's leadership and vision, about the effectiveness and honesty of her government, and about the depth of its commitment to human rights and socio-economic reform,'' said David G. Timberman, a New York specialist on the Philippines, in a report this week.
In their talks at the White House, Mrs. Aquino pressed President Bush for greater Philippine access to the American market, help in debt relief and added investment, said Richard Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs.
In addition to Mr. Bush, the Philippine President met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady.
Mrs. Aquino is scheduled to meet with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney on Friday to discuss the bases. She is also scheduled to have breakfast with Vice President Dan Quayle.
While Mrs. Aquino was meeting with Mr. Bush, her Finance Minister, Vicente R. Jayme, signed three loan agreements at the World Bank that will provide the Philippines with $175 million for projects in health, water supply and industrial investment.
President Aquino plans to leave Washington on Friday afternoon for Dallas, where her hosts will be executives of the J. C. Penney company, which has been an importer of goods from the Philippines. On Sunday, she will be in Los Angeles before flying back to Manila.
 
Ahead, but Still Behind
Since Mrs. Aquino has been in office, foreign investment has risen to $936 million in 1988 from $127 million in 1986, according to the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Timberman calculated that American direct investment followed the same trend, rising to $157 million last year.
But he pointed out that foreign investment in Thailand and Indonesia, two of the Philippine's neighbors, ran to $6.2 billion and $4.4 billion last year, suggesting that there was vast room for growth in the Philippines.
Americans remain the largest investors in the Philippines, with about $1.3 billion invested there. But money being invested in the Philippines from Hong Kong, which is due to be taken over by China in 1997, and from Taiwan and Japan has risen faster than that from the United States in recent years.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Journal;
From the U.S. Envoy, Salvos of 'Friendly Advice'

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Japan and the United States may be engaged in economic warfare, but why do Japanese newspapers always use battlefield imagery to describe their relationship? At least that was what Ambassador Michael H. Armacost wanted to know recently at the Japan National Press Club.
''Choice of language is worth attention,'' Mr. Armacost told the Japanese reporters, mentioning the use of the words ''war,'' ''attack'' and ''counterattack'' in several recent economic articles. ''I urge you to search for some new metaphors.''
Six months after arriving in Tokyo, Mr. Armacost is giving out a lot of what he terms ''friendly advice'' these days, something almost unheard of for the diplomat holding one of America's most delicate and difficult ambassadorial posts. 
Indeed, for more than a decade, Mr. Armacost's predecessor, Mike Mansfield, was well known for making few pronouncements that aroused controversy, instead repeating that Japan and the United States had to nurture ''the most important bilateral relationship in the world, bar none.''
 
Highly Regarded by Japanese
Mr. Mansfield, a former Senate majority leader, is regarded as something of a saint here, and as a man of extraordinary stature and wisdom. The other evening, Japan's national broadcasting company ran a one-hour television special devoted to his life and reflections upon retirement.
At the same time, he and other officials at the American Embassy drew sharp criticism in recent years from those in Congress who assert that the United States has not pushed Japan hard enough to open up trade and investment barriers.
Mr. Armacost, a former Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs, initially disarmed many critics in Congress when he said that as Ambassador he would fight for access for American products to Japanese markets and view himself as the embassy's senior commercial officer.
Lately, he has said the $50 billion American trade deficit with Japan is ''untenable'' and he has gently but firmly suggested that Japan act to quell American anxieties about its investments in the United States.
''There should be no question, the welcome mat is still out,'' said Mr. Armacost, whose career has been in the Foreign Service. But he added that after the recent purchase of Columbia Pictures by Sony and other deals, American concerns ''are sufficiently widespread that they cannot be ignored.''
 
'People Are Pleased'
In the process, Mr. Armacost has won praise from many quarters previously critical of the American Embassy. By common agreement, he appears to symbolize the evolving notion that economic issues dividing Tokyo and Washington can no longer be subordinated to the need to maintain friendly political ties.
''The signals we're getting are that people are pleased with Armacost,'' said William T. Archey, vice president for international affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''The atmosphere is different, and he is not afraid to say some candid things that haven't been said before.''
The idea that economic issues are now more important than political or security issues is not widely accepted in Japan. But at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, officials say they are happy that Mr. Armacost is speaking forthrightly so that Japanese can understand American thinking.
In an interview, Mr. Armacost said he had no intention of establishing a different style from that of Mr. Mansfield, but he ackowledged that the mood in the United States on trade issues was different now. ''Our trade deficit with Japan has persisted, and American patience has worn a little thin,'' he said. ''I have simply tried to make that point and to inject a sense of urgency into the situation.''
Perhaps more intriguing, Mr. Armacost has not hesitated to wade into the serious philosophical debates raging among Japan specialists abroad, such as the contention of some critics that Japan is culturally unique and somehow incapable of welcoming imports or foreign investment.
In a recent speech, Mr. Armacost said he recognized that many Japanese found such a point of view offensive, but he then noted that Japan itself raises its own ''claims to uniqueness'' to buttress its demand for protection from imports of rice and other materials.
 
On the Local Scene
The Ambassador has also stirred some controversy by throwing himself into the Japanese political scene. He received a great deal of publicity when he met with the chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, Takako Doi, provoking complaints from businessmen that he seemed to be endorsing her leftist views.
Later, the businessmen said they were pleased when Mr. Armacost gave interviews to the Japanese press saying Miss Doi and the Socialists had failed to quell doubts about their longstanding positions, like those calling for renunciation of the security treaty with the United States.
On the subject of investment, he asserted that it was not ''racist'' for Americans to be concerned about Japanese foreign investment, as some Japanese charge. Mr. Armacost said that Japanese investment was large and growing more rapidly than anyone else's and that Americans are understandably worried.
He has told Japan to employ more Americans as managers in their American companies, take part more in local communities, employ more women and minorities and - most important - ''provide equal investment opportunities for U.S. firms wishing to invest in Japan.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
U.S. Worry Rises Over Europe's Stability

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
President Bush hailed East Germany's opening of its borders today as a ''good development,'' but privately his Administration is growing concerned that the postwar European order is coming apart before any new stable structure has been established.
Speaking at an impromptu news conference at the White House after being briefed on the day's developments, Mr. Bush said, ''Of course I welcome the decision by the East German leadership to open the borders to those wishing to emigrate or travel.''
''If it's implemented fully,'' he said, ''it certainly conforms with the Helsinki Accords, which the G.D.R. signed. And if the G.D.R. goes forward now this wall, built in '61, will have very little relevance. It clearly is a good development in terms of human rights.'' 
 
Political System Is Key
The upbeat tone of the President's remarks was in contrast to the deeper concerns in the Administration over the uncertainty of what may happen next in East Germany, in relations between the two Germanys and in Europe as a whole. The entire structure of the postwar European order, which maintained stability for the last 40 years, has been based on a divided Germany.
The key questions now, Administration officials said, is what kind of political system develops in East Germany and whether the country will remain independent or somehow merge eventually with West Germany. East Germans who leave for the West will determine their own future, but those who stay may well determine the future of Europe by the type of state they and their leaders form.
In his public remarks the President seemed to mask any concerns about the rapidity of change in Europe, but those concerns nevertheless came through in his careful answers. When asked whether he saw a danger of events in Central Europe spinning out of control, Mr. Bush said:
''Well, I wouldn't want to say this kind of development makes things move too quickly at all. I'm not going to hypothecate that it may. But we are handling it in a way not to give anybody a hard time. We're saluting those who can move forward with democracy. We are encouraging the concept of a Europe whole and free. And so we just welcome it.''
 
'I'm Very Pleased'
When reporters observed that the President in his initial answers seemed less than elated by the day's events, he responded in a more enthusiastic manner.
''I'm elated,'' he said. ''I'm just not an emotional kind of guy. Oh, I'm very pleased, and I've been very pleased with a lot of other developments.
''I think the United States' part of this, which is not related to this development today particularly, is being handled in a proper fashion, and we'll have some that'll suggest more flamboyant courses of action for this country. We're handling this properly with the allies, staying in close touch trying to enhance reform, both political and economic. The fact that I'm not bubbling over, maybe it's - maybe it's getting along toward evening because I feel very good about it.''
On Capitol Hill, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, struck a more unequivocally enthusiastic note, saying, ''This is an historic event.''
''It can be made even more so,'' he added, ''if the East German Government now acts to tear the wall down. I urge them to do so. Only then will we know that their proposal of today has lasting substance and meaning.''
 
Remarks Are Recalled
The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, also declared ''East Germany should now tear down the Berlin wall'' and ''emulate Poland and Hungary by announcing democratic elections so that the East German people can build a secure future without having to leave their homes.''
In his own way, the President also seemed to encourage East Germans to stay at home and work for reform in their own country instead of flooding to West Germany.
''You may remember that before I went to Poland I was asked by a Polish journalist, if I were a young Pole what would my advice be,'' the President recalled. ''And what I said is I think you ought to stay there and participate in this dramatic change in your country. You ought to feel the surge of freedom, feel the move toward democracy, and be a part of it.
''And these are Germans, and Germans love their country, and at some point I think a lot of Germans who have felt pent in and unable to move are going to say, 'Look, we can move but wouldn't it be better to participate in the reforms that are taking place in our own country?' So I think it's too early to predict that because of this opening that means everybody is going to take off.''
At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a statement that the odds of using military forces from East Germany against the West appeared to be ''significantly lower now than at any time in the postwar period.''
 
'A Revolutionary Situation'
As events in East Germany take unexpected new turns each day, Bush Administration officials say they are discovering that while they have a great deal at stake in the final outcome they are virtually powerless to influence it.
As a result, American policy today consists largely of hoping for stable change, urging all sides to exercise restraint and quietly praying that if there is to be a reassociation of East and West Germany there will be enough time to work out arrangments satisfactory to all the parties in Europe.
''I admit that when all is said and done it is a policy largely of stated desires and rhetoric,'' said a senior Bush Administration policy maker. ''But what would you have us do? What we are dealing with in Eastern Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Soviet Union, is a revolutionary situation. Revolutionary situations have a dynamic of their own.''
Under such conditions, the official added, ''we can watch, applaud, hope and work together as closely as possible with the West Germans.''
''They know how best to deal with their own countrymen,'' he said. ''They can influence events inside East Germany, to the extent that anyone can, through their aid programs and their political parties, but even the West Germans have little influence.''
As events unfold in East Germany, Administration officials feel powerless not only to direct those events in any way but also to discuss any alternative security system for Europe if the postwar order based on a divided Germany becomes obsolete.
 
'Fulfillment of Our Dreams'
''The reason we seem to be so helpless is because what East Germans are demanding is the fulfillment of our dreams, the exercise of our values, and that is something that is inconceivable for us to oppose,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on East-West relations at the Council on Foreign Relations.
''Yet we are dealing with a country, Germany, which if it becomes united and independent transforms the entire strategic landscape in Europe. The Germanys we had fit into an order which despite its injustices and maybe even because of them gave us peace for 40 years. We don't know if a new arrangement for Germany can fit into a stable order.''
Summing up the Administration's quandary, Herbert S. Okun, a former United States Ambassador to East Berlin, remarked: ''We want the East Germans to be free and we want their freedom to come about smoothly and gradually. But as Lenin said, the path to revolution is not smooth or broad, and neither is the path to freedom. It is bumpy and full of turns.
''That simply underscores the fact that we urgently need to replace the present structure that has kept Europe stable with an alternative. We want the East Europeans to be free. The Russians are ready to let it happen slowly, provided their security is not damaged. But we need an understanding soon.''

Hard Fight To Teach 7th Grade Is Over

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Thomas K. Gilhool holds degrees in philosophy, political science and law from Yale. He was a Fulbright Scholar in town planning at the London School of Economics and Political Science. For the last two years, he was the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education.
Mr. Gilhool thinks he is qualified to teach seventh-grade history. But the Superintendent of Schools here was not so sure, and it took a two-week investigation by the Board of Education to set aside the Superintendent's concerns. On Wednesday night the board hired Mr. Gilhool, ending a two-month bureaucratic imbroglio. 
The board's inquiry centered on School Superintendent Constance E. Clayton's concern that her aides may have given Mr. Gilhool's application favorable treatment - in particular, that they had him take a teacher certification test alone in a room away from other applicants.
Mr. Gilhool, who says he had to resign his post as State Education Secretary in June because of ''firestorms'' caused by his efforts to make school boards more accountable and teachers more autonomous, is no neophyte when it comes to the politics of education. But even he was surprised by the obstacles he encountered. ''I am amazed that I had to fight to teach,'' he said.
The 51-year-old Mr. Gilhool, who became a public interest lawyer in the 1960's to enlist in the cause of civil rights, switched to a career in education two years ago in the belief that the best way to achieve racial equality is to improve public education.
He says he decided to leave educational administration for teaching because ''teaching is the most exciting and urgently important profession of our time.'' He will take a drastic cut in pay: from the $55,000 a year he made as a lawyer to the $25,000 that starting teachers earn.
On Wednesday, the school board said there had been ''no breaches of integrity'' on the part of school district staff members who processed Mr. Gilhool's application and administered oral and written tests.
Mr. Gilhool became aware of the obstacles ahead of him on Sept. 27, when school officials pulled him out of a line of newly hired teachers who were selecting schools where they would teach.
''I was given a letter saying that my appointment was put on hold,'' Mr. Gilhool said. ''That was a month and 10 days after I had taken the test, three weeks after I had received an employment letter and 15 minutes before I was to pick a school where I was to start teaching the following Monday.''
The Superintendent was concerned that in August Mr. Gilhool had taken the teacher application test alone in a room apart from 56 other applicants. Mr. Gilhool said he had protested mildly at the time, but the officials insisted on it, saying the presence of a former Education Secretary might distract the other applicants.
He scored third among those taking the test that day. (''I wrote a magnificent essay on teaching; it must have been the orals that knocked me down to third place,'' he said.) No charges were brought against Mr. Gilhool, but the teachers' union filed a grievance on his behalf, saying his career was being delayed unfairly while school officials sorted out their administrative procedures.
The issue appeared to be nearing resolution late last month when the Superintendent's office made an unusual announcement that unspecified disciplinary actions would be brought against six of her aides, who were not identified, on the ground that they had committed ''improprieties'' in connection with Mr. Gilhool's application.
That announcement prompted the school board to begin its own inquiry on Oct. 23 and stop the disciplinary actions. Herman Mattleman, the board president, said the purpose of the inquiry was to ''make sure that the testing, hiring and placement of teachers is consistently applied.''
Two days later, The Philadelphia Inquirer published an editiorial characterizing the Gilhool affair as ''absurd and embarrassing.'' The editorial noted that the school system had no shortage of problems, including poor student achievement scores, deteriorating buildings and a looming deficit, and added, ''But the one that you wouldn't expect to find is the one that is currently preoccupying the School Superintendent and the Board of Education: undue favoritism shown to a V.I.P. who, bless his heart, wants to teach in an inner-city elementary school.''
Meanwhile, the eager teacher-to-be has been passing the time by writing a textbook on education law.

HEADLINE: House Backs $305 Billion Military Bill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
The House approved a $305 billion military programs bill today, but many members complained that Congress had failed to make tough decisions on cutting politically popular weapons programs.
They warned that the legislation would make it even harder to cut the budget next year.
The military programs bill, which calls for cutting money for the ''Star Wars'' missile defense program for the first time, was worked out last week by Congressional negotiators.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 236 to 172. The Senate has not yet taken up the conference legislation but is expected to approve it. 
 
Political Expediency Cited
The legislation sets spending limits for military programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Separate legislation is still required to appropriate the money the Pentagon can spend.
Representative Bill Dickinson of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, criticized the bill as an example of political expediency.
The House ''not only refuses to make tough decisions,'' he said, ''it refuses to pass the buck and let the executive branch make them.'' Despite his criticism, he voted for the bill as the best that could be achieved under the circumstances.
Mr. Dickinson was referring to the House refusal to quickly terminate weapons programs that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had sought to end this year, like the Navy's F-14 fighter, built by the Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, L.I.
''If you do not know where you are going, any road will do,'' he said. ''This conference has no idea where it is taking defense policy.''
The military programs bill calls for money for 18 F-14 planes that the Pentagon did not want. They would cost $66 million each by Mr. Dickinson's estimate. After these planes are built, production of the fighter is to be terminated.
 
Money for Helicopters and V-22
The bill also calls for $195 million for 36 helicopters that the Pentagon did not want to buy and recommends $585 million for the V-22 Osprey plane that Mr. Cheney sought to terminate.
A repeated refrain in the debate in the House today was that the failure of the bill to cancel weapons programs now would only make it more difficult to trim military spending in future years without sacrificing programs to maintain military readiness.
If Congress does not have the political will to cancel weapons programs, some Congressmen contended, they would be forced to turn to other areas of the budget for savings, like operations, maintenance and personnel.
Confronting this criticism, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat, reminded House members that the bill failed to kill programs largely because the House wanted it that way.
The Bush Administration had sought to end 10 weapons programs over the next two years. The House voted to terminate only two of these while the Senate generally accepted the Administration's recommendations, according to a statement by the House Armed Services Committee.
 
Four Unwanted Programs Saved
The compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators, which was approved by the House today, continues four of the 10 programs.
But while Mr. Cheney lost on these counts, the Pentagon largely got its way on spending for strategic nuclear programs. The bill, for example, provides $4.3 billion for the B-2 Stealth bomber, $420 million less than requested by the Defense Department. The budget calls for two B-2 planes, which cost more than $500 million each, to be purchased this year and five more next year.
The military programs bill represents the fifth consecutive year that the budget has gone down after inflation is taken into account. Mr. Aspin said in an interview that the budget will go down again next year, reflecting a perception in the United States of a receding Soviet threat.
''Next year will be the beginning of the Gorbachev driven defense budget,'' said Mr. Aspin, referring to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
The failure to kill programs this year, he said, ''will add to the problem next year. We are just postponing the problem.''

Remorseless Dozing Gets Presidential Nod

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Sometimes, even with all that adrenaline and power pulsating through the White House, you have to close your eyes and grab a few winks. Just for a minute. Just until you catch yourself crashing head-first into the bowl of flowers on the President's coffee table in the Oval Office.
Because the sad truth is, even the nerve center of the Western world can get a little tedious sometimes. So many charts and statistics. So many foreign visitors talking stiffly about good relations. So many bureaucrats droning on about the structural impediments initiative with Japan or the fine print in the Pentagon budget or Representative Dingell's latest reaction to Representative Waxman's latest counterproposal based on Senator Chafee's ideas about the clean air bill. Zzzzzzzzz. 
That's why President Bush has created the annual Brent Scowcroft Award, named for the courtly national security adviser who likes his catnaps.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, is the second winner, following Mr. Scowcroft himself. In their offices both display photographs of themselves, sprawled in sleep on Air Force One, with inscriptions from Mr. Bush congratulating them on their awards. ''The award,'' Mr. Fitzwater explained, ''is given to the person who can go to sleep in the most obvious and seemingly embarrassing of situations without any remorse whatsoever.''
Mr. Fitzwater prefers planes or the office couch. The 64-year-old Mr. Scowcroft, who works 14 hours a day and often jogs at midnight because it is the only time he has free, is a master of public naps.
He can fall asleep anywhere from the Oval Office to state dinners, cleverly masking the respite by striking the pose of ''The Thinker,'' with chin in hand and eyes downcast. But he always wakes up before he topples off the couch and in good time to answer a query from the President.
The only two officials who say they never conk out are the President and the Secretary of State.
Jim Baker glazes, a condition once described by a colleague as ''his eyes coming up peaches and oranges, like a slot machine.'' Mr. Bush does not. His metabolism is on such overdrive that he reminds old Washington hands of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who put on his pajamas every day at 4 P.M. for a nap, but ended up frantically working the phone in his bedroom for an hour.
Mr. Bush genially keeps track of everyone else who nods off. ''He passes out notes that say 'Throw a spitball at the general and wake him up,' '' said one senior adviser.
President Reagan was ribbed for dozing off during a 1982 Vatican meeting with the Pope. White House staff members recall clustering around the television back home, cheering him on to win one for the Napper: ''Hang in there, Dutch, you can do it! Just a few more minutes!''
Military briefers are considered the hardest on those prone to nod off. ''The repetition that is a strength when you are indoctrinating 19-year-olds is a weakness when you're trying to keep 50-year-olds awake,'' says one Administration official.
Once, after some military aides briefed Mr. Reagan and a group of aides with a slide show, the lights came up to find five out of the six, including the President, fast asleep.
The biggest group nap came at the 1987 economic summit meeting in Venice. As the Italian leader read the long final communique, all the other heads of state in the Group of Seven, except Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, snoozed on stage.
Mr. Reagan was admired for his surreptitious nap style. When he awoke midmeeting, he would roll up his eyes, as though he might have had them down on purpose.
One Bush official makes it a habit to turn his desk chair away from the door and toward the window, thus giving the impression to anyone who interrupts that he is perusing papers.
But the most skilled in soporific secrecy was the late spymaster William J. Casey, who napped without letting his head fall forward onto his chest or backwards into that most risky of all positions, ''the whiplash.''
The only faux pas is snoring. ''It's like a Mafioso code of honor,'' explained one Bush adviser. ''We all wake each other up when the snore occurs. We never let things deteriorate to that stage.''

Central Park West Gets Luxury Condominiums

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
Even though the construction of super-luxury condominums has been growing at a rapid clip in Manhattan over the last few years, Central Park West has been glaringly absent from this flurry of activity - despite its obviously appeal to affluent buyers -because virtually no sites have been available for redevelopment.
Now, however, two development partners, David Edelstein and Harry Simpson, are building on one of the few Central Park West sites suited to the purpose, the corner of West 88th Street, where the Progress Club had stood since 1904. Since 1932, the club building had been used by the Walden School. Like all sites on Central Park West, this one offers the opportunity to create apartments with broad views of the park and the city's skyline, an amenity for which many New Yorkers are willing to pay dearly. 
The building is proving to be a success. Though the apartment prices start at $900,000 and rise to $6 million, 21 of the 38 units have been sold since they went on the market in September. The building will not be ready for occupancy until September 1990.
The developers; the architect, Costas Kondylis, and the marketing firm of Gilbert Charles Beylen attribute the rapid sales to factors other than location. One is the concentration on larger, family-sized units with at least two bedrooms. Another is marketing strategy, which focused on the super-rich who, the developers say, cannot always find large, gracious apartments. Such people, they have found, are also far less affected by cyclical changes in the economy.
Thus, even after the stock market crash of 1987 and the subsequent slowing of apartment sales, the team retained the strategy of concentrating on larger units costing $1 million, Mr. Edelstein said.
Another factor contributing to the strong sales in the 24-story building, Mr. Kondylis said, was the decision to combine the advances of contemporary apartment house construction with the qualities buyers seek in elegant prewar cooperatives - nine-foot ceilings, crown moldings, parquet flooring, large marble-paved foyers, separate bedroom wings, servants' quarters and a service entrance, eat-in kitchens and formal dining and living rooms. All those features are offered along with central air-conditioning, large thermopane windows and up-to-the-minute kitchens and bathrooms.
''We also felt there would be a strong demand from people who loved the prewar co-op but did not want to deal with a co-op board,'' said Mr. Edelstein. Many would-be buyers, he noted, dislike disclosing details about their finances to boards and seeking board approvals for changes they want to make in their apartments.
The bulk of the initial buyers are from cooperatives nearby. One attraction has clearly been the chance to make custom interior changes -the sort not easily achieved in an older building. For example, one buyer, the Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, is combining a duplex and two two-bedroom units to produce a mansion-sized, 7,150-square-foot dwelling with seven bedrooms and eight and a half bathrooms at a cost of $7 million. Two others are creating four-bedroom apartments, one with a living room 40 feet by 24 feet, at a cost of $4 million each.
Plans for 279 Central Park West were started about two years ago when Mr. Edelstein and his partners were approached by the trustees of the Walden School to see if they would be interested in purchasing the Progess Club, a five-story Italian palazzo that the school had been using for more than 50 years.
The goals had been an infusion of cash to save the school from financial ruin and modern space within a new structure.
The partners struck a deal with the school that will give Walden a package worth about $10 million. That sum covers the sale of the 37,500-square-foot corner property and a share in the profits from the sale of the units. In addition it will give the school new accommodations encompassing 22,000 square feet in the condo structure. The new space is to be ready for occupancy in March.
It was a good deal for the developers, too, since as much as 24 stories could be built without any special zoning change. Even so, neighbors initially protested, believing that the original classical structure on that site - a turn-of-century German-Jewish men's club - should have landmark protection. But the Landmarks Preservation Commission decided the building was not sufficiently significant, in part because the cornice had been removed 15 years ago for the addition of another floor.
Nevertheless, the new building tries to create a sort of instant landmark by emulating the decorative limestone and tan brick facades that are traditional along Central Park West.
The units range in size from 1,800 to 4,000 square feet. Parking will be available for residents beneath the building.

HEADLINE: Setback for Yonkers

 BODY:
More than anything, the city of Yonkers, N.Y., needs to put a divisive housing desegregation controversy behind it and deal with pressing issues of economic development, crime and drugs. Yet on Tuesday, the city's voters elected a new Mayor and City Council that are likely to continue the housing distraction. That creates a new challenge for outside officials like Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Westchester County Executive, Andrew O'Rourke. 
In 1985, Federal District Judge Leonard Sand ruled that Yonkers had deliberately promoted segregation in housing and schools for nearly 40 years. That judgment was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. A voluntary desegregation plan has been instituted in the schools, but the city has nearly self-destructed over a housing remedy.
In January 1988, a majority of the City Council approved a consent judgment that promised 200 low-income housing units in mostly white areas. But by August, mounting public opposition caused the Council, by a 4-to-3 vote, to refuse any meaningful action. Judge Sand responded with crippling fines against the city. Two switched votes fended off bankruptcy, but continued foot-dragging has prevented any real progress. This week's election became a referendum on the housing issue, with Henry Spallone, one of the most defiant Council members, soundly defeating the Democratic incumbent, Nicholas Wasicsko, who was often a lonely proponent of compliance.
In addition to Mr. Spallone, three Council winners, all Republican, oppose the housing order. Three other apparent Council winners, a Democrat and two Republicans, would go along with it.
The potential split puts an added burden on higher-level officials. Mr. Cuomo has a task force working to promote a settlement. But he could be more assertive in trying to persuade Yonkers citizens to obey the law. Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican who began his political career in Yonkers, distanced himself from the controversy last year - a clear abdication of leadership.
Mr. Spallone owes his election only to his exploitation of voters' irrational fears. He has not shown any capacity for bringing statesmanship, or even common sense, to an issue that still creates the potential for enormous harm in his community. It's up to higher officials like Mr. Cuomo and Mr. O'Rourke to fill the void.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Post 0.4% Gain

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Further evidence of subdued inflation emerged today as the Government reported a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods in October and no increase at all for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production.
Although the finished-goods index rose a bit more than expected, most analysts considered the overall report encouraging and likely to reassure the Federal Reserve that inflation risks are minimal. This week the Fed has acted to bring down interest rates.
''The Fed's recent credit-easing actions are consistent with the view that inflationary pressures in the economy are being successfully managed,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members pay the producer prices. The October figures confirm that analysis, he said, adding that the data indicate stability in inflation into early 1990. 
 
Core Rate of Inflation
Economists were impressed not only by the unchanged prices for intermediate and crude goods, but also by the sharp deceleration, to a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent, in the finished goods index when the erratic food and energy components are excluded. The October performance followed two months in which this so-called core rate of inflation averaged six-tenths of 1 percent.
Other economists, however, were somewhat less optimistic. John E. Barnds, first vice president and economist at the National Bank of Detroit, called today's report ''a mild positive'' but cautioned against assuming that inflation posed no immediate concern.
''You still have to look at the year-over-year numbers,'' he said, which now show finished goods have climbed 4.9 percent since October 1988 and at a 5.2 percent annual rate for the first 10 months of this year.
Indeed, added Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''producer price inflation is actually higher now'' than a year ago even as economic growth has slowed to an annual rate of perhaps 2.5 percent from more than 4 percent. ''The Fed's effort to slow economic growth has reduced employment opportunities but not inflation,'' Mr. Hunter said.
 
Big Jump in Food Prices
In broadest outline, the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the finished-goods index last month reflected a 1.4 percent jump in food prices - the biggest in nearly two years - that was substantially offset by a 1.4 percent decline for passenger cars. Energy prices rose a scant two-tenths of 1 percent, after soaring 6.5 percent in September and helping push that month's overall finished-goods index up by nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Prices of fresh and dried vegetables jumped 18.9 percent in October, a bit more than they fell in September, and fresh fruits climbed 4.9 percent. Pork rose 9.5 percent and dairy product prices accelerated 2.8 percent, but beef and veal prices eased, as did those of chickens, coffee and shortening, the report showed.
Much of the rise in vegetable prices was because of poor weather in Florida and California, analysts said.
Passenger cars, reflecting the introduction into the sample of 1990 models, rose 8.3 percent before seasonal adjustment but fell 1.4 percent after adjustment. The seasonal adjustment factor for October included $180.74 for the value of quality improvements, 26 percent of the average $694.54 increase in auto prices.
 
Energy Costs Stabilize
The negligible two-tenths of 1 percent rise in finished energy goods reflected a downturn in prices for home heating oil and natural gas, and moderating increases in gasoline prices, which were up 2.3 percent after jumping 10.6 percent in September.
Among capital goods, which posted an overall three-tenths of 1 percent decline in price, increases slowed markedly for trucks, while prices turned down for printing equipment and agricultural machinery. Prices rose for metal-cutting machine tools and photographic, communications and electromedical equipment.
Among intermediate goods, where aggregate price stability followed a four-tenths of 1 percent rise in September, there were further declines for several manufacturing materials that balanced increases for some construction materials. The price of plywood soared 9 percent, the biggest monthly increase since April 1974, to bring the advance over the last 12 months to 22.1 percent.
A four-tenths of 1 percent decline for nondurable manufacturing materials was the fifth straight drop, and durable manufacturing goods, after an upturn in September, resumed the decline begun last spring. Prices fell for copper, brass and aluminum mill shapes, but rose modestly for primary copper, the Labor Department's report showed.
 
Electricity Price Falls
All major petroleum fuels rose somewhat, but the intermediate energy index edged down because of a 1.9 percent drop in the index for electric power.
Crude goods, which swing by large amounts from month to month, were unchanged in price after a 1.1 percent rise in September and a 1.9 percent decline in August. Energy rose more slowly. Crude materials excluding food and energy rose the same three-tenths of 1 percent as in September, and foods continued to fall.
Substantial price increases were posted for softwood logs and copper base scrap, while ferrous scrap and leaf tobacco fell sharply. Chicken prices dropped 18.2 percent and soybeans dropped 10 percent.

Budget Woe Goes Beyond Gimmicks

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AS Washington's current battle of the budget demonstrates, more than a month into the new fiscal year, the effort to stay under the Gramm-Rudman deficit ceiling has worsened public confusion and increased the use of budget gimmicks. For instance, Government payments are shifted to a different fiscal year or goods are paid for not in cash but through certificates or by pushing outlays ''off budget.''
This has been a longstanding problem. Twenty-two years ago, the Presidential Commission on Budget Concepts, in recommending a unified Federal budget as a basis for the nation's financial planning, warned against overconcentration on a single number - the budget surplus or deficit. Such overconcentration, the commission said, ''has been a root cause of public confusion and has been responsible for accusations of gimmickry. 
But eliminating gimmickry is only the start of what needs to be done to clean up the Federal budget process. The General Accounting Office has proposed a plan for overhauling the budget to improve the Government's financial decision-making for both the short and long run. It would retain the unified budget to assure continued disclosure of the Government's total financial operations but would divide the budget into three main components -general, trust and enterprise funds (to cover business-type entities like the Postal Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority), with each of the three components subdivided into operating and capital accounts.
This approach would offer a way to resolve the controversy over whether the Social Security trust fund surpluses, intended to finance the enormous benefits for the postwar baby-boom generation when it retires, should continue to be used to offset the huge operating-budget deficits.
The unified budget deficit is important for planning fiscal and monetary policy, counting everything the Government takes in or borrows and spends. That was the basic reason the Budget Concepts Commission recommended the unified budget in the first place. But the G.A.O. report contends that merging the Social Security surpluses into the total ''leaves the erroneous impression that the structural imbalance in the Government's fiscal affairs is being corrected when, in fact, it is getting worse.''
The chronic United States budget deficit depresses the already low level of national savings. Japan's net public and private saving, which has been averaging 20 percent, has been five times as great as that of the United States, and that difference helps explain Japan's greater rate of investment in new plant and equipment and in research and development, and its much greater investment in foreign real and portfolio assets.
One way of reducing the disparity between United States and Japanese rates of capital formation would be for this country to bring its operating deficit into balance, while allowing the Social Security surpluses to accumulate and thereby make more private savings available for investments.
The G.A.O.'s proposal to divide the general, trust and enterprise budgets into operating and capital components is also meant to end bias against Government outlays that would improve long-term efficiency. But there are great difficulties in defining what should be counted as a capital outlay.
The chronic budget deficit, as Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution observes, ''helped President Reagan achieve the reduction in nondefense activities of the Federal Government that he sought.'' But the times are changing, and a new consensus seems to have emerged - evident, according to many political analysts, in this week's elections -that the role of Government should increase in several areas: combating drugs, improving the environment, modernizing roads, bridges and other public facilities, improving schools and extending health coverage to the uninsured.
In the foreign policy area, with notable hazards and opportunities in Eastern Europe and Latin America, the United States is severely hobbled for lack of funds. ''How can you be a superpower,'' asks Goran Ohlin, a leading Swedish economist, ''when you are out of pocket?''
Further, the budget's almost exclusive focus on current cash transactions means that many costs are greatly understated or ignored. One huge case that has been grabbing headlines is the bill American taxpayers now must pay for resolving the savings and loan crisis - it seems certain to exceed $150 billion and could be more than $300 billion including interest costs.
President Bush says he wants a reconciliation budget bill ''without gimmicks.'' But the problem goes many billions and many years beyond gimmickry. Instead of the partisan maneuvering for position, there is need for a new budget commission - and White House and Congressional action - to deal with the Government's unfinanced obligations and concealed costs, and the nation's unmet needs.

HEADLINE: British Banks Lift Reserves

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Two major British banks put aside money yesterday to protect them against bad third world loans, together adding more than $2 billion to their reserves following similar moves by United States and Canadian banks.
The banks, Lloyds Bank P.L.C. and National Westminster, said their profits would be hurt by the move. 
Lloyds said that it would add 1.2 billion, or $1.9 billion, while NatWest said it would add 575 million, or $908.5 million.
''Economic and political problems have intensified in those countries, and 15 out of 29 countries have stopped paying us interest,'' said Brian Pitman, Lloyds's chief executive.
''The debt situation has deteriorated further in recent months and this increase in provisions reflects our commercial assessment of the situation,'' said Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman.
Lloyds said the latest move means it will report a ''substantial'' loss for 1989, after a profit last year of 952 million, or $1.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Trade Officials to Meet On U.S.-Soviet Accord

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Top commercial officials of the United States and the Soviet Union will meet next week in Washington to begin work on a new trade pact, Administration officials said today. It is to be similar to an agreement nullified by Moscow in 1975, after Congress demanded freer Soviet emigration.
The meeting next Wednesday and Thursday of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Commercial Commission, a body set up in 1972 to foster trade links, comes just two weeks before the Dec. 2 and 3 Mediterranean summit meeting. At the meeting, Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev are expected to discuss closer trade ties. 
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and the Soviet Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, Konstantin F. Katushev, are heading the two delegations, which are likely to set up informal working groups on the trade agreement, American officials said.
 
Better Tariff Treatment
Such an agreement could bring about normal economic relations between the two superpowers, not only ending a half-century of trade discrimination but also setting a framework for expanded investment and technology transfers.
The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which Moscow cited in aborting the earlier trade agreement, bars most-favored-nation tariff treatment - generally low tariffs - to countries that deny freedom to emigrate.
Responding to Mr. Gorbachev's reforms, including more liberal emigration, President Bush announced last May that he would ask Congress for a waiver under Jackson-Vanik for the Soviet Union.
But he set two conditions: Moscow must put its more liberal policies into law, and there must be a period to monitor how well the law is carried out.
According to reports from Moscow, an emigration law is expected to clear the Supreme Soviet by the end of this month.
John P. Hardt, Soviet affairs specialist at the Library of Congress, said he expects formal negotiations on a trade agreement to get under way after the summit meeting, and that by the time of the leaders' next meeting, probably in mid-1990, the President could submit a trade agreement to Congress.
Under Jackson-Vanik, no tariffs can be cut until a trade agreement is approved by Congress. Tariffs on Soviet goods are generally five to 10 times higher than on imports from most other countries.
The approval process could pit the Administration against chiefly conservative critics, like the Center for Security Policy, a Washington research institute, who still see the Soviet Union as a military and strategic menace.
 
Priority Issue
Normal treatment is high in the list of Soviet demands mainly because it would end the country's status as an economic pariah. Mr. Gorbachev has often spoken of his desire to integrate the Soviet Union into the global economic community.
Current two-way trade between the two countries is about $3 billion a year, most of which represents American agricultural exports. Without agriculture, the flows are about equivalent to American trade with Haiti.
The agreement the United States and the Soviet Union concluded in the 1970's called for elimination of discriminatory trade restrictions and included provisions for settling the Soviet Union's World War II lend-lease debt of $674 million.

Why Japan Likes Lower U.S. Rates

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:

FOR most of 1989, the Japanese stock market has been a laggard, a sharp reversal from the leading role it played for much of the 1980's. But it was Japan that stemmed the tide of the mini-crash that rocked most world markets in mid-October, and this week it was Japan that reacted most enthusiastically when the Federal Reserve seemed to signal it wanted to ease credit.
As a result, yesterday's rise of 61.83 points, to 35,657.42, in the Nikkei 225, the most widely watched index of Japanese stocks, left the average just 32 points, or 0.09 percent, below the record it set on Sept. 28. The Dow Jones industrial average, by contrast, remains 6.7 percent below its record, set on Oct. 9. 
''People have been hoping the Fed will ease, and that that will weaken the dollar,'' said Lawrence S. Prager, an American who this summer was promoted to chief fundamental analyst and strategist at Nikko Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.
To the Japanese, such a course holds out the possibility of easing two problems that have faced the Japanese market. Interest rates have been pushed up, in Tokyo as well as in much of Europe, to fight the dollar's strength and to stem inflation rates that seem high by their standards. ''This could gradually develop room for the Bank of Japan to ease and let interest rates fall,'' Mr. Prager said.
The Fed's easing on Tuesday, signaling that it was willing to allow the Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend money to each other - to fall from 8 3/4 percent to 8 1/2 percent, got a hesitant response that day in the American stock market. The Dow rose almost 15 points, but both the over-the-counter market and the American Stock Exchange saw more stocks fall than rise in price.
But in Japan on Wednesday, share prices rose rapidly, with the Nikkei average surging 325 points, or almost 1 percent, and the American market joined in the party later the same day, as the Dow rose 26 points in a rally that was broader than any since the Oct. 19 slump. The advance slowed in Tokyo yesterday, and prices fell in New York.
Whether the Japanese market can keep climbing depends in part on whether the American easing of interest rates really does help bring down the dollar. The yen rallied a bit just after the Fed move but then gave up much of its gains. The worry over relatively high interest rates - 10-year Japanese bonds now yield 5.6 percent and savers can get 6.7 percent on three-month bank certificates of deposit - is widely viewed as being one reason that stock prices fell in early October, before the drop began in the United States.
Those rates are not high by American standards, but the spread between Japanese and United States Government bond yields - about 2.3 percentage points - is the lowest since 1986. If an even narrower spread is needed to bring down the dollar, the Japanese would much rather see that come from lower American rates than from higher Japanese ones.
Foreign investors have generally stayed away from the Japanese market this year, reflecting concerns about the poor performance of the market, as well as about the high price-earnings ratios in Japan - often two or three times what they are in Europe or the United States. And some of those earnings, as William L. Clauss, a market strategist with Banca della Svizzera Italiana, notes, include gains from stock speculation. ''If the market goes down,'' he said yesterday, ''corporate profits will follow.''
The Nikkei is up a respectable 18.2 percent this year, in yen terms, but after adjusting for the rise of the dollar, the index is up just 4.8 percent. By contrast, the Dow is up 20.1 percent.
After becoming net buyers of Japanese shares in late 1988, as the dollar was falling, the foreign institutions kept up their purchases only through February. They then began selling shares, according to Japanese Government figures, reaching a peak net sale of about $3.4 billion in June. Although foreigners were net buyers in August, they returned to selling in September.
Since the end of June, the Nikkei average has marginally outperformed the Dow, but that gain has been small consolation for many American portfolio managers who own Japanese stocks. The big export-oriented companies have generally not done that well this year as Japanese investors focused on smaller companies and on ones that could cash in on the consumer boom.
The Japanese savings rate remains high, but more and more consumers are borrowing as they seek to enjoy luxuries befitting their wealth. Outstanding Japanese consumer debt for purchases of goods and services was about 16 trillion yen ($115 billion) at the end of 1986. Less than three years later, it is more than 65 trillion yen ($450 billion).

Treasury Sells $10 Billion of Notes

BYLINE: By KENNETH GILPIN

 BODY:
Securities dealers yesterday placed bids on $10 billion worth of new three-year Treasury notes as prices of most notes and bonds ended the day lower in fairly light trading.
Yesterday's auction of the three-year issue was highlighted by large bids from Japanese securities firms.
According to officials at those firms, the Japanese placed bids on a little more than 40 percent of the issue.
''If you are looking at major markets around the world, the United States is the only major country where there is some prospect of a central bank easing monetary policy,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''On that basis, you should be buying short-term maturities.'' 
 
Concern Expressed
Some dealers expressed concern that the bidding from Japan at yesterday's auctions might bode ill for upcoming sales of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Mr. Brachfeld rejected that notion. ''There will be Japanese interest in all the auctions,'' he said. ''There always is.''
For the most part, traders said the slight dip in prices was a defensive reaction to a move by the Federal Reserve Board to drain reserves from the banking system when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 8 3/8 percent.
The funds rate fell to that level on Wednesday, prompting some analysts to speculate that the Fed, which on Tuesday clearly indicated it wanted the funds rate to drop a notch, may have sanctioned a decline in the rate to below 8.50 percent. The Fed's action yesterday more or less scotched that notion.
''The draining move was a pretty clear rate protest,'' from the Fed, one government bond trader said.
 
Fed Funds Trade at 8 3/8%
Nevertheless, after the Fed's move the funds rate continued to trade at 8 3/8 percent, and was quoted at that level late yesterday.
In addition to the Fed's move, market participants said yesterday's report on producer prices spurred some selling because it showed that measure of inflation rose by four-tenths of a percentage point last month, a bit higher than anticipated.
At the three-year note auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 7.77 percent, the lowest level since the auction of Feb. 2, 1988, and well below the 7.93 percent average yield at the last three-year note auction on Aug. 8.
The refunding auctions continue today with the sale of $10 billion worth of 36-day cash management notes, and wind up early next week, when $10 billion of 10-year notes and $10 billion of 30-year bonds will be sold on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
Late yesterday, the 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.86 percent, up from 7.82 percent late Wednesday. 30-Year Bond at 7.89% Meanwhile, the 30-year bond was offered at a price to yield 7.89 percent in when-issued trading, compared with 7.88 percent late Wednesday.
In the secondary Treasury market, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 102 5/8 late yesterday, down 5/32, to yield 7.89 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 22/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 23/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.78 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher in reaction to the Fed's draining move. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.68 percent, up three basis points, or hundredths of a point. And six-month bill rates rose by nine basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.56 percent.
 
Texaco Offers Notes
Elsewhere, a number of corporate issuers priced more than $1 billion in new issues yesterday. Among the issuers was Texaco Inc., which made its first offering since the company went into bankruptcy in April 1987.
The company, which emerged from bankruptcy a year later, after its battle with the Pennzoil Company over Getty Oil was completed, offered $400 million worth of seven-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 9 percent notes were priced at par, or 1.15 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent seven-year Treasury notes. The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Other issuers included New Jersey Bell, which sold $150 million worth of 40-year debentures through a syndciate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, and Citicorp, which sold $200 million worth of five-year notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The New Jersey Bell issue, which carries a final maturity of Nov. 15, 2029, includes a ''put'' at par in the 10th year. The 7.85 percent debentures were priced at 99.75, to yield 7.887 percent, 7.5 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and S.&P.
The 8 5/8 percent Citicorp notes, which mature Nov. 15, 1994, were priced at 99.77 to yield 8.683 percent, 93 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/4 percent Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the narrowest and broadest measures of the nation's money supply M-1 and M-3, fell during the week ended Oct. 30. The third measure, M-2, rose by $3.1 billion. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Higher While Gold Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most major currencies, except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold fell to $387.10, from $388.80 the day before. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for gold of $386.30 an ounce at 4 P.M., down from $387.50 late Wednesday. 
Dealers said the dollar had little reaction to a larger-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent rise in United States wholesale prices in October. Analysts had expected an increase in the Producer Price Index of two-tenths of a percent.
''You saw most of the market reaction rather subdued to the Producer Price Index report,'' said David Ethridge, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''It wasn't a shock.''
Currency traders said the dollar remained strong despite the market's perception that the Federal Reserve is easing its credit policy, which will likely encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress the dollar's value.
 
Factor in Dollar-Yen Trading
The key factor pushing down the dollar against the yen was the selling between other currencies, said Keith Raphael, an assistant vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
He said the yen rose against the West German mark and also gained ground against the dollar in the morning. The selloff ran out of steam when the dollar hit 142.25 yen and traders bought dollars in an afternoon rally, traders said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.70 Japanese yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar rose to 142.85 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 143.13, down from 143.18 late Wednesday.
Mr. Raphael said the dollar rose against the British pound because the Bank of England expressed concern that pressure to increase wages could lead to a recession.
In London, the British pound edged up to $1.5863, from $1.5860 late Wednesday. Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.5823, less than $1.5885 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8523 West German marks, up from 1.8445; 1.6250 Swiss francs, up from 1.6168; 6.2810 French francs, up from 6.2515; 1,354.25 Italian lire, up from 1,347.25, and 1.1670 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.
Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late Wednesday, included: 1.8475 West German marks, up from 1.8450; 1.6212 Swiss francs, up from 1.6170; 6.2545 French francs, up from 6.2510; 2.0815 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0805; 1,351.50 Italian lire, up from 1,349.50, and 1.1675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1695.
Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid of $386.25 an ounce, from $384.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $387.30, from $384 late Wednesday.

Labor Conditions in Chile Keep Copper Prices Rising

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper prices continued to surge yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York amid investor concerns about labor conditions in Chile.
On other markets, grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher, energy and sugar futures were higher and gold was off while silver gained.
Copper settled 0.70 cent to 1.35 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in November at $1.1640 a pound. 
Miners at Chile's four largest mines have voted to strike if the Chilean Government adopts a law that would reorganize the state-owned Chile Copper Corporation. The proposal would give members of the military Government power over mine operations after the Government leaves office, and it would reduce the power of unions.
Helping to spur prices was the perception that the metal had been oversold in recent weeks because of settlement of labor disputes in Canada and Mexico, said Don Tierney, an analyst for Stanley Bell & Company in New York.
Expectations that a report scheduled to be released on Monday about stocks in warehouses approved by the London Metal Exchange would show a decline also helped prices, as did prospects that interest rates were going down, which would increase demand, Mr. Tierney said.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans were higher in quiet trading. Corn and soybean trading was subdued, as investors waited for the Agriculture Department's latest crop report to be released.
The report, issued after trading closed, estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up by 54 percent from last year's drought-shriveled crop. The estimate was up by 2 percent from prospects a month ago, when the department estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels.
Wheat prices were forced lower because of less export business, although some support was received from the National Weather Service's forcast for the next 6 to 10 days, which called for dry weather in winter-wheat crop areas.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST: UNITED STATES;
U.S. ENTHUSIASTIC, BUT HAS CONCERNS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Like the rest of the world, Washington is scrambling to keep pace with the changes unfolding by the hour in Eastern Europe. But in contrast with the pivotal role the United States played 40 years ago in shaping the postwar European order that now seems to be coming apart, Washington finds itself more of a bystander - astonished, enthusiastic and concerned.
Twice in the last 24 hours, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d found himself being slipped notes from aides informing him of major changes in Eastern Europe that only a week earlier no one had imagined, let alone predicted. Officials said a policy review that Mr. Baker ordered three weeks ago on how the United States should relate to changes in East Germany will have to be tossed out and begun anew.
The political changes reverberating across Europe, and the diminished threat of military conflict, also promised to stir new debate in Washington about the need for maintaining a large, expensive American military presence in Western Europe. Moving quickly to deflate such speculation, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cautioned against letting the euphoria of the moment dictate American defense policy. 
But Washington today was mostly a capital energized by a sense of witnessing - and participating in - an epochal moment.
''Someone asked me, 'Weren't you surprised?' '' said Mr. Baker, who ignored the Veterans Day holiday to monitor events from his seventh floor office in the State Department. ''I said, 'Your're darn right and so was everybody else.' So were the East Germans. So were all of our allies. So were the West Germans. If anybody tells you that they knew this was going to happen yesterday they are smoking something.''
''This is a remarkable event,'' added Mr. Baker, who is saving for posterity the typed note which was passed to him at a luncheon on Thursday, informing him of the opening of East Germany's borders.
 
Intervention Seen as Unlikely
Mr. Baker said: ''It is the most significant event in terms of the East-West relationship since the end of the war. There is no question about it. It is really something. You may see some backsliding, even on the part of the Soviet Union, although I remain convinced, I hope not naively, that they are not going to intervene with force. You are not going to see a 1956 again. That is what they tell us privately and now they are saying it publicly.''
Mr. Baker was referring to the Soviet military intervention that crushed the Hungarian revolution in 1956.
In light of the rapid developments in East Germany, American officials now anticipate that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union may try to use his meeting with President Bush next month to discuss the fate of Germany and to press for a dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The two leaders are scheduled to meet Dec. 2 and 3 aboard American and Soviet naval vessels off the coast of Malta in the Mediterranean.
 
Studying Implications
Administration officials made clear today they have no intention of getting into a negotiation with Mr. Gorbachev about the future of Germany, let alone a dissolution of NATO. But following the stunning changes under way in Eastern Europe, American officials are increasingly interested to hear how far Mr. Gorbachev is prepared to let events in East Germany develop and the implications this will have for the East-West security balance in Europe.
One thing is clear, said an Administration European affairs expert: ''This summit will have to address things that no one imagined two weeks ago.''
Adopting a much more enthusiastic posture than he did yesterday about the opening of East Germany's borders, President Bush said: ''The changes in recent months make clear that the process of reform initiated by the Eastern Europeans and supported by Mr. Gorbachev and by America and by our allies is real, offers us all much hope and deserves our continued encouragement. We're living in fascinating times and we will seize every opportunity to contribute to lasting peace and to extend democracy.''
Mr. Bush spoke with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany by telephone for about 20 minutes this afternoon, as the President was touring Texas. The White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted Mr. Kohl as saying that ''this day would not have been possible'' without the United States.
For some of the men who were architects of the postwar order four decades ago, this week's developments were cause for reflection about how America's role in Europe has changed since the United States stepped in to help a devastated Continent recover from the war and resist the threat of Soviet expansion.
Paul H. Nitze, the 82-year-old former arms-control negotiator who was a member of the Truman Administration team that helped to establish NATO and the Marshall Plan at the start of the cold war, discussed the contrast in an interview.
 
'We Have Come Out on Top'
''If you go back 40 years what you see is that we suddenly had pulled ourselves together to follow a very different course in the world from the one we had been following - standing up to the Russians in Europe, establishing NATO and creating the cold war,'' said Mr. Nitze.
''Today, that kind of situation is not called for,'' he added. ''We have come out on top. The situation in Europe is evolving our way and our task is to simply be helpful to that evolution. Events are going on right now with results that cannot be forseen. We know things are going to be different but we are not certain how much better. So maybe we should keep our powder dry. We don't need to be operating every second, but we should be analyzing every second.''
Among the most critical analyses now being undertaken is how these events in East Germany and Bulgaria might affect the Bush-Gorbachev summit talks.
''The Soviets' rhetorical position has been that they would be prepared to see a reunited Germany provided it was neutral and came about in the context of a demilitarized Europe,'' said an Administration European expert. ''That, of course, is a nonstarter for us. The big question for now is whether Gorbachev might propose something that makes more sense, maybe some formal reassociation short of total merger, or political and economic union, but with American and Soviet troops maintaining a certain presence, or some other framework to deal with the security implications. Obviously nothing is going to be decided there. We can't cut any deals. But this summit is going to be enormously significant in determining what the Soviets really want in terms of the German question and overall European security.''
 
Baker Won't Forget the Moment
Secretary Baker said he will never forget the moment when he was informed of the opening of the German borders as he was giving a lunch on Thursday for President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines at the State Department's gilded dining hall yesterday.
''We were sitting there at the table and a note was given to me by our executive secretary,'' recalled Mr. Baker. ''I just told the table and everybody was really, really profoundly moved by it. It said: 'Mr. Secretary, the East German Government has just announced that it is fully opening its borders to the West. The implication from the announcement is full freedom of travel via current East German-West German links bettween borders.' ''
Reflecting on his feelings at the time, Mr. Baker said: ''I am almost 60 and I remember the war, I have a vivid memory of where I was on the day of Pearl Harbor, and I remember vividly where I was on V.E. day and V.J. day. I don't have a specific memory where I was when the wall went up, but I'll never forget this. What is so mind-boggling is the way it happened - an announcement by some deputy press person. You would think if something like this was going to happen it would be some carefully crafted move. This just sort of oozed out and boom! There we are. The most significant event in 40 years. It's a heck of a deal.''

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST: Redefining Europe;
As the Revelry Goes On, Politicians Ponder The Ramifications of Changes in Germany

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, Nov. 10

 BODY:
By the simple act of forcing their Communist rulers to open the Berlin wall and allow them to go wherever they wish, the people of East Germany have irrevocably changed the way Berlin, Germany and all of Europe have defined themselves for more than 40 years.
Thousands and thousands of East Berliners celebrated their triumph today by promenading up and down the elegant, tree-lined shopping boulevards of the western part of the city, which most of them had never before been allowed to see. They made the Kurfurstendamm into a street festival this evening as church bells pealed joyously into the night.
 
'A Different Relationship'
Willy Brandt, who was Mayor of West Berlin when the wall was built in 1961, said at a rally this evening, ''The moving together of the German states is taking shape in reality in a different way than many of us expected.'' 
No one should act as if he knows in which concrete form the people in these two states will find a new relationship. But that they will find a relationship, that they will come together in freedom, that is the important point.''
But the entire postwar European order has been based on the assumption that Germany, and Europe, would remain divided, and the countries of Eastern and Western Europe firmly anchored in their respective alliances.
In that assumption the United States, in the NATO alliance, guaranteed the security of Western Europe. And in that same assumption France, West Germany and the other major industrial countries of Western Europe began the economic and political unification of the European Community.
West German politicians, including Mr. Brandt and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who interrupted an official visit to Poland today to fly to Berlin, all insist that West Germany's commitment to West European integration and the alliance remains.
 
Europe as a 'Haven of Order'
But politicians, diplomats and business leaders all over Europe are considering new implications for both institutions now that the end of German partition is at last imaginable.
''Europe, though Europeans did not always appreciate it, has been a haven of order these past 44 years,'' The Economist wrote today. ''For East Europeans the price of that stability has been high: a lifetime wasted under a government you loathed. For West Europeans the stability has been marvelous. They could get rich, and start to build a new unity, within a clearly defined zone which ended at the river Elbe and the Bohemian forest.''
Now, a NATO diplomat in Brussels said, ''The end of the wall raises questions of what's going to happen in Europe. The whole concept of the European Community now may have to change.''
So would the concept of the NATO alliance, this diplomat conceded: ''Our role will be to design a new role for the alliance - maintaining a balance of stability with the East while all this change is going on.
''There's a reassessment of the Warsaw Pact going on too,'' he said. ''This organization we rejected over the years is beginning to be seen as a possible element of stability in the future, to prevent the Balkanization of Eastern Europe.''
Rudolf Witt, a 32-year-old mechanic from East Berlin who crossed over this afternoon with his wife, Barbara Rieck, and their 4-month-old baby, Susanne, said on his way back home at the Invalidenstrasse crossing point, ''We're the balancing scales of Europe, and we don't want to tip them with something like German reunification.''
An American diplomatic expert on Germany said, ''I think the orderliness of everything that has happened so far, and the great restraint shown by the West Germans, shows that there will be an orderly transition to something else.''
 
Western European Unity
''I think Kohl will make a great big pledge and West German industrialists will start rebuilding'' East Germany, he said. ''But the price will be more political reform than the East German leadership originally intended. If they follow the Polish model, East Germans would have 8 or 10 years to determine whether they wanted to remain a separate country,'' he said.
Such uncertainties have been far from the minds of the European Community politicians who have spent the last three years trying to agree on ways to closer economic and political unity among the 12 existing members.
Chancellor Kohl has been trying to persuade his fellow European leaders to agree to make the Community into a confederation, rather than the loose collection of cooperating sovereign states that is preferred by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
 
Thatcher Seen as Obstacle
Mrs. Thatcher is already regarded by the other leaders in the Community as an obstacle to greater unity among the 12. At full steam only a year ago, momentum toward closer union could falter if much of West Germany's attention in the next few years is diverted to the East. On Wednesday, Mr. Kohl promised a ''completely new dimension'' of economic aid for East Germany if it went ahead with promised political changes.
But even if European integration is sidetracked for the time being, it may acquire a new direction if the peoples of Eastern Europe can go on forcing democratic change in their countries. Nations like Hungary, Poland and perhaps even East Germany could become associate members of an expanded European Community, if not full ones.
The challenge would be to allow them to flourish economically in association with Western Europe without upsetting the security interests of either the United States or the Soviet Union in the process.
Both superpowers, at the moment, look more or less like passive, though benevolent, bystanders as events in Eastern Europe unfold. Moscow no longer seems to see itself as threatened by radical political or economic change in Eastern Europe, and both the United States and the Soviet Union have an interest in achieving substantial cuts in their conventional armed forces on both sides of the German divide.
 
Strategic Bottom Line
What is not so clear is where Moscow's strategic bottom line lies, and what the attitude of the United States - not just the Bush Administration, but Congress as well - will be if many Americans decide the cold war is over and their troops should all come home. There are about 300,000 Army and Air Force troops in Western Europe.
The American attitude is the key to insuring that Germany does not lose its Western orientation and that Europe manages an orderly transition to whatever new future awaits it, many Germans and Western diplomats agree.
''We are at present at the creation of a new postwar era,'' one American official said, ''and I hope the people at home will see it that way.''

As Threat of War Recedes, U.S. and Soviets Face Pressure for Troop Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The political unheaval in Eastern Europe is raising the prospect of change in the military balance in the region, putting pressure on Moscow and Washington to substantially reduce their forces there.
A senior Bush Administration official said this week that he had been informed by a Hungarian official that Hungary's goal was the elimination of Soviet forces there.
And Polish officials reportedly have objected to a Western plan to store substantial quantities of Soviet and American military equipment in their nation as part of a conventional arms accord, believing that such a move could perpetuate the Soviet presence there.
Showing increased political independence from Moscow, some Eastern European officials have privately told American aides that they want to see deep reductions, if not the complete withdrawal, of Soviet forces. 
 
Soviet Troop Cuts Are Reality
With an eye toward events in Eastern Europe and reducing the burden of military spending on its economy, the Soviet Union is already withdrawing a sizable complement of its forces from Eastern Europe. It has indicated a willingness to go much further as part of an emerging agreement on cutting conventional forces in Europe.
The Soviet Union has said publicly that it is willing to disband the Warsaw Pact if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is similarly dissolved, although the proposal has been flatly rejected by Bush Administration officials.
As a result of the Eastern European developments, Pentagon officials assert that the risk of military aggression is at its lowest point since World War II.
''The likelihood is certainly significantly lower now than at any time in the postwar period that military forces from East Germany would be used to move offensively into Western Europe,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a statement. The text was issued after the East German Government announced that it was opening its border to the West.
 
U.S. Fears Pressure on Spending
But while the Pentagon cautiously welcomes the changes in Eastern Europe, it fears that political developments will increase public pressure in the West for reductions in defense spending and in the American military presence in Europe.
''We must not be euphoric,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''We must maintain our own capabilities until we see the kind of fundamental changes that cannot be altered overnight. Any reductions in our military commitment to Europe should be made in our negotiations on conventional and strategic forces. Only after agreements are pursued and signed should any reductions be made.''
The Pentagon's concern about eroding domestic support for military spending appears to be well founded. The bill for 1990 military programs, approved Thursday by the House of Representatives, marks the fifth consecutive year that the defense budget has decreased after inflation is taken into account.
Legislative leaders predict that the political developments in Eastern Europe will encourage Congress to cut defense spending again next year.
''Next year will be the beginning of the Gorbachev-driven defense budget,'' said Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
 
No Deep U.S. Troop Cuts Yet
So far, Congress has not sought to make deep cuts in troops in Europe. The 1990 defense bill would cut 15,000 Army and Air Force troops, the number that Congress says were used to handle the intermediate-range missiles that are being eliminated under the 1987 American-Soviet missile accord.
But if West Europeans respond to events in Eastern Europe by cutting troop strength, pressure will build in Congress to take comparable steps, American lawmakers warn.
By any measure, Moscow has maintained a domineering military presence in Eastern Europe since World War II. About 600,000 Soviet troops are stationed in Eastern European nations. The heaviest concentration of Soviet forces is in East Germany, where Moscow has roughly 380,000 soldiers.
The United States has 305,000 Army and Air Force troops in Western Europe, to which are added the smaller forces of Britain, France and other NATO nations.
 
Surprise Attack More Remote
The unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 men and 5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe - announced in December by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an address at the United Nations - will limit Moscow's capability for surprise attack. It also has given Eastern Europeans an impression that Moscow has begun to consider a more far-reaching withdrawal.
A new East-West conventional arms agreement that is being negotiated in Vienna would require much more of Moscow, erasing the Soviet Union's longstanding advantages in ground forces. The upheaval in Eastern Europe now threatens to outpace the negotiations despite President Bush's goal of achieving an early accord.
To some, the recent developments are nothing but good news. Others are more cautious.
East Germany's Ambassador to Washington, Gerhard Herder, warned today in an appearance at the National Press Club that the situation in his country must be carefully handled by all parties. He said a miscalculation could lead to armed conflict between East German and nearby American, British or French troops.
A senior Pentagon official, while welcoming the change, also sounded a note of caution.
The rapid pace of change in Eastern Europe carries the risk of dangerous instability, he said. And he emphasized that Moscow's concurrent talk of dissolving the Warsaw Pact and NATO alliances was most unwelcome.
''I think they are very much playing the game of trying to drive us out of Europe,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Hartford, Drug Wars May Broaden Concern

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Little more than a mile from the glass skyscrapers of downtown and the gold-leaf dome of the state Capitol, teen-age gangs are locked in what the police say is the city's worst blood feud since the cocaine business took root here.
In the last month, three youths - 15, 16 and 18 years old - have been slain and four others have been shot in drive-by or ambush attacks.
On an island of urban poverty surrounded by well-tended New England industry and affluence, the gang war has highlighted the worlds of rich and poor that coexist at the center of this state's society.
With 138,000 people crammed onto 17.8 square miles - neighboring Bloomfield has 19,500 in 26.4 square miles - Hartford is the core of a metropolis of about 740,000 people who live in dozens of towns and cities. 
 
Waking the Sleeping Giant
In a state with the nation's highest per capita income, Hartford is the nation's fourth poorest city among those with populations over 100,000, the 1980 census says. City officials say the ranking has not changed significantly since the census listing.
Hartford's public schools are about 90 percent black and Puerto Rican; outside the city, the schools are overwhelmingly white. In the city's poorest section, the North End, unemployment is at least 30 percent, according to city officials; in neighboring towns, the rate is under 4 percent, and in several, under 2 percent.
City officials say that making the suburbs - and their 100,000 residents who commute to jobs in Hartford every day - realize their relationship with Hartford's poverty has long been the city's main hope for the future.
The surge of killings, they say, may shock some people into that realization. While the traditions of small town home rule may persist, suburban residents are going to have to accept that the inner city of Hartford is the inner city of the region.
''The bunching up of the killings has been horrible - on the other hand, because of the bunching up, it has awakened the sleeping giant,'' said Hartford's Mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry. ''I see them more willing to listen and say 'maybe there is something more we should be doing.' ''
In a city that depends heavily on big banks and insurance companies for its tax base, questions are also being asked about how much more the city can do by itself.
In the last year, a soft real-estate market has stalled several big office-tower projects in which developers had pledged millions of dollars for subsidized housing and other projects to help the poor.
Since early 1988, the amount of vacant office space - an important measure of downtown vitality - has about doubled, to 13.4 percent in the central business district, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real-estate company.
 
Less Attractive to Business
A spokesman for the state's insurance industry trade association said that changes in technology, higher local and state taxes and transportation problems are making the city less attractive as a place for business to expand.
H. Craig Leroy, president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, said, ''It's becoming more difficult to justify locating in the city of Hartford.''
In the last decade, the city's largest employer, the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, has expanded and moved operations employing 7,000 workers to the nearby communities of Middletown and Windsor. Meanwhile, the company's employment in Hartford has fallen by 2,606, from 11,514 in 1980 to 8,908 this year.
A spokesman for Aetna, Jason Wright, said the company remains committed to Hartford. But he added, ''Hartford is not the city, it's the region.''
 
Bitterness and Resignation
Mayor Perry, who was elected to a second term on Tuesday, said that pressure for a regional identity is coming from the state, which wants to coordinate plans for affordable housing, and from a school integration lawsuit that could result in school districts being merged or coordinated across city lines for the first time. Connecticut has no county governments, which in many states deal with shared regional problems.
For now, Hartford's problems are largely its own. A spokesman for the Hartford police, Sgt. Charles S. Morris, said the wave of violence that began with the shotgun slaying of two gang members in the city's North End on Oct. 13 will almost certainly continue.
Retaliation, including the drive-by shootings of two brothers who were wounded on consecutive days last week, has raised tension, he said.
Sergeant Morris said that the police have identified about 300 gang members and six gangs or posses in the city. But most of the violence has been traced to a core of 25 to 28 ''constantly feuding'' members, he said.
The Albany Avenue Posse, which takes its name from the thoroughfare through Hartford's North End, and the Park Street Posse, centered only a few blocks from the Capitol, have been particularly prone to violence against competitors, he said.
On Adams Street in the North End, where one of the shootings occurred last month, three teen-agers spoke of the shootings with bitterness, but resignation. Greed, vengeance and ready access to firearms have made violence an accepted part of the drug business, they said.
''As long as brothers are selling drugs, they're going to be shooting because people are jealous that they don't have the money and gold and stuff like that,'' said Joe Lindsey, a tall, slim 19-year-old with a heavy gold chain around his neck.
''It ain't going to cool down,'' he said. ''It ain't going to cool down.''

HEADLINE: Koch Resists Ideas Backed By Dinkins

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Mayor Edward I. Koch issued a 10-point warning yesterday about the future of New York City, one that seemed to be directed largely at positions and ideas endorsed by David N. Dinkins, the Mayor-elect.
Having vowed on Wednesday not to criticize his successor for six months, Mayor Koch already seemed to be proposing an agenda against which Mr. Dinkins's performance might be judged - although he preferred to liken his speech to Washington's farewell address to his officers.
''The city's new leaders will be called upon to implement new programs that have tremendous symbolic appeal,'' Mr. Koch told members of the City Club of New York, in his 12th and final talk as mayor to that good-government group, with which he has been at odds more than once.
''They should be careful not to send the wrong signal to the employers and taxpayers who foot the bills,'' the Mayor said. ''They should also be careful not to implement changes that divide the city against itself.'' 
 
Rent Control and Health Benefits
Specifically, Mr. Koch warned against commercial rent control, an all-civilian police complaint review board, legislation to prevent apartment ''warehousing,'' racial set-asides in city hiring and judicial appointments through patronage rather than merit selection.
He urged that the city not reject a home port for Navy ships on Staten Island. He pleaded for caution in adopting more measures to deny city business to companies with ties to South Africa.
Mr. Koch also said the city should not pay health benefits to unmarried partners of municipal employees, unless that arrangement were reached through collective bargaining. He criticized the concept of comparable worth, in which jobs with equal skill, effort and responsibility are paid equally.
And, in what might have been a pointed aside to Mr. Dinkins, who enjoyed considerable union support, Mr. Koch said: ''A mayor cannot sit on both sides of the bargaining table. If he does, it will come back to haunt him and it will make it more difficult to balance the city's budget. The mayor is management.''
In almost every case - with some exceptions like merit selection - Mr. Koch described positions opposite to those taken by Mr. Dinkins. But when he was asked whether he was directing his points to the Mayor-elect, Mr. Koch said, ''Why don't you look at this as the kind of speech that could be delivered at Fraunces Tavern?''
 
'Have Agreed to Disagree'
The Dinkins camp greeted the speech with equanimity. ''Ed Koch never said, nor did David ever presume, that his support in the general election would mean that he would now agree with every position of David Dinkins,'' said David M. Fishlow, a spokesman for Mr. Dinkins.
''David and the Mayor have agreed to disagree on issues and work together on the general-election campaign and the transition,'' Mr. Fishlow said.
Mr. Dinkins favors a form of commercial rent control involving arbitration. Yesterday, Mr. Koch said commercial rent control ''would have a chilling effect on an already cool economy.''
Mr. Koch warned against creating an all-civilian board to investigate complaints against the police, which Mr. Dinkins favors. As it is now, half of the board members are employees of the Police Department. The Mayor said any effort to advance the all-civilian board might result in an ''ugly, divisive referendum.''
In the matter of legislation meant to prevent apartments from being ''warehoused'' - that is, kept off the market - Mr. Koch said the idea was a ''fraud'' in that would make no difference in the city's housing market but would ''send another negative signal to the business community.'' Mr. Dinkins favors anti-warehousing legislation.
Mayor Koch warned about further limiting the business done by the city with companies that have corporate links to South Africa. Mr. Dinkins favors strengthening anti-apartheid measures but Mr. Koch said if too many companies were excluded from city contracts, ''the city might be forced to accept bids that cost millions of dollars more.''
 
'I've Changed My Mind'
The Mayor urged the city not to scrap its agreement to provide a home port for a naval surface action group. Mr. Dinkins is opposed to the home port. ''No one likes the idea of war,'' Mr. Koch said, ''especially a war fought with nuclear weapons. But it's foolish to think we can avoid war by engaging in unilateral disarmament.''
As to the extent to which he and Mr. Dinkins differed, Mr. Koch said, ''I hope he changes his mind as a result of having the responsibility of running the city.''
''When you come in,'' he said, ''and you recognize what the problems are and that the solutions you proposed make no sense, there's nothing wrong with changing your mind. I've changed my mind.''
The audience greeted Mayor Koch warmly, listened attentively and lined up to ask questions afterward, most of which were gentle and respectful.
There was a lot of laughter when Mr. Koch described his dismay at discovering the fallacy of presuming that his wishes would be carried out by the bureaucracy. Civil servants could be unhelpful, he said, and ''they know they're going to be there long after you're dead.''
At the outset of the gathering, at Sardi's restaurant on West 44th Street, Peter Samton, the president of the City Club, made an oblique reference to past battles between club members and the Koch administration when he introduced Sally Goodgold, the chairwoman, as ''someone who can go one-on-one with our special guest.''
Mayor Koch, who was seated next to the lectern, looked up. ''And has, quite successfully,'' he said.
''But not today,'' Ms. Goodgold said.

HEADLINE: Nassau County Proposes to Cut Property Taxes

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Nov. 10

 BODY:
Nassau County, under fierce pressure from homeowners to lower property taxes, proposed today a $1.62 billion budget for next year that would reduce county property taxes by almost 3 percent.
The proposed budget would be 4.3 percent higher than the current one, a sign of the austere times facing county and state governments throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Anger over rising tax bills on Long Island helped oust two incumbent Suffolk County legislators in primary races and two more in the general election on Tuesday, and the furor contributed to showings that were poorer than expected by Republican candidates, who dominate Nassau politics. 
With that message in mind, Nassau officials proposed a fiscal plan that would eliminate 200 vacant positions, from secretaries to groundskeepers, but would maintain health and social services, would call for hiring 61 additional correction officers and would allow a small tax cut. $25 Average Saving The proposed budget ''contains no new initiatives, no fee increases and cuts positions,'' said County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, who was re-elected on Tuesday. He announced the proposed budget at a news conference at his office here.
Under Mr. Gulotta's plan, most homeowners would pay an average of $25 less in county property taxes than last year, lowering the total average bill to $881. The rate would be $12.95 per $100 of assessed valuation.
Another factor could be that the sluggish economy may be picking up. Sales-tax revenues increased 7 percent in the third quarter over the same quarter a year ago, Mr. Gulotta said, leading officials to project a 2.3 percent increase in sales taxes next year.
County taxes account for 22 percent of a homeowner's tax bill, which includes school and town taxes, as well as assessments for services like garbage and water districts.
 
Elimination of 200 Jobs
Mr. Gulotta said his budget offered the small tax cut despite an 11 percent increase from a year ago in costs mandated by the Federal and state governments in areas like as Medicaid and education for handicapped children.
Offsetting the rising costs would be savings, which are to be outlined on Monday, including eliminating the 200 jobs, largely through automation and the merging of responsibilities.
Last year, the county raised property taxes 12 percent, mainly to make up for a loss of $95 million in sales taxes.
Mr. Gulotta's proposed budget would include additional Health Department and social workers, whose salaries the state would partly reimburse. In some cases, Mr. Gulotta said, hiring employees saved money. Adding the correction officers, he said, would cost the county less than the $14 million in overtime it is paying officers this year.
The budget goes to the six-member Board of Supervisors, who have until Dec. 18 to adopt or amend it.

HEADLINE: Little Gold in Coloring Old Films

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10

 BODY:
When color versions of such vintage black-and-white films as ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' and ''Topper'' began appearing on television in 1986, executives in the color-converting business thought they saw a bright new industry emerging.
They calculated that if just 10 percent of the thousands of old movies and TV episodes were converted to color, the converters could rack up more than $1 billion in revenues.
But a combination of high costs and some resistance to tampering with the originals has kept those high expectations from materializing. While the public seems to have accepted the alterations, many Hollywood executives, directors and actors quickly rejected what the industry calls ''colorizing'' as a travesty, and some studios declined to participate.
 
Costs Are High
More fundamentally, the computer technology required, for example, to make the Christmas tree green in ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' took longer to perfect and cost more than expected. 
''If the cost of coloring was $1,000 a minute I'd be a very rich man, but it's not,'' said Patrick C. Byrne, president of Tintoretto Inc., a Toronto-based colorizer. Mr. Byrne said colorizers must often charge the owner of the film, frequently a studio or distributor, $2,500 to $3,000 a minute for a film that runs 100 minutes or more.
One reason for the high cost is that the conversion process is labor-intensive, requiring many highly specialized operators using costly computer equipment.
Color Systems Technology Inc., the first American company in the business, converted many films at a huge loss. Color Systems miscalculated the price it should charge because it ran into unforeseen problems in mastering the new technology. As a result, it has never turned a profit and has amassed $19 million in debt.
 
Stock Down Sharply
If Color Systems, based in suburban Los Angeles with 165 employees, fails to renegotiate with creditors, the company may collapse, analysts say. Color Systems' stock, once at $29.50, closed today at $1.75, down 12 1/2 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
''They've spun into oblivion,'' said David Garcia, an analyst with the Howard, Weil Financial Corporation. ''Color Systems won't be economically viable.''
Colorization Inc., another Toronto-based company, also finds itself in a financial bind. The company is half-owned by Qintex Entertainment Inc., which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in October. Qintex Entertainment, of Los Angeles, is owned in part by the Qintex Group of Australia, which failed in a recent bid to acquire the MGM/UA Communications Company.
Colorization Inc.'s principal client is Qintex Entertainment, which is paying the company to convert episodes of the ''McHale's Navy'' television series to color. With the future of Qintex Entertainment now in question, Colorization Inc.'s prospects are also suddenly clouded.
 
'Mismanagement' Reported
Tintoretto has been in business more than two years but has completed only two films while losing $3 million because of ''mismanagement'' by former executives, said Mr. Byrne, the company's president.
''We suffered from poor art direction,'' said Mr. Byrne, who added that Tintoretto was recovering and negotiating with new customers.
The strongest player in the color-conversion industry, American Film Technologies Inc. of Wayne, Pa., seems to be losing interest in that part of its operations. The company earned $622,000 in the fiscal year 1989 on sales of $11.6 million. It expects to earn $4.5 million to $5 million this year on sales of $20 million.
As a byproduct of its colorizing business, American Film developed a computerized, or ''paperless,'' animation technique that company officials say will ultimately be far more profitable than color conversion. In two to three years, the company said, it hopes to derive 70 percent of its revenues from animation.
''We'll be very satisfied converting eight to ten pictures a month, because we see an upside in paperless animation that quite frankly outweighs coloring motion pictures by a ratio of 50 to 1,'' said Robert L. Glaser, American Film's president.
 
Public Acceptance Seen
The troubles these companies face do not result from a rejection of colorized films by the public. And no one in the industry is saying that color conversion will die out.
Even troubled Color Systems has three shifts a day at computer consoles to give a new look to sometimes-forgotten films like ''Manhattan Melodrama,'' starring Clark Gable.
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which holds 2,500 black-and-white films in its library, already owns 100 colorized films and has contracts to convert 24 more with American Film and 12 more at Color Systems.
Roger L. Mayer, president of the Turner Entertainment Company, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting, said that when his company spends $250,000 to $270,000 to colorize a film it can recoup two to three times that amount in two years through domestic and international syndication to television stations and Turner's own cable outlets, the TBS Superstation and Turner Network Television.
''We find as distributors, to say nothing of our position as an exhibitor, that people, particularly young people, prefer color to black and white,'' Mr. Mayer said.
 
Industry Heartened
The commitment made by Turner, which shows as many as three newly converted color films every month on TBS and TNT, is heartening to industry executives like Norman Glick, chairman of Colorization Inc.
''I believe there is life in the hereafter in the colorization business, but it's going to take some courage,'' said Mr. Glick, who is also president of Colorization's half-owner, Glenex Industries. ''People thought the industry would blossom a lot sooner.''
One reason Turner is by far the largest customer of the colorizing business is that it owns a film library and cable outlets in addition to a distribution network.
''The individual studios don't have the cable network,'' Mr. Byrne of Tintoretto said. ''Many are reluctant to spend the money before they know they can get air time.''
Mr. Glaser of American Film said the industry still suffered from the debate over the merits of colorizing. ''Some of the major studios feel they don't want to step on the toes of the Directors Guild,'' he said. Many film directors oppose film coloring.
Color Systems faced major problems in its early years with cost overruns and bad color quality. Its executives now say they have improved quality and pared costs to the point where operations are profitable, even though the large debt remains.
Buddy Young, Color Systems' president, said the company hopes to woo new investors, perhaps through a limited partnership that would acquire the rights to old television series. Color Systems would keep part of the profits generated through syndication.
 
A Digital System
A similar plan worked at American Film Technologies, which acquired the rights to several Sherlock Holmes mysteries and then distributed the colorized versions on video at a profit, Mr. Glaser said.
Industry executives say American Film has had more success because it uses a more efficient system - a digital process.
When a black-and-white film is converted to color, it gains a new copyright. Many films now or soon to be in the public domain could make money for new owners, Mr. Young said.
And with film libraries changing hands in deals like the acquisition of Columbia Pictures by the Sony Corporation, he said, more companies may be willing to invest $250,000 in a film, in hopes of raising its potential value to $750,000 or more.
Mr. Young said he was particularly optimistic about the European market, where deregulation has spawned scores of new television stations.
''Europeans were not weaned on black-and-white television,'' Mr. Young said. ''Now that all these stations are proliferating, they need product, and black and white isn't going to fly.''
Even in the United States, the colorizers now say old television series like ''I Love Lucy'' are better candidates for profitable colorization than movies because they are less subject to criticism as altered icons and also cost less to colorize than films.
''If you produce a half-hour TV show, it can cost you $700,000,'' said Mr. Glick of Colorization. ''To color an episode is $60,000. Really, you're creating a brand-new product for $60,000, which could find a market worldwide.''

HEADLINE: Ford Motor Chairman To Retire

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 10

 BODY:
Donald E. Petersen, the executive who helped bring the Ford Motor Company from the edge of financial disaster to a ranking as the most profitable of the Big Three auto makers, said he would retire on March 1 as chairman and chief executive, about a year and a half earlier than expected.
Ford simultaneously announced that Mr. Petersen's successor will be Harold A. Poling, 64 years old, vice chairman and chief operating officer. After three years in that post, Mr. Petersen is to retire.
Mr. Petersen, 63, was a product planner who early in his career worked on the development of the Ford LTD, Mustang, Maverick and Continental Mark III. Mr. Poling is a financial expert. 
 
New Lineup
Philip E. Benton Jr., 60, head of the company's automotive group, was named president of the corporation and chief operating officer, succeeding Mr. Poling. Allan D. Gilmour, 55, an executive vice president who had been considered a top candidate to succeed Mr. Petersen, was named president in charge of all of Ford's automotive businesses. Ford had disclaimed such speculation, and the company said it had no succession plan for the time Mr. Poling retires.
Messrs. Poling, Benton and Gilmour, along with Stanley Seneker, the chief financial officer, will make up Ford's office of the chief executive, Mr. Petersen said.
Under Mr. Petersen, Ford fought back from a grim performance in the recession of the early 1980's to become a profitable and much admired corporate model. Market Share Gained Ford has steadily gained market share in the United States in recent years. Until last summer, Ford reported higher profits in each quarter for the last three years, and the company's earnings surpassed those of General Motors in each of the last two fiscal years.
Mr. Petersen was known for his style of influencing subordinates to seek a consensus, in contrast to the more autocratic style of Ford's past leaders. His policy of giving designers more latitude led to the development of the highly successful 1983 Thunderbird. He is also credited with helping to improve quality and with fostering the creative environment that produced the popular Taurus and Sable models.
Mr. Poling, who said he had reconciled himself to never being chief executive, said the automobile industry was heading into a cyclical decline, which means he may be taking the reins as car sales and profits slip.
Mr. Petersen's decision surprised many high company officials; it was kept secret until today from all but a very few friends, family members and associates. Mr. Gilmour said he learned of the developments only on Thursday.
At a news conference, Mr. Petersen fought back tears as he said that 10 years as chief operating officer and chief executive, capping a 40-year career at Ford, was enough. He cited a need ''to make a change in my life.''
Appearing fit and saying his health was excellent, Mr. Petersen emphasized that no conflicts or disappointments had prompted his sudden move.
He got the idea of retiring early last March, he said, when William Clay Ford retired as vice chairman after 40 years, at age 63. On reflection, he said, he realized he had had little time to himself and with his family during his career. During the last few years, he said, his job has frequently required seven days a week of intercontinental travel, speaking engagements, ceremonial functions and meetings. ''While the demands of the job have increased, my energy level is progressively declining,'' he said, smiling. Aside from weariness, he said there was the matter of individual growth , and he cited the thoughts of an educator at his alma mater.
''I have been struck with the philosophy of Ernie Arbuckle, who at one time was the dean of Stanford's graduate business school,'' he said. ''He followed a plan to change occupations every 10 years. He called it repotting himself. Well, 10 years are up, and it's time to repot myself.''
He said another important factor in his decision was that Mr. Poling might have to retire without having had a chance to be chief executive. ''It bothered me,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''It seemed Red wasn't going to have his chance, and that was wrong.''
Two weeks ago Mr. Petersen asked Mr. Poling whether he would be willing to stay on past retirement. ''It was quite a surprise,'' Mr. Poling said. ''I had to talk to my wife about it.'' Ford's board approved the plan on Thursday.
Mr. Poling will stay at Ford about two years past his expected retirement at age 65. Ford does not have a mandatory retirement policy, but 65 is the customary age of retirement for most executives and managers.
Mr. Petersen said he hopes to play more tennis, to spend more time with his family and to slow down during the next year before deciding on his future plans.
Mr. Poling, a native of Detroit who started as a college trainee in the company's steel division, worked his way through financial management jobs, becoming executive vice president in charge of North American automotive operations in 1980 and chief operating officer in 1985.
Just two weeks ago Mr. Poling was looking for office space as part of a retirement plan to work for Ford on a consulting basis. ''I just told the kids this morning,'' he said. ''They are pretty excited.'' He has three children and two grandchildren.
Mr. Gilmour, who joined Ford in 1960, has been in mostly financial jobs until recent years, when he was given responsibility for overseas operations. Among his past jobs are president of Ford Motor Credit, controller of the corporation, head of government affairs and labor relations and chief financial officer.
Mr. Benton has been in charge of nonautomotive operations and has broad experience in sales and marketing for the North American automotive operations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
East German Events Seen Lifting Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the West German mark and other European currencies in gains traders attributed to the opening of East Germany's borders.
The rapid changes in East Germany, traders said, are creating short-run uncertainty, though traders said the situation could have positive long-term effects for Europe and the Western alliance. Initially, however, this kind of political uncertainty usually causes traders and investors to seek safety in the dollar.
''There is uncertainty about the Soviet response and the Warsaw Pact response to the pace of change,'' said Paul Kimball, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''And when you are uncertain, you get closer to home.'' 
 
Smaller Gain Against Yen
In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.8675 marks, up from 1.8520 on Thursday, but down from its 1.8690 high for the day. But the dollar gained less against the yen; it was at 143.45 yen, up from 143.05 on Thursday.
Gold prices eased. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a 4 P.M. bid of $386.25 a troy ounce, down from $386.30 late Thursday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold lost 30 cents an ounce, closing at $386.80.
The dollar also rose against the Swiss franc, jumping to 1.6435, up from 1.6250 Thursday. But some traders said this had more to do with the underlying weakness of the currency than the situation in East Germany. In addition, the dollar gained against the pound, closing in New York at $1.5773, compared with $1.5823 Thursday.
The dollar's climb was not that sharp when compared with some other days this year, when the dollar has been fairly volatile. And traders were divided over whether this rally would continue and possibly force another round of dollar selling by central banks to keep the currency in line. At 143.45 yen, the dollar is already above the 140 ceiling believed set for it by the United States and its economic allies. And at 1.8675 marks, the dollar is again beginning to move toward the 1.90 ceiling.
The United States and its allies in the Group of Seven have fought to keep the dollar in line. They have issued communiques saying the dollar is too high, changed interest rates, and sold billions in the foreign exchange market to push the dollar lower. And since the stock market plunge of Oct. 13, the dollar has been back in line, at least against the mark.
Hubert Pedroli, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, said he thought the dollar was now moving higher. But he also said that the September trade deficit number, scheduled for release Thursday, could have a big impact on the outlook, especially if it indicates that the deficit is growing again. The August trade deficit was $10.8 billion, up from $8.2 billion in July.
 
Looking for Signals
Mr. Pedroli suggested that the uncertainty in the market could continue until next month's United States-Soviet Union summit meeting between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He said the changes in Eastern Europe ''go beyond the understanding of the average foreign exchange trader,'' and they will be looking for any strong signals of what to expect.
Liliana Nealon, vice president for foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland, said that the slowing American economy, lower corporate profits and further declines in the stock market could again push the dollar lower.
One reason for yesterday's rise is that many traders had aggressively sold dollars for West German marks after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points on Oct. 13. But after markets became calmer, they found themselves overloaded with marks, especially in light of the uncertainity in East Germany.
The mark also fell against the Japanese yen, partly because of rumors early in the day that the Japanese would raise interest rates next week. Because West Germany has moved much more aggressively than Japan to raise interest rates this year, the yen has remained much stronger against the dollar in recent weeks.

Paying the Maid Requires Care

 BODY:
People who pay for child care or who pay household workers like maids and gardeners face special tax reporting and withholding requirements. And they should be sure they have complied with the requirements within 1989 - not wait until next spring when filing their tax returns.
This year for the first time, for example, people claiming a child and dependent-care credit on their tax returns are required to list the name, address and Social Security number of the worker, or if the service is provided by an agency, the Federal employer identification number, on Form 2441.
The Government can then use its computers to match this information with the recipient's tax return to be sure the income is reported and, if the recipient is legally an employee, can check to be sure the payer has withheld Social Security tax and paid the employer's share. Both the employee and employer owe 7.51 percent of wages beginning at $50 per quarter and going up to $48,000 a year. The employer may also be liable for quarterly state unemployment insurance contributions. 
Social Security payments are due quarterly with Form 942, said Richard J. Stricof, a tax partner with BDO Seidman in New York. Individuals, unlike businesses, are not required to withhold income tax from domestic employees unless they request it, he added.
Nor do Social Security taxes have to be withheld for independent contractors like painters or plumbers. Unlike those engaged in a trade or business, individuals are not required to file information returns, Form 1099, for payments made to independent contractors, but it is important to be sure that legally the person really is an independent contractor and not the payer's employee.
''This is an area of widespread noncompliance,'' said Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y. ''Often employees say, 'I'm not going to work for you if you report it,' '' he said, and many employers also want to avoid the cost and the paperwork.
But, he warned, ''The costs of not complying far outweigh the costs of complying.'' A woman in Mississippi failed to pay Social Security taxes for her maid for years, he recalled. ''Her words were, 'Let's just let sleeping dogs lie.' '' But the maid - a human being, not a sleeping dog - eventually retired and filed for Social Security. She had records of what she had been paid, and her former employer had to pay both the tax and thousands of dollars of interest and penalties.
If an employer has failed to withhold income and Social Security taxes, the employee is still liable for the taxes. If he or she does not pay the taxes, the I.R.S. will try to collect them. But if it cannot, the employer may be held liable for a portion of the employee's taxes, Mr. Stricof noted.
People may be unsure if a person they pay for services - a private-duty nurse or a governess or gardener provided by an agency, for example - is an employee or an independent contractor.
Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said the first step was to ask the agency or hospital that refers the person. ''You can have lots of different scenarios,'' he said. The person might be an employee of the hospital or agency, rather than of the person receiving the service or he or she might be an independent contractor.
''Section 3506 of the I.R.S. code is very specific in regard to sitters for children or the elderly or disabled,'' he said. If the parent or relative gets the sitter through an organization and pays the sitter who, in turn, must pay the organization a fee, the sitter is an independent contractor, he said, so there are no withholding requirements.
But the law is less specific about drivers, gardeners and others who may work in private homes. Gardeners or maids might work a half day a week in 10 different homes, for example, but may still be employees, not independent contractors. In the case of employees, the homeowners have the right to exercise control over their work. So all 10 employers would have to file Forms 942 and W-2.
Payers who are uncertain may request a ruling by filing Form SS-8. Any tax forms or publications needed are available at I.R.S. offices or can be requested by calling 1-800-424-FORM toll-free, he said. I.R.S. publication 926 explains employment taxes for household employers in detail.
One way to avoid tax difficulties is to hire domestic help through agencies that send out employees.
''We get the SWAT team,'' said a partner at a national accounting firm. He and his wife work, so on Saturday morning, an agency sends a half-dozen workers to clean house. ''It's done in an hour, and there are no reporting requirements,'' he said.
Another advantage of such an arrangement, Mr. Block said, is that an agency is insured and bonds its employees. Still, many people would rather have someone they know personally, he added, so they are willing to pay both the employee's and employer's share of the Social Security tax. For a part-time maid who is paid $50 a week, or $2,600 a year, that comes to just under $400.

HEADLINE: DOW UP 21.92 TO 2,625.61, ON RATE HOPES

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Buoyed by a positive outlook for interest rates and the dollar, stock prices made broad gains yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day at 2,625.61, after gaining 21.92 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent. Issues that rose led those that fell by 901 to 557. For the week, the Dow slipped 3.90 points. 
The opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange was delayed an hour by a fire in a financial district building that houses computer equipment used in processing trades. Once trading opened, there was a brief drop in prices, but a spurt of buying then pushed the Dow to an 18-point gain within the first 15 minutes of trading. It maintained a similar-sized gain throughout the day.
 
Fire at Computer Center
The fire occurred at the Securities Industry Automation Corporation at 55 Water Street, which receives information from, and transfers information to, the New York and American Stock Exchanges. The automation operation is jointly owned by the two exchanges.
Volume on the Big Board dropped to 131.8 million shares, from 143.4 million shares on Thursday. In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.53 points, to 339.10, while the Big Board composite index edged up 1.15 points, to 187.90.
''Reaffirmation by the Federal Reserve in establishing a new and lower level of Federal funds convinced some investors to do some bargain hunting; otherwise it was a low-volume non-eventful session,'' said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president at Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer.
Yesterday, for the second day, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system. But analysts said the move was technical and did not represent a statement of Fed policy. The analysts said the move was intended to soak up what the Fed regarded as excessive reserves in the banking system.
 
Strong Dollar Helps Stocks
Mr. Spilko said equities also got a psychological lift from the strong gains registered by the dollar yesterday. The dollar attracted investors seeking a secure haven while they watched the rapid political changes occurring in East Germany.
Among individual issues, DeSoto soared 4 3/4, to 47 3/8. Traders said the stock rose on the Sutton Holding Corporation's planned $50-a-share tender offfer for DeSoto.
Walt Disney rose 1 3/4, to 126 1/4. Alan Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, reiterated his buy recommendation after the company's strong fiscal 1989 fourth-quarter earnings report.
Pinnacle West Capital fell 1 1/4, to 7 3/4, and was the second-busiest issue on a turnover of nearly 2.1 million shares. Standard & Poor's downgraded the subordinated debt of Pinnacle's Merabank Federal Savings unit.
Signal Apparel fell 1 1/4, to 6 3/8, after reporting a loss of $662,000 in the third quarter.
Occidental Petroleum jumped 3, to 31, on reports that Armand Hammer, the company's chairman, was in a hospital in Los Angeles.
UAL advanced 4 1/4, to 189 1/2. The pilots' union at United Airlines said it planned to work with the company's management and flight attendants' union to fashion a new deal for employee ownership of UAL, traders said.
Avon Products soared 5 1/2, to 36 3/4. Avon disclosed that an investment group, Chartwell Associates, had acquired 5 percent of Avon's outstanding voting shares. Avon has been the target of several takeover attempts in the past.
Active blue chips included Philip Morris, which rose 1/4, to 41 7/8; McDonald's 3/8, to 31 1/4; Boeing 5/8, to 56, and Bristol-Myers, 5/8, to 54 3/4.
Amax edged up 1/8, to 23, and was the most active Big Board stock on a volume of 2.2 million shares.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index gained 1.06 points, to 371.47, while in over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.12 points, to 456.19.

Houses That Trap Humidity May Unleash Health Problems

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
A lesson about household air quality is unfolding at the Passamaquoddy Indian reservation on the rocky coast of northeastern Maine. Dozens of children there suffer from respiratory problems, including asthma-like conditions.
''Some of these kids have colds throughout the entire winter,'' said John D. Spengler, an environmental scientist with the Harvard University School of Public Health, which has been studying the problem.
Mr. Spengler and housing experts believe the problem lies with some of the Passamaquoddy homes, which were constructed in the early 1970's by the Federal Government and touted as being tightly built, energy-efficient units. But inadequate ventilation in the houses, among other factors, creates high indoor humidity levels that promote the growth of disease-producing molds and mildew. 
 
Peeling Paint
 As consumers weatherproof their homes in anticipation of winter, they should take steps to avoid trapping too much moisture, Mr. Spengler and other experts caution. Humidity is typically viewed as a problem of summer. But in winter, high humidity indoors may be both unhealthy and damaging to buildings.
''The health hazard is small compared to the durability questions,'' said Joseph Lstiburek, a building scientist with Dames & Moore, Trow, an environmental consulting concern in Park Ridge, Ill. ''We know when homes get too humid, attics rot and paint peels off the walls.''
The household humidity problem is an unintended result of the nation's drive to conserve energy. Older homes, though uncomfortably drafty at times, quickly released moisture from such sources as human respiration, shower steam and damp heat vented from stoves, clothes dryers and space heaters.
But as builders constructed tighter homes and homeowners added more insulation, more moisture was trapped inside. And in the face of winter, homeowners often take other steps, like caulking exteriors and sealing up windows, that further reduce air flow.
''The trick is finding a balance between keeping a house ventilated and keeping it heated,'' said John F. McCarthy, president of Environmental Health and Engineering Inc., a consulting company in Cambridge, Mass.
Sweating windowpanes, a result of condensing moisture, are a tipoff that a house contains too much humidity. So is the growth of mold and mildew. Molds are a matter of increasing concern because they are thought to give off gases that may produce allergic reactions or contribute to respiratory problems.
Mr. Spengler and other researchers said the situation on the Passamaquoddy reservation may not be typical because large extended families often live in the same dwelling. But a recent nationwide survey suggests that the Indians' experience may be a magnified version of a problem affecting others. That study, conducted by the Harvard University School of Public Health in six cities nationwide, found that reports of colds and other respiratory problems among children were significantly higher in households that reported the presence of mold and mildew, Mr. Spengler said.
The dust mite, a microscopic insect, is another respiratory irritant that thrives in a warm, damp interiors. Once a problem only in hotter climates, the insect has expanded its domain in recent years, thanks largely to increased household humidity, scientists believe.
''We are finding houses grossly contaminated with dust mites all the way into Wisconsin,'' Mr. Spengler said. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates that exposure to dust mites, molds and similar irritants causes 20,000 hospital visits annually by asthma patients.
Interior humidity levels during winter should remain between 30 and 50 percent, experts said. Consumers can take a number of steps to maintain needed ventilation.
The E.P.A., for example, recommends fans in bathrooms and kitchens, where significant amounts of household moisture are produced. Humidistats, devices that operate like thermostats, can be connected to fans so that they turn on automatically when humidity levels exceed a preset level.
Heaters and clothes dryers should be vented outside the house and vent pipes should be tilted upward. Downspouts should point away from the house to prevent dampness in the basement.
Large quantities of firewood, a significant source of moisture, should be kept outside until used, experts added.
 
Space-Heater Peril
 Windows are another area of concern. If possible, Mr. Lstiburek suggested, a storm window or plastic insulating film should be installed on a window's interior, rather than exterior. This helps keep room temperatures higher and, as a result, reduces condensation on windows, he said.
Humidifiers, if used, should be cleaned daily to avoid the buildup of bacteria, the E.P.A. suggests, adding that only distilled water should be used in humidifiers.
Some building safety experts strongly urge that space heaters that burn natural gas, bottled gas or kerosene are venter to the outside. Such heaters generate nitrogen dioxide, which is suspected of contributing to chronic respiratory problems, said Bruce Davis, housing director for the Economic Opportunity Agency, a nonprofit organization in Fayetteville, Ark. Those heaters can also produce poisonous carbon monoxide.
Said Mr. Davis: ''If you have an unvented heater, turn it off and throw it out.''
 
MAKING AIR DRIER
 Here are some steps to reduce household humidity in winter:
* Vent dryers and heaters to the outside.
* Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchen.
* Store firewood outside.
* Clean water-damaged carpets.
* Install louvers in closet doors.
''The Inside Story,'' a booklet prepared by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, offers advice about indoor air-quality problems. Write to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Public Information Center, 401 M Street SW, Washington D.C. 20406.

Making Policy of the Inevitable, Gorbachev Accepts Wide Change

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Any doubt that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is prepared for a fundamentally new order in Eastern Europe has been largely erased this week, as Soviet officials calmly applaud the crowds pouring through the newly perforated Iron Curtain.
The changes in East Germany, following those in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union itself, and perhaps to be followed by a liberalization in Bulgaria, are taking place with an alacrity that surprises Soviet officials almost as much as it does the West, and jangles nerves in both the East and the West.
Just how much the Soviet leadership is prepared to tolerate is still a question. But it is already clear that the limits are looser than most Westerners assumed even a few months ago.
President Gorbachev has already sent President Bush a message supporting the changes taking place in East Germany, and in it he expressed hope that the situation would remain ''calm and peaceful,'' the White House spokesman said today. [Page 22.] Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, the former United States national security adviser, had a preview of the looser limits two weeks ago when he appeared before Mikhail S. Gorbachev's foreign policy establishment here and offered a sweeping prescription for the dismantling of Soviet power in Eastern Europe. 
Addressing 500 Soviet diplomats and academics, Mr. Brzezinski said the socialist countries would have to transform themselves from Communist dictatorships to pluralist democracies. The two Germanys must be united, perhaps in a loose confederation at first. The ''neo-Stalinist regime'' in Czechoslovakia would fall within a year or two, he predicted.
The response to the speech was so warm that an American Embassy official promptly drafted a cablegram to Washington reporting on the ''extraordinary'' event.
 
Agreeing With Brzezinski
Not only did the crowd agree with almost everything Mr. Brzezinski said, the diplomat reported, but afterward some listeners said that Mr. Brzezinski's speech was ''actually mild in comparison to the current tenor of debate in party and academic circles, and that most of the ideas he mentioned had adherents in the party and Government structure.''
Soviet officials and Westerners who follow these issues closely cite several reasons why Mr. Gorbachev has embraced changes that previous Soviet regimes would have brutally repressed.
First, the Soviet Union has drastically redefined its security interests, recognizing that halting its own economic decline is more important to the ultimate survival of Soviet power than enforcing an unpopular Communist gospel.
 
Claiming the Initiative
To some extent, Mr. Gorbachev is making a policy of the inevitable.
He realizes that even if he wanted to stop the transformations of Eastern Europe, he could not do so without endangering his support at home and abroad. Better to claim the initiative, winning admiration in his own bloc and credibility in the West.
The opening of the Berlin wall, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda commented today, shows that ''the new political thinking is blazing a trail'' and that East Germany is moving toward creation of a ''common European home.''
Soviet television tonight, in an understated report that showed happy reunions in the West and workers taking jackhammers to the wall, stressed that this was the initiative of the German Communists. Most of the East Germans who took the chance to inspect West Berlin, the Soviet accounts noted, lined up later to go home again.
Mr. Gorbachev seems convinced that Western Europe is not likely to take strategic advantage of the situation, in part because the West now has a stake in Mr. Gorbachev. He will surely try to bolster his confidence in Western intentions in his meeting with President Bush next month.
Because the West worries about the stability of the Continent no less than the East does, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to find willing partners for new types of political and economic cooperation to prevent events from swerving out of control.
Most of Moscow's satellites had become economic cripples, and Mr. Gorbachev is well aware that without integration into Western markets they will remain a drain on his own budget.
The Soviet leader has not just endured the retreat of his allies from Communism, he has promoted it both by his words and example.
''Freedom of choice is a universal principle which allows no exception,'' he said in his speech last December to the United Nations General Assembly. And in Finland two weeks ago, he said the Soviet Union had no moral or political right to meddle in its neighbors' affairs.
 
'Brezhnev Doctrine Is Dead'
''The Brezhnev doctrine is dead,'' added Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, referring to the Western term for Leonid I. Brezhnev's determination to preserve the postwar order in Europe, with force if necessary.
The Kremlin has remained serene through the rise of a Polish Government led by non-Communists, and through the abrupt disintegration of the Hungarian Communist Party.
In East Germany, Mr. Gorbachev was at least the catalyst for the departure of Erich Honecker, the aging party leader, and almost certainly counseled the initiatives of his successor, Egon Krenz, who hastened to Moscow within days of his ascent.
No one knows just what Mr. Gorbachev said to Mr. Krenz during their three-hour meeting on Nov. 1, but the East German leader emerged from the encounter sounding like a disciple, and there is little doubt the decision to open the borders had the Soviet leader's blessing in advance.
 
Big Stake in East Germany
East Germany, where the Soviet Union keeps 380,000 troops stationed, presents the trickiest test to date of Mr. Gorbachev's hands-off policy.
In a recent interview, Georgi K. Shakhnazarov, Mr. Gorbachev's longtime adviser on Eastern Europe, acknowledged the Soviet stake there.
''One of our concerns is that the situation in the German Democratic Republic is normalized,'' he said. ''They have a very strong foundation; the economic foundations are sound. They have to solve certain tasks -make more information available, establish dialogue between the leadership and the people. Certain reforms will take place, and that in no way excludes cooperation between the two German states.''
Asked about reunification of the two Germanys, Mr. Shakhnazarov said it was not ''on the agenda now,'' but added, ''I don't think anyone would dare to predict whether it's going to happen, when or in what way.''
 
Gorbachev's Wider Proposals
The opening of the border between the Germanys is likely to make the West look more seriously at Mr. Gorbachev's proposals for a broader disengagement of East and West in Europe. He has repeatedly proposed negotiating an end to the two military blocs, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, as well as conventional arms agreements that would involve a drastic rollback of military front lines.
''Both East and West realize that all events should be taken as a complex,'' Mr. Shakhnazarov said, when asked about the prospect of pulling back Soviet troops from Eastern Europe.
''The troops will be withdrawn, but it will be done within the framework of the all-European process,'' he said. ''From the standpoint of mutual confidence and stability, it would be much better for everyone if it happens on the basis of common consent, with participation of both alliances.''
In this, Mr. Gorbachev may be willing to go further than many in the West think is wise.
 
Save 2 Pacts, Brzezinski Says
In his speech to Soviet officials, for instance, Mr. Brzezinski said he believed that the alliances should be preserved as ''twin pillars of geopolitical and territorial stability.''
He said the Warsaw Pact should be reorganized in a more benign fashion, forswearing any role as an ideological policemen, and that the two blocs should establish contacts.
During a week of meetings with Soviet officials, including Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, the Politburo member in charge of foreign policy, Mr. Brzezinski said he was unable to discern clear limits to what the Soviets were willing to accept in Europe.
''I think maybe it's just as well that they don't answer,'' he said. ''It means they are open-minded and the process is open-ended - provided it is nonviolent, not anti-Soviet, and does not bring the immediate destabilization of Eastern Europe.''

HEADLINE: ANTI-DRUG FUNDS AROUSE CONFLICT

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Even as the nation's mayors and governors push President Bush to provide more resources for the war on drugs, they have been waging a civil war over whether the cities or the states ought to control the new Federal funds pledged to the battle.
Mayors of large and small cities are writing letters, offering Congressional testimony and lobbying members of Congress to funnel the money for enforcement of drug laws and prevention and treatment of drug abuse directly to them because city neighborhoods, police officers and children are the ones under siege.
They insist that their efforts are not the usual political jockeying for budgetary aid and fiscal advantage. Rather, they say, they are acting out of a need to bring the resources as quickly as possible to the front lines where the most lives are at stake.
The National Governors' Association has begun a counteroffensive, arguing that Federal anti-drug money should continue to come through state capitols to make sure someone will oversee the way it is spent. 
Nolan Jones, an official with the governors' group, concedes that states have been slow to send anti-drug money to local governments, but he also says city officials are simply not equipped to deal with the larger questions of trafficking or money laundering or details of prison construction: ''What good is it if they use this money to arrest a lot more people, but we don't have the prisons to house them?''
The mayors say it is the local governments that have tried new tactics against the drug problem and deserve the money to finance them. In Houston in 1987, city officials sought Federal financing for a concentrated street-level enforcement program, said Laura Waxman, an official with the United States Conference of Mayors. But Ms. Waxman said that proposal did not mesh with the state of Texas's drug strategy, organized around regional task forces focusing on rural areas and corridors of drug trafficking.
 
Through the State Slowly
According to data from the Conference of Mayors, New York City has received more Federal money than any other city. about $7.5 million since 1987. But city officials say they would prefer that the money came to them in direct grants, rather than through the state.
''There is no question it gets more complicated when it goes through the state,'' said Paul Dickstein, the city's budget director.
In a recent letter to President Bush, Mayor John O. Norquist of Milwaukee wrote: ''An overwhelming majority of the law-enforcement officers who were killed in narcotics-related crime fighting last year were local officers, not state or Federal officers. The cities are where this fight is being waged and where the resources should be directed.''
Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles told Congress in September, ''What really matters to the foot soldiers in this war is how many reinforcements will arrive -and how soon.''
 
Echoes of a Longtime Animosity
This week, at the urging of cities, 20 members of Congress wrote both Mr. Bush and William J. Bennett, Director of National Drug Control Policy. They argued that Federal anti-drug money allocated over the last three years has often been stalled at the state level, and they urged that the new Federal money should be given directly to local governments.
The battle over the distribution of Federal anti-drug resources echoes the longtime animosity between large urban areas and state governments, and it comes after the sharp cutbacks in Federal assistance for housing, economic development and other urban programs in the Reagan years.
The Conference of Mayors says Federal assistance for law enforcement amounts to less than 1 percent of the annual total that states and local governments together spend on criminal justice. Meanwhile, the conference said, expenditures for public safety in the 50 largest cities have increased 32.6 percent over the last year and state spending on corrections has increased 14.1 percent.
''This is not so much a fight about money, or delays in funds getting to cities - it's about control,'' said Gwen A. Holden, the executive vice president of the National Criminal Justice Association, which represents states on crime control and public safety matters.
David Tell, a spokesman for Mr. Bennett, said the drug policy office had taken no formal position on whether there ought to be a change in the formula for distributing anti-drug money. He said the matter is under study. Roots in the Reagan Era As the Federal drug strategy is now written, said Bruce Carnes, director of planning and budget for Mr. Bennett, governors and states are asked to exercise more control in shaping programs.
This does not mean that Federal officials would rule out any other proposal on getting the money to the cities, he said.
The states have been the clearinghouse for Federal money since the Federal anti-drug block grant program was adopted in 1986. Reflecting the Reagan Administration's desire to let state officials, rather than Federal officials, take a more active role in shaping domestic policy, the program last year gave state governments the authority to allocate $1.2 billion in Federal money for drug prevention, education and law enforcement.
Under the drug-fighting proposal now before Congress, the total amount that will be allocated under the three programs will be about $2.2 billion, Mr. Carnes said. State and local governments will then be expected to put up matching money.
Congress and the White House are considering spending $9.2 billion on drug strategy over all, with most of the money going to Federal law-enforcement agencies. Originally, Mr. Bush had proposed $7.9 billion for the war on drugs.
Officials in Mr. Bennett's office say the increase in money being made available to local governments is intended in part as an incentive to encourage innovative approaches. Municipal officials say there are already lots of good ideas around, and by not directing money directly to cities the Federal Government is not providing enough reward for work already being done.
 
Scores of Local Programs
Last year both the National League of Cities and the Conference of Mayors commended more than 100 anti-drug programs in cities, few of which had received any Federal financial support.
Berkeley, Calif., was cited for using a converted bus as a mobile police substation, moving it each night into different neighborhoods, then using it as a base for foot patrols. The bus, donated by a transit agency, was converted with $43,000 from seized drug assets, and volunteers did the work.
Since Mr. Bush outlined his anti-drug strategy in September, state and local officials have agreed on one thing: The President and Congress must allocate more money. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has accused the President of declaring a war on drugs but asking the states to pay for the bullets.
Critics at both the state and local levels say it is wrong to spend only $9 billion on drugs when the President and Congress recently found $165 billion to help rescue the savings and loan industry.
But while they would like more money, many state and local officials have widely differing ideas about how to spend it. Big-city mayors argue that the Bush strategy is placing a strong priority on street-level enforcement without providing the money to hire more police officers, improve information gathering and buy more sophisticated weapons.
 
Survey for Mayors' Group
In Ohio, Gov. Richard F. Celeste questions the need to focus on urban areas at the expense of the rest of the state. In a recent interview, he urged less emphasis on law enforcement and more on treatment and education. He also called for 10 new beds in drug treatment centers for every new prison cell built.
The specific complaint among many cities is that in allocating Federal drug money, states did not distribute it according to need or to reflect local realities.
A 30-city survey conducted last spring by the Conference of Mayors reported that only one in four cities said they had participated in developing their state's anti-drug plan, and more than two-thirds said the state strategy did not respond to local needs. One in four cities said they had yet to receive any money for local law-enforcement programs.
Mayor Bradley told Congress this fall that Los Angeles received less than 6 percent of the Federal anti-drug money allocated to California last year, even though the Los Angeles police arrest 20 percent of all drug offenders in the state and seize 82 percent of the cocaine.
 
Fitting Into Urban Picture
The Conference of Mayors and the League of Cities have argued that no drug strategy can succeed unless it is viewed as part of urban pathologies that include unemployment, racism and homelessness.
Because drugs exist in that larger urban context, said Mayor Terry Goddard of Phoenix, president of the League of Cities, he is uncomfortable with Mr. Bush's ''war'' analogy.
''If you carry it to extremes,'' he said, ''you are at war with yourself. Drugs in cities are a problem that is especially indigenous among the urban poor.
''Sure, it's easy to scare the hell out of the middle class over drugs, but among the poor, how do you separate drugs from other hard-core urban problems like joblessness and cycles of dependency and teen-age pregnancy?''

The city is using a bus, donated by a local transit agency and converted by volunteers with money from seized drug assets, as a mobile police station in neighborhoods plagued by drug problems.

HEADLINE: U.S. LINKS TEHERAN TO TERROR SQUADS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Every few weeks, a heavily laden plane flies from Iran to Syria with a cargo of weapons, food and other supplies. The material is then trucked across the border and distributed to various Shiite terrorist groups in Lebanon.
The flights were an essential element in Iran's foreign policy during the tenure of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and their continuation under Iran's new President, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, is seen by Administration officials as graphic evidence that Teheran's support for terrorism has not lessened.
In the months after Hojatolislam Rafsanjani became President, some Western experts had hopes, as yet unrealized, that his conciliatory speeches and moves to oust hard-liners from the Government meant Iran would soon lessen its use of terrorism against Western countries. 
Instead, Administration officials said, Teheran openly expanded its ties to Palestinian radicals like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, the Syrian-based group that intelligence officials believe carried out the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Scotland in December 1988.
 
Aiding Lebanon Captors
The officials said Iran also appeared to have authorized a campaign to kill Saudi diplomats around the world in retaliation for Saudi Arabia's execution of 16 Iranians convicted of bombing an Islamic pilgrimage in Mecca.
The officials said Teheran's support for the Shiite groups in Lebanon had broadened. In addition to aiding the Party of God, the Muslim group holding some of the American hostages, Iran has begun assisting others in Lebanon, including the Amal militia.
The officials did say Iran had turned away from mainly American targets, focusing its use of terrorism on the Saudis and internal opponents, a development several officials said was not significant.
''They haven't changed their spots,'' an Administration official said. ''The true nature of the regime, its use of violence overseas, remains the same. The networks are all still there, and they are still supporting them.''
Administration officials and independent experts said they saw some reason to hope that President Rafsanjani might eventually end the state of hostility between the United States and Iran. But they cautioned that the hard-liners displaced by Mr. Rafsanjani, such as former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi-Pur, have maintained their ties to the Lebanese groups, reducing the new President's freedom to maneuver on such issues as freeing the American hostages. Mr. Mohtashemi, who is now out of the Government, visited Lebanon last month and met with the leadership of the Party of God, Administration officials said.
 
Emphasis on Economy Cited
''Rafsanjani's emphasis on economic issues and improving Iran's image in the world leading up to greater cooperation in the world has all been really quite positive,'' said Gary Sick, an Iran specialist and former White House official who is now at Columbia University. ''The exchange of signals with the United States has been quite interesting. There's been a lot of quiet communication back and forth, mostly through public signals that each side understands.''
''The big exception,'' Mr. Sick continued, ''is on the terrorism side. I don't think there's any evidence that the Iranian use of terror has declined in this period.''
Administration officials cite several incidents involving Iran, including these:
* On July 13, Abdul-Rahman Ghassemlou, leader of an Iranian Kurdish group, was assassinated during a meeting with representatives of the Iranian Government. American officials believe this operation was approved at the highest levels of the Iranian Government.
* On Aug. 26, an Iranian refugee named Bahman Javadi was shot to death in Larnaca, Cyprus, by what were believed to be agents of the Iranian Government.
* On Oct. 16, Abdurreehman Shrewi, a diplomat in the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, lost both legs when a bomb exploded in his car.
* On Wednesday, Mohammed Ali Marzouqi of the Saudi Embassy in Syria was killed by three gunmen in Beirut who, witnesses said, used submachine guns equipped with silencers. Islamic Jihad, the Iranian-backed group that holds some American hostages, said in a statement that it had carried out the assassination to avenge the executions by Saudi Arabia.
 
Opposition Members Killed
Aladdin Touran, a representative of the Iranian opposition group called the People's Mujahedeen, said there had been no lessening of Teheran's attacks against its members and other Iranians. He said the killing of Hossein Keshavarz in Pakistan on Sept. 14 was only the latest example.
''The regime's opponents have been on a hit list, and more than one has been assassinated,'' he said. ''The nature of this regime, which has not been changed by Khomeini's death, is external terrorism and internal repression.''
President Rafsanjani and his colleagues have been quite open in cementing relations with various anti-Western groups.
In July, Ahmed Jabril, the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, met with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the successor to Ayatollah Khomeini as Iran's religious leader, in Teheran.
On Sept. 22, the Teheran radio reported that a delegation including Mr. Jabril and Saed Musa, widely known as Abu Musa, head of the Fatah Revolutionary Movement, arrived in Iran and over the next week met with senior officials, including President Rafsanjani.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST: The White House;
Exchange With Gorbachev Leaves Bush Hopeful

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 11

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has sent President Bush a message supporting the changes taking place in East Germany and expressing hope that the situation will remain ''calm and peaceful,'' the White House spokesman said today.
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's press secretary, disclosed the message, which was received on Friday while the President was here to dedicate a memorial to soldiers killed in the Vietnam War.
The cable from Mr. Gorbachev was described by Mr. Fitzwater as ''an informal message.'' Although its text was not released, the spokesman said the Soviet leader spoke of ''the importance of the changes'' in East Germany and ''expressed the hope that the situation will remain calm and peaceful.'' 
Mr. Gorbachev also told Mr. Bush that he supported the actions of the new East German leadership to open its their country's borders.
 
U.S. Response Is Promised
Mr. Fitzwater said later that ''the President will respond, and he will repeat many of the things he said, as well as offering encouragement for the continuation of political and economic reforms.''
Mr. Bush, addressing thousands today at an emotional Veterans Day ceremony in which he dedicated a new Vietnam War memorial, said that the perforation of the Berlin wall shows ''a great truth shining brighter with each passing day.''
''The quest for freedom,'' he went on, ''is stronger than steel, more permanent than concrete.''
Recalling that his Administration had not foreseen the suppression of blossoming dissent in China, President Bush said in an interview published today that he has acted with ''prudence'' toward the developments in Eastern Europe because of concern that bolder action could ''contribute toward an unforeseen disorder'' in the Soviet bloc.
 
Inside View
In the interview, conducted on Friday with Texas reporters, Mr. Bush said he was prepared to discuss ''a wide array of economic questions'' with Mr. Gorbachev. But, in his first detailed response to the rapidly unfolding events of recent days in East Germany and other nations of the Warsaw Pact, Mr. Bush reflected the deep uncertainty within his Administration about how much the United States can become involved.
He seemed frustrated both at criticism that he has been reluctant to take the kind of leading role in Europe that the United States has pursued for four decades and at the limitations on American action created by the current upheavals.
Mr. Bush said his advisers believe that Mr. Gorbachev is irrevocably committed to his reforms. ''They can't go back to Square One,'' the President said. But he and his aides are still uncertain, and debating among themselves, how the Kremlin will respond to the growing rift amomg its neighboring countries. What About Prague? With Friday's change of leadership in Bulgaria, Mr. Bush went on, the Administration is eager to assess the possibilities for change in a remaining hard-line Communist country, Czechoslovakia. Mr. Bush said that Prague is now among ''the most egregious offenders of human rights, those that resist change the most clearly.''
Asked if he was concerned that the rapidity of events could lead to instability in Europe, he said, ''I think that's why I keep using the word like prudent.''
Still, he said, ''I am convinced, given not just the events of yesterday, but the cumulative set of events that have taken place, that this change is real.''
The President and his advisers have repeatedly insisted that China and Eastern Europe cannot be compared in political terms. But Mr. Bush would not disregard the Chinese crackdown on dissent that culminated in hundreds of deaths in Beijing in June, and he used that event to explain his seeming anguish over policy toward Eastern Europe.
 
'Keep Our Eyes Open'
''I think many of us felt that what happened in China set back the relationship there,'' he said. ''I hadn't seen anybody predict that was going to happen.''
''And so we keep our eyes open, and we keep acting prudently so as not to exacerbate tensions but to encourage that democracy is whole and free. If we continue to do that, we can hopefully not contribute to an unforeseen disorder.''
Mr. Bush said he would like to return to Berlin ''to see it with the wall down, not just with holes in it.'' But he said he did not plan to stop there after his meeting with Mr. Gorbachev on ships off the coast of Malta on Dec. 2 and 3 ''unless there were something that developed between now and then that would make the presence of the U.S. President catalytic for peace or for evolution of democracy.''
 
Possible Economic Help
Turning to questions about economic aid, the area in which the Administration has been especially reluctant to engage the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush said: ''I think the time is right, should the Soviets want to discuss how to improve their economy, that we do that. I'm perfectly prepared to talk to Mr. Gorbachev on a wide array of economic questions, and will be ready to do that.''
He added that he had had two ''interesting seminars'' with his advisers on economic issues to prepare for the meetings with the Soviet President.
Despite some conflicting statements in recent weeks about the Soviet-American relationship, Mr. Bush said he and his advisers agree on the substance of policy toward the East bloc. Still, they ''sit and argue back and forth - How quick will this happen? Or, What will be next? Or, what do you think is going to happen to Mr. A. or Mr. B.''
''Will Gorbachev remain committed to perestroika and indeed to glasnost?'' Mr. Bush said. ''Absolutely.''

HEADLINE: Lujan Tries to Counter Drive Against Offshore Oil Wells

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who has played a low-key role in the Bush Administration, has mounted an aggressive campaign to counter growing opposition to offshore oil leasing and production.
In a series of speeches characterized by jabs at environmentalists who oppose offshore oil development, Mr. Lujan is not only serving as President Bush's point man in the effort to turn public opinion, but also taking a rare aggressive stance on an issue that has engendered considerable controversy. Mr. Lujan has been a relatively silent Cabinet official, especially compared with recent predecessors like James G. Watt and Donald P. Hodel in the Reagan Administration.
Environmentalists and members of Congress have also criticized Mr. Lujan for favoring development interests over environmental concerns.
 
'Reverse Growing Trend'
Mr. Lujan used his strongest language to date as Interior Secretary in support of offshore drilling in a speech Friday night to a group of independent oil drillers in Midland, Tex., where President Bush once operated an oil business. 
''We must reverse the growing trend toward summarily dismissing the possibility of leasing in areas which offer great potential for supplying our whole nation with energy resources,'' Mr. Lujan said, according to a text provided by his office.
''When we move in the direction of shutting down American development, when we base policy on limiting our potential rather than expanding it, when we turn to foreign lands to supply our energy needs - then I can't help but feeling that somewhere along the way we've surrendered something of our freedom - and relinquished our independence,'' he said.
Mr. Lujan has said that the United States might be importing more than 55 percent of its oil by the year 2000. In September, the United States imported almost 50 percent of its oil.
The Interior Secretary recently pushed the theme of offshore oil drilling when he spoke to another group of independent oil drillers in San Antonio and in a speech to Western governors in June. He is planning more speeches along the same lines, a spokesman said.
 
Lujan Heads Study Group
The Administration offensive comes at a time when a study group led by Mr. Lujan is preparing recommendations for President Bush on whether leasing should be permitted to go forward off Southern and Northern California and southwestern Florida. The proposals are expected this year. Last February, the President said he would delay oil leasing activities in those areas pending the results of a study.
Mr. Lujan, whose department supervises the offshore program, has been criticized by some members of Congress and environmental groups for continuing to speak out in support of offshore drilling at the same time he is leading the study group.
Mr. Lujan has said he does not see his position as chairman of the group and as the Administration's leading advocate of offshore drilling as being in conflict. He has noted that he is only one of several panel members and his position has been that offshore oil development should be permitted only if it is conducted in an environmentally sound manner.
The Administration is worried that voiciferous opposition to drilling off the coasts of California and Florida is drowning out competing views about the energy needs of the nation, said Mr. Lujan's spokesman, Steve Goldstein.
The Administration's stance suffered a blow early in the month when a panel of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the Government lacks enough information to assess the environmental and economic consequences of oil leasing off the California and Florida coasts.
Mr. Lujan's study group had requested the report, the results of which put pressure on the Administration to back away from offshore leasing in those states.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE INCREASE DONATIONS IN U.S.

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
As Japanese companies increase their holdings in this country, many are multiplying their contributions to American charities, but a leading figure in Japanese corporate philanthropy says donations are not growing commensurately with investments.
Japan's wealth and its corporate involvement in the United States have become ''conspicuous,'' said Tadashi Yamamoto, president of a nonprofit group in Tokyo, the Japan Center for International Exchange, that has fostered American-Japanese relations.
This trend, in turn, has increased pressure on Japanese corporations to increase their low level of corporate and individual giving to philanthropic causes in this country, he said.
To bring such pressure to bear directly, and to instruct Japanese businesses in the American way of giving, the center is co-sponsoring a conference Tuesday in Tokyo on ''Becoming a Good Corporate Citizen in the American Communities.'' 
 
A Crash Course in Charity
Americans who administer corporate foundations or who are prominent in philanthropy will be there to offer their Japanese counterparts a crash couse in Western-style philanthropy. Among them will be David Rockefeller, who coincidentally recently announced the sale of the controlling interest in Rockefeller Center properties to Mitsubishi Estate Company of Tokyo for $846 million.
The Americans who will participate in the conference include Reynold Levy, president of the A.T.&T. Foundation; Alfred N. Scallon, director of corporate support programs for the International Business Machines Corporation; Mary Beth Salerno, vice president for philanthropy at American Express, and Peter C. Hutchinson, chairman of the Dayton Hudson Foundation.
Two hundred Japanese companies have signed up for the event, which is co-sponsored by the Council for Better Corporate Citizenship of Keidanren, representing Japan's leading companies.
Japanese corporate giving in the United States increased from $85 million in 1987 to $145 million last year, the Japan Center said. But corporate giving is not as established in the Japan as it is in the United States, and Mr. Yamamoto said Japanese business leaders still have a long way to go.
He preaches to his fellow Japanese the virtues of giving to neighborhood schools and cultural groups in the American communities where they have plants and volunteering for United Way or Red Cross campaigns.
 
Fighting Facelessness
''Otherwise,'' he said in an interview during a recent visit to the United States, ''Japanese business will continue to be faceless. Too many Americans see us as having a Sony television set as a head and a Toyota body.''
Mr. Yamamoto, 53 years old, acknowledged he is trying to counter a measure of suspicion and anti-Japanese sentiment among some Americans, evoked partly, he said, by the phenomenal success of Japanese industry and the acquisition of American companies and real estate. Some Japanese were stung by a cover story in Business Week magazine in July last year suggesting the Japanese were using philanthropy to win the hearts and minds of America, capture American research talent and perhaps head off trade policies that would hurt Japanese exports to the United States. In response, a few companies temporarily retrenched on their corporate giving in the United States, he said.
''Trade and economic conflicts are unavoidable in an interdependent world,'' he said. They are eased in European-American relations because of a common heritage and multi-layered connections. With Japan, there are only commercial ties, he said.
Elliot L. Richardson, former Secretary of Defense, who is chairman of the Washington-based Hitachi Foundation, said that as a bridge-builder, ''Yamamoto has done more than any other individual to create mutual understanding about corporate responsibility.''
Others say Mr. Yamamoto fathered Japanese philanthropy by developing the still relatively small number of Japanese foundations and by lobbying for new Japanese tax laws to encourage charitable donations.
Donation and voluntarism are unfamiliar concepts for Japanese accustomed to having their Government look after those needing help, Mr. Yamamoto said.
But Sam Kusomoto, president of the Minolta Corporation in the United States, said Japanese companies have kept a low profile in corporate philanthropy in the United States for other reasons: Many Japanese executives find their American communities new and strange and are relocated before they become familiar with them. Often, American subsidiaries operate with small budgets for charitable giving.
 
'Slightly Less Inward-Looking'
''My advice is Japanese companies in the United States should be slightly less inward-looking and become more outward-looking, focusing less on product and more on the broad needs of the communities where they operate,'' Mr. Kusomoto said.
There are signs that American subsidiaries of Japanese companies are adopting American practices. Two years ago, the only one of the 2,300 United Way campaigns with a Japanese member was in Hawaii, said Martin T. Walsh, managing director of International Corporations for United Way. Now there are seven board members, including Hisao Kondo, president of Mitsui U.S.A., on the board of United Way of New York, and Mr. Kusomoto, on the Bergen County, N.J., board.

HEADLINE: TV's Black World Turns - But Stays Unreal

BYLINE: By HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.; Henry Louis Gates Jr. is an Andrew W. Mellon Fellow at the National Humanities Center in North Carolina. His most recent book, ''The Signifying Monkey,'' won a 1989 American Book Award.

 BODY:
There is a telling moment in the 1986 film ''Soul Man'' when a young man explains to a friend why he has decided to down a bottle of tanning pills and turn himself black. The friend is skeptical: What's it actually going to be like, being black?
''It's gonna be great,'' the hero assures him. ''These are the 80's, man. This is the 'Cosby' decade. America loves black people.''
Alas, he soon discovers the gulf that separates the images of black people he sees on television and the reality that blacks experience every day. 
Even black Americans sometimes need to be reminded about the deceptiveness of television. Blacks retain their fascination with black characters on TV: Many of us buy Jet magazine primarily to read its weekly television feature, which lists every black character (major or minor) to be seen on the screen that week. Yet our fixation with the presence of black characters on TV has blinded us to an important fact that ''Cosby,'' which began in 1984, and its offshoots over the years demonstrate convincingly: There is very little connection between the social status of black Americans and the fabricated images of black people that Americans consume each day. Moreover, the representations of blacks on TV is a very poor index to our social advancement or political progress.
But the young man is right about one thing: This is the ''Cosby'' decade. The show's unprecedented success in depicting the lives of affluent blacks has exercised a profound influence on television in the last half of the 80's. And, judging from the premiere of this season's new black series - ''Family Matters,'' ''Homeroom'' and ''Snoops,'' as well as ''Generations,'' an interracial soap opera - ''Cosby's'' success has led to the flow of TV sitcoms that feature the black middle class, each of which takes its lead from the ''Cosby'' show.
Historically, blacks have always worriedJU aloud about the image that white Americans harbor of us, first because we have never had control of those images and, second, because the greater number of those images have been negative. And given television's immediacy, and its capacity to reach so many viewers so quickly, blacks, at least since ''Amos 'n' Andy'' back in the early 50's, have been especially concerned with our images on the screen. I can remember as a child sitting upstairs in my bedroom and hearing my mother shout at the top of her voice that someone ''colored . . . colored!'' was on TV and that we had all better come downstairs at once. And, without fail, we did, sitting in front of our TV, nervous, full of expectation and dread, praying that our home girl or boy would not let the race down.
 
'White' Money Vs. 'Colored' Money
 Later, when American society could not successfully achieve the social reformation it sought in the 60's through the Great Society, television solved the problem simply by inventing symbols of that transformation in the 80's, whether it was Cliff Huxtable - whom we might think of as the grandson of Alexander Scott (played by Mr. Cosby in ''I Spy,'' 1965-68) - or Benson (1979-86), the butler who transforms himself into a lieutenant governor.
Today, blacks are doing much better on TV than they are in real life, an irony underscored by the use of black public figures (Mr. Cosby, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Bobby Ferrin) as spokesmen for major businesses. When Mr. Cosby, deadpan, faces the camera squarely and says, ''E. F. Hutton. Because it's my money,'' the line blurs between Cliff Huxtable's successful career and Mr. Cosby.
This helps to explain why ''Cosby'' makes some people uncomfortable: As the dominant representation of blacks on TV, it suggests that blacks are solely responsible for their social conditions, with no acknowledgement of the severely constricted life opportunities that most black people face. What's troubling about the phenomenal success of ''Cosby,'' then, is what was troubling about the earlier popularity of ''Amos 'n' Andy'': it's not the representation itself (Cliff Huxtable, a child of college-educated parents, is altogether believable), but the role it begins to play in our culture, the status it takes on as being, well, truly representative.
As long as all blacks were represented in demeaning or peripheral roles, it was possible to believe that American racism was, as it were, indiscriminate. The social vision of ''Cosby,'' however, reflecting the minuscule integration of blacks into the upper middle class (having ''white money,'' my mother used to say, rather than ''colored'' money) reassuringly throws the blame for black poverty back onto the impoverished.
This is the subliminal message of America's weekly dinner date with the Huxtables, played out to a lesser extent in other weekly TV encounters with middle-class black families, such as ''227,'' ''A Different World,'' ''Amen'' (Sherman Helmsley is a lawyer), and with isolated black individuals, such as the dashing Blair Underwood on ''L. A. Law'' and Philip Michael Thomas on ''Miami Vice.'' One principal reason for the failure of Flip Wilson's ''Charlie & Company'' was the ambiguity of his class status; Wilson's character, Charlie Richmond, was an office worker at the Department of Highways, his wife (Gladys Knight) a schoolteacher. Wilson once joked, acidly, that he was the star of the black version of ''The Cosby Show,'' which may have been true in ways that he did not intend.
 
The Great 'Amos 'n' Andy' Debate
 In 1933, Sterling Brown, the great black poet and critic, divided the full range of black character types in American literature into seven categories: the contented slave; the wretched freeman; the comic Negro; the brute Negro; the tragic mulatto; the local color Negro, and the exotic primitive. It was only one small step to associate our public negative image in the American mind with the public negative social roles that we were assigned and to which we were largely confined. ''If only they could be exposed to the best of the race,'' the sentiment went, ''then they would see that we were normal human beings and treat us better.''
Such a burdensome role for the black image led, inevitably, to careful monitoring and, ultimately, to censorship of our representations in literature, film, radio and later television. The historian W. E. B. Du Bois summarized this line of thinking among blacks: ''We want,'' he said in 1925, ''everything that is said about us to tell of the best and highest and noblest in us. We insist that our Art and Propaganda be one. We fear that the evil in us will be called racial while in others it is viewed as individual. We fear that our shortcomings are not merely human but foreshadowings and threatenings of disaster and failure.'' And the genre about which we were most sensitive, Du Bois wrote, was comedy. ''The more highly trained we become,'' he wrote in 1921, ''the less we can laugh at Negro comedy.''
One of my favorite pastimes is screening episodes of ''Amos 'n' Andy'' for black friends who think that the series was both socially offensive and politically detrimental. After a few minutes, even hardliners have difficulty restraining their laughter. ''It's still racist,'' is one typical comment, ''but it was funny.''
The performance of those great black actors - Tim Moore, Spencer Williams and Ernestine Wade - transformed racist stereotypes into authentic black humor. The dilemma of ''Amos 'n' Andy,'' however, was that these were the only images of blacks that Americans could see on TV. The political consequences for the early civil rights movement were thought to be threatening. The N.A.A.C.P. helped to have the series killed.
What lies behind these sorts of arguments is a belief that social policies affecting black Americans were largely determined by our popular images in the media. But the success of the ''Cosby'' show has put the lie to that myth: ''Cosby'' exposes more white Americans than ever before to the most nobly idealized blacks in the history of entertainment, yet social and economic conditions for the average black American have not been bleaker in a very long time.
To make matters worse, ''Cosby'' is also one of the most popular shows in apartheid South Africa, underscoring the fact that the relationship between how whites treat us and their exposure to ''the best'' in us is far from straightforward. (One can hear the Afrikaaner speaking to his black servants: ''When you people are like Cliff and Clare, then we will abandon apartheid.'') There are probably as many reasons to like the ''Cosby'' show as there are devoted viewers - and there are millions of them. I happen to like it because my daughters (ages 9 and 7) like it, and I enjoy watching them watch themselves in the depictions of middle-class black kids, worrying about school, sibling rivalries and family tradition. But I also like ''Cosby'' because its very success has forced us to rethink completely the relation between black social progress and the images of blacks that American society fabricates, projects and digests.
But the ''Cosby'' vision of upper-middle-class blacks and their families is comparatively recent. And while it may have constituted the dominant image of blacks for the last five years, it is a direct reaction against the lower-class ghetto comedies of the 70's, such as ''Sanford and Son'' (1972-77), ''Good Times'' (1974-79), ''That's My Mama'' (1974-75) and ''What's Happening!!'' (1976-79). The latter three were single-mother- dominated sitcoms. Although ''Good Times'' began with a nuclear family, John Amos - who had succeeded marvelously in transforming the genre of the black maternal household - was soon killed off, enabling the show to conform to the stereotype of a fatherless black family.
Even ''The Jeffersons'' (1975-85) conforms to this mold. George and Louise began their TV existence as Archie Bunker's working-class neighbors, saved their pennies, then ''moved on up,'' as the theme song says, to Manhattan's East Side. ''The Jeffersons'' also served as a bridge between sitcoms depicting the ghetto and those portraying the new black upper class.
In fact, in the history of black images on television, character types have distinct pasts and, as is also the case with white shows, series seem both to lead to other series and to spring from metaphorical ancestors.
 
Pure Street in A Brooks Brothers Suit
 Let's track the evolution of the ''Cosby'' type on television. While social engineering is easier on the little screen than in the big city, Sterling Brown's list of black stereotypes in American literature proves quite seviceable as a guide to the images TV has purveyed for the last two decades. Were we writing a new sitcom using these character types, our cast might look like this - contented slave: Andy, Fred Sanford, J. J. (''Good Times''); wretched freeman: George Jefferson; comic Negro: Flip Wilson; brute Negro: Mr. T (''The A-Team''), Hawk (''Spencer: for Hire''); tragic mulatto: ''Julia,'' Elvin (''Cosby''), Whitley (''A Different World''); local color Negro: Meschach Taylor (''Designing Women''); exotic primitive: Link (''Mod Squad'' 1968-73); most black characters on MTV. If we add the category of Noble Negro (Cliff Huxtable, Benson), our list might be complete.
We can start with George Jefferson, who we might think of as a Kingfish (''Amos 'n' Andy'') or as a Fred Sanford (''Sanford and Son'') who has finally made it. Jefferson epitomized Richard Nixon's version of black capitalism, bootstrap variety, and all of its terrifying consequences. Jefferson was anything but a man of culture: Unlike the ''Cosby'' living room, his East Side apartment had no painting by Jacob Lawrence or Charles White, Romare Bearden or Varnette Honeywood. Despite his new-found wealth, Jefferson was pure street, draped in a Brooks Brothers suit. You did not want to live next to a George Jefferson, and you most certainly did not want your daughter to marry one.
''The Jeffersons'' was part of a larger trend in television in the depiction of black men. We might think of this as their domestication, in direct reaction to the questing, macho images of black males shown in the 60's news clips of the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers and the black power movement. While Jefferson (short, feisty, racist, rich, vulgar) represents one kind of domestication, a more curious kind was the cultural dwarfism represented by ''Diff'rent Strokes'' (1978-86) and ''Webster'' (1983-87), in which small black ''boys'' (arrested adolescents who were much older than the characters they played) were adopted by tall, successful white males. These establishment figures represented the myth of the benevolent paternalism of the white upper class, an American myth as old as the abolitionist movement.
Indeed, one central motif of 19th-century American art is a sculpted tall white male (often Lincoln) towering above a crouched or kneeling adult or adolescent slave, in the act of setting them free. ''Webster'' and ''Diff'rent Strokes'' depict black orphans who are rescued from blackness and poverty, adopted and raised just like any other upper-middle-class white kid, prep schools and all. These shows can be thought of as TV's fantasy of Lyndon Johnson's ''Great Society'' and the war on poverty rolled into one.
The formula was not as successful with a female character: An attempt to use the same format with a black woman, Shirley Hemphill (''One in a Million,'' 1980) lasted only six months. ''The White Shadow'' (1978-81) was a variation of this paternal motif, in which wild and unruly ghetto kids were tamed with a basketball.
These small black men signaled to the larger American audience that the very idea of the black male could be, and had been, successfully domesticated. Mr. T - whose 1983-87 ''A-Team'' run paralleled that of ''Webster'' - might appear to be an exception. We are forced to wonder, however, why such an important feature of his costume - and favorite fetish - was those dazzling gold chains, surely a subliminal suggestion of bondage.
This process of paternal domestication, in effect, made Cliff Huxtable's character a logical next step. In fact, I think of the evolution of the Huxtable character, generationally, in this way: imagine if George Jefferson owned the tenement building in which Florida and her family from ''Good Times'' lived. After John Amos dies, Jefferson evicts them for nonpayment of rent. Florida, destitute and distraught, tries to kill George. The state puts her children up for adoption.
They are adopted by Mr. Drummond (''Diff'rent Strokes'') and graduate from Dalton, Exeter and Howard. Gary Coleman's grandson becomes an obstetrician, marries a lovely lawyer named Clare, and they move to Brooklyn Heights. And there you have it: the transformation of the character type of the black male on television.
And while Clare Huxtable is a refreshingly positive depiction of an intelligent, successful black woman, she is clearly a descendant of ''Julia'' (1968-71), though a Julia with sensuality and sass. The extent of typecasting of black women as mammy figures, descended from the great Hollywood ''Mammy'' of ''Gone With the Wind,'' is astonishing: Beulah, Mama in ''Amos 'n' Andy,'' Geraldine (''Flip Wilson,'' 1970-75), Florida, Nel in ''Gimme a Break'' (1981-88), Louise (''The Jeffersons''), Eloise (''That's My Mama,'' 1974-75).
 
Is TV Depicting A Different World?
 And what is the measure of the Huxtables' nobility? One of the reasons ''Cosby'' and its spin-off, ''A Different World,'' are so popular is that the black characters in them have finally become, in most respects, just like white people.
While I applaud ''Cosby's'' success at depicting (at long last) the everyday concerns of black people (love, sex, ambition, generational conflicts, work and leisure) far beyond reflex responses to white racism, the question remains: Has TV managed to depict a truly ''different world?'' As Mark Crispin Miller puts it, ''By insisting that blacks and whites are entirely alike, television denies the cultural barriers that slavery necessarily created; barriers that have hardened over years and years, and that still exist'' - barriers that produced different cultures, distinct worlds.
And while ''Cosby'' is remarkably successful at introducing most Americans to traditional black cultural values, customs and norms, it has not succeeded at introducing America to a truly different world. The show that came closest - that presented the fullest range of black character types - was the 1987-88 series ''Frank's Place,'' starring Tim Reid and his wife Daphne Maxwell Reid and set in a Creole restaurant in New Orleans.
Unfortunately, Mr. Reid apparently has learned his lesson: His new series, ''Snoops,'' in which his wife also stars, is a black detective series suggestive of ''The Thin Man.'' The couple is thoroughly middle class: He is a professor of criminology at Georgetown; she is head of protocol at the State Department. ''Drugs and murder and psychotic people,'' Mr. Reid said in a recent interview. ''I think we've seen enough of that in real life.''
But it is also important to remember that the early 70's ghetto sitcoms (''Good Times'' and ''Sanford'') were no more realistic than ''Cosby'' is. In fact, their success made the idea of ghetto life palatable for most Americans, robbing it of its reality as a place of exile, a place of rage, and frustration, and death. And perhaps with ''Cosby's'' success and the realization that the very structure of the sitcom (in which every character is a type) militates against its use as an agent of social change, blacks will stop looking to TV for our social liberation. As a popular song in the early 70's put it, ''The revolution will not be televised.''

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
Her Style Is Imitable, but It's Her Own

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
Bette Midler struck fear into the hearts of advertisers with her recent legal victory over Young & Rubicam. The agency had bought rights to use ''Do You Wanna Dance,'' which Ms. Midler had remade into an early-1970's hit, for a Ford commercial. When Ms. Midler refused to participate, it hired one of her former backup singers to imitate her. Ms. Midler sued, and in a precedent-setting decision, a Federal District Court jury in Los Angeles awarded her $400,000 in damages.
While the decision is couched as a matter of property rights and celebrity prerogatives, it also recognizes aspects of popular music that have eluded lawmakers - and it has fascinating, potentially thorny ramifications, as it raises in a new form the question of how music can mine its own past. 
The case didn't involve copyright. Copyright law protects two aspects of music: the parts of a composition reducible to sheet music -words, melody, chords - and the original sound recording. But the agency had followed the law by making an agreement with the publisher to use the song, and not drawing directly on Ms. Midler's 1972 recording of it. Sidestepping those issues, the Midler case treats vocal style as property, like a star's recognizable face or public image. Where critics have long written about ''trademark'' vocal styles, the law now loosely agrees with them.
Some advertisers have said the ruling may threaten their ''creativity'' - a fairly ludicrous term for the use of deliberately imitative sound-alikes. Increasingly through the 1980's, advertisers have been using well-known music to get a foot in the door, then switching from golden oldie to sales pitch. It's like having a long-lost pal call out of the blue to sell you insurance. Most copyright owners, who often aren't the original performers, won't turn down the extra cash; surprisingly few performers think it harms their artistic credibility to shill for beer or cars or home appliances.
Until now, those few performers willing to turn down advertisers' blandishments - to reserve their fans' affection for themselves, not a product - have been at the mercy of sound-alikes. Performers who don't own their repertory, like Ms. Midler, could be imitated; performers who control their songs could, nonetheless, have their style imitated, down to their vocal tone, the length of their phrases and their choice of guitars. That's because copyright law doesn't protect an element every bit as essential to music as words, melody and harmony: timbre.
The sound of a piece of music - violins or log drums, a saxophone section or a synthesized rhythm track - is the first thing the ear picks up, and timbre registers much faster than melody or harmony. While it takes two or three notes, at least, to name that tune, a snippet of James Brown or Led Zeppelin sampled on a rap record is enough to trigger a sense of familiarity (though whether that sense of familiarity constitutes a copyright infringement is an open question).
That's because a major part of producing records is to create a distinctive sonority for a song, so that it's instantly recognizable when it turns up on the radio. Producers spend expensive studio hours fine-tuning the tones of drums, guitars, voices. Even in less commercial areas, timbre is a vital component; the now hallowed Blue Note jazz albums of the 1960's were defined not just by their musicianship but by the etched instrumental tones achieved in Rudy Van Gelder's recording studio.
It's no wonder the copyright laws tread lightly in the area of timbre, since tone quality is hard to quantify. European music notation doesn't take timbre into account, although tone makes all the difference between, say, competent operatic singing and diva-level greatness. Even the English language has remarkably few words to describe sounds. (Music critics sometimes pine for a vocabulary of tone colors to match the minute gradations of visible colors; just think of all the kinds of reds.) At the same time, timbre is music's current frontier. Amplification brought vastly expanded choices to singers and instrumentalists; synthesizers, which can create previously unheard tones or warp existing sounds beyond identification, add infinitely more. Paradoxically, amid the brave new noises we long for older, identifiable sounds to orient ourselves in the information barrage. Many advertisers are happy to exploit that longing. No one I know will be unhappy if sound-alikes go the way of medicine shows, and I can't wait to find out whether companies can still get away with those ads that grab the ear with a familiar-sounding voice, then try to cover themselves by saying ''celebrity imitator'' at the end. But the Midler case could open an economy-size can of worms. When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Ms. Midler to proceed with her suit, it stated that imitation for ''informative or cultural uses'' was not actionable. But there are all kinds of copycats on the loose.
A rock style that becomes popular usually creates a slew of imitators; half of the record business invariably busies itself chasing last year's trends. And some imitators can profit handsomely. When the originators of a style turn into superstars and start to take years between albums, imitators rush into the empty niches - as happened when Men at Work, and later the Outfield, exploited the absence of new albums by the Police, or when Stacey Q and Debbie Gibson took the Top 40 slots that would have been allotted to Madonna.
Some performers have platoons of disciples - is there a female jazz singer who doesn't have a hint of Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington, or a decent country singer who doesn't imitate Hank Williams? And speaking of Hank Williams disciples, Bob Dylan has plenty of sound-alikes, all those ''new Dylans'' that have popped up in the last two decades.
I can see it now: Bob Dylan in Los Angeles Federal court, filing suit against Bruce Springsteen, John Cougar Mellencamp, Lou Reed, Roger McGuinn, Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Steve Forbert, Elliott Murphy et al., winning a huge settlement - and then being forced to hand it over to the estates of Hank Williams, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Buddy Holly, Woody Guthrie, Elvis Presley and half a dozen obscure blues singers. The Midler case may make some advertisers less unscrupulous, but it's also a reminder of all the musical debts that go forever unpaid.

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS;
Tempos That Tell More Than Time

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
Three recent albums of almost nonstop brilliance by the pianist Andrew Hill, 52 years old, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan, 55, and the flugelhornist Art Farmer, 61, are good examples of how, for jazz musicians, age amplifies control. The critic Hugh Kenner once wrote that art is the accumulation of detail; in jazz, detail derives from constant playing and the experience that comes with age.
On all three albums the nuances come through in the tempos. Each performer uses carefully shaded speeds to reach emotions often overlooked by younger musicians. The tunes creep ominously, or they stumble or slink; the unusual tempos can extract longing, fear and alienation from a composition, or warmth and love. Avoiding cliche, they make all three albums, in varying degrees, advertisements for the pleasures of classical jazz orthodoxies. 
Age in jazz also bestows, if not a loss of nerve, a retreat from the aggression and hardheadedness of youth into the embracing arms of tradition. The challenge for older musicians is no longer to destroy the rules of jazz, but to use them as freely as possible. All three albums show how jazz orthodoxies can be subtly distorted to yield the pleasures that long ago vanished under cliches.
Andrew Hill's ''Eternal Spirit'' (Blue Note 7 92051; all three formats) features a quintet with Greg Osby on alto saxophone, Bobby Hutcherson on vibes, Rufus Reid on bass and Ben Riley on drums. It is the first album Mr. Hill has released in nearly 20 years that captures the rigorous logic and experimentalism of his string of Blue Note albums in the 1960's. An eccentric pianist whose best work exhibited the possibilities of combining new (for jazz) meters with impressionistic harmonies, he was eclipsed by McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock, the two dominant jazz pianists of the 1960's.
Mr. Hill is more abrupt, more iconoclastic than either of them. His pieces scuttle sideways, crablike, or settle into brooding, stormy emotionality. On ''Eternal Spirit,'' which he prepared in a five-day stint at the Knitting Factory in Manhattan, his pungent yet elliptical compositions, laden with a feeling of cold anomie, are underscored by tempos that grind against conventional speed and feel dislocated and slightly uncomfortable. On ''Pinnacle,'' a classically angular tune, the tempo inches forward, uncertainly and with bluster; an alternate take found on the CD offers a slightly brighter version, which changes the mood radically.
It also changes the solos. Mr. Osby is an extraordinary young musician, whose improvisations pair hurtling lines with jangling, abstract melodies and are among the album's high points. On the original take of ''Pinnacle,'' he measures out a tender solo that jars the harmony into releasing unexpected colors. On the second take, he sounds as if he were in a burning house, with all the doors slowly shutting; nervous and skittish, he races through the tune.
Age allows for other nuances as well. In ''Mood Indigo'' (Antilles 7 91320; all three formats), Frank Morgan has made his best album ever. Some credit goes to the wise production work of John Snyder, which intersperses duets between Mr. Morgan and the pianist George Cables with quartet sections, two tunes featuring the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and a snippet of an unaccompanied bass solo by Buster Williams. There is also a short talk at the end by Mr. Morgan. The effect is like chapters in a book, keeping a plot unfolding and breaking the tedium.
Mr. Morgan is one of jazz's most personal and passionate soloists, and the album rarely breaks into more than a trot; its mood is autumnal and intimate, full of lovers' whispers. The tempos, withholding easy gratification, help the mood, but Mr. Morgan's playing, constantly varied in rhythm and tone, does most of the work. Nowhere is this more evident - and it's helped by a recording that captures every breath - than in his duets with Mr. Marsalis.
Mr. Marsalis's opinions may be subject to debate, but his technical prowess isn't; he's an adept soloist. Mr. Morgan, however, makes him sound merely talented. On ''Bessie's Blues,'' set at the sort of relaxed tempo that allows musicians to take their time and reach a profound level of improvisation, Mr. Marsalis solos first, carefully. Harmonically sophisticated and well plotted, his solo sounds preconceived. Mr. Morgan comes in, playing with the rhythms of Mr. Marsalis's last phrase, bending notes, tagging flourishes to bold statements of melodies. Phrases wheel off, ending in flutters; Mr. Morgan varies his tone from line to line, reaching a climax with clear yelps, then descending into woolly and round honks. At times evasive and oblique, he'll suddenly confront a listener with a tough melody. Like a good boxer, he's continuously resourceful, jabbing from all angles.
A subdued, intimate mood also prevails on Art Farmer's ''Ph. D.'' (Contemporary 14055; all three formats), which features the guitarist Kenny Burrell and the saxophonist Clifford Jordan in the front line as well.
Mr. Farmer, who lives in Vienna but came onto the California scene in the late 1940's as one of the most gifted of the second generation be-boppers, is often described as a lyrical musician. He's more than that. Having trimmed all the fat from his playing, he's become a minimalist. The smallest rhythmic intensification is picked up and magnified; lines and melodies are likely to be separated by long inhalations of breath. On a tune like James Williams's ''Ph. D.,'' set at an anxious, creeping tempo, Mr. Farmer's dreamlike flugelhorn floats gently, occasionally flickering. The perfectly shaped albums Mr. Farmer has been releasing for the last three years have all had Mr. Jordan on them, and he is simply extraordinary here, with clearly defined ideas that march up melodic steps, then bounce into the basement, riding a low honk.
Like the other two albums, ''Ph. D.'' is well conceived and arranged. There is a sense in all the recordings that decisions have been made, that the economics of jazz, usually horrible, have for once allowed the composers the time and capital to realize their visions. The shades and nuances of the music argue for the merits of age. It's not an argument likely to be heard - jazz, like the rest of American culture is enthralled by youth - but the subtle manipulations of standard material offer a way out of stagnation.

HEADLINE: From Cash Cow To Cash Machine

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Romeo J. Ventres knows exactly what he wants Borden Inc. to be when he retires in December 1991. He wants it to be the lowest-cost producer of all its products, from milk to pasta to plastics to glue. He wants it to have a decent mix of national and regional brands. He certainly wants it to be independent - a year ago, he and Borden's top 25 managers agreed to quit simultaneously in the event of a hostile takeover. But most important, he wants Borden to be a ''perpetual cash machine.''
Sounds almost like science fiction, but the 65-year-old Mr. Ventres, who has been Borden's chief executive since 1986, sees it as a practical goal - so much so that on Thursday, he told analysts that, over the next two years, Borden would spend $650 million to expand its plants, and would increase its advertising budget by between $75 million and $100 million.
Mr. Ventres's idea of a perpetual cash machine is a company that spends heavily to persuade consumers that its branded products, including even garden-variety items like milk, are better than generic versions. That means those brands can command premium prices, which, when combined with more efficient plants, means high margins - and more money for yet more advertising. 
It is all logical - but until now, it was also eminently undoable for the New York-based Borden. An effective advertising blitz requires two things: money, and products distributed widely enough to justify spending that money. Borden, thanks to the hefty cash flow that its dairy business provides even in bad times, has always had access to the money. The products, though, were a different story.
Borden used to be a crazy quilt of a company with a sizable stable of regional brands as unrelated as waffles and car-care products, but with most of its capital tied up in cyclical businesses like commodity chemicals and milk.
But since he took over, Mr. Ventres has been tinkering with the product mix and the organization chart to provide what he calls a ''critical mass'' of high-growth products. He has spun off commodity chemicals and 20 other businesses, accounting for about $932 million in annual sales, because they did not fit in to what he has designated as Borden's six ''strategic growth areas'': dairy, pasta, snacks, niche groceries like canned seafood or cheese substitutes, non-food consumer products like Elmer's Glue, and industrial films and adhesives.
And he bought even more quickly than he sold. Since 1986, Borden has spent $1.7 billion to buy 77 small companies. The purchases more than doubled the number of Borden's plants and pushed the company's annual sales to $7.2 billion last year - up 11.2 percent from 1987 - and its net income to $411.9 million, 16.8 percent higher than in 1987. More importantly, they gave Borden a nationwide distribution system and a stable of brands to take national through that system: Creamette pasta, Krunchers! kettle-cooked potato chips, Classico pasta sauces and a handful of others.
Now Borden's simultaneous slash-and-build strategy has peaked. On Sept. 28, Mr. Ventres announced that he would sell 20 of Borden's lowest-margin dairy plants, effectively shrinking Borden's mainstay dairy business by a third. He also said he would close 45 sundry grocery and snack plants, and transfer the products being made in them to existing, more modern plants, or to so-called hyperplants - huge, multiproduct facilities - that would be built with part of that $650 million Mr. Ventres committed last week.
''What all the acquiring has done is given us distribution, an ability to consolidate manufacturing and a shot at national brands,'' Mr. Ventres said in a recent interview in his Park Avenue office. ''We now have the mass to go for economies of scale.''
The short-term cost of the move is high: Borden set up a pretax reserve of $571 million to cover the plant-closing costs and severance payments to the approximately 7,000 of Borden's 46,000 workers who will lose their jobs. The company is likely to end this year between $47 million and $58 million in the red. Next year does not promise stellar returns either.
 
Mixed Reviews
 The restructuring is playing to mixed reviews on Wall Street. Borden's stock jumped $2.25, to $36.75 right after Mr. Ventres laid out his plans, yet fell a few days later, as investors realized how sparse the short-term payoffs would be. Mr. Ventres's spending announcements Thursday did not help, either.
Now some analysts wonder whether Mr. Ventres has cut too far into product lines, while others say he has not cut far enough. ''He's selling those dairy plants at the bottom of the dairy cycle,'' said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Bache who has a ''hold'' recommendation on Borden stock. With the 1988 drought long over, Mr. McMillin notes, pasture land and corn for feeding dairy herds is in greater supply, which means that milk will be cheaper to produce. ''He overreacted to a couple of bad quarters,'' Mr. McMillin said. ''Long-term returns would have been best served by sticking it out.'' William Leach, a food analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, has only a ''weak'' buy recommendation on Borden stock, in good part because he feels Mr. Ventres is holding onto too much. ''It is ludicrous for one company to be in wall coverings and in pasta, and a strategic growth category like non-food consumer products can include half the G.N.P.,'' he said. ''I'd like to see them divide into two companies, with food in one and non-food in the other.''
Not surprisingly, Borden executives shrug off such comments. ''It's simple - we got rid of plants in areas that were oversupplied with dairy products,'' said Richard W. Fowlkes, president of the dairy division.
Anthony S. D'Amato, president of Borden's packaging and industrial products division, also gives his critics short shrift. ''A lot of packaging goes into food wrap, and the processes for making plastic film aren't that different from making pasta,'' he said. ''And we are the No. 1 company in the world in wall coverings. Why would we want to get rid of that?''
 
Confusion on the Street
 Still, Borden's diverse product mix has always given Wall Street a bad time. In 1986 Mr. Ventres set targets of 15 percent annual growth in earnings per share, 18 percent return on equity and assorted other goals. He has either met or exceeded each. Yet Borden's price/earnings multiple remains low. At the start of October, Borden stock was selling at about 84 percent of its earnings growth rate, compared with 120 percent for other food companies.
One reason is that investors have a hard time understanding Borden. Food analysts are not comfortable judging performance of, say, adhesives, while chemical analysts dismiss Borden as a food company.
Moreover, Borden has a somewhat chaotic structure. Although its official headquarters are in New York, nearly all of its executives are in Columbus, Ohio. Analysts grumble that they never get to see them. ''These are nameless, faceless people to us, and we need a chance to ask them questions,'' said William F. Maguire, an analyst with Merrill Lynch who nonetheless recommends that investors buy Borden stock.
Making matters worse, Borden's six strategic growth areas are crammed into four divisions that seem to have been put together by aimlessly throwing darts against an organizational chart.
Snacks, for example, are lumped together with international consumer products. Creamette pasta, a product that Borden is working hard to turn into a $120 million national brand, sits in the same group with niche groceries and specialty products, items whose very strengths are their regional nature. ''Their segment reporting really confuses analysts,'' said Mr. Leach.
Mr. Ventres, a strong-willed but even-tempered man, does not get riled by such criticism. Why keep the line people in expensive space in New York, he asks, when it is only he and the 20 or so legal, public relations and financial people on the corporate staff who need to be near the analysts and bankers? And as for the haphazard segments, ''Sure, some day we may set up separate divisions for high-growth areas like pasta or snacks,'' Mr. Ventres said. ''But for now, more divisions just means higher head count and more overhead. And that's the last thing I want.''
Indeed, cost-cutting seems as high a priority as advertising at Borden. In that sense, Mr. Ventres is returning to his roots.
In 1957, after receiving a degree in chemical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, he joined Borden's polyvinyl chloride operation in Leominster, Mass. In 1974 he left Borden to join a specialty chemicals company. When that company was sold five years later, Mr. Ventres returned to Borden as group vice president of the company's chemical division. He rose swiftly through the commodity chemical ranks, and was named Borden's president in 1985.
 
Learning the Business
 That same year, Gene Sullivan, then the chief executive, designated Mr. Ventres as his heir. So Mr. Ventres set about learning the food side of the business. He discovered that two cultures were living side by side at Borden: a commodity business, which invariably competes on price and thus revolves around keeping costs low, and branded foods, which stresses marketing and brand awareness rather than costs.
Mr. Ventres set out to meld the two cultures. He formed 12 teams, each a mixture of people from food and chemicals, and sent them to all the company's plants to see how they would improve on operations.
One team figured out how to make vegetable oil go further in snack processing. Another suggested closing aging ReaLemon and Cracker Jack plants in the Chicago area, and moving their production to a far newer Wyler's plant - the first of what has become a whole cadre of multiproduct plants at Borden. All told, the team approach yielded nearly $12 million in savings, and spawned an awards program for suggestions to improve safety and productivity that is still continuing.
Mr. Ventres insists that Borden will now concentrate on consolidation and cost-cutting. And when asked, his four divisional presidents - one of whom will probably succeed Mr. Ventres in two years - dutifully tick off the ways to wring out savings.
But they get most animated when they talk of growth. George J. Waydo, president of Borden's snacks and international consumer division, notes that his division has already grown from $800 million in sales and no national brands in 1986 to probably $2 billion in sales and three national brands - Krunchers!, Cheez Doodles and Wise Premium Choice Popcorn - this year. ''Five years down the road I'd like to think we'll see at least $2.5 billion in sales, and five or six national brands each doing at least $100 million or more,'' he said.
Jon G. Hettinger, president of the grocery and special products division, has put his emphasis on ''getting our cost structure right.'' But pasta, which has already tripled in sales in four years, and the company's fast-growing food-service business have his heart. Already, he is talking about a new hyperplant for pasta, and is ready to go national with a new microwavable pasta.
In food service, which sells to restaurants, schools and other institutions, he has been pushing high-volume, low-margin items like vats of mayonnaise and vegetable oils, and low-volume, high-margin items like single-serve packets of condiments and sugar substitutes. Now, he wants to produce many of those items in one plant. Even the dairy business - where soaring raw milk prices and intense competition have forced margins as low as 2 percent in some areas - is looking for growth. ''There are all kinds of new products - new yogurt flavors, say, or low-sodium cottage cheese, or lower-fat items - that we can create, and new markets that we can develop with advertising,'' said Mr. Fowlkes, the dairy chief.
And, despite Mr. Ventres's insistence that Borden is now in a ''consolidation phase,'' there is always a chance for more acquisitions. As Mr. Waydo put it, ''There is never a shortage of small businesses to buy.''

HEADLINE: WEEK IN BUSINESS;
Hopes Are Rising For Lower Rates By STEVE DODSON

 BODY:
The credit market took hope from signs of an easing in Fed monetary policy. On Tuesday the Fed added money to the banking system when the Federal funds rate was at 8 11/16, bringing the rate down to 8 1/2 percent. But when the rate went below that, to 8 3/8, the Fed acted to drain money from the system, leading analysts to conclude that the easing would be limited. Southwest Bank of St. Louis, a small institution that often is the first to move on rates, cut its prime rate to 10 percent, from 10.5 percent, but no big banks immediately matched the cut. The Fed's actions came in a confusing week, with the Treasury forced to delay its auctions while awaiting Congressional action on the national debt. But once the debt ceiling was raised to $3.12 trillion, the auctions began, and they confirmed a lowering of rates. The three-year notes sold at an average yield of 7.77 percent, the lowest since February 1988.

 Venezuela is buying the 50 percent of Citgo it does not already own. The $675 million deal will make Venezuela the first OPEC member nation to own a large American oil refiner and marketer. Three years ago Venezuela bought half of Citgo for $400 million from the Southland Corporation, which operates the 7-Eleven stores and is trying to reduce the debt taken on in a $4.9 billion buyout in 1987.

 American and Japanese industries agreed to cooperate in developing high-definition television. The accord reached between American semiconductor makers and Japanese electronics companies offered no guarantees on the amount of American parts that would be used in Japanese-made HDTV sets but it could help insure that the two nations use the same standard for the new technology.

 A change at the top of Ford is scheduled for March 1. The company's chairman, Donald Petersen, said last week he would retire and be replaced by the vice chairman, Harold Poling, pictured at right. Mr. Petersen, who is 63 years old, has led Ford since 1985. Mr. Poling, 64, has been vice chairman for two years and has also been serving as chief operating officer. Ford said he would be chairman for three years and then retire . . . Lewis T. Preston, 63, will retire at year-end as chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company. He will be succeeded by Dennis Weatherstone, 58, the banking company's president since 1987 . . . Alberto Vitale, president and chief executive of Bantam Doubleday Dell, will succeed Robert L. Bernstein as chairman of Random House.

 The stock market spent the week trying to bounce back from a 47-point plunge on Monday. The effort did not quite succeed, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at 2,625.62, down 3.90. Computerized program trading got much of the blame for the Monday selloff, but disappointing corporate earnings were also cited. The ''junk bond'' market, in a severe downturn most of this autumn, showed some signs of recovery, although the price gains were confined to the higher quality issues. Gold prices reached three-month highs near $390 an ounce but were backing off at week's end.

 Braniff ceased its airline operations and put itself up for sale. The decision halted the 46 daily flights Braniff has been operating since filing for Federal bankruptcy protection in late September. Braniff had about 30 percent of the market in its hub at Kansas City, Mo., with flights to 11 cities. Most of its 1,800 employees faced layoffs.
Plans for 2,000 layoffs were announced by Wang Laboratories. The computer company, based in Lowell, Mass., has already cut 5,000 jobs in recent months. The new reductions will bring its work force down to about 22,000 . . . Shearson Lehman Hutton warned its employees to expect more layoffs, and officials said privately that 700 to 800 jobs would be eliminated . . . The Jacksonville Shipyards in Florida said it would close in January, dismissing 1,500 workers, unless a buyer is found by year-end.
 
*
 The producer price index rose four- tenths of a percent in October, somewhat more than expected. But with food and energy excluded, the increase was only one-tenth of a percent . . . Consumers sharply slowed their taking on of new debt in September, adding only $606 million. The August figure was $2.66 billion.

HEADLINE: The Great Real Estate Rush of '89

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
They are the dogs of real estate.
Take the Ramada Inn in east Dallas. Burned out and encased by barbed wire, it is hardly a place where tourists would want to stay. Or the Alta Mesa shopping center in Fort Worth, a strip of vacant buildings. And then there are miles and miles of raw land in places no one wants to go. All these are for sale, thanks to the savings and loan crisis, and will soon be marketed by the Government in what promises to be the biggest real estate sale in the nation's history.
Nearly $300 billion in assets from busted savings institutions - mortgages, commercial loans and real estate - is about to fall into the Government's hands as part of the savings industry bailout. Most of this will be quickly packaged and sold, largely by selling whole savings institutions outright. But some $100 billion, most of it in Southwestern real estate, will remain with the Government to sell piecemeal. And getting these properties to market is expected to be a painstaking process that could extend well into the next century. 
These are not the shimmering office buildings that gild the Dallas skyline, but rather the thousands of ill-conceived and ill-financed projects that now litter the Texas landscape. ''We're in the real estate business,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the new Government agency created to handle these sales. ''We're neck deep and sinking.''
What the Government is being asked to do is indeed overwhelming: Sell hundreds of millions of dollars of distressed properties, with a minimal staff, in a depressed region and under intense Congressional scrutiny. ''This is so much bigger than anything anyone has had to deal with,'' said Gene C. McQuown, a vice president at the asset management firm of J. C. Robert Company of Texas. ''It's going to be traumatic.''
Yet just how the Government fares in selling these properties will determine the final tab of the savings unit debacle. The cost to taxpayers, now estimated at $50 billion, could easily rise into the hundreds of billions of dollars if these properties remain unsold for long. Every day, the Government incurs enormous carrying charges on these properties - taxes, upkeep and financing costs. And if the assets are sold for too little or too late, the taxpayer will have to make up the shortfall.
 
Thorny Issues
 Right now, the Government is trying to resolve a series of thorny issues that have a direct bearing on how much more risk the taxpayers may have to bear: will the Government provide seller financing? Can the Government sell so much property without driving real estate prices down further? Will the Government be able to keep fraud and abuse from seeping into the program?
Many of the better properties will likely be scooped up by Wall Street investors with an eye for a bargain. Such firms as Goldman Sachs & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are said to be amassing funds of hundreds of millions of dollars to speculate on these parcels. But with few lenders providing money for Texas real estate, the Government may be forced to provide financing to attract buyers to the less attractive properties, putting additional taxpayer dollars at risk.
''The willingness of the R.T.C. to provide liquidity may be critical,'' said Richard Peiser, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate Development at the University of Southern California. ''But if there are massive defaults on notes backed by the Government, the Government could be required to come into this crisis again.''
While some people in the Southwest fear that the sudden sale of so many properties in such a distressed region will only further depress real estate values there, others believe that the real danger is that the Government will move too slowly. The Government will not actually sell the properties itself, but will oversee an army of private contractors - appraisers, attorneys, asset managers and brokers - who will do the work. The process could easily get mired in bureaucratic inefficiency, which some say would only cause the costs of the bailout to rise and could also keep the Southwestern economy on hold.
The Government, fearful that some of the high-flying operators that helped cause the savings unit crisis could land on its doorstep once again, is drafting a tight new ethics policy. But, some say, it is so strict that it eliminates virtually anyone who has done business in Texas real estate in the last decade - conceivably even such experts as the Trammell Crow Company and and the Gerald D. Hines Interests.
Many in the Dallas real estate community say the proposed guidelines eliminate those who the Government needs the most, while admitting those who are small or inexperienced and are therefore more likely to bungle the job.
As the Government sorts through these issues, Dallas is getting ready. ''There's anxiety in the Dallas real estate community,'' said David W. Gleeson, president of the Lincoln Asset Management Company, one of Dallas's largest real estate firms. ''It's anxiety that they won't get a piece of the action.''
The city has been hit hard by the savings and loan collapse. As the industry here boomed in the mid 1980's, so did real estate - in part because of the increased liquidity available for property development, and in part from the wild speculation in real estate by the savings unit operators, using depositors' funds.
As the real estate market collapsed from overbuilding and the oil crisis, savings and loan institutions began to experience losses. And as they sank, the real estate market fell even further - reducing employment, too. But the bailout will probably bring jobs to the region, said Joe Foster, vice chairman of BEI Real Estate Services, a real estate consulting company. ''It's going to keep a lot of people warm and dry.''
Right now, the trust corporation is setting up shop in Dallas, one of four regional offices. The regional director, Carmen J. Sullivan, is currently hiring about 2,000 employees to oversee the contractors who will handle the sales. There are also about 1,000 employees at the trust corporation's office in Washington, which sets overall policy and handles the sales of whole savings units.
Since arriving in Dallas last August, Ms. Sullivan has been meeting with the Dallas real estate community and compiling an inventory of the properties that are coming her way. With a portfolio whose value is estimated at more than $50 billion, Ms. Sullivan ''is the most popular gal in Texas right now,'' said Mr. Gleeson, of Lincoln asset management. ''Her name is a household word.''
 
Missing a Chance
 ''Anybody who is a player in Texas real estate is going to have to work with the R.T.C.,'' said G. Ronald Witten, president of M/PF Research Inc., a Dallas real estate research firm. ''If you don't, you will miss out on a substantial share of the market.''
That is why the ethics guidelines are of such concern among Dallas's real estate community. As proposed, they would prevent the Government from contracting with anyone who - or whose partners or employees - has ''demonstrated a pattern or practice'' of theft or misuse of depositors' funds, or has caused ''substantial'' loss to the Federal insurance funds for savings associations.
But Dallas developers say the Government has cast too wide a net. For instance, they say, legitimate developers may be barred from Government contracts because their real estate ventures were foreclosed when the market collapsed or because they borrowed money from a bank that failed.
''Virtually anyone doing anything in the 1980's in the Southwest would not pass a single conflict-of-interest test,'' said Mr. Gleeson of Lincoln asset management. ''These guidelines virtually eliminate a high percentage of the real estate market who are qualified to do the work.'' Jim Leslie, chief financial officer of the Staubach Company, said: ''This affects every major player in Dallas.''
There is no disagreement that those real estate speculators who contributed to the problem should be precluded from benefiting from the cleanup. A steady stream of real estate executives has been traveling to Washington, where trust corporation officials are trying to decide such matters as what exactly constitutes a ''substantial'' loss. David C. Cooke, executive director of the trust corporation, admits that no matter how carefully the rules are written, the program is so big that fraud is inevitable.
''With $30 billion to $40 billion in assets up for management, that's a lot of money changing hands and a lot of potential,'' Mr. Cooke said. ''We hope to monitor our contractors, but with so much money the temptation may be too great.''
Yet the real risk to the taxpayer, in terms of dollars, is not the losses that could be caused by fraud, but the costs that could be incurred if these properties are not disposed of in quickly. Selling distressed properties is difficult, and it could take years to bring many of them to market.
Often, they are in disarray - vandalized, half-finished or in need of some improvements to stop further deterioration. For others, records are often sketchy if not nonexistent, making it difficult to provide potential buyers with economic data. In many cases, the Government does not have clear title to the assets and may have to wage costly court battles with a variety of parties, including borrowers or their partners.
''Each one of these assets has its own complexity,'' said Jim Pendley, national marketing director of the Federal Asset Disposition Association, a quasi-governmental organization that has sold about $760 million in real estate properties from savings units under contract with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. (Assets from all savings units that failed before 1989 are being liquidated by the F.S.L.I.C. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The R.T.C. will manage the rest.) ''There's seldom clear title,'' added Mr. Pendley. ''In some states, like Florida, where judicial foreclosure is difficult, we've had properties that have taken three years to get title to.''
In addition, many properties are of questionable market value. Many were not built because they made economic sense, but merely as devices to generate fee income for high-flying savings units. And some 40 percent of the real estate the Government will inherit is raw land, often large parcels located so far from developed areas that they have little economic value.
''A lot of these properties were poorly designed and poorly built,'' said Mr. Leslie of the Staubach Company. ''We went through the free and easy money days from the savings and loan industry, and they got into a lot of developments that have no business being there.''
 
Skunks in the Pile
 The trust corporation is not deterred. ''We do have a lot of skunks as far as our assets go,'' said Lamar C. Kelly Jr. director of the asset and real estate management division at the trust corporation. '''And we're going to put a prom dress on them and make them queens of the prom. But, it won't be an easy effort.''
As a result, the Government is unlikely to get top dollar for these properties. ''People are buying a future when they are buying that property,'' said Philip Montgomery, president of Montgomery & Company, a Dallas real estate firm. ''There's a market for these assets - but it's at a price.''
Further depressing prices, the trust corporation's properties have to compete with other distressed real estate that will be coming on the market as the savings unit crisis deepens. The trust corporation is taking over any savings unit that has failed since January and any that fail in the future.. So far, the R.T.C. has $95.6 billion in assets from some 256 failed savings units. The corporation's figures another 250 shaky units will eventually come its way.
There already are about $16 billion in real estate assets in the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from banks and savings units that failed prior to 1989.
There are also distressed real estate assets being marketed by regional banks like NCNB Texas, which recently bought two failed Texas banks and a failed savings unit. NCNB Texas is working through an $11 billion troubled loan portfolio from those deals. And other banks and financial groups that buy Texas savings units from the Government are expected to put parts of their real estate loan portfolios on the market. Timothy P. Hartman, vice chairman of NCNB Texas, expressed an attitude shared by many. ''We don't intend to invest in troubled real estate loans. We're primarily interested in building a deposit franchise.''
 
Low Prices
 Many in Dallas are already citing a host of additional reasons why the Government may get low prices.
One is appraisals. Appraisals in such a distressed market are extremely difficult to make and are quite often meaningless. Traditional valuation measures like replacement costs or comparable sales are worthless when properties are selling for less than their replacement costs and when recent sales are few and far between.
At the same time, many Dallas appraisers, heavily criticized and even sued for overly optimistic appraisals during the boom years, have since become extremely conservative. And that may push down the selling prices for the Government's properties.
''Appraisals are where the rubber meets the road in real estate,'' said Mr. Montgomery of Montgomery & Company. ''But to understand appraisals, you have to understand their fear of being sued. And that's helping drive down prices in many areas.''
 
Drawn Out Process
 What is more, the appraisal process may be drawn out. The ranks of Dallas appraisers, who know the market best, thinned after the market collapsed, causing backlogs. The wait is now 90 to 120 days.
Yet under current regulations, the Government requires that all properties have two appraisals and that no property be sold for less than 95 percent of its appraised value. In practical terms, this slows down the selling process as a buyer waits for the two appraisals. It also forces the Government to sell properties at 95 percent of an appraised price that is highly subjective and may or may not reflect market values.
Not only is the trust corporation having to steer through a thicket of issues, but it is being watched closely every step of the way. There are currently no less than six Government bodies overseeing and auditing the trust corporation's operations, including two Congressional committees. In addition to carrying out its assigned tasks, the trust corporation will have to tread carefully to keep political controversy at bay.
''With every decision we make and every letter we write, we have to adopt the attitude that, in conducting our business, someone may take exception,'' said Ms. Sullivan of the Dallas office.
Ms. Sullivan only has to look across town to the Federal Asset Disposition Association for a cautionary tale. The association was formed several years ago to sell real estate from troubled savings institutions taken over by the F.S.L.I.C. - almost the identical job that the resolution trust corporation is being asked to do.
But the association ran was widely criticized in Washington forspending too much and selling too little. Much of the association's trouble, many say, stemmed from the fact that it never mastered the political ways of Washington and failed to explain to legislators that the asset disposition is a long and tedious process.
Today, the association, which nevertheless gets high marks from real estate experts for its professionalism, is being sold by the Government to a private buyer. Bids for the association have been accepted, although no deal has yet been announced.
 
Open to Criticism
 ''A lot has got to happen before the R.T.C. can start marketing properties,'' Mr. McQuown said. ''And the public sector doesn't understand that. That's where F.A.D.A. failed. It didn't educate others as to how the process worked.''
No matter what the trust corporation does, it is open to criticism: if it sells a property for too little, if it holds a property too long, if it pays a contractor too much or hires the wrong one, if a property is mismanaged. Any perceptible mistakewill be grist for the various oversight bodies, once the process gets into full gear.
''They've got to come up with bulletproof processes to protect themselves from flak,'' Mr. McQuown added. He knows this all too well. In his previous job, he was the Dallas regional manager for the disposition association. In that capacity, he said, ''I always lived in fear that I would sell something for the F.S.L.I.C., someone would flip it and it would be in the paper.''

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN BLACK ENTERPRISE;
Promising Prospects Despite Recent Setbacks

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER C. WILLIAMS; Christopher C. Williams is a writer based in New York.

 BODY:
Black Americans in recent years have made powerful political strides. Their business successes have been less brilliant, but many civil rights activists hope that blacks can push into the economic mainstream in the 1990's. And recent changes in Federal assistance programs for minority-owned businesses and President Bush's campaign pledge to help these companies could fuel their cause. 
''Minority business development will be the hot topic of the 90's,'' said Harriet R. Michel, president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council Inc. in New York, which matches corporate clients with minority suppliers.
Blacks have come a long way since the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Having gained experience in the public sector in such areas as finance and real estate, many blacks have moved into the private arena. In the last few years, a few forceful role models have emerged, like Reginald Lewis, who in 1987 led the $985 million leveraged buyout of Beatrice International Foods. Another sign of their entrepreneurial success: Annual revenues of the nation's top 100 black businesses increased by 368 percent since 1979, to $5.7 billion last year, according to Black Enterprise magazine.
Yet blacks still face formidable obstacles. Black businesses have historically struggled to get financing, making their failure rate high and stifling their ability to expand. In fact, minority-run companies today account for less than 1 percent of the sales of American businesses, according to the Department of Commerce.
The tone set by the Reagan Administration has also been crippling. Not only did the Administration oppose affirmative action, but it also repeatedly tried, without success, to dismantle the Small Business Administration, which helps finance many minority-owned companies.
And in January, the Supreme Court ruled in Croson v. Richmond that the city's minority set-aside program for public contracts was unconstitutional. Minority contractors, who had previously been guaranteed 30 percent of Richmond's public contracts, now win only about 2.5 percent of them.
The decision has had a ripple effect. It has prompted cities across the country to suspend or review their programs and has brought other Government incentive programs designed to help minorities under legal attack.
''We are seeing the legacy of the Reagan era,'' said Anthony Robinson, president of the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., a legal advocacy group.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Economic Crossroads

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAO PAULO

 BODY:
On the eve of its first direct presidential election in nearly 30 years, Brazil, the giant of Latin America, stands frozen at an economic crossroads. Frustrated by a decade of economic stagnation, Brazil's 82 million voters will now decide the path the Western world's eighth-largest economy will take in the 1990's.
One school of candidates is offering the classic Western prescription for economic growth in the third world, a path now being followed by Mexico, among others: trade liberalization, more foreign investment and far less state ownership of industry. The other group of candidates in a very crowded field is offering the classic blueprint of Latin American development usually associated with the left: higher wages, land for the landless and at least a temporary moratorium on payments of foreign debt. Brazil has $110 billion in debt, the most in the developing world.
The outcome of the election is impossible to predict. But business leaders say that if the voters choose the pro-Western, free-market course, Brazil will emerge in the next decade with glittering, Pacific Basin-style growth rates. They say that a leftist victory, however, would seriously wound the country, already hobbled by social tension, four-digit inflation and capital flight. 
Fueling social combustion, Brazil has one of Latin America's widest gaps between rich and poor. In a nation where three-quarters of the voters earn less than $125 a week, Brazil's conservative military maneuvered for decades to avoid a direct vote for the presidency, fearing a victory for the left. The voting this Wednesday will be the first such election since 1960; since 1964, presidents have been chosen by the military or by a civilian electoral college.
''All long-term plans are on hold,'' Timothy A. Durkin, a Citibank vice president, said of the nervous business mood in this city, often known as the ''locomotive'' of Brazil. ''I know of several $100 million-plus projects that are tabled until the situation is defined.''
With no clear frontrunner in the 22-candidate race, Wednesday's voting is expected merely to clear the field, leaving the two highest vote getters to face each other in a runoff Dec. 17. The winner of the runoff will succeed President Jose Sarney in March.
At stake is the future of Latin America's largest market, with 144 million people. A favorite of American bankers and investors during the high-growth years of the 1960's and 1970's, Brazil lost its allure during the 1980's, when economic growth fell to an average of less than 2.9 percent a year, barely pacing population growth.
Business executives attribute the stagnation to several causes: oil price shocks, a net outflow of capital to service the foreign debt, economic mismanagement that led to gyrating inflation rates and a highly controlled domestic economy that proved increasingly unattractive to investors.
 
Big Trade Surplus
 Despite all that, Brazil last year racked up a $19 billion trade surplus, the third-largest in the world after Japan and West Germany. Once largely an exporter of agricultural goods - coffee and the sugar to sweeten it - Brazilian factories now send overseas a panoply of manufactured goods: airplanes, steel, tanks and shoes.
The surge of manufactured exports and Brazil's barriers against imports have led to conflicts between Brazil and the United States. United States officials last May gave Brazil 18 months to lower its barriers or face retaliatory tariffs. Although some import tariffs have edged down, Brazil remains, in the words of a recent Bank of Boston report, ''very much a closed economy.''
Last year, for example, Brazil bought only $4.2 billion worth of American goods, less than what was purchased by Venezuela, which has one-eighth of Brazil's population.
In response, Brazilians say they have to keep import barriers high in order to record a trade surplus that can be used to service the foreign debt. American bankers lead the list of creditors of the $65 billion commercial portion of the debt.
In September, Brazil quietly stopped servicing the foreign debt, in what was seen as a temporary, improvised move. But the debt remains a burning issue in the presidential campaign. Indeed, two strong left-wing contenders have made the debt public enemy No. 1.
Leonel Brizola, a Socialist former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, and Luis Inacio da Silva, a trade unionist known as Lula who has strong Marxist backing, have blamed it for a wide range of ills - from stifling the economy to spurring inflation, now at an annual rate of 1,300 percent.
The two candidates are calling for a formal moratorium on payments while auditors review the debt and far more favorable terms can be negotiated - a process that could easily take a year.
A victory of the left would probably cause further strains with the United States. Dismissing as insufficient Washington's country-by-country debt-relief plan, the leftists say that Brazil should lead a coalition of debtor nations. In the 1980's, such coalitions never got beyond the talking stage. But this could change with an energetic leftist at the head of Brazil.
A milder stance on the debt has come from the frontrunner of the center-right, Fernando Collor de Mello, a former governor of Alagoas state.
But the campaign rhetoric, which is expected to sharpen during the second round of the election, may well force the new president to adopt an unrealistic position on debt negotiations after being inaugurated for a five-year term next March 15.
Many American banks are now in a stronger position to resist Brazil's pressure and to cut off new lending. This year, many banks raised their loan-loss reserves, effectively taking early losses on Brazilian loans.
''We can now be tougher at the negotiating table, because we have very little to lose,'' said one American banker in Rio.
In the third world, the secondary debt market serves as an informal barometer of international assessment of a nation's debt management, political stability and general economic policies.
In Latin America, Chile and Colombia, two careful money managers, score high - their debt securities trade for about 65 percent of face value. Mexico and Venezuela, two countries that this year adopted decisive economic programs featuring free-market reforms, score in the medium range - about 40 percent.
 
Hitting Rock Bottom
 Last week, Brazilian debt securities hit their lowest point ever - 21 cents on the dollar. Among the major debtors, only Argentina (at 18 cents) and Peru (6 cents) scored lower.
Meanwhile, confidence in domestic debt securities issued by Brazil has dropped so low that the Government is paying real interest rates of 6 percent a month to attract lenders. Analysts calculate that Brazil's internal debt has increased 50 percent this year, to about $120 billion, roughly a third of the country's gross domestic product. By comparison, Mexico's internal debt has declined as a percentage of G.D.P., to 28.6 percent at the end of 1988, from 33.3 percent the year before.
The lack of confidence reflects the Brazilian Government's increasingly precarious hold on the economy. In the last 15 years, tax collection has dropped from 17 percent of G.D.P. to 9 percent. And with an estimated 90 percent of this year's budget going to pay salaries for the state's 8 million employees, the Government has resorted to printing or borrowing money to pay for nearly everything else, fueling inflation.
It is even unclear whether Brazil's economy can make it to March 15 without disintegrating into the kind of hyperinflation that sparked widespread street rioting in Argentina after presidential elections there last May. With the emergency, Argentina's new President, Carlos Saul Menem, was able to galvanize bipartisan support for a tough anti-inflation program - raising taxes and public utility rates, cutting Government subsidies and selling money-losing state companies.
 
Waiting for a Disaster
 ''Unlike Argentina, we have not yet had a disaster - only a half-disaster,'' said Roberto Campos, a senator and economist who advocates a similar set of tough measures for Brazil. Under a new Constitution, Brazil's Congress wields strong powers over economic policy. But there is no consensus in Congress for an emergency program, Senator Campos said.
Looking ahead, a diplomat in Brasilia concurred: ''A key issue is whether the next president will be able to mobilize huge sectors of the population and Congress for an economic salvation program.''
In Sao Paulo business circles, there is growing support for cutting the state sector and for opening Brazil to foreign investment and imports.
''The closing of our borders keeps us inefficient,'' said Jose E. Mindlin, president of Metal Leve, a Brazilian-based multinational auto-parts manufacturer.
Antoninho Marmo Trevisan, the president of an economic consulting group here, predicted that the budget shortfall will force the Government to start dismantling the state empire of 230 companies.
''Whoever wins, whether it is Lula or Collor, he will have to privatize if he wants to build schools, roads and health clinics,'' Mr. Trevisan said, advocating selling the money-losing state companies to a mix of foreign and local investors.
But it is unclear whether the voters will follow the recent prescription of a Sao Paulo newspaper: ''Less government, less misery.''
''We may go with the half-measures of Brizola, or with the wrong-headed radicalism of Lula,'' Senator Campos said of the 1990's. ''Then we will have to wait another five years for Brazil to grow again.''

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: PERESTROIKA GOES SOUTH;
Auctioning Off the National Patrimony

BYLINE: By NATHAN P. GARDELS; Nathan P. Gardels is editor of New Perspectives Quarterly, the journal of the Center for Study of Democratic Institutions.

 BODY:
Although world attention is focused on the drama of Communist reform, the statist systems of Latin America are undergoing an ideological restructuring that is no less radical than perestroika. New leaders like Argentina's Carlos Saul Menem and Mexico's Carlos Salinas de Gortari are bent on privatizing their economies and opening them to the international market. The fierce nationalism that once led the Latin American states to close their borders is giving way to the hope, not unlike Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's, of fully joining the world economy in order to develop.
So far, the new reforms have gone farthest in Mexico. In an unusually candid conversation about Mexico's reforms, Foreign Minister Fernando Solana recently outlined a program that, in the eyes of still powerful nationalistic forces at home, amounts to selling off the previously untouchable pillars of the national patrimony. 
While Mr. Solana acknowledges the central role of the state in building Mexico's foundation as an industrializing nation, he believes that central role is now over. He looks primarily to the private sector to competitively integrate Mexico into the world economy. ''State investment and broad participation in the economy was very important during the stage of 'import substitution.' But the strategy was overused. It outlived its time,'' said Mr. Solana. ''Now Mexico has matured. It is time to join the great transformation to a global economy that is taking place today.''
In a radical departure from economic practice since the time of Mexico's revolution in 1914, the borders have been cast open to foreign investment. Under Mexico's newly promulgated 1989 foreign investment regulations, foreigners may own 100 percent of businesses in a surprising range of sectors from agriculture to livestock, building and contruction, magazines and newspapers, air navigation to legal and financial services. And in many areas, Mexico is less protectionist than the United States.
In August, the Chase Manhattan Bank announced it had put together a consortium to purchase 25 percent of Mexicana Airlines, once the Government's flagship enterprise. In the same month, the Government announced that the largest state-owned mine in Mexico would be allowed to go bankrupt.
According to Mr. Solana, the state's share of the economy has rapidly been shorn to only 6 percent of gross domestic product. In the last two years alone, state-owned enterprises have been reduced by 75 percent, to 300 companies from 1,200. In the petrochemical area, which was nationalized in 1938, the number of products subject to nationalization has been reduced to 30 from 200. Remarkably, Mr. Solana defined only the railroads, electric power plants and the extraction and trade of oil and uranium as the remaining core of nationalization. ''Everything else,'' he said, ''is open to privatization.'' But, will the strategic opening of the protected Latin American or Eastern Bloc economies work? There is as yet no evidence - anywhere in the developing world - that opening previously closed economies to the unkind winds of international competition has resulted in improved living standards. Quite the contrary, it is inevitable that living standards will fall in the near term. Given the very low productivity rates from Mexico City to Moscow free competition with Japan, the United States and Europe threatens to decimate whatever national economic foundation domestic protection was able to build. And with the removal of subsidies on everything from Mexican tortillas to Polish bread, the consumer will be hit as hard as the worker.
Yet there is no going back. And, in reality, there is not much choice for farsighted leaders like Carlos Salinas or Mr. Gorbachev. As uncertain as a future of market reforms may be, it necessarily proceeds from the certainty that the past strategy of import substitution in the case of Latin America inevitably ends in stagnation. Both are incapable of surpassing uncompetitive industrialism and partaking of the high wages and dynamism of a global economy driven by information technology.
The great danger in Latin America as well as in the Eastern Bloc, is that the pain of restructuring will kill a renewed faith in the future born from shedding old ways. Yet the success of these reforms is crucial to a promising future for the post-industrial West. It would thus seem a more responsible course for the United States to search for ways to cushion the transition than gloat over capitalism's triumph.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: PERESTROIKA GOES SOUTH;
Privatizing Will Make Life Worse

BYLINE: By MICHAEL HUDSON; Michael Hudson is an economist and international financial consultant in New York.

 BODY:
I attended the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington last month. When the meetings ended, I was left with the impression that no further writedowns would be forthcoming for Latin America's debtor countries unless they followed the lead of Mexico. To do this, countries like Brazil and Argentina would have to sell off their public utilities, some potentially profitable industrial corporations and some service industries like airlines.
In the past, one met mostly bankers at these big international meetings. Now there are a lot of lawyers. 
For Latin America the foreclosure process has begun, but for the time being it is called privatization or debt-for-equity swaps. Countries hoping to borrow more money from creditor-nation governments, the I.M.F. and the World Bank, are being told to help themselves by relinquishing ownership of their basic economic infrastructure.
In advocating this brave new world of privatizing hitherto public monopolies, these local investors and their partners, the international banking and investment community, cite a number of truisms.
Private-sector managers will run enterprises more efficiently, the proponents of privatization say.
This argument has merit, as far as it goes. But it should be remembered that the troubled savings and loan institutions in Texas were all privately run businesses.
But more important, in the United States and Europe there exists a balance between private profitability and the public's need for popularly priced power, transport and other services. This balance is insured by public regulatory agencies and is backed by antitrust legislation.
But few Latin American or other third world economies have ever had to develop these regulatory traditions because their governments have owned the major public utilities and other monopolies. The fact that private ownership of these enterprises will be a new experience for these countries means that it may not have the same salutary consequences as in the United States.
Proponents of privatization say that a sell-off of utilities will reduce government budget deficits. They argue that privatization will turn government-owned businesses, which are often fiscal drains on a country, into private tax-paying entities. As a result, lower federal deficits may help slow the endemic inflations that plague most debtor economies.
But for the population at large, shifting the economic burden away from government (and hence the taxpayers) may turn out to be largely illusory. For what the government saves in subsidies may be paid by users of these utilities in the form of higher power, phone and transport rates charged by the new proprietors.
Fortunately, there are alternatives to the above scenarios. The most obvious one is to keep these monopolies public but restructure them as truly independent corporations by bringing in the best management possible. The alternative to badly run public enterprise is not necessarily privatization, but better administration with effective checks and balances against incompetence and malfeasance.
A second option is to put public regulatory and antitrust legislation in place before it is too late. The objective is to hold privatizers to their promises by making them absorb the penalty for their own possible inefficiency, by enjoying lower profits rather than extorting higher rates from consumers. After all, why should third world populations deserve less than the United States in this respect?
Whatever option is chosen, the possible outcomes are relatively clear. If the new purchasers of public utilities are foreign, it will constitute a retrogression from neocolonialism back to direct colonialism. If domestic investors buy a nation's economic infrastructure, they will achieve a higher degree of power than has been attained by investors in the United States and Europe. The upshot of this may be an unprecedented economic polarization in countries where wealthy citizens already have a strong influence on government.
But the most likely outcome is an alliance between wealthy local families and foreign banks and other international investors. That would give the takeover process a cosmopolitan patina.
One way or another, the debt-into-equity conversion represents a foreclosure on the mismanaged economies of the third world. But behind the rhetoric of today's privatization, one must always ask, Qui bono? Who will benefit from the prospective economic changes? In my opinion, it will be the rich and the creditor banks who benefit from these schemes. For the people in general, and for public-employee labor unions, privatization means that life may well be more expensive in the future.

HEADLINE: THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER;
At the Front in the Battle Over Unix

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Even though the Unix operating system is 20 years old, it seems as if the battle over the one ''true'' Unix has been going on since the Crusades. The war is far from over, but in recent weeks the field has narrowed to two major versions of the operating system. One is controlled by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and supported by an advisory group called Unix International; the other, scheduled for delivery next year, is being developed by a group called the Open Software Foundation, whose goal is to come up with something not controlled by A.T.&T.
If Unix came in only one flavor, life would be easier for everyone. But two versions are certainly better than the more than 200 that existed at one time, and it appears that the rival camps are prepared to co-exist for a while. ''My interpretation is that Unix International seems to have a slight edge in momentum,'' said Kevin O'Neill, vice president of research and consulting at the Business Research Group, a subsidiary of Connors Publishing Inc. of Newton, Mass. 
The latest move toward a unified standard was the development of A.T.& T.'s Unix System V version 4.0, announced earlier this month at Unix Expo in New York. Version 4.0, flying the banner of Unix International, unites several of the more popular variations, including Berkeley, Xenix and SunOS. SunOS was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., which has been one of the fastest-growing makers of work stations.
When A.T.& T. bought a stake in Sun last year, the alliance led the International Business Machines Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation and more than 100 other equipment makers to form the Open Software Foundation in an attempt to keep A.T.& T. from giving Sun an unfair advantage in the work-station market.
The foundation has reportedly switched recently from a core technology developed by the International Business Machines Corporation to one hatched at Carnegie-Mellon University. That ''in some minds calls into question their timetable,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''Both camps have a significant list of companies that are committed to them, but with version 4.0 on the table now, there might be some defections from O.S.F.''
The fact that analysts are even discussing Unix, let alone dissecting its turf wars, is significant. From its ivory-tower beginnings in science and academe, Unix has emerged as a significant operating system for businesses, especially those that use big computers as a hub for a network of terminals, in contrast to those that use groups of powerful personal computers linked in local area networks, or LAN's. The latter are expected to be based on the OS/2 operating system developed by the Microsoft Corporation and I.B.M.
The recent rise in popularity of Unix has been the result of several related factors: the growth of networked computer systems, the increasing sophistication of corporate computer users who want multi-user and multi-tasking ability, and the availability of powerful work stations capable of using Unix in retail computer stores at relatively low prices. The idea that Unix systems would be sold in mainstream computer stores would have been unimaginable several years ago. In recent months, however, Apple Computer Inc., the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Dell Computer Corporation and other personal computer makers have been touting the Unix capabilities of their systems.
''Unix is no longer a sleepy little pocket-protector operating system deep in the bowels of Harvard, M.I.T. and the data processing department at the Pentagon,'' said John McCarthy, director of professional systems research at Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
''On the other hand, Unix isn't the be-all and end-all yet,'' Mr. McCarthy hastened to add. ''You aren't going to put Unix in the office and have every computing problem you've had disappear. But A.T.& T. and Sun Microsystems are moving to eliminate a lot of the traditional headaches of Unix, the most damning of which was that there were so many versions.''
Although Unix offers such important features as allowing several users to share the same sets of data, and for several applications to be active on screen at once, Unix is unlikely to become a dominant operating system. DOS, OS/2 and the Apple Macintosh OS are more popular. However, many analysts say Unix is capitalizing on the relatively slow acceptance of OS/2, which was introduced two years ago and which is expected to be the most widely used operating system in the 1990's. A version of OS/2 that is promised for next year will match many of the features found in Unix today.
Unix can run on computers built around the industry-standard 80386 and 80486 microprocessors made by the Intel Corporation as well as on reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, chips from Motorola Inc., I.B.M., Intel and others. The ability to run on a variety of systems, including personal computers, work stations, minicomputers, mainframes and even supercomputers, is a major advantage over other operating systems.
The profusion of Unix versions came as computer makers added their own proprietary features in an attempt to make their systems competitive with others. That resulted in a hodge-podge of incompatible Unix versions.
Then the computing environment changed. A decade ago, most corporations bought all their computers from a single vendor, like I.B.M. or the Digital Equipment Corporation. There was no need to choose the flavor of Unix, since each vendor sold its own.
Today, according to figures supplied by Compaq, 80 percent of large corporations buy their computer equipment from multiple sources. Having a common operating system that can operate on a wide number of machines has become a critical issue.
''Given the accelerated rate of change in business and the world economy, customers can't be tied to artificially constrained operating systems and tied down to one vendor,'' Mr. McCarthy explained.
Still, even supporters of Unix dispute how successful the operating system will be in the business environment. Doug Michels, vice president of the Santa Cruz Operation Inc., a Unix system software developer in California that is partly owned by Microsoft, said he expected Unix to equal the market share of OS/2. But Steve Balmer, a senior vice president at Microsoft, said last week that Unix will always be a small niche player in businesses.

HEADLINE: BEYOND THE WALL;
Not Just One German Question But Many

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN

 BODY:
OF all the startling images on the night of Nov. 9, perhaps the most gripping was the sight of Germans streaming from both sides through the brightly illuminated Brandenburg Gate.
For 40 years it had stood as a symbol of Berlin's fate, a battle-scarred relic of a grand history gone wrong, a gate stranded in no man's land in the middle of the wall through which passage was banned in either direction. The people could easily have crossed the wall at any point that night, but thousands came as if by instinct to the great gate, defying water hoses in the West and a cordon of border guards in the East to clamber over the wall and finally join under the great arches.
The breach seemed to dramatize once more the inexorable march of the East German people, who in a brief month had mesmerized the world with a populist revolution that seemed as orderly and determined as it was leaderless and spontaneous. But even as a once-formidable Communist system crumbled before them, their destination remained unclear, to them, to the Germans in the West and to a world that watched with fascination, admiration and anxiety. 
''The German question will remain open just as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed,'' the West German state President, Richard von Weizsacker, said a few months ago. But now that the gate was opened, the questions seemed to gape ever broader. What was really in the hearts of the Germans perched atop the wall and chipping at its concrete? Would they bring a forced coupling of the Germanys, destabilizing Europe, threatening the strategic interests of the superpowers, undermining the process of European economic integration?
Was reunification in fact imminent? Or did the end of enforced division paradoxically clear the way to an amicable separation? Once they were granted a genuine option, would the majority of Germans in the East choose to maintain and build their socialist homeland?
Willy Brandt, who was Mayor of West Berlin when the wall went up and who won a Nobel Peace Prize for shaping the complex compromise with the East that came to be known as Ostpolitik, summed up the excitement and the uncertainty when he declared from the steps of the city hall: ''This is a beautiful day after a long voyage, but we are only at a way station. We are not at the end of our way.''
Over four decades, ''reunification'' has assumed various connotations. In West Germany it has been a guiding myth, enshrined in the Constitution but never officially plotted or discussed in front of strangers. In East Germany the notion has been considered treason, implying the dissolution of a nation whose only reason for existing was its ideology. In Moscow, Washington, Paris and London, the concept has been laced with sinister connotations of a Bismarckian monolith in the heart of Europe. In public the Germans were pitied for their division, in private everybody wanted to keep it that way.
Even now that the German question was on top of the world's agenda, answers remained elusive. None of the placards or slogans in five weeks of virtually daily mass demonstrations across East Germany ever raised reunification. If anything, the chants of ''We're staying here!'' spoke of a pride in a separate identity.
In West Germany, too, politicians rejoiced at reunion even as they warned that it was still a long way away. Again and again, Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged the East Germans to stay in their own homeland, promising them large-scale aid if they would work to rebuild their state. The national mood was ambiguous. Many of those who stood teary-eyed at the West Berlin city hall declined to join in the singing of the West German national anthem, which to many Germans remains a symbol of a nationalism they still consider somehow shameful. This was a family reunion, not the reaffirmation of a tribe.
From Moscow came the rumble of caution. It is your right to walk through the wall, the Kremlin seemed to say, but it is our decision when the division will end. It may well be that President Bush, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher whispered a silent amen.
Nobody at this stage seemed ready to predict how things would develop. If there was one thing the October Revolution of 1989 had shown, it was that nobody really controlled the march of the East German people -not Egon Krenz, the new Communist leader, who threw out concession after concession in a headlong retreat before the people; not Mr. Kohl, who could do no more than make room for newcomers and beg remaining East Germans not to come; not Moscow or Washington, which watched their former wards march to a very German tune.
But the very discipline and reasonableness with which the East Germans had largely avoided violence and excess seemed to feed confidence that the process would stop well short of a riotous breaching of the European order. It was, wrote a Marxist historian in Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party newspaper, a ''conservative revolution,'' in which the goal was not to turn the world upside down but to restore it to order, to bring the people back into the ''leading role'' hijacked by a clique of old men, to restore a right as basic as visiting compatriots in a neighboring state.
There was the risk that having tasted the might of people power the Germans could be tempted to drive on into the unknown, pushing for a premature political linkage. The possible ramifications were scary: the military and economic groupings of Europe would collapse in disarray, the new state would command awesome economic and military power, the formidable task of bringing the East German economy to Western levels would tie up all West German resources and effectively disrupt not only West European economic integration, but the revival of other East European states as well.
Little at the moment gave flesh to such a scenario. ''No people on this earth, no people in Europe have to fear if the gates are opened now between East and West,'' declared Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. ''No people have to fear that liberty and democracy have returned to the German Democratic Republic.''
But there was also the sense that politicians on both sides and in both alliances had to confront the real possibility of reunification, even if still far off. The West German Constitution, endorsed by the Western allies, calls for German unity in free self-determination. With the promise of free elections in East Germany, the referendum of the German question was no longer a theoretical goal.
''There will come a day when the Germans in the G.D.R. decide whether they want to form one state with the Germans in the Federal Republic,'' wrote the Frankfurter Allgemeine. ''Then the Federal Republic will have to face up to its provisional character, which will be hard for a lot of people.''
But others argued that the breach of the wall had effectively pushed back the German question by taking away its pain. With free elections and free travel now virtually guaranteed in the East, the wall was reduced to a benign fence between neighboring cousins. Then President von Weizsacker would be proved right in a way he might not have intended: the opening of the Brandenburg Gate would not only make it unnecessary to have a wall, it might also make it unnecessary to take the wall down.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Savings Failure That Illustrates Everything Wrong With the Industry

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in California has come to represent a microcosm - in the extreme, to be sure - of the failure of hundreds of other thrift institutions at a cost to taxpayers of more than $100 billion.
In Lincoln's story are all the elements of the industry's woes: lax state-level regulation, Federal regulation that was hampered by the use of political influence, a highly aggressive, risk-taking entrepreneur, speculative investments, accounting gimmickry, political connections, possible criminal fraud and a huge price tag for failure.
The Government has filed a $1.1 billion civil suit against the thrift's former chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., and his associates, and criminal investigations are under way. The Lincoln failure has proved particularly embarrassing for five Senators who had received large contributions from Mr. Keating and met with regulators on his behalf. 
''Lincoln follows the pattern of all the catastrophic S. & L. failures over the last few years,'' said William Black, district counsel in the San Francisco branch of the Office of Thrift Supervisions, formerly the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. ''It epitomizes the entire debacle.''
Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va., said there were signals from the start that Lincoln would someday collapse. He noted that Mr. Keating was among many businessmen who entered the thrift business in the early 1980's with little or no experience in the highly regulated industry.
Moreover, Mr. Ely said, the struggling thrift in Irvine, Calif., was probably close to insolvent even when Mr. Keating bought it in 1984, and reflected a pattern in which regulators hoped unrealistically that a new owner could turn things around. Experts said that Lincoln's excessive growth should have been the first indication that there would be problems. In the five years between his purchase of Lincoln and its takeover by Federal authorities last April, Mr. Keating had turned a $1 billion institution into one with assets of almost $6 billion.
During the mid-1980's, it was relatively easy to collect vast deposits by offering above-market interest rates, but investing those funds prudently was much more difficult. As it turned out, instead of making relatively safe investments such as home mortgages, Mr. Keating poured money into raw land - a highly speculative investment that only earns a return if it is developed - a huge hotel and other development projects that soon floundered.
 
An Auditor's Help
Moreover, Mr. Black said, with the aid of an outside auditor, Lincoln and scores of other institutions were able to show record profits while hiding the fact that investments were collapsing. In some cases, owners and directors and members of their familiies appeared to reap large rewards from financially anemic institutions. Investigators said Mr. Keating and his family received a total of $34 million in salaries, bonuses and proceeds from stock sales.
One scheme would go something like this: An institution would make a $10 million loan to a developer. But while $10 million in cash would be dispensed, the developer would sign a note promising to pay back $12 million, the $10 million principal, plus $2 million in interest over two years. The $2 million would then be ''booked'' in an interest reserve account, and a certain amount would be credited to earnings from that account every month, even though the builder had not paid back a penny.
And if after two years the builder still could not pay interest on the loan, it would simply be refinanced in the same way with no loss showing.
''You are showing great earnings with all the money going out and no money coming in,'' Mr. Black said. ''That is why some S. & L.'s reported record profits in one year and collapsed the next.''
 
Relaxed Regulation
Lincoln and other institutions enjoyed a lax regulatory environment, particularly from state regulatory agencies, that permitted these practices. In early 1983, California, for example, permitted its state-chartered savings institutions to invest 100 percent of their assets in high-risk real estate projects. It was eventually overruled by a Federal Home Loan Bank Board imposition of a 10 percent limit on such investments.
During 1983 and 1984, California granted more than 200 new thrift charters and in general encouraged aggressive investments, in keeping with local officials' view that tying the industry strictly to home loans was an outmoded rule. Into that environment stepped Mr. Keating, who quickly eliminated almost all of Lincoln's home mortgage lending in favor of junk bonds, raw land and real estate development.
But many of Lincoln's activities began setting off warning bells at the bank board, prompting San Francisco examiners to warn Washington officials as early as August 1986 that Lincoln was insolvent. To keep the regulators at bay, Mr. Keating turned to the political system, and developed extraordinary political clout by generous contributions, on local, state and national levels.
Experts say the money that Mr. Keating distributed to many members of Congress, and his success in getting five Senators to take up his cause with regulators, was matched only by attempts by owners of troubled savings institutions in Texas to get the former House Speaker and Texan Jim Wright to urge regulators to go easy.
''The way Congress's chain was jerked by a few can only be described as extraordinary,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. Mr. Keating, he said, perfected ''the technique of giving a little money up front that would come out of the taxpayer later.''
As a result, Mr. Leach said, Lincoln ''came to symbolize the ideological bent of an Administration that did not realize there had to be some curtailment of deregulation.''

Global Warming Means New Global Politics

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, politicians who wanted to avoid the issue of global warming could duck behind the scientific uncertainties. Now, with soaring public concern for the environment and wide scientific agreement about the nature if not the timing of the problem, the debate has shifted. The question is no longer whether the threat is real, but rather how fast it needs to be countered and at what expense.
As discussion moves from the scientific to the political, the world has split into several factions. Some nations like the United States and Japan are also fighting internal political battles. 
Last week environmental ministers from 68 countries met in the Netherlands and agreed in principle to stabilize emissions of carbon dioxide, the main contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect. But bowing to pressure from the United States, the conference avoided any specific timetable.
Much of the carbon dioxide buildup is caused by the burning of coal and oil in power plants and gasoline in automobiles. Other sources include the burning of tropical rain forests. Cutting back carbon dioxide emissions could require big advances in energy conservation, large investment in renewable fuel sources like solar energy and greatly increased automobile fuel economy.
Deciding to pay the price of prevention is doubly painful because no one can prove just when pollution-induced warming and weather disruptions will begin, if they have not already. Experts warn that if the world waits for incontrovertible evidence of major climate change, it will be far too late to do much about it.
The debate has split the world into three camps. Several industrialized European nations support strong measures to stabilize or reduce the emissions. Third world countries like China and India argue that since they are not responsible for much of the problem they should get financial aid in return for cooperating in measures that could hamper desperately needed economic growth. Three major industrial powers, the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union, advocate more cautious approaches.
In October, the United States led a United Nations-sponsored working group in Geneva to discuss an agreement on global warming. American representatives said they came away from the sessions surprised by the extent of support for faster action to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions.
The tone of the Geneva meeting anticipated what would occur in the Netherlands. In the conference declaration, the participants agreed that stabilization of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be achieved ''as soon as possible.'' Several European nations, led by the Netherlands, had pressed for a commitment to stabilize the emissions by the year 2000 at 1988 levels, and for a 20 percent reduction by 2005.
The Administration favors more study of the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on the climate and wants to pursue the issue more slowly through the United Nations. That approach received support this week from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who called on the United Nations to complete a global warming treaty by 1992.
Not everyone in the Administration supports the deliberate approach. William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is known to have favored a more aggressive posture at the Netherlands conference, but was rebuffed by other Administration officials. A similar internal struggle is apparently under way in Japan, said Richard Mott, a representative of the Environmental Law Institute, a Washington group that closely monitors climate change issues. As in the United States, the forces in Japan that backed a slower approach won the day at the Netherlands conference.
The White House would prefer a general accord at first, followed later by specific commitments. But William Nitze, the State Department official responsible for coordinating Government policy on global warming, suggested at a conference last month that the United States may be unable to resist a commitment to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions if a world agreement is negotiated in the next few years.
In recent weeks, the President has been sharply criticized by environmental groups and members of Congress from both parties for resisting more aggressive action. The critics warned of dire environmental consequences if the United States, which contributes a fifth of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide, failed to take the lead in dealing with the greenhouse effect.
''It may be logical to say that we need more information about the consequences of accepting a plan to freeze emissions of carbon dioxide at current levels,'' said Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania. But on the other hand, he said, ''It is illogical not to weigh the consequences of indecision and inaction on the global environment and our own well-being here in the United States.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Dinkins and the Unions That Supported Him Face Fiscal Bad News

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
STARTING six months after David N. Dinkins's Jan. 1 inauguration as New York City's 106th Mayor and continuing for most of the next six months, contracts with dozens of unions representing the city's 330,000 workers expire, group by group.
Coming at a time of sluggish city tax revenues and rising demand for new spending, especially to meet the needs of the poor and the infirm and to deal with the addicted and the incarcerated, this round of bargaining would do much to define the limits of any new administration. It may be an especially telling period for a new Mayor nominated and elected with strong labor support, especially from the municipal unions.
During the campaign that culminated in his victory last week Mr. Dinkins joined private hospital workers pressing for higher wages and briefly considered supporting a lessening of the penalties under the Taylor law, which bars strikes by public employees. 
But he also indicated his preparation for collective bargaining would include consultation with the Financial Control Board, which was created in the bad old days of profligate spending and would step in if the budget appeared to be slipping out of balance. He has also appointed a panel of economic advisers.
Some union leaders, too, seem mindful of the city's fiscal uncertainties, although given Mr. Dinkins's ascension they may have to cope with heightened expectations among their rank and file. ''We want to make sure David succeeds,'' said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. But he also said, ''I always tell my members, 'David Dinkins is a boss. We supported him, but he's a boss.' '' Former Mayor Abraham D. Beame was also a friend of labor, but as the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's deepened the unions made concessions. During the Koch years, which the unions have now helped end, wages increased at just under the rate of inflation, said Robert W. Linn, the Director of Personnel and Labor Relations. He notes, though, that wages alone are not a true measure of a contract's cost.
 
A Growing Payroll
In any event, what has grown far more dramatically than wages is the size of the city workforce. As New York recovered from its fiscal crisis and then unexpectedly found itself flush with revenue, the payroll swelled by 50,000 new positions in six years. In bad times, that payroll could be ripe for pruning.
''The real issue is what are things going to be looking like next year, when the time comes for the administration to begin its talks with labor,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. ''Clearly you can't have it all, you can't have a significant increase and a large labor force. Maybe you can have neither.''
If the stakes of municipal bargaining have grown, the tactics have also changed. Mr. Linn characterized the 1960's and early 1970's as a time when labor costs ''exploded,'' not only because of wage increases but also through less obvious contract provisions, such as shortening the time it took new employees to reach higher pay levels.
Typically, he said, the cost to the city of such provisions was not fully appreciated. It was also a time, Mr. Linn said, when each union would demand what the previous union received and a little more, forcing the city into ''an endless cycle of catchup.''
During the fiscal crisis the municipal unions bargained in coalitions that began to break up in the mid 1980's. But Mr. Linn said the administration has been able to maintain equal treatment among the labor organizations though ''pattern bargaining,'' in which the city reaches an agreement with one union and uses the cost of that contract - including, he said, the expense to the city of provisions other than wage increases - as a model for settlements with the rest of the workforce. The various unions can then determine how they want to spend the money, deciding how to divvy up the pot between salary and fringe benefits. This type of bargaining has enabled unions to deal with specific needs. For example, Mr. Hill created a fund that was used to improve salaries for hard-to-fill positions like Emergency Medical Service technicians and Human Resources Administration caseworkers without affecting the contracts with all the other unions.
Does pattern bargaining allow enough flexibility for every group? ''I don't think it does,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, who said her union's goal is to make salaries of city teachers competitive with those of teachers in surrounding districts, even if it breaks the pattern. ''That's the way collective bargaining is traditionally carried on,'' she said.
But Mr. Linn sees in such a strategy the danger for the new administration of a return to the time when each union looked out for itself and the city was subjected to what he called ''me, too'' bargaining.
There are other labor issues facing Mr. Dinkins as well. During the Koch years many employees were hired at the discretion of the administration, in some cases bypassing Civil Service. That left the city's personnel system vulnerable to political pressures and patronage, the New York State Commission on Government Integrity found last summer.
And a group of business executives asked by Mayor Edward I. Koch to critique municipal government found among other things that many municipal work places ''are substandard by almost any definition of acceptable employee working conditions.'' In a city strapped for cash, however, that is just one more competing need.

HEADLINE: Two Tyrannies

 BODY:
Historic. Now there's a word journalists love. But what other word is there for democracy's advances last week on German streets, and in the American elections? The dominating demons of our lifetimes are Communism and racism; what is it but historic when the first tyranny shudders and the second continues, visibly, to soften?
Four years ago, four days ago, it was barely imaginable that the East Germans would open the hated wall. Now they can't punch holes in it fast enough. The turmoil is wondrous - and worrisome. 
Before long, Berlin's exultation will wear off. The Germanys will have to find ways to manage the flow of East Germans. The free world must grope for a new equilibrium. Otherwise, the West, having won the cold war, risks losing the hot peace.
In the same week, democracy made less dramatic but more deliberate gains in the United States. The elections did not unsettle the world order. They did produce milestones in the struggle against the interior tyranny of racism, one in which there is no Mikhail Gorbachev to loosen the roots.
A Virginia editor says his state is so conservative that it takes four Virginians to change a light bulb, one to change it and three to say how fine the old one was. It sends a message when an electorate like that, only 15 percent black, gives L. Douglas Wilder enough votes to claim election as the first black governor of any state. Seattle voters, 10 percent black, sent the same message by choosing Norman Rice, a black City Councilman, for mayor.
And racially tormented New York City, where only one voter in four is black, has broadcast the same message even more clearly by electing David Dinkins as its first black mayor. Many black candidates have won mayors' races but usually in cities where black voters predominated. Tuesday's victories demonstrate trans-racial triumphs, once as unimaginable as the end of the wall.
Consider Dallas County, Ala. In 1961, it was half white, half black. But there were 9,000 white voters - and 156 black. Then the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the protests that produced the monumental Voting Rights Act of 1965.
In 1965, there were four black members of Congress. Now there are 23. In 1965, there were 280 black elected officials around the country. Now there are 7,200. But democracy, even with the vote, requires vigilance, as Dallas County shows. Not until 11 months ago, under continuous pressure, did it hold commissioner elections in fairly drawn districts. Three blacks, the first ever, were elected.
What law has changed in the South is yielding to cultural change in the North. David Dinkins attracted many more younger than older voters, a portent of progress. But even so, there's a danger of confusing political and economic progress.
Yes, the proportion of blacks who live in suburbs has jumped, since 1960, from 15 percent to 26; but for whites it's still half. Yes, black husband-and-wife families earn $30,000-plus. That's 82 percent of the white figure, a big gain in 20 years. But nearly half of black families are headed by women, and their income typically is only $11,000.
America knows how to help, with Head Start, for instance. Yet society sputters and stalls. How many eligible poor children are enrolled? One in six. There's much to do, and no mystery about how to do it. The need for early childhood programs is obvious to men like Douglas Wilder, David Dinkins and Norman Rice, and they speak not only for black constituencies. They speak for a country that is moving, messily, unevenly, toward a standard of racial equality probably unknown in history.
There is very far to go, but it's also worth pondering race relations elsewhere. Periodically, Japanese politicians apologize profusely for pronouncing recklessly on the low state of literacy among American blacks. Black visitors to the Soviet Union regularly recoil in disgust at blatant racism. In China last year, students rioted over ''the black devils'' from Africa. Insult, discrimination and deep poverty endure in this country. And yet, as the elections attest, America keeps enlarging democracy.
At the start of the cold war, a magazine ad showed a girl looking up from a history book to ask, ''Mommy, who was Hitler?'' Perhaps one day, a child of this generation will ask, ''What was the Berlin wall? What were Civil Rights?'' The answer depends on Americans' prudence in Europe, and determination at home. ''Victories,'' we may earn the right to say; ''victories for democracy.''

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
The New Europe

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In the disorder of our stunned reactions to the drama playing out in East Germany, we can scarcely begin to see the consequences. But one is clear. Political stability in Europe is going to depend more than ever on the European Community.
Only the Community can provide an alternative political focus for all the European states as, inevitably, the Soviet Union and the United States withdraw military forces from the region and their influence wanes. Only the Community can offer a reassuring framework that will be Europe's economic powerhouse. 
Economics and political ideas drove events in East Germany. The longings for freedom and a better life that first burst out in the 1953 uprising brought East Germans to the streets and across the borders. This time the Soviet leader refused to use force. Mikhail Gorbachev told Egon Krenz: You're on your own.
The moment when Mr. Gorbachev made that decision marked the symbolic end of the postwar order in central Europe: an order maintained by Soviet military force. To have allowed the formation of a non-Communist government in Poland was an enormous change. To doom Communist domination of East Germany was more.
Mr. Krenz is hardly a liberating figure by nature; last summer he applauded China for crushing the students in Tiananmen Square. But he understood what Mr. Gorbachev's decision meant. Without Soviet support for a military response, protest could no longer be contained.
The state was bleeding, its best-trained and most highly motivated people leaving by the thousands. If things went on that way, East Germany would be a country of pensioners. Mr. Krenz's only recourse was to convince citizens - by reason, not by force - that they should stay.
Mr. Krenz opened the gates and promised they would stay open, so people need not seize this opportunity to leave. He spoke of free elections. He allowed an opposition to form without harassment.
But all that is still not enough. East Germans will be persuaded not to vote with their feet only if they have hope of economic improvement. They see West German television, and they know the difference between that standard of living and their own gray existence.
Where can Mr. Krenz look for the investment and aid needed to lift the standards of life in East Berlin and Leipzig and Dresden? Only to West Germany. And that fact has political implications.
Governmental aid from Bonn, large as it already has been, cannot be enough. Private investment is needed. And West German companies will not invest in the East unless they can use the methods that have made them so successful. They will want market conditions. And it looks as though Mr. Krenz is ready to let that happen.
The result of such change in the East German economic system, and of heavy investment from West Germany, must be to bring the two Germanys much closer together. Formal reunification still seems a distant prospect, but there are many ways of association short of that.
In economic terms, the division of Germany is almost certainly going to fade away. A few years from now there will be a German economy with twice the gross domestic product of any other country in Europe. That would surely raise the old fears of German domination - unless the European Community is functioning as it hopes in economic unity and political purpose.
The Community's program to end all trade barriers among members by 1992 is given greater importance by the events in Eastern Europe. Even more vital is the proposal to create a European central bank and a common European currency. For the alternative is domination by West Germany's financial policy and its central bank.
The new realities have a particular meaning for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She has been fighting the Community's plan for financial union, splitting her own Cabinet and Conservative Party in doing so. Now her insistence that Britain must defend its sovereignty by staying aloof from the Community plan looks even more shortsighted.
But there will be consequences for many politicians. Will Vice President Quayle finally understand that Mikhail Gorbachev is really making changes in the Soviet world? Will the Stalinist leaders of Czechoslovakia be able to go on resisting the tide of freedom? Autumn 1989 is only the beginning.

HEADLINE: LAUGHTER, TEARS AND THE PERFECT MARTINI

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel; Alex Witchel is a senior features editor at Mirabella magazine and writes the Inside Theater column for 7 Days.

 BODY:
AR. GURNEY JR. IS AT HIS FAVORITE kind of party - the kind where they don't read the reviews. The occasion is that after 370 performances of the Off Broadway hit ''The Cocktail Hour,'' Keene Curtis, the actor who has been playing the father, is leaving the show.
The party is being held in the empty lobby of the Promenade Theater after a Sunday matinee; the cast is there, a few of their friends. Curtis toasts the other actors with his plastic cup of champagne. He tells them that a friend who saw the play overheard someone announce, ''They should sell T-shirts that say, 'A. R. Gurney knows my family,' '' The cast laughs. They feel good about this, having come under fire - as many Gurney characters do - for playing WASP's who avoid emotional accountability and shun confrontation. The only handicap they acknowledge is on the golf course.
The actors encourage two of the ushers, Hispanic teen-agers, to re-enact a scene between the play's father and son, which they deliver in Spanish. Everyone howls. Everyone except the man who wasn't bred to howl, the man who, instead, stands at the edge of the crowd and broadcasts a smile they could see back in his native Buffalo. 
Gurney is in his element. Wearing crumpled khakis and a blue, button-down shirt (real WASP's don't wear Polo), he looks like a well-meaning guy from somewhere out of town who's having a perfectly marvelous time. Which is exactly what he is. Because after spending 26 years on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty while he struggled to establish himself as a playwright, Gurney, 59, is finished with what his teaching colleague, Richard Douglas, calls ''leading a hyphenated life.'' Having written his first full-length play at the age of 40, Gurney finally got the nerve to give up his day job - and (Continued on Page 102) his parents' scorn of the theater as an exhibitionist forum - and moved to New York seven years ago.
Gurney's intimate, small-cast plays are ideal for the theater of the Nineties, where Broadway's blockbuster economics continue to prohibit any writer - with the possible exception of Neil Simon - from maintaining a consistent presence. Instead, like the work of Sam Shepard and Terrence McNally, Gurney's plays have a loyal following Off Broadway and in regional theater, where they are always revived.
''The Cocktail Hour'' opens at Chicago's Royal George Theater this month; a touring company begins in January, playing small theaters that seat roughly 1,000. Gurney's two-character star vehicle, ''Love Letters,'' which is written in letter form and read aloud, opened in August to positive reviews. It will continue to rotate its casts weekly at Broadway's Edison Theater, to which it recently transferred after a limited run at the Promenade - counting among its number William Hurt, Julie Harris, Jason Robards and Kate Nelligan. Another production of the play opens this week at San Francisco's Theater on the Square, and companies are planned for Los Angeles and Chicago.
Television, too, has discovered Gurney. His play ''The Middle Ages'' has been adapted by friend and fellow playwright Percy Granger for an ABC special this season called ''His Brother's Wife,'' starring John Ritter, Polly Bergen and Mel Harris.
Gurney has also just started work on a musical. It is an adaptation of his novel, ''The Snow Ball,'' the story of a rich WASP girl and a poor Irish boy who are perfectly suited to each other once they're on the dance floor.
Talk about prolific. Many theater insiders do, and snidely, the implication being that if Gurney can write so much - without the playwright's requisite suffering and extended dry periods - how good can any of it be? The playwright Wendy Wasserstein, whom Gurney relies on as one of his ''torpedoes,'' the group of four or five theater professionals he turns to when his play goes ''into the tunnel'' - the inevitable crisis point in its rehearsal period - dismisses this idea. ''All I can think of is Gene Kelly,'' she says. ''You know. 'Gotta dance.' ''
Gurney remains impervious to the theater world's sniping. His confidence comes from having won his success in gradual doses, through his unrelenting Protestant work ethic. ''Slow and steady wins the race is perhaps the most WASP-y thing of all,'' says Andre Bishop, fellow WASP and artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, who has produced three of Gurney's plays and was responsible for launching his breakthrough hit, ''The Dining Room,'' in 1982.
''Most WASP's identify with tortoises, not hares, and Pete's one of them.''
Gilbert Parker, Gurney's agent for the last 16 years, who represents some of the theater's biggest names, including John Tillinger, a frequent Gurney director, offers what is possibly the ultimate rave for any agent: ''I never cringe when I hear that Pete is on the phone.'' And the Broadway press agent David Powers, a veteran of many Gurney plays, says: ''He's a real gentleman. I once told him I had the perfect title for his autobiography: 'I Can Get It For You Retail.' ''
ALBERT RAMSDELL GUR-ney Jr. - known as Pete (don't look for a connection; his mother just liked the name) -is the only playwright to have had nine of his plays produced in New York over the last eight years. What he continually writes about is Buffalo's WASP aristocracy. And if it's impossible to peg Gurney as the prototypical WASP, he comes close enough. Unlike Philip Barry of ''The Philadelphia Story'' and ''Holiday'' fame, to whom he is often compared, Gurney refuses to glamorize his WASP's a la Hollywood - cotillion balls and fox hunts are not for them. Barry's Tracy Lord would be bored to distraction in a Gurney play.
Still, Gurney's characters live in a world of maids, country clubs and cocktails. No matter how adverse their circumstances, they make monumental efforts not to raise their voices. They are prime ulcer candidates, but they never let the strain spoil their backhand. And they all know how to mix the perfect martini - which helps make everything more bearable.
But these people are far from dull. Gurney's elegant, light touch with dialogue is as reassuring as it is entertaining; his banter is just a more refined version of what you tell your shrink:
BRADLEY: (Looking warily at manuscript) What's it called, this play?
JOHN: It's called ''The Cocktail Hour,'' actually.
BRADLEY: It's called the what?
JOHN: ''The Cocktail Hour.''
BRADLEY: That's a terrible title.
ANN: Oh now, sweetheart. . . . BRADLEY: Terrible. JOHN: Why is it terrible?
BRADLEY: To begin with, it's been used.
JOHN: That's ''The Cocktail PARTY,'' Pop. That's T. S. Eliot. BRADLEY: Even worse. We walked out on that one. ANN: This is ''The Cocktail Hour,'' darling.
BRADLEY: Doesn't make any difference.
ANN: No, it does. A cocktail party is a public thing. You invite people to a cocktail party. A cocktail hour is family. It's private. It's personal. It's very different.
BRADLEY: Nobody will know that. It will confuse everyone. They'll come expecting T. S. Eliot, and they'll get John. Either way, they'll want their money back.* Nancy Marchand, who played the mother in ''The Cocktail Hour,'' and who also grew up in Buffalo, says: ''I do wish that every actor who plays the son in this play would study Pete more. Physically, the way he uses himself is very WASP-y. He doesn't walk as much as shuffle, he looks at you sidewise, smiles a lot, and keeps his hands in his pockets.'' Arthur Miller, Gurney's longtime friend, neighbor and tennis partner, has a favorite story. A few years back, he was standing in the subway, waiting for a train, when he was approached by a Hasidic Jew. ''Excuse me,'' the man whispered. ''Are you Jewish?'' ''Yes, I am,'' Miller answered. The man brightened considerably. ''Then, can you tell me, does this train go to Canal Street?''
This is, of course, the same assumption that many make about Gurney's world - that if you didn't prep at Hotchkiss, you just won't get it. But the reason why there are just as many Schulmans as Simpsons lining up at the box-office window for Gurney's plays is the work's universality. Once you get past the idea that his characters are people who actually like dressing for dinner, you can recognize their loneliness, bitterness and overwhelming sense of isolation. One of Gurney's favorite reviews of ''The Cocktail Hour'' came from Michael Elkin, syndicated columnist of Philadelphia's Jewish Exponent: ''Sure, we know Gurney is reportedly wired into the WASP experience with his own WATTS line, but . . . 'The Cocktail Hour' . . . is intoxicating proof that families drink from the same glass of tsoris no matter the spelling of their last name.''
Yet, last year, before Gurney's ''Another Antigone'' opened at Playwrights Horizons, there was some talk of anti-Semitism. The lead character, Henry Harper, a classics professor, clashes over graduation requirements with Judy Miller, a headstrong Jewish student, who joins an attempt to have him ousted from the faculty. But the allegation was inaccurate. Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, '' . . . it's patently obvious that Harper is no anti-Semite, and Judy's enrollment in the smear campaign only destroys her integrity as a character.''
Besides drawing a Jewish audience - a necessity for survival in the New York theater - Gurney's WASP's travel well. Productions of most of his 13 full-length plays have been produced worldwide -everywhere from Argentina to Australia to Italy.
The one real gripe critics have with Gurney's work is that he has never written a major character on a par with a James Tyrone, Blanche DuBois or Willy Loman. Nor has he ever written the blood-and-guts battle after which a character - or the audience - can find a pure catharsis. But because the operative element in Gurney's dramatic world is ensemble - checks and balances take on a new meaning here - these kinds of moments are not consistent with his characters. Any word or action too extreme would threaten their very existence, and Gurney simply won't have it.
''I was lucky to grow up in a civilized world,'' he says, ''because Buffalo, which doesn't sound very civilized, was really the city time forgot. It had all the cultural advantage of a big city, with a small-town coherence. The dancing school that I went to, and my wife, Molly, went to, was the same one my parents attended. My grandmother was taught by the same guy who taught me. We're talking about continuity that went back three or four generations. So, at an early age, I sensed the comforts of civilization - but also its discontents, what you give up. The emotions are carefully trained, ultimately honed, tamped down.
''I'm not terribly comfortable with conflict,'' he continues. ''All my life, I was accused of being the troublemaker in my family. My mother used to say that whenever things were settled down and quiet, she and my father would hear these yelps coming from upstairs and they knew it was me teasing, going into someone's room and starting a fight. But whether those fights ever ended in an authentic confrontation that a play should have, I don't know. How many ultimate confrontations are there in Chekhov? Very few.''
Gurney's stance has drawn fire from critics like New York Magazine's John Simon, who called ''The Cocktail Hour'' ''one of 1988's better insipidities.'' Frank Rich wrote that Gurney ''is not the sort to turn an evening of martini-fueled drawing-room banter into a truly drunken 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' ''
But rebuttals are rampant. Arthur Miller says, ''Most playwrights never write a character like Willy Loman and they're still perfectly good playwrights.'' Gurney's daughter, Evelyn, one of his four grown children, also defends him. ''A repressed emotion doesn't mean it's not a valid emotion. It's unfair to ask him to write about something outside his experience.'' Andre Bishop notes: ''I love and understand a world where things are unspoken and yet very clear. Where it isn't all out there, and doesn't have to be. You'll never make Pete Gurney into Christopher Durang - he's not a go-for-broke satirist. What he is, is a true and graceful chronicler.''
What he is also, is rabid about his critics. Everyone who attended ''The Cocktail Hour'' opening night party at Ernie's - a cavernous yuppie eatery near the Promenade Theater where no self-respecting Gurney character would ever be caught dead - recalls Gurney's fury at the reviews. Holland Taylor, who played the daughter, remembers: ''Someone read The Times review'' - which was mixed - ''and Pete just stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking left to right, sort of bobbing his head. He was quite flushed. He felt dismissed. It was one of those moments where everyone was talking at once and there was no focus on him particularly. It was an indistinct moment, the kind Pete can capture easily in a play - hurt feelings, instantly concealed. A stunned, wounded kind of anger.''
Tom Viertel, one of the producers of ''The Cocktail Hour,'' says that, despite Gurney's distress, the play recouped its $385,000 capitalization at the 399-seat theater in 16 weeks. According to Viertel, this was faster than any play he and his partners had ever produced.
IT IS LUNCHTIME AT BICE, A crowded midtown restaurant. Gurney, uncomfortable in a one on one about himself, smokes contraband Merits, which Molly, his wife of 32 years and a nutritionist, forbids at home. He's wearing a nondescript tweed jacket (with peppermint Lifesavers in the pocket) over his usual cotton uniform, and his quiet, almost-warm tone betrays three decades of wine and cheese with wide-eyed literature students. At his core, he's the best kind of teacher, the generous kind, rooting for everyone to get it right. It's an attitude that endears him to most, especially to actors.
Lunch is salad and a squid-ink risotto, with both courses delivered to the table almost simultaneously. When the waiter brings coffee, he asks if everything has been all right. When we tell him that one course at a time would have been appreciated, he launches into a million excuses. After he leaves, I say, ''Don't you love when a waiter asks how things are and you tell him and he really doesn't want to know?'' Gurney laughs. ''That's true of everyone, isn't it?'' he says.
It certainly is of Gurney. But no matter how many times he's criticized, he never stops writing. It's almost as if, having been born into the most accepted, most white, most powerful group in the society, he can't fathom one existing that he can't eventually break into and belong. And not just belong, but excel. Molly Gurney says: ''I dread opening nights. With 'The David Show' (Gurney's first produced play in New York, 1968), Pete got physically sick over the reviews.''
Gurney's eldest son, George, remembers, ''After 'The David Show,' my father came back from New York and we were all excited, expecting presents. But Clive Barnes had nailed him, so he just went upstairs and went to sleep.'' But, Molly says, he was up and writing again the next day.
PETE GURNEY WAS born in Buffalo on Nov. 1, 1930. His father, A.R. Gurney Sr., was president of Gurney, Becker and Bourne, an insurance and real estate business (and, as Gurney says, ''the wonderful autocrat of the dinner table''). Pete was the middle child of three; his sister, Evelyn, still lives in Buffalo and his younger brother, Stephen, is on the faculty of a private school in New Haven.
Gurney graduated from Williams College, was commissioned as an officer in the Navy - where he had the love affair with a Japanese woman that makes its way into two of his plays,'' The Middle Ages'' and ''Love Letters.'' Not quite rebellious enough to bring her back home (''There were certain frantic signals from Buffalo, New York, on that, I can tell you''), he returned alone and enrolled in the Yale School of Drama's playwrighting program. Midway through, he spent a summer in New York working as a script reader for the Kraft Television Theater. His mother had him look up Molly Goodyear, a Buffalo girl who had left Bryn Mawr and was spending the summer working at New York Hospital. The two married the following year. (A side note on WASP inbreeding: Two years after Gurney's father died in 1977, his mother married Molly's father.) After graduating from Yale, Gurney taught English for two years at the Belmont Hill School, a private school in Belmont, Mass. In 1960, a friend offered him a position at M.I.T. (''my salary jumped from $4,800 a year to $5,200''), where he stayed until 1987, teaching literature, and doggedly writing his plays. ''After 'The David Show' got thoroughly pasted by The Times, I had to slink back to school and teach a course on the American drama the next day,'' he remembers.
Gurney wrote on summer vacations and sabbaticals. And, he says, he wrote about what he didn't have: ''I wrote 'The Dining Room' after we had given up our own dining room - we lived in a big house in Newton, Mass., and during the energy crisis we had closed off the living room, sold our dining-room furniture and turned it into a family room. We all huddled together and ate in the kitchen. I realized what we'd lost, so I tried to write my way back into that world.''
He took a similar approach with ''Love Letters.'' ''I'd been fooling around with the letter form for some time. In the world I grew up in, they were always sending you away someplace, so in order to maintain contact with your family or your girl, you'd have to write,'' he says. ''My father-in-law had given me an I.B.M. PC and I started playing with it. I wasn't very good at the margins, so I wrote great chunks of dialogue, just practicing, and suddenly the letter form came together. The computer made me think about the differences in computer writing and letter writing - the scratch of the pen, the special quality of a personal letter. I found myself writing about the lost process of letter writing.''
Perhaps the most important thing that Gurney has always been without is his father's approval. It is what drives him repeatedly to write plays with fathers and sons in adversarial relationships; and it may be that the irrational hope of getting that approval is what has prevented him from writing a character capable of an all-out tantrum, rejecting the father and the father's world, as surely as he feels it has rejected him.
''Just as it's mentioned in 'The Cocktail Hour,' my great-grandfather hung up his clothes one day and walked into the Niagara River and no one understood why,'' Gurney says. ''He was a distinguished man in Buffalo. My father could never mention it, and it affected the family well into the fourth generation as a dark and unexplainable gesture. It made my father and his father desperate to be accepted, to be conventional, and comfortable. It made them commit themselves to an -ostensibly - easy bourgeois world. They saw it so precariously, but the reason was never mentioned. I first learned about it after my father died'' - an event Gurney won't discuss - ''from my father-in-law, who is a genealogist and had dug out the old newspaper articles. I was 48 at the time.''
Molly Gurney remembers: ''Peter's father was a very charming guy, and I used to think he was just wonderful - until I married Peter. He never really accepted me. You could say I wasn't good enough for his son, but his son wasn't good enough, either. He didn't accept any of his children's spouses. The charm just went off. In some ways I'm angrier at his father than Peter is. He's very forgiving. He never would have dared to talk to his father the way the son does in 'The Cocktail Hour.' But that's a form of confrontation and reconciliation he wishes he had had with his own father.''
If Gurney has found his revenge in that most public of places, the theater, then he's also found it in the way he's raised his own family - sans martinis and dinner jackets. On a Sunday afternoon last July, two of his children -Evelyn, 28, and George, 31, his oldest - are visiting their parents' Connecticut farm with their spouses; George's wife, Connie, expects the family's first grandchild this month. From the road, the house seems ordinary -white clapboard with black shutters - but its size is deceiving. It spreads itself out away from the road. There's a swimming pool, a barn, two active wells, orchards of peach and apple trees, a vegetable garden and 20 acres of hills, lawn and trees.
Inside, Molly is making borscht with beets from the garden. The house is full of books and Gurney has his dining room back now - with a vengeance. The antique table looks long enough to seat George Washington's troops. Upstairs, Gurney writes on a computer in one of the bedrooms - predictably bare -on an old desk burned down one side by coffee-cup rings.
Molly brings the hot borscht out to a picnic table on the terrace (the house has no air-conditioning, but she doesn't sweat - none of them do) and serves it with bread and cheese. Gurney presides at the head of the table. Everything feels easy - no rules past ''please'' and ''thank you''.
Evelyn recalls when she and her siblings were growing up, and Gurney was deep into writing a play, he'd pay no attention to the dinner conversation, although he'd pretend to. ''He'd be totally out of it and we'd say, 'Dad, can we have some candy?' and he'd stare out the window and say, 'uuuuh-huuuuuuh.' ''
When lunch is over, Gurney stays at the table outside and, safe from Molly's view, lights up a Merit. Time is short; we will be leaving soon for New York, to see Julie Harris and Richard Kiley perform in ''Love Letters.'' Forced again to talk about himself and his work, about his detractors, about the Stanley Kowalski he's never written, Gurney finally says: ''I think that what I have done, is to create a body of work, somewhat interconnected, about the first Eastern city to suffer as American power moved west, and I've dealt with its people in a changing time.''
Does he speculate on how his successors at M.I.T. would teach his work, if they taught him at all? He answers like a true professor: ''My point of view is primarily comic in that I see a reconciliation possible at the play's end between the individual and the world. And that's not terribly American. If you look at the European tradition - Moliere, Coward, Congreve - the world is always put back together by the end. In American comedies, there's anarchism at the end - Huck Finn says goodbye and shoves off for the territories, Holden Caulfield ends up in the madhouse. So, I see what I do as going against the grain of the American embracing of private freedom.''
He talks about his plans for the musical, about a new play that will focus on his generation as the parents instead of the children. ''I think I have pretty much mined this vein,'' he says of the WASP culture. ''I've pretty much said what I've wanted to say. In musical comedy, certainly, emotions have to be more direct. I'm trying to move away from the tight form of the drawing-room comedy.''
Molly comes outside and, pretending not to see the Merits in the ashtray, signals that it's time to leave. We go to the car, and the kids all come out as if on cue to see us off. It is a familiar ritual for them, one they've grown up with. When, at just the time of day that some people are having a cocktail hour, their father says goodbye, and goes to the theater.

HEADLINE: JUST ANOTHER NIGHT ON CRACK STREET

BYLINE: By Philippe Bourgois; Philippe Bourgois, an anthropologist on fieldwork leave from San Francisco State University, is writing a book about street culture in East Harlem, to be published by Little, Brown.

 BODY:
THE HEAVYSET UNDERCOVER POLICEMAN pushed me across the ice-cream counter, spreading my legs and poking me around the groin. As he came dangerously close to the bulge in my right pocket I hissed in his ear, ''It's a tape recorder.'' He snapped backward, releasing his grip on my neck, whispering a barely audible, ''Sorry.'' Apparently he thought I was an undercover cop from another department. Before I could get a close look at him, he had left the bodega, a grocery store-cum-numbers joint.
After almost five years of living in a tenement apartment in East Harlem with my family, I have learned how to deal with the police officers who regularly stop me in the course of my work. I am an ethnographer conducting long-term, participant-observation research on street culture in the underground economy. I spend long hours, night and day, in crack houses and on drug-copping corners, observing, befriending and interviewing street dealers, addicts and anyone else who will pause to talk with me. It is unusual work, to say the least, difficult for outsiders to appreciate, perhaps most particularly the police, who cannot fathom why anyone would immerse himself in the heart of the drug culture if not for the drugs. 
Once I made the mistake of trying to explain my work to two patrolmen, both white, who stopped me late at night and angrily said, ''Go buy your drugs in a white neighborhood, and get the hell off these streets, white boy.'' I had barely uttered, ''No, you don't understand, I don't use drugs. I am a professor . . .'' when I was called ''dirty white scum,'' and threatened with a booking in the precinct if I didn't ''shut up and get out of here right this minute.''
The night in the bodega I did what I had learned to do when being frisked - stare at the ground, avoid eye contact and mumble obsequiously, ''Yes, sir,'' whenever appropriate. This encounter was an easy one. I hadn't even had (Continued on Page 60) to say, ''Thank you, sir,'' and I was not publicly cursed. As soon as the officer was out of earshot, I was able to focus back on my work.
In an effort to display trust and establish a better rapport, I told Jesus - the street dealer and crack addict I happened to be interviewing that night - to grab the change from my $10 bill from the cashier as I hurried to leave. At the doorway, however, I was blocked by a thin teen-ager named Bennie, who pushed me aside and lunged at the loose dollar bills in Jesus' hand.
''That's my money now, Jesus; give it to me,'' Bennie shouted. I started to shout back: ''Hey! What are you talking about? That's my money!'' But one look at Bennie's contorted face and narrowed eyes stopped me. Jesus muttered ''Be careful - my man is dusted,'' but it was unnecessary. I was ready to give up the eight bills - and more if I had to -to avoid any out-of-control violence from an angry mugger high on angel dust.
Jesus went through the motions of confronting Bennie, to whom he really did owe money. First he was gentle. Staring into Bennie's face, which was two inches from his own, he pulled at the fistful of bills and said: ''Yo, Bennie, chill out. I know how much I owe you. I'll take care of you tomorrow. This ain't my money. Please don't take this money.'' Then he tried a harsher tack: ''I told you this ain't my money; Get off of it! It ain't my money!'' Bennie just got tougher. He knew Jesus was a coward. He yanked at the bills, hissing about the $60 still owed him. They had been selling marijuana together for several weeks on the corner next to the bodega, and during a bust a week earlier, the police had confiscated their supply. Bennie wanted Jesus to make good on his share. He knew that Jesus would not fight back. As the bills began to rip, Jesus finally let go, looking back at me sheepishly.
As we stepped out the door of the bodega, Bennie kept yelling at Jesus about the $60. Then he let out a whistle, and a dented Vega came roaring down the block. It careered to the curb and cut us off. A young man in the passenger seat tried to open his door and jump onto the sidewalk before the car stopped, but he fell on his face in the gutter. He jumped back to his feet, and stood, unsteadily. His nose was bleeding. He was waving a baseball bat in his right hand.
The driver, who was steadier - apparently not as high as his companion - had also rushed out of the car and was running at us. Bennie called out that all was ''cool,'' that he already had the money; and they slowed down, walking toward us with puffed backs, the one with the baseball bat resting it on his shoulder.
Frightened, I jumped back to the bodega door, trying to figure out where to run and what to do, but Jesus had to stand firm. This was the corner he worked; those were his former partners. They surrounded him, shouting about the money, and began kicking him and hitting him with the bat. Jesus still did not turn and run; instead he jumped up and down, prancing sideways along the sidewalk toward the corner on the main avenue. He was hoping his new colleagues at the bogus botanica, a shop that ostensibly sold herbal potions and spiritual items, around the corner, to whom he was steering crack customers, might catch sight of what was happening. He was knocked down twice before reaching the corner. Then the two men backed away, walking back to the Vega with deliberate slowness, pretending not to notice me. They had not seen the policeman search me, and they evidently did not think it wise to pick a fight with an unknown ''white boy'' who was just the right age to be an undercover. Obviously nervous, they pulled at Bennie's elbow to hustle him into the car. Then they drove off, leaving rubber at the curb.
By the time I caught up with Jesus, half a block down the avenue, he was telling the story to his cousin. A woman in her late 20's, dressed ''butch'' in a long-sleeved jean jacket, she was on her way to the botanica crack house. Her emaciated face and long sleeves made it likely she was a coke mainliner. She was waving her skinny arms and stamping on the ground, whining hoarsely at Jesus, telling him he couldn't just run off like that; that he had to ''go down swinging like a man''; that he couldn't just let people chase him around; that he had to show them who's who. Now what did he expect to do? Where was he going to work? Finally, she said she needed the money she had lent him the day before to buy a new supply of marijuana - he had spent it on crack instead - and that she was disgusted with him.
At the crack/botanica house, we told our story to Julio and Papito, who were on duty selling that night. Julio jumped up excitedly, calling out: ''What street was that on? Come on, we can still catch them. How many were they?'' I said we should just forget about it; revenge wasn't worth it. And Papito looked at me disgustedly, sitting back down on the milk crate in front of the botanica's door. Julio, whom I knew better, jumped up in front of me, raising his voice to berate me. ''Man, you still think like a blanquito,'' he said. A half-dozen spectators - some of them empty-pocketed, ''thirsty'' crack addicts, but most of them sharp-dressed teen-age girls competing for Papito's and Julio's attentions - snickered at me.
To regain some minimal respect, I turned on Jesus, telling him he owed me the $8 Bennie had stolen, and ordering him to empty his pockets. Grinning, he pulled out a dollar and promised he would come by tomorrow with seven more. He told me not to worry; he would pay me back first. Of course, I knew he would not. He knew that I was one of the few individuals on the street even softer than he.
At this point, seeing my feeble attempt, Julio, making sure I saw what he was doing, dropped a vial of crack in Jesus's shirt pocket in payment for the half dozen customers he had steered to the crack house that evening. I was supposed to grab the vial - worth $5 - from Jesus's pocket as partial compensation for the seven he still owed me. But I could not bring myself to rip Jesus's shirt pocket open, knowing that Jesus was ''thirsty'' to smoke and might get violent with me.
A few minutes later, Papito and Julio told everyone it was time to close shop. It was 12:30, and they had to turn in the evening's receipts to their boss. They pulled down the metal gates over the botanica's entrance, eager to leave work and get on with an evening of partying.
UNLIKE THE CRACK DEAL-ers and addicts that I hang out with and interview, the vast majority of the residents of East Harlem are honest and hard-working. It is a struggle to live there, and they struggle honorably. Nevertheless, to many, especially the young, the underground economy beckons seductively as the ultimate ''equal opportunity employer.'' The rate of unemployment for Harlem youth is at least twice the citywide rate of 8.1 percent, and the economic incentive to participate in the burgeoning crack economy is overwhelming.
The individuals ''successfully'' pursuing careers in the ''crack economy'' or any other facet of the underground economy are no longer ''exploitable'' by legal society. They speak with anger at their former low wages and bad treatment. They make fun of friends and acquaintances - many of whom come to buy drugs from them - who are still employed in factories or in service jobs.
Most of the people I have met are proud that they are not being exploited by ''the White Man.'' All of them have, at one time or another, held the jobs - delivery boys, supermarket baggers, hospital orderlies -that are objectively recognized as among the least desirable in American society. They see the illegal, underground economy as not only offering superior wages, but also a more dignified workplace.
For example, Julio's last legal job before selling crack was as a messenger for a magazine. He had become addicted to crack and began selling off his possessions to pay for his habit. Finally he was thrown out by his wife, who had just given birth to his son. He quit his 10-hour-a-day messenger job in favor of stealing car radios for a couple of hours at night in the same neighborhoods where he had been delivering messages. After a close encounter with the police, Julio, who is 26 years old, begged his cousin for a job in his crack house. The sense of responsibility, success and prestige that selling crack gave him enabled him to kick his crack habit and substitute for it a considerably less expensive powder cocaine and alcohol habit.
JULIO'S GIRLFRIEND JACKIE also sells crack. Her husband used to own the botanica crack site, but he is now ''upstate,'' serving two to five years for his second conviction for selling cocaine and possessing firearms. Two nights before he was scheduled to go to jail, as he was closing down the botanica, Jackie, who was eight months' pregnant at the time, shot him in the stomach in front of all his workers. She was furious because instead of leaving money for her before beginning his jail sentence, he had been running around spending thousands of dollars on young women and bragging about it.
Ten months later, Jackie, at 32, was doing much better, especially following the problem-free delivery of her fifth daughter. Her husband's cousin, who had taken over the crack franchise at the botanica while her husband was in jail, had witnessed the shoot-out, and had been impressed by Jackie's aggressiveness; shortly after the birth of her daughter, he hired her to sell ''twenties of rock'' -$20 foils of cocaine - at his other sales point in the neighborhood, a candy store.
Not everyone shared his feelings, however. Shortly after her husband's hospitalization and jailing, Jackie took up with Julio, and she told Rose, a 15-year-old former girlfriend of his, to stop hanging around the crack house - or else. I was there one evening when Rose was discussing this threat with a crowd hanging out around the crack house. Someone was warning Rose that Jackie meant business, when Aida, the seller on shift at the crack house that evening looked up from the pink blanket she was knitting for the baby she was pregnant with and called out: ''Big deal! Anybody can buy a gun. You just stay here, Rose. You can come visit me any time you want. That woman's just nasty. She can't tell me or you or anyone else what to do here. She don't own the place.''
Rose did, indeed, keep coming back, even after another of her ex-boyfriends, who claimed he still loved her, threatened to kill Julio and then commit suicide if she kept hanging out at the crack house at night. He showed up a few days later with two big friends, but by then Julio had gathered a group of his own for protection, and the would-be assailants just kept walking. Julio was exasperated with the whole issue; he had lost interest in Rose after he had gotten her pregnant, and they had argued heatedly when he refused to pay for her abortion.
REGULAR DISPLAYS OF violence are necessary for success in the underground economy - especially the street-level drug-dealing world. Violence is essential for maintaining credibility and for preventing rip-offs by colleagues, customers and intruders. Thus behavior that appears irrationally violent and self-destructive to the middle- or working-class outsider can be interpreted, according to the logic of the underground economy, as judicious public relations.
This can be clearly seen in the events described at the outset of this article. Jesus and I were mugged because he had a reputation for being a coward and because I had been publicly unmasked as not being an undercover cop - hence, safe to attack. Jesus had tried to minimize the damage to his ability to sell on that corner by not turning and running. Nevertheless, the admonishments of his cousin just minutes later could not have been clearer: Jesus was not going to be upwardly mobile in the underground economy. Where was he going to work after such a public humiliation?
Employers or new entrepreneurs in the underground economy are looking for people with experience that proves their capacity for effective violence - Jackie's being hired to sell cocaine by the man who witnessed her shooting her husband is an example. Papito had a ''bionic leg.'' He had been shot through the thigh in a previous crack confrontation, and his leg had been successfully rebuilt, leaving him with a pronounced limp. He frequently referred to his rebuilt limb in conversation; it was a source of pride and credibility for him. He was considered an effective crack dealer.
For the owner of the crack house, the ability of his employees to face up to the possibility of violence is crucial; stickups of dealing dens are common. During my time there, the botanica was held up twice. Julio was on duty both times. He admitted that he had been very nervous when robbers held a gun to his temple and asked for money and crack. Nevertheless, not only did he withhold some of the money and crack, kept hidden inside a hollowed-out statue of a saint, but he also later exaggerated to his boss the amount that had been stolen; he pocketed the difference himself.
The possibility of being held up was constantly on Julio's mind. When more than two people walked into the botanica at once, he would stiffen, as if expecting them to pull out weapons. Once he told me he was nervous about a cousin of his who had started hanging out at the crack house, feigning friendship. Julio suspected him of being in the process of casing the place for a future stickup.
Several times I asked crack dealers or robbers to explain how they were able to trust their partners in crime. In each case, I was told: ''What do you mean how do I trust him? You should ask how does he trust me!''
They were claiming, I believe, that they are not dependent upon trust because they are tough enough to command respect and enforce all contracts they enter into. Ruthlessness is their security.
My failure to display a propensity for violence cost me, in several instances, the respect of the crack sellers. This was evident when I turned down Julio and Papito's offer to search out the three men who mugged Jesus and me. Julio was genuinely disappointed that I was not someone with common sense and self-respect.
His reaction was a setback for my research. In the few weeks prior to getting mugged, I had established a routine for tape recording life-history interviews. After Julio closed the botanica, we would go back to Jackie's apartment to babysit her children and her husband's grandfather, a 65-year-old alcoholic. Babysitting involved sending one of the children out for beer, keeping the grandfather from drinking any hard liquor, shouting at the young children if they quarreled, playing with the 9-month-old. Eventually I would follow Julio and whoever else had come with us from the crack house into the bedroom, to keep talking to them as they ground up and snorted cocaine. At this point I could comfortably take out my tape recorder, and they would dictate chapters for my book, competing for my attention and for space on the tape. By daybreak, Jackie had usually returned from work with fresh coke for Julio to snort. He would then sleep from mid-morning until mid-afternoon, careful to arrive on time for the evening shift - 3 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. - at the botanica crack house.
INNER-CITY STREET violence is not limited solely to drug sellers or to street criminals; to a certain extent, anyone living in the neighborhood who wants to maintain a sense of autonomy - i.e., who does not go outdoors during daylight hours only - finds it useful to participate, at least passively, in some corner of the culture of terror. I overheard the story of a boy whose mother had told him never to fight. Not long into the school year a classmate mugged him, stealing his midafternoon snack and pocket money. The child quickly developed a reputation as a weakling. During the ensuing weeks, he lost his snack and money daily until finally he complained to his mother. Her response was to berate him: ''What's the matter with you? Can't you fight back?''
Anyone who is frequently out on the street will be exposed to the violence of the underground economy, even if he does not participate in it. In the first 13 months I spent in Spanish Harlem I witnessed:
A deadly shooting, outside my window, of the mother of a 3-year-old child, by an assailant wielding a sawed-off shotgun.
A bombing and a machine-gunning of a numbers joint, once again within view of my apartment window.
A shoot-out and police-car chase in front of a pizza parlor where I happened to be eating a snack.
The aftermath of the firebombing of a heroin house.
A dozen screaming, clothes-ripping fights.
Almost daily exposure to broken-down human beings, some of them in fits of crack-induced paranoia, some suffering from delirium tremens, and others in unidentifiable pathological fits screaming and shouting insults to all around them.
Perhaps the most poignant expression of the pervasiveness of the culture of terror was the comment made to me by a 13-year-old boy in the course of an otherwise innocuous conversation about how his mother's pregnancy was going. He told me he hoped his mother would give birth to a boy ''because girls are too easy to rape.''
BASED ON MY EX-perience, I believe the assertion of the culture-of-poverty theorists that the poor have been badly socialized and do not share mainstream values is wrong. On the contrary, ambitious, energetic, inner-city youths are attracted to the underground economy precisely because they believe in the rags-to-riches American dream. Like many in the mainstream, they are frantically trying to get their piece of the pie as fast as possible. In fact, they follow the traditional model for upward mobility: aggressively setting themselves up as private entrepreneurs. Without stretching the point too much, they can be seen in conventional terms as rugged individualists on an unpredictable frontier where fortune, fame and destruction are all just around the corner.
Consider the example of Indio, an ambitious young crack dealer who, while he was high on angel dust, shot his brother in the spine and paralyzed him for life in a battle over sales rights. His brother now works for him, selling on crutches. Meanwhile, the shooting has cemented Indio's reputation, and his workers are awesomely disciplined. Indio reaffirms this symbolically by periodically walking his turf with a $3,000 gold chain and nameplate hanging around his neck.
Many of the street dealers claim to be strictly utilitarian in their involvement with the drugs they sell, and disdain their clients despite the fact that usually, like Indio, they have alcohol and powder-cocaine habits themselves. They refer to their merchandise as ''this garbage'' and openly deride addicts as they arrive with fistfuls of money. Papito used to chant at his regular customers: ''Keep on killing yourself. Bring me that money. Smoke yourself to death. Make me rich.'' Though the average street seller is employed by the owner of a sales point for whom he has to maintain regular hours, meet sales quotas and be subject to being fired, the street seller has a great deal of autonomy and power in his schedule. His boss comes once or twice a shift to drop off drugs and pick up money, or else sends a young messenger. Because of the money and drugs passing through their hands, sellers are often surrounded by a bevy of ''thirsty'' friends and hangers-on - frequently teen-age girls - willing to run errands, pay attention to conversations, lend support in arguments and fights and provide sexual favors upon demand. In fact, even youths who do not use drugs will hang out and try to befriend the dealer, just to be privy to the excitement of people coming and going, copping and hanging.
The ultimate expression of success is opulence without visible means of support. There is plenty of proof of this on the street as teen-age crack dealers drive by in white Suzuki jeeps and middle-aged cocaine tycoons speed around in well-waxed Lincoln Continentals or Mercedes-Benzes. Anyone can aspire to be one of the ubiquitous sellers, perched on mountain bikes with beepers on their belts. In fact, many youths not particularly active in the drug trade wear beepers, just pretending to be big time.
The feeling of self-worth that the street-level dealer's life style offers cannot be underestimated. A former manager of a coke-shooting gallery who had employed a network of a half-dozen sellers, lookouts and security guards before he was jailed, explained to me that the best memories of his drug-dealing days were of the respect he received from people on the street. After his release, he became a clerk in a Wall Street brokerage concern, determined, he said, not to return to street life. But he recalled that, as a dealer, when he drove up in one of his cars to pick up the day's receipts, a bevy of attentive men and women would run to open the door for him and engage him in polite small talk. Others would offer to clean his car. He would invite a half-dozen friends and acquaintances out to dinner in expensive restaurants almost every night. Jokingly, he also noted that his shooting gallery had enabled his wife and two children to get off welfare.
A CASUAL STROLL through Spanish Harlem exposes one to legions of emaciated coke and crack addicts. Many will be begging for their next vial; others will be ''petro'' or ''bugging out'' - i.e., high, intensely paranoid, shying from everyone around them - shivering, mumbling agitatedly to themselves, with their eyes wide open and jaws tense. If the stroller should happen upon a ''copping corner'' it will look like a street fair, especially late at night - cars driving by, people coming and going, doors of buildings opening and closing, people hanging out all over. Most likely a hail of whistles and shouts will accompany the stroller's arrival as the lookouts warn those ''pitching'' the drugs that a potential undercover is on the scene.
Anthropologists have developed a concept known as ''conjugated oppression'' -whereby ethnic discrimination interacts with class exploitation to produce a perception in its victims of inescapable oppression. I have come to believe that this begins to explain why hordes of crack heads continue to fry their brains and burn up their bodies.
Substance abuse in general, and crack in particular, offers the equivalent of a born-again metamorphosis. Instantaneously, the user is transformed from an unemployed, depressed high school dropout, despised by the world - and secretly convinced that his failure is due to his own inherent stupidity and disorganization. There is a rush of heart-palpitating pleasure, followed by a jaw-gnashing crash and wide-eyed alertness that provides his life with concrete purpose: Get more crack - fast!
After almost five years living in and out of that world, it is impossible not to get depressed, especially when some of the emaciated figures I see are women in advanced states of pregnancy, mothers dragging screeching toddlers behind them - or a former friend broken down on a binge.
Often, the day after an especially brutal night of fieldwork, I seek out the bright-eyed, cheery-faced schoolchildren who fill the streets of Harlem after 3:30 each afternoon. I've come to know a half dozen of them and have their mothers' permission to take them on outings. We'll play ball, take a walk to the East River, visit a fancy toy store or a museum downtown. The energy, love and dreams of these children stand in stark contrast to the desperate substance-abuse and violence that goes on around them. I am suddenly filled with the hope that they might survive these mean streets - and, for a while at least, I feel better.

HEADLINE: THE ULTIMATE MARKETPLACE;
Tales of Success

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA; Susan Chira is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
A SALESWOMAN hovers in the doorway of Volity Narayan Prakash's office in his jewelry store in Jackson Heights, Queens. She has a problem. A customer is buying a $2,400 gold chain for cash, but he is $100 short. Mr. Prakash strides out to the counter and speaks to his customer in the south Indian dialect he learned as a child in Bangalore. They shake hands and the customer leaves with his purchase.
''I told him, please take it and send the money later,'' said Mr. Prakash, who is 38 years old. ''They feel proud because someone trusts them.''
''Gold is a trust business,'' he said. ''Someone will say, let's go to Prakash because we know him and we've never had a problem. We jewelers are like barbers. You don't change your barber.'' 
This is how Mr. Prakash has prospered in a very specialized business - selling diamonds and handmade Indian gold jewelry to Indians in the United States.
In New York there is hardly a need that is not supplied by an entrepreneur whose livelihood depends on an accurate grasp of this vast marketplace. The city is full of dreamers and risk-takers, each seeking the niche that will allow him or her to prosper.
They crowd into neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, where Mr. Prakash's Jewels of India shop is but one in a row of Indian enterprises. Store windows are plastered with advertisements for visiting Indian singers, stocked with Indian and Pakistani delicacies and draped with saris in stunning shades of cobalt and saffron, fuschia and lime.
They venture farther out in Queens to Kew Gardens, where Mitaecha Kim has spent 10 years establishing her nail salon and now faces Korean-run competitors across the street and down the block.
They are tucked away in anonymous Manhattan skyscrapers like the one where Alma Nugent runs her interior design business. And they thrive in the sprawling warehouses of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where Bill Howell bases his petroleum products company.
These four entrepreneurs are part of New York City's tapestry of ingenuity and dedication. Each embodies the promise of this city - that here it is possible to start, to begin again and maybe, someday, to get rich.
Each year, according to Dun & Bradstreet, the business information services company, some 5,000 new businesses are started in New York City, out of a national total of about 250,000. Dun & Bradstreet defines a new business as one that begins to participate actively in the marketplace, purchasing goods and services from other businesses. A new business is almost by definition a small business, with an average of five employees. The riskiness of such ventures is illustrated by their failure rate. ''In 1988,'' said Reid Gearhart, a Dun & Bradstreet analyst, ''700 New York City businesses failed, meaning that their creditors were left with losses. There is no way of knowing how many businesses simply pay their debts and discontinue operations. Our statistical rule of thumb is that about half of the businesses that fail every year are five years old or younger.''
Particularly daunting is the lack of start-up capital, according to Gary Kesner, Commissioner of New York's Office of Business Development. Many people underestimate how much money they will really need. Once established, the aspiring entrepreneur must grapple with the legal requirements of incorporation, partnership and licensing, along with bookkeeping, obtaining insurance, maintaining security and managing employees. Dreams of wealth notwithstanding, at the beginning most entrepreneurs have little to look forward to but hours of grinding work.
Mr. Prakash, for example, keeps his store open seven days a week. He also devotes time and energy to the Indian community. He heads the local jewelers' assocation and hosts receptions for Indians visiting the United States. When a competing jeweler was robbed, he sent him some stock from his own store as a goodwill gesture. And he donates money to the local Hindu temple.
Although he will not disclose his sales or profits, Mr. Prakash appears to be thriving. He recently bought a house in New Hyde Park, L.I., for his wife and two children, and workmen are building counters and fixing mirrors for a new diamond showroom.
It took him a decade to get this far. The Prakash family has sold silk and gold in the South Indian city of Bangalore for generations. But Mr. Prakash sensed a market for an American branch. .
''I am always a person who takes risks and adventures,'' he said. ''I spoke to a lot of Indians here. A lot of people gave me negative opinions. They said gold and guns go together, and you don't want to be a part of that. Gold in this country is sold at a cheaper price than Indian gold. But I studied this market for a year and decided no matter what happened, I had to open a jewelry store.''
While most entrepreneurs have trouble raising enough capital, Mr. Prakash could draw on family money. And most of his employees are relatives. The most crucial decision he had to make was where to locate his store. Deciding against Manhattan's 47th Street, the diamond district, he settled on Jackson Heights because it was the center of a vibrant Indian immigrant community.
Mr. Prakash's shop thrived there, and has spawned nearly a dozen imitators. Now his biggest headaches are security and the cost of insuring his merchandise.
''This country is so helpful to business,'' he said. ''In India, we have a lot of red tape. That's what makes this country so great - they help you.''
EVEN SO, THERE ARE DAYS WHEN Mitaecha Kim thinks about giving up the business she opened ten years ago in her one-bedroom apartment in Kew Gardens. Women and people who work out of their homes are major forces among entrepreneurs today - an estimated 8 million to 10 million businesses are operated from homes with some 400,000 new ones being started each year, according to the Commerce Department.
Mrs. Kim appears to have prospered, judging by the sleek gray and black decor of her present shop, the brisk efficiency of her nine employees and the chairs full of customers. Still, she said, speaking in a mixture of English and Korean translated by her sister-in-law, ''Sometimes I think maybe working for someone else is better.''
While New Yorkers marvel at the seemingly well-organized and cooperative networks of Korean immigrants who have become the city's greengrocers, dry cleaners and manicurists, Mrs. Kim and her husband, Jae Hoon, see both the drawbacks and the benefits of such a network.When they left South Korea 17 years ago with their young son, Robert, both found work in New York with other Koreans - Mr. Kim with a construction company, Mrs. Kim as a manicurist in a nail salon in Manhattan. Patiently, Mrs. Kim absorbed the economics and the techniques of the business. After seven years she and her husband had saved enough to enable her to quit working for someone else and, with an investment of a few thousand dollars, set up a manicure table in their apartment. Steadily adding more tables and customers, she outgrew the apartment and rented a storefront on Queens Boulevard. She called it Kim's Golden Nails.
The problem, according to the Kims, is that so many other Korean immigrants have latched onto the same dream. There are six nail salons within a few blocks of hers, and at least 10 along Continental Avenue. They charge prices so low she has not raised hers in years - it is still $4.50 for a manicure, $5.50 on weekends.
''It's just too much competition,'' said Mr. Kim, who is 44.
The Kims were reluctant to divulge their revenues or profits because the business varies so much. They had two good years ending in 1987, but business has lagged last year and this. They pay $2,250 a month for their office space, and commercial and real estate taxes bring the total to $3,000. They live in the same one-bedroom apartment they moved into 15 years ago.
Mrs. Kim keeps the shop open from 9:30 A.M. to 7 P.M., six days a week. When it closes, she goes home to cook dinner. Sundays are for sleeping and washing clothes. It is these long hours, she believes, that have helped her succeed where some others have not. ''I came to this country 17 years ago, and only two times I have gone to the movies,'' Mrs. Kim said. ''The media say all Koreans make money. American people work 40 hours and take off vacations. We work 70 hours and have no vacation.''
THE WILLINGNESS OF MANY newcomers to work such long hours can provide stiff competition for other Americans. In fact, when many New Yorkers think of small-scale entrepreneurs, they think of immigrants. According to Harper's Index for December 1988, the chances that a white American man is self-employed are 1 in 7; the chances that a foreign-born Korean-American men is self-employed are 1 in 4. In fact, a 1982 census count, the latest available, showed that 17,350 blacks, 10,338 Hispanics and 13,577 Asians and other minorities own their businesses in New York City.
Bill Howell, president of Howell Petroleum Products, a wholesale distributor of fuel and motor oil, grease, lubricants and antifreeze, is determined to prove that opportunities exist for all. A black American who grew up in North Carolina, he works in his spare time as a counselor in the city's job-training programs for inner-city youth, expounding the message that they, too, can succeed.
Mr. Howell suggested several reasons fewer blacks than immigrants go into business for themselves: many immigrants are well educated and were professionals or businessmen in their own countries; many can draw on extensive networks of support and credit from fellow immigrants. And many immigrants, desperate to make it, are willing to put in longer hours than many Americans, black or white.
''We haven't been willing to work for nothing,'' said Mr. Howell, ''What I'm all about is trying to import the work ethic. It's a fact: to achieve anything in America you've got to be willing to work real hard for it, just like the Koreans, Indians or Jamaicans.''
Mr. Howell, who is 41, said he had always dreamed of going into business for himself. He pursued that dream through a succession of jobs, including bank credit officer, life insurance salesman, special assistant to former Senator James L. Buckley, executive director of the Association of Minority Enterprises of New York and senior marketing officer at two petroleum products firms.
Finally, he felt ready. After heart-to-heart talks with his wife, Jessica, who works as a civilian employee of the Coast Guard, Mr. Howell took his savings of $15,000, enlisted his wife and a friend as partners and founded his company in 1985. He made his first sale to a buyer he knew in Co-op City, lugging a five-gallon drum of grease in his own car for a $5 profit.
To build his business, he drew on his marketing experience, his personal contacts and his volunteer work. It was at a youth leadership seminar that he met a Texaco official who offered to supply him, cash on delivery. Now Texaco provides 80 percent of his products, as well as substantial credit.
Aggressively seeking out opportunities provided by affirmative action programs, he competed for contracts set aside for small businesses owned by women and minorities,, winning them at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and from New York City agencies.
Living at first on his wife's Coast Guard salary, Mr. Howell expanded slowly. He stored his products in a friend's garage. The first year, he lost $10,000 on sales of $50,000, but his sales doubled every year thereafter and in 1988 he cleared $30,000 on sales of $750,000. He ran his business out of trailers, and the trailers kept proliferating. City officials told him about inexpensive office space at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and last February he moved his barrels, drums, fax machine and seven-person staff there.
Now his customers include Brooklyn Union Gas, Nynex and The New York Times, and his biggest dilemma is how to expand. He is sorting through offers from banks and from city agencies to lend him money, and hoping for sales of $1.5 million this year.
Mr. Howell praises New York City officials for their outreach to minority-owned business, but he fears that the opportunities that helped to build his business will shrink in the wake of recent Supreme Court decisions that significantly weakened affirmative action precedents.
''Up until the Supreme Court decisions, I was called on a daily basis by people trying to find minority-owned businesses to fulfill whatever contracts they had,'' he said. ''Since the decisions, there are no calls. If this had happened two years ago, it probably would have put me out of business.''
IT WAS RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, in part, that gave Alma Nugent the incentive to go into business for herself. Born in Costa Rica and brought up in Nicaragua, Ms. Nugent, now 50 years old, arrived in the United States at the age of 22. She became a nurse, but later realized that she really wanted to be an interior designer. So she went back to school, working part-time as a nurse. But when she graduated from the New York School of Interior Design and the New York Institute of Technology in the mid-1970's, a recession was in full swing and she found no openings.
Being black, a woman and older than most other design-school graduates did not help. ''When I showed up, they told me the job had just been given to someone else,'' Ms. Nugent said. So 13 years ago she decided to start her own company from her apartment in Manhattan. Using $20,000 in savings to live on, she planted herself at home, printed some stationary and looked for clients. Her first break came when a doctor she knew asked her to design his office, and she began the slow process of garnering referrals.
''This is a word-of-mouth business,'' she said. ''I have a lot of friends. I join a lot of organizations. That's what happens - friends tell friends.''
In four years, her expanding business allowed her to share an office with an architect on 114th Street, near Columbia University, and then move in 1983 to her own offices on West 57th Street. She now employs two full-time designers and one part-time office worker and her biggest costs are rent, payroll and insurance.
''One of the things I have to credit myself for is perseverence,'' said Ms. Nugent, smiling at her own understatement. ''It's taken a long time - much longer than I would have wanted - to have people know me and want me.''
It is still difficult to head a young company in a business where many of the best-known designers are men and a less-established company often loses clients to big-name firms. But the frustrations have not stopped her, and Nugent Designs is still around and winning commissions. One of the largest was a 15-month series of projects for Prudential Insurance's Newark office. One of the most challenging: designing the interior of a corporate jet, from the built-in consoles down to the table linens.
Ms. Nugent spends part of her free time interesting young people in going into business for themselves. Working with business organizations such as the New York City Partnership, she helps students at Grand Academy, a public school on the Lower East Side, learn to set up a school store, get a bank loan for it and mark up goods.
Like most entrepreneurs, Ms. Nugent vacillates between euphoria at success and fear of failure, juggling her determination to keep doing what she loves with the inevitable stresses that risk entails. Last year was her worst time. With sales (total gross earnings, including design fees) of $250,000 - which she says is very little for the interior design business - she feared her company could not survive. Like most designers, Ms. Nugent charges her client a fee for her designs as well as a commission on the furnishings she orders for them at her professional discount. But after paying rent, salaries and overhead, she estimates her profits after all taxes and expenses are between 5 and 7 percent of her sales.
This year, business picked up, and she is awaiting word on a contract that could allow her to reach sales of more than $1 million.
''It's a wonderful field, and it really means a lot to me,'' Ms. Nugent said. ''It's much easier now. I've proven myself. But sometimes business is good and sometimes it slows down tremendously and I think, why am I in this?''

HEADLINE: THE ULTIMATE MARKETPLACE;
Potrait of a Wall Street Lady

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK; David Margolick covers legal affairs for The New York Times.

 BODY:
''GENTLE DRAGON Lady.'' That's the phrase Alice Young chose to describe herself for a profile commissioned by the Dewar's Scotch people. Ms. Young, 39, was recently selected by the liquor manufacturer as one of 50 youngish, accomplished New Yorkers, a ''Do-er.'' She accepted the honor, although she never touches the stuff.
Ms. Young, a partner in the Wall Street law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, was the only corporate attorney on Dewar's list. Her latest accomplishment, she told Dewar's, was ''negotiating five different joint ventures and acquisitions involving Japan, Italy, France and the United States simultaneously; getting my son and daughter to willingly eat fried calamari.''
When it comes to her accomplishments, Alice Young is not modest. ''I wanted to have a successful career, and I have that,'' Ms. Young, who is head of her firm's Asian group, said in a recent interview. ''I wanted to have a happy marriage. I have that. I wanted to have children, and I have two, who are really neat, happy, bright. I don't know what happens in a couple of years, but so far, so good.'' 
How does she explain her success? A bit uncertainly. For fear of offending other, more battle-scarred women, she'll reiterate just how difficult it is to be mother, wife and law partner simultaneously, and how she could never do it all without a phalanx of the faithful - husband, nanny, secretary, paralegal, cleaning woman -behind her. On the other hand, she seems to resent the notion that to prosper in a large law firm, a woman must be angst-ridden, masculine or maladjusted. ''Just because you're driven doesn't mean you have to be neurotic,'' she said.
By all measures, Alice Young has had a charmed career. She has been the right person in the right place at the right time. She entered the law when firms at least said they wanted women. She began her career as the world's economic center of gravity shifted eastward, when terms like ''Pacific Rim'' entered the lexicon. And, at a time when law firms were attempting to build bridges to the Far East but had little sense of how to proceed, she was an Asian-American who'd grown up speaking Chinese at home, had picked up Japanese in college and also knew a smattering of Korean. She became a partner as competition on Wall Street intensified and firms, jettisoning the genteel behavior of a gentlemanly profession, aggressively courted superstars, then let them be themselves.
And, in a world where appearance and personality matter, Alice Young is charming and individual. In a world of unisex gray flannel, she dresses brightly - on one day recently, in indigos and magentas. (Though she claims to dress in 15 minutes and says she puts on her makeup in taxis, she looks impeccable.) Her clothes match the bouquet of lilies and heather on her desk; flowers, delivered each week, lend an unusual panache to her utilitarian surroundings in Milbank's offices at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.
Still, Ms. Young is not just another pretty face, as her docket for September attests. In that time she helped Nippon Shinpan, Japan's largest consumer credit company, set up an American operation; represented a major American museum - which she declined to name - on various matters in Europe and Asia; handled real estate financing deals for the Development Bank of Singapore and securities lending issues for the Yasuda Bank and Trust Company (of which she is a director); advised the New York Life Insurance Company on ventures in Japan and Hong Kong, and counseled a Japanese construction company in negotiations with several American cities over a proposed linkage of mass transit systems. She also negotiated space for a Japanese gallery seeking to open in New York, advised three Japanese artists on attempting to bring a musical to Broadway, and signed Don Johnson, star of ''Miami Vice,'' to shoot two television commercials for another client, Japan's Minami Sports Company.
''It's a pretty long list,'' she said. ''It's been a long month.'' Still, there is enough time left over for extracurricular activities. Ms. Young is on the board of the Aspen Institute, serves on the business associate committee of the Metropolitan Museum, belongs to the Council on Foreign Relations and is secretary of the Japan Society.
Yet, for all of her accomplishments, Ms. Young has her detractors, who, given the close-knit world of the Asia bar, tend to keep their feelings to themselves. Quietly, they'll tell you she is more image than substance, with a streak of self-promotion. There's that Dewar's award, for instance.
ALICE YOUNG WAS born into a family of achievers. Her brother, Peter, is an investment banker at Salomon Brothers; her younger sister, Nancy, is a partner at the New York law firm of Richards & O'Neil. Their parents were born in China. Dr. Young entered the diplomatic corps, and was stranded in the United States during the Communist takeover in China in 1949.
Ms. Young was born in Washington, D.C. When she turned 12, her family spent two years in Tokyo, where her father administered a language program for the University of Maryland. They then moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Young entered the University of Hawaii in an accelerated study program. She transferred to Yale, becoming part of the first group of women to matriculate there. Her major was in East Asian studies, and she won a fellowship to study Japanese literature in Tokyo under Yasunari Kawabata, the novelist and Nobel laureate, in the summer of her junior year. She graduated in 1971 and entered Harvard Law School, from which she graduated three years later. She entered private practice, first in the Hong Kong office of Coudert Brothers, a firm long known for its international work, then with the San Francisco firm of Graham & James, for whom she set up a New York branch.
Ms. Young's first marriage ended in divorce - the result, she said, of a youthful mistake and not her workaholism. In 1984, she married Thomas Shortall, an institutional bond salesman at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. (Mr. Shortall's late father, Leonard, was an author and illustrator of children's books; in response to the Dewar's profile question ''last book read,'' Ms. Young cited ''Washington Goes to War,'' by David Brinkley, and ''Little Toad to the Rescue,'' by Leonard Shortall.) A daughter, Amanda, was born in 1985, and a son, Stephen, followed in 1987.
Starting a family did not set back Alice Young's career. Indeed, despite a difficult pregnancy that included four and a half months confined to bed, Ms. Young billed more hours in 1985 than any other lawyer in her office. (When Amanda was born, a wise client gave her mother a fax machine.) In 1987, when most of her law school classmates were still relatively junior partners - and many of her female classmates had dropped out of law altogether - she began talking with Milbank, Tweed, an old-line, somewhat stagnant firm anxiously seeking to shed its stuffy image. Impressed by the advantages of working for a large, multiservice enterprise and eager to get rid of some of her administrative chores, she made her move. She's rarely stopped moving since.
Every morning, Ms. Young leaves her home in Montclair, N.J., around 8, two hours after her husband. Amanda gets dropped off at the school bus; Stephen stays with a babysitter. Ms. Young is in her office by 9, where her day's activities are listed on her computer. There are meetings and other tasks, like glancing at the Asian Wall Street Journal, the Far Eastern Economic Review, and, for some Japanese fashion clients, Women's Wear Daily. But much of her work, like that of any international lawyer, is done by phone; the average day brings 50 calls. Mornings, they come first from Europe, then New York. By midafternoon, they may be from the West Coast. One requires her to switch instantaneously to Japanese. A visitor can make out only a few words - ''debt-equity ratio,'' ''America,'' ''speakerphone'' - plus the gist of the conversation: yet another Japanese company is acquiring yet another piece of America. At least one more thing can be detected from the caller's laughter: here is a client at ease with his counsel. Ms. Young hangs up, saying, ''People expect me to be a different, much more hard-boiled . . .'' - here she stops, searching for the right euphemism - '' . . . a tougher style of person.''
Around 7, the domestic calls stop, and the calls from Asia start. The beads of lights along the Brooklyn Bridge, visible outside Ms. Young's window, go on at different hours, depending on the time of year; but even when the days are longest, she is invariably around to see them shine. When, then, does she quit? ''When there is no major crisis, when I'm too tired, when I have some sort of family or social obligation that forces me out,'' she said. Nevertheless, from time to time, her husband goes ahead and eats dinner without her.
Ms. Young says it is her Asian-American background, with its stress on personal interdependence, that has helped keep her sane. The emphasis on family and friends, something she found suffocating as a teenager, is reassuring now. By way of explanation, she notes a phrase from a book by another Asian-American, Maxine Hong Kingston's ''Tripmaster Monkey'': ''Anybody American who really imagines Asia feels the loneliness of the U.S.A. and suffers from the distances human beings are apart.''
Alice Young admits to paying a price for her success. Nowadays, the books sit on her nightstand longer than they once did. Other interests are either neglected or abandoned; she has less time than she'd like with her family. Still, it is a sacrifice she seems willing to make. ''I've seen kids who were messed up even though their parents were around all the time making cookies,'' she said.
EN ROUTE TO COLLECT her Dewar's prize, Ms. Young calls her family on the car phone.
''Hi, Pumpkin, how are you doing?'' she asks Amanda. ''Did you have a good time in school today?'' Then another voice comes over the wire, one which, at first, she does not recognize. In fact, it is her son. ''That's right,'' she says to him, as she's about to leave the limousine. ''Mommy's working.''
''Attorney, wife, mother, daughter, Asian and dreamer, not necessarily in that order.'' That's how she summed herself up for Dewar's.

HEADLINE: THE ULTIMATE MARKETPLACE;
It's Not Just Window Dressing

BYLINE: By LOUISE LAGUE: Louise Lague is an independent writer and window shopper.

 BODY:
SIMON DOONAN, THE vice president and creative director of Barneys New York, stands before one of his Seventh Avenue windows and purses his lips slightly. He points at the sleeve of a jet-black Ronaldus Shamask jacket, where a stray white thread has been carelessly abandoned. ''That,'' he says, all firm and British, ''is not supposed to be there.''
One has the feeling heads will roll for this. In the small, fickle world of window dressing, Doonan is renowned, an enfant terrible. In one window last year, he shwoman being sawed in half; another was the target of a knife-thrower. ''There was a terrible uproar,'' says Doonan. ''I just told everybody that it was unfortunate if the scenes reflected a violent attitude toward women, but these things do happen in the circus, and these windows were about the circus.
''Most people think display people are all nut cases anyway,'' he adds. 
No one will be decapitated for the errant thread. Doonan's not really that kind of guy. If his windows have ''a pretty sharp edge,'' as he puts it, he's only trying to get attention. That's what windows are for. New York City has always been the display capital of this country. It is one of the few places left in America where people walk to stores and pass other stores on the way and are caught by the beauty, cleverness or absurdity of the scene within a frame. Elsewhere, people drive to enclosed malls, within which stores have glass walls facing an indoor corridor - the entire store becomes the exhibit. But visual merchandising that happens within the perimeters of a window, perhaps with a backdrop, is by comparison a haiku, a nearly obsolete art, says Robert H. Hoskins of the Fashion Institute of Technology. As assistant professor of display and exhibit design, Hoskins observes: ''We take windows very seriously in New York. Only here could we have designers as celebrities.''
At the moment, the celebrities are few but colorful - Doonan at Barneys, Gene Moore at Tiffany, Danuta Ryder at Henri Bendel, Fernando Lara at Citarella Fish. As well as they know each other's work, they do not know each other personally. ''Of course, I've sent him many fan letters,'' says Simon Doonan of Gene Moore. ''There's an association,'' says Thomas Beebe, the display director at Paul Stuart, ''but we're all too busy to go.'' Hoskins says: ''The competition is fierce. They build their own kingdoms. Put them all in a room and the walls would crack.''
Creativity in window display has flourished in cycles. Salvador Dali made history at Bonwit Teller in 1938, when he filled a Persian-lamb-lined bathtub with water and juxtaposed it with a bloody-faced mannequin wearing coq feathers. Other famous artists worked incidentally on windows on the way up: Maurice Sendak, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol all either designed windows or built props. L. Frank Baum, the author of the first Oz books, was the founder and first president of the National Association of Window Trimmers and in 1897 started Show Window, the trade's first journal.
In the 1950's, designers began to attain superstar status. While doing the windows for Bonwit's, Gene Moore would go to the runway shows with the buyer and ''just pick out dresses that would look good in the window and make her buy them,'' he recalls. He once ripped a pink satin rose off the sash of a white Norell ballgown while doing a window, later explaining to the furious designer that ''it ruined an otherwise brilliLnt design.''
At 79, Moore is the acknowledged dean of New York window design; he has been doing Tiffany's celebrated boxlike windows since 1955. ''It's easy for me,'' he says, ''but isn't it crazy that it's still fun?'' He has the most fun when he can unstring some pearls or smash a Waterford goblet. ''Then,'' he says, ''I actually get phone calls telling me there's a broken glass in the window.''
His style is wildly diverse: a heart locket in front of a chest X-ray, a toy truck dumping a pile of real sand in which a real diamond glistens. He takes cues from current events. Once, during a drought, he showed a fountain spewing gin. When a fire inspector called it flammable, Moore lighted a match to prove it wasn't.
While the art and scenery at Tiffany are planned eight months ahead for the biweekly changes of his five windows, the jewels that will be exhibited are almost an afterthought. Moore sweeps through the store the day before his Thursday dawn installations and snaps up five pieces of jewelry that will function with whatever artwork he has created. ''I never change my mind, either,'' he says.
THE LATEST GOLDEN age of windows was the 70's, when Candy Pratts Price was turning the Bloomingdale's windows into a kind of street theater. ''We had surrealistic windows, situation comedies,'' she recalls. ''Bob Currie was doing the same thing at Bendel's. The press covered the windows, people came to see them, small stores all over town got into the act.'' Little gangs of New Yorkers, members of the creative community, would tour the town on Wednesday and Thursday nights when the windows changed, oohing and aahing over the new installations. (''Aaaah'' is a big word among window designers; they go for the ''aaaah'' the way Jane Fonda used to go for the burn.) Price, now a fashion director at Vogue, remembers serving Thursday night popcorn to window groupies outside her store.
That excitement has died down for various reasons. For one, the number of experienced designers has been diminished. ''AIDS has completely decimated the profession,'' said one store owner. He refused to divulge the name of the freelancer he hires. ''Good people are too hard to find.'' Currently, more and more women are entering the field. At Parsons School of Design, where Linda Cahan has taught visual merchandising for seven years, 90 percent of the display students are now women. ''There never was anything about the job that women couldn't do,'' says Cahan, ''but it was just very hard for women to break in, more so in New York than anywhere else.'' In response to the popularity of display classes, Parsons is introducing a 10-course certificate program in visual merchandising this fall, and next year the School of Visual Arts will inaugurate a four-year degree program in display.
CAHAN ESTIM ATES that half of New York's display designers have had formal training. She tells her students to expect an average of $10 an hour to start as an assistant. A freelancer can get $1,000 or more for a single window on Madison Avenue, and a very good creative planner who becomes a store vice president can earn upward of $100,000 a year. ''They all want to go into apparel,'' she says, ''but the chains with their mass design ideas - Benetton, Banana Republic, The Limited - have made apparel less creative. I tell them that the future is in travel agencies, accessory stores, liquor stores and service storefronts in general.''
If the world of windows is less outrageous than it has been, Robert Hoskins of F.I.T. lays the blame on the corporate tenor of the marketplace in the 80's. ''The recession hit retailing, and all decision-making went to upper management,'' he says. ''Budgets were cut, the business became bottom-line oriented rather than creative. And that was before all the major department store takeovers.'' In the eternal battle between the creative types and ''the suits,'' the suits have been winning.
Over at Barneys (no apostrophe, please, it's part of the style thing), Simon Doonan has conquered this problem by being a creative type who wears a suit. ''Display and merchandising are a marriage,'' he says. ''That's why I dress for this job.'' Before he came to Barneys four years ago, Doonan, 37, had built a reputation as a freelance designer for Maxfield's in Los Angeles, where he'd done windows featuring women in coffins, coyotes stealing babies and a couple of urinals and a sink to set off some Yamamoto menswear.
Barneys, which opened 66 years ago at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street as a men's discount clothing store, has since become a purveyor of men's and women's full-price fashions and accessories, gifts and antiques. Windows elsewhere exist to pull pedestrians in off the street. Barneys, in a pedestrian-poor area, is, for the fashion-conscious, a destination in itself - ''Which is all the more reason to do special windows for the people who come here,'' says Doonan.
Barneys, which devotes half its display budget to windows, is very successful at the primary purpose of window display, which is not to sell merchandise but rather to give the store an identity and image. ''This is what display should be about,'' says Robert Hoskins. ''Most shoppers today see the same merchandise everywhere and don't even know what store they're in.''
Danuta Ryder, the director of visual planning at Henri Bendel, meets four times a year with the store president, Mark Schulman, and the store manager to draw up a schedule for the next 13 weeks. ''We name a fashion designer for each week in the main window,'' says Ryder. ''Being selected is a coup, especially for a young designer.'' But sometimes plans go awry. ''One designer went out of business just before his week,'' she remembers. ''Another sent clothes so boring we couldn't put them in the window.''
Ryder installs on Wednesday night from 6 until 2 in the morning, working with two assistants and seven freelancers. ''I use one assistant for hair, one for makeup,'' she says. Real makeup is used and later removed with a spray of Fantastik. She usually pulls the clothes from the designer's boutique on Monday, renting her props on Tuesday.
''Basically you can sell anything from a window,'' says Ryder, but she likes her nonmerchandise windows best: a great pile of fake dollar bills for a storewide sale, a couple of fantasy lame ballgowns of her own design for a Christmas window. Usually the inspiration comes from the fashion. ''You see these Karl Lagerfeld coats with velvet collars? I took off on the velvet theme and spent the night making black velvet bows to stick on the walls. Everybody thinks this is glamorous. It's a lot of hard work.''
Up at Citarella Fish on Broadway at 75th Street, a Mexican immigrant who does not speak English (or even eat fish) spends at least three hours every morning laying out a new mosaic of salmon, squid, sole, scallops, shrimp, swordfish and shark. Fernando Lara made a British flag of fish for Princess Diana's visit, portrayed Mickey Mouse fishing for the cartoon character's 60th birthday and has put a Walkman on a 40-pound salmon.
One of the town's most famous window designers, Lara, 33, has almost as many press clippings as Simon Doonan. ''I get my ideas from my head, on the subway,'' he says. Topical notions are often suggested by his boss, Joseph R. Gurrera. Untrained in display, Lara was a busboy at the restaurant across the street from Citarella until Gurrera nipped him to work his icebox. Lara got his chance to try the window display when the regular man was sick. Since then, he has refused several offers to arrange fish elsewhere.
To keep his display fresh, Lara stretches it on packed crushed ice, and sprays it regularly with ice water during the day. At 6 P.M., in seconds flat, he takes the whole thing apart for the night, knowing he'll have to think up something else tomorrow.
LAST SUMMER, PAUL Stuart, at 45th and Madison, began ''hitting a comical vein,'' says the creative services director, Patricia Grodd. Thomas Beebe, the 36-year-old display director, and his three assistants are doing some of the most entertaining work in town at one of the most unexpected places. ''There's a lot of competition now in classic apparel,'' says Beebe, ''and we've got to try harder to get attention.'' Most of Paul Stuart's customers work around Madison Avenue, but they hurtle past the store at top speed, on their way to catching a train or a meeting. ''He's tense, his mind is going a mile a minute,'' says Grodd of the Paul Stuart shopper. ''There is a trend to try to sell people a life style, but we think that's patronizing. He's already got a life style. He needs a little bit of delight, a little surprise.''
Paul Stuart's 14 windows are full of innuendoes that puncture the stuffiness of being very well dressed. A masculine figure in a pristine pink suit sits on a park bench sharing a hot dog with a pigeon. The other end of the bench bears a ''Wet Paint'' sign. A man in a flawless charcoal suit strides purposefully, carrying a briefcase and, under his elbow, an enormous striped bass. ''He'd rather be fishing,'' says Beebe. ''The joke is always to juxtapose the formality of the clothes with people's private fantasies.
''Our windows are meant to make the store less forbidding, to give people a lift,'' he adds. ''We get our feedback from the hot dog vendor on the corner, and from the finger marks on the glass.''
AS CO-OWNER OF Pure Madderlake, a SoHo flower store that does a brisk telehone-and-delivery service with East Side hostesses, Billy Jarecki has the ultimate freedom to do wild windows, the kind he had for years when Madderlake was uptown in the East 70's. He once used a mannequin's head wearing a blond coif that was perfect in the front but teased, matted and stuffed with cigarette butts and a soda can sprouting a narcissus in the back. ''Okay,'' he says sheepishly. ''You're not supposed to make fun of the customer. I did that. I got yelled at.''
Pure Madderlake now deals in home furnishings and outdoor furniture as well as flowers. The next dimensions for display there will be smell and taste. ''I'm putting a big kitchen in the middle. You know how all stores smell like potpourri? This will smell like frying onions, simmering soup, whatever I'm making that day. I'd like to put a bowl of soup in the window.''
Robert Hoskins finds Jarecki's ideas not at all off the wall. ''What shoppers want now is a sense of place. That's what Ralph Lauren does so well. You look at the windows, you go in the stores, you feel that you're in a place that you instinctively know and like. The big complaint now is that all the stores look alike. That ought to end.''
But Jarecki isn't thinking about marketing. He's thinking about life. ''I feel so lucky to be able to walk around and breathe. I say, hey, I'm alive, let's have fun. In case people aren't sure they're alive, I like to have a little something in the window that makes two little brain cells rub together. That does it for me.''
 
ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN
If you have ever wanted to watch a window dresser at work, this season offers some of the best opportunities -shops and department stores all over the city will be decorating holiday windows during the next couple of weeks. Scheduled installation dates for stores mentioned in the accompanying story are given below.
 
BARNEYS NEW YORK, Seventh Avenue, at 17th Street (929-9000). The window dressers began to install holiday windows - ''Signs of the Zodiac'' - last Thursday and will continue on Monday and Tuesday, beginning at 9 A.M. each day. After Jan. 1, 1990, all 17 windows will be changed on alternate Thursdays.
 
HENRI BENDEL, 10 West 57th Street, off Fifth Avenue (247-1100). During most of the year, the four windows are changed every Wednesday evening. The window dressers begin at 6 and work until they're through. Holiday windows will be installed this weekend and will remain until after New Year's.
 
BERGDORF GOODMAN, 754 Fifth Avenue, between 57th and 58th Streets(753-7300). The windows on all three sides - on 57th and 58th Streets and along Fifth Avenue - are usually changed every Tuesday starting at 6 P.M. Holiday windows, however, will be installed during the day on Nov. 18 and 19 and wont' be changed until after Christmas.
 
BLOOMINGDALE'S, 1000 Third Avenue, at 59th Street (705-2000). Displays change about every 10 days, but the dressers drape the windows so that spectators cannot watch.
 
CITARELLA FISH, 2135 Broadway at 75th Street (874-0383). Fernando Lara lays out the fish in the window every morning between 8 and 11, although store doesn't open until 8:30 from Monday to Saturday and 10 on Sunday.
 
PURE MADDERLAKE, 478 Broadway, between Broome and Grande (941-7770). Billy Jarecki changes both windows every Wednesday, beginning at 5 P.M.
 
PAUL STUART, Madison Avenue at 45th Street (682-0320). The women's fashion windows (one on Madison, one on 45th) are usually changed during store hours on Wednesday. Decorating all of the store's 14 windows takes up to a week, the last calendar week of every month; merchandise in the windows may be changed more frequently. The holiday windows will be installed all this week, during the day, to remain throughout the holiday season.
 
TIFFANY & COMPANY, 727 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street (755-8000). Gene Moore changes his five windows on alternate Thursdays, very early in themorning, before the store is open. The holiday windows will be unveiled Nov. 30 and remain until the normal schedule resumes on Jan. 4.

GRAPHIC: Danuta Ryder, director of visual planning at Henri Bendel, in the 57th Street window she redecorates each Wednesday night. ''Basically,'' she says, ''you can sell anything from a window''; at Citarella Fish on the Upper West Side, Fernando Lara creates a display from the fruits of the sea. Arranging a new design takes him at least three hours every morning (pgs. 50-51); Gene Moore in his office at Tiffany. He has been doing the celebrated boxlike windows since 1955; Billy Jarecki at Pure Madderlake. His goal: ''Something in the window that makes two little brain cells rub together'' (pg. 52); detail of a 1958 Easter window at Tiffany. Gene Moore used real grass, eggs and precious necklaces; Simon Doonan, the creative director and a vice president of Barneys New York, considers a finis

HEADLINE: THE ULTIMATE MARKETPLACE;
Working to Feed the City - the Butcher, the Baker ... the Marketplace Maker

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL; Molly O'Neill is reporter for the living section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE FOOD DAY BEGINS shortly before midnight at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx. It is a militaristic-looking complex in a wasteland of auto wreckers and junkyards. Convoys of semi-trailers pass through a toll-booth opening in the barbed-wire and corregated-tin wall that surrounds the grocery compound. They unload, they load. Last year, five million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables were sold from the gargantuan warehouses here, primarily to grocery chains and huge wholesale buyers. Meat, packaged fish, dairy goods, canned and frozen food are also sold, about $7 billion worth a year. Almost everything comes in packages; almost nothing is sold retail.
On the far West Side of Manhattan, angling from 14th Street to Ninth and 10th Avenues, the day also begins before dawn in the city's meat district. Refrigerated trucks purr outside the low-lying buildings. Meat cutters in splattered white coats and hard hats push racks of swinging lamb and goat carcasses and sides of beef across the uneven sidewalks. The aromas of game and diesel fuel hang over the blocks. 
At 3:30 A.M., as trucks begin to pull away from the Hunts Point Market, a different fleet idles around the Fulton Fish Market, the 158-year-old fish exchange under the East River Drive, near the tip of Manhattan. In shin-high rubber boots, workers push handcarts loaded with mussels and clams, baskets of small flatfish and loose dinosaurean halibut across the wet cobblestones. The steady squish of the the veneer of ocean underfoot gives the early morning a rhythm. The air smells of low tide and diesel, coffee and doughnuts.
Commerce has etched New York City's topography as irrevocably as any natural force. And commerce began with the buying and selling of food. Today, New York can be seen as a long food chain. From the wholesale markets, on the city's fringes, it spirals through the shops in the boroughs' ethnic neighborhoods where food is prepared and sold and on into the large grocery stores and boutiques that dot Manhattan.
You can still buy and sell almost any kind of food in New York City. But the nature of that buying and selling is changing. Centralization and bulk buying are nibbling away at the old-time wholesalers. And the effect can be felt in the sense of erosion that now pervades the outer ends of the food chain.
When it opened in 1967, the Hunts Point Market, with its modern, efficient, bulk-buying mentality, eclipsed the nearby Bronx Terminal Market. Today, the older market is a quieter shopping area, still running under the Major Deegan Expressway, still hearkening back to a time when produce was chosen by touch and aroma. The three-block stretch smells of cilantro and garlic. Hunts Point has pallets of canned tuna; its predecessor still has dollies loaded with fresh sugar cane, bins of watermelons, mounds of mangoes. Although no longer a major source for large supermarkets, the Bronx Terminal Market is still a mecca for Hispanic grocery stores.
Before dawn, the owners of New York's small bodegas and corner shops pull their battered vans and station wagons into the market. They walk the stained cobblestones and make deals. There is something fragile in the crumpled greenbacks they exchange. There is something endangered about the peculiar odor that comes when parsley stems and fruit peels and cigarettes are paced into the diesle-fuel-drenched pavement. But the market perseveres.
So does La Marqueta, the string of shedlike buildings that stretches beneath the Metro North tracks along Park Avenue from East 111th Street to East 116th Street. Needed renovations been at a standstill for the past two years, and more than half of the market's 150 food stalls have been abandoned. But La Marqueta remains the place for chayote squash and fresh tamarind pods, for smoked turkey necks, fresh farm eggs, sorrel syrup and hairy purple potatoes - still sold retail or wholesale at some of the best prices in town.
The downtown meat district pushes anyone who walks here back to the time before meat was portioned, positioned on absorbent Styrofoam and wrapped in a transparent shield. Tons of meat are shipped from here each week. And yet that number diminishes every year, according to Edward Seh Jr., of Pacific Seh Wholesaling, who has been selling meat from the area for 40 years. ''The big chains buy boxed meat direct from the slaughterhouses,'' he explains, which cuts out the some of the middlemen of Manhattan.
And so, the Bronx Terminal Market and La Marqueta grow quieter. In the meat district, established wholesalers worry about their sales. Will they crumble like the piers that stretch their ghostly tentacles into New York Harbor?
Not long ago, small parcels of food were landed on those narrow piers, everything from local fish to bananas from Panama. Then small parcels gave way to semi-trailer-size containers, and they could only be landed and stored in sprawling ports like Red Hook, in Brooklyn, Newark and Elizabeth in New Jersey.
Yet New York is still the most active port in the country. And despite some decay, its wholesale markets continue to feed some fundamental need in New York. Maybe it's just that the sense of adventure it takes to embrace the city's wildly varied foodstuffs is predicated on the assurance that somewhere two people shook hands over the ingredients.
No market portrays the abiding importance of this exchange better than the Fulton Fish Market. More than 450 varieties of fish - 90 million pounds annually - are sold from the sagging tables that line the stalls of this the largest fish market in North America. But in an era of computerized accounting and bulk buying, every deal at the Fulton Market is person-to-person, handshake-by-handshake, cash-to-pocket. ''It's the last piece of civilization in this town,'' says Robert Neuman, co-owner of the Rosedale Fish and Oyster Market on the Upper East Side, as he makes his daily 4 A.M. purchase.
By 6 A.M., the local bakeries are beginning to issue yeasty smells. The city's ethnic enclaves are rousing. The second link of the New York food chain is waking up.
Not far from the East River, in the former German and Hungarian enclave on the Upper East Side, the aromas of baking rye and raisins and pumpernickle bread have nearly been eclipsed by the trendy scent of chocolate chip cookies. But by 4:30, an Old World essence still wafts from Orwasher Bakery on East 78th Street. At the same time, the smell of sourdour creeps up to the sidewalk from the subterranean bakery at nearby E.A.T. where Eli Zabar uses electric French ovens to fire his signature baguettes.
''This wasn't always a white bread town,'' says Mr. Zabar, pointing out that it is getting hard to find Jewish cornbread (Moishe's Bakery, on East Houston, still makes it) or an oven-warm bialy (except at Kossar's Bialystoker Kuchen Bakery, on Grand Street). A fine variety of traditional breads can be found on at Gertels Bake Shop, on Hester Street, and the Streit Matzoth Company, on Rivington Street, makes matzohs.
Bread has a different flavor in SoHo where, at D & G Bakery Mary Jackson turns out loaves of prosciutto bread, and Vesuvio Bakery is well-known for its Italian pepper biscuits. Until nine years ago, Trio Bakery, which produces sesame sticks, sandwich rolls and Italian and French bread, was on Bleecker Street. But SoHo, says Paul DiGiovanni, a baker at Trio, had gone from a fringe location, easily plied by delivery trucks, to a chic and congested area.
Now, by 7 A.M., there is bread-truck gridlock outside Trio on Ninth Avenue. Bread for hotels, restaurants and food stores is loaded, push-cart vendors stock up on sandwich rolls, and neighbors wander in to buy still-warm rolls. Ninth Avenue, one of the oldest ethnic enclaves in the city, has begun to stir.
IN THE BACK OF DI LUCA Dairy and Deli, a closet-size storefront, a man whose hands are used to the feel of boiling milk begins making some of the best fresh mozzarella in town. Behind the double windows of Manganaro Grosseria Italiano, where jars of imported pasta, biscotti, olive oil, vinegar and cheese are displayed against a backdrop of gilt Venuses, Sal dell 'Orto slips into his blue grocer's jacket and sips the morning's first espresso.
Back in 1890, when his mother's family opened the grocery, recalls Mr. dell 'Orto, the neighborhood was called ''Paddy's Market,'' and pushcarts lined Ninth Avenue from 31st Street to the low 50's. Today, much of the best shopping is compressed between 40th and 36th streets. ''Its a tough time,'' says Mr. dell 'Orto, noting the scheduled razing of a nearby block of tenements and the high-rise (and high-rent) apartment complex that has been proposed for the site.
But until that development and its attendant real estate repercussions are unleashed, these four blocks of Ninth Avenue offer food of an astounding ethnic diversity.
Manganaro sells a wide range of Italian staples, and Giovanni Espositio and Sons Pork Shop has delicious Italian parsley sausage. Bulaklak Philippine Food Center stocks groceries from the Philippines. At the Ninth Avenue Cheese Market, Karen and Pando Andonopulo sell more than 300 kinds of cheese, in addition to dried fruits, olives, Rumanian sausage, Iranian caviar and Turkish groceries. Central Fish, a wholesale and retail store, stocks species to ease the worst case of homesickness, whether the longing is for Greece or Italy or Southeast Asia. With its bins of dried spices and beans and tubs of fresh feta, International Groceries and Meat Market remains an important Greek grocery. And the West African Food Corporation, in the shadow of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, offers white corn, pigeon beans, ground yams, palm wine and Nigerian beer.
BY 7 A.M., THE ETHNIC ENCLAVES on the fringes of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens are also awakening. In tiny shops on Canal Street, bundles of long green beans, fresh lemon grass, hairy melons, bok choy, rice stalks and duck eggs covered in ash are arranged for display. Swimming in cloudy aquariums, carp and black bass turn a lazy eye to the tourists and the Chinese housewives who drag their wire carts along the crowded sidewalk.
The stretch between Mott, Pell and Doyers is like an alley in Hong Kong, offering such treasures as fresh water chestnuts, taro root or snow pea shoots. Kam Man Food Products is an excellent overall market, as is Kam Kuo, where English-speaking clerks offer a huge selection of Chinese produce, dried goods and groceries as well as the pots to cook them in. Other interesting shops include Tai Pei Wine and Liquor, for Chinese alcohol, and the Han May Meat Company. Hoi Lee has fresh tofu, and the Chinese American Trading Company stocks an array of dried mushrooms, soy sauces and Chinese canned goods.
Along Mulberry Street, the smell of ginger gives way to that of garlic as Chinatown ends and Little Italy begins. For the most part, food stores have been eclipsed by tourist restaurants here, but a few fine shops remain. Alleva Dairy continues to sell fresh and smoked ricotta, along with a huge selection of other fresh and aged cheeses. Milan Lab Wine and Beer offers spices and home-brewing equipment. The Italian Food Center stocks pasta, canned goods, sausages and oils. Farther north, Faicco Pork specializes in pork braciola. And although glitzy pasta shops have covered New York City like locusts, not one of them turns out a more tender fresh ravioli than Raffetto's on West Houston Street.
The East Village (a real estate term that promises clean and well-lighted supermarkets filled with tightly wrapped, mass-produced groceries) is encroaching on the Lower East Side. But family-run specialty stores that are crowded with bins of unpackaged foods still open early in the morning. Fine smoked fish is laid out at Russ and Daughters. Ben's Cheese Shop has perfect cream cheese, while Miller's Cheese specializes in baked farmer's cheese, and Yonah Schimmel sells potato, kasha and fruit knishes.
DESPITE THIS FINE VARIETY, today some of the most authentic ethnic strongholds are outside of Manhattan. In Brooklyn, waves of Russian emigres have been revitalizing the food-shopping center under the El on Brighton Beach Avenue. On Sundays, every Russian within a hundred-mile radius seems to be packed into M & I International, known as the Zabar's of Brighton Beach. And there are plenty of other interesting shops: Stolichny Deli and Fish Town Deli both sell whitefish and caviar; Melrose Take Out Foods has sweet-potato kugel and homemade gefilte fish; Mo's Deli Market offers spicy Georgian relish.; Israel's Take Home Foods has deliciouis peirogi, and outside the Continental Grocery, a young woman sells cabbage-filled pirozhok.
On Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue, Middle Eastern groceries abound. The gentrification in Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights may have spurred renovations at Sahadi's Importing Company, but it didn't change the quality of the store's olives, fresh dates, cracked wheat or spices. The Oriental Pastry and Grocery Company offers lamb sausage as well as zata (pita with spices and olive oil), along with a dozen types of olives and six different kinds of perserved lemons. Damascus Bakery specializes in pita bread; Shammas & Company is the place for feta cheese.
In the West Indian and Carribean neighborhood neighborhood of Crown Heights, the narrow sidewalks are crowded with women wrapped in vivid African dresses, and the early-morning air is dense with Rastafarian incense and the aroma of frying meat patties. Ultrafine Meats, on Nostrand Avenue, may be the most exotic butcher in New York, offering fresh goat, oxtail, hog's head and smoked turkey. El Caribe Food Center stocks a wide selection of island vegetables.
Brooklyn is not without its Italian stronghold. Along the trim streets of Carrol Gardens, you can still find deep-fried chickpea balls and rice balls, fresh biscotti (at Caputo's) and potato pizza (at Monteleone's). Most importantly, the neighborhood is home to the premier branch of G. Esposito Jersey Pork Store, which offers cuts of meat from Manhattan's meat district as well as sausage, prosciutto balls and fresh pasta.
WHEN THE EARLY MORNING light dances across the Agean-blue facades of the shops along 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, bakalva and spinach pie are already cooling on bakery counters. Astoria is the third-largest Greek city (after Athens and Salonika) in the world. It is a place where bouzouki music plays against the rumble of trains on the El, where dill and oregano, mint and sage grow in window boxes. At Titan Foods, the A. & P. of Astoria, lines of people debate the qualities of the store's six different kinds of feta, and they buy goat's-milk yogurt, olive oil, canned and preserved Greek groceries. Mediterranean Grocery Foods also stocks an extensive array of Greek groceries. And the Ocean Number 11 Fish Market stocks the fresh octopus and thumb-size squid that Greeks dote on.
Flushing is New York's second Chinatown, where prices are lower than in Manhattan, and Korean, Japanese and Southeast Asian groceries are often offered along with groceries from mainland China. Flushing Food, for instance, offers Chinese and Thai products, while the shelves of Daido/Main Street Foods are stocked with Japanese and Korean groceries. Flushing Seafood has a high evnough standard to please them all.
Like Manhattan's Ninth Avenue, Jackson Heights has a great variety of storefront groceries. The aroma of Indian spices surrounds Patel Brothers and the Shamiana Sweet Center, while the clean perfume of fresh lemon grass emanates from Tahi Grocery and the sweet molasses smell of Latin American pastries envelops La Constancia Argentinian and Las Americas.
By 8 A.M., Manhattan has begiun to stir. Gray suits and briefcases are scurrying along the sidewalks toward midtown offices, the farmers in the green market at Union Square are setting up their stalls, and the third layer link in the New York food chain - the city's specialaty stores and carriage-trade grocers - are unfurling their tidy awnings. Unlike the wholesalers the small, ethnic providers, and, indeed, the farmers, these suppliers count on presentation and service as much as they do on quality.
The elaborate and imaginative arrangements in the window at Citarella Fish, on the Upper West Side, for instance, are famous throughout the city. The display windows are more subdued at the Rosedale Fish and Oyster Market and Pisacane Midtown Corporation. But, along with the seafood departments at the Jefferson Market, Balducci's and Dean & Deluca, the premier fishmongers of Manhattan all artfully showcase the fish they bought hours before at the Fulton Fish Market.
When it arrives from 14th Street, the some of the best of New York's meat is carefully primed for display at such distinguished general butcher shops as M. Lobel and Sons, the Nevada Meat Market and H. Oppenheimer Prime Meats. There are also many specialty meat stores in Manhattan: Ottomanelli's Meat Market is noted for its game; Raoul's Butcher Shop is the best French butcher in town, and Bremen House has good German meats. Butchers at each of these stores cut and groom their products with an eye toward the profits it takes to finance ceramic tile floors in pricey neighbhorhoods.
SPECIALTY EMPORIUMS like Zabar's (for smoked fish, cheese, condiments and coffee), Fairway (for cheese and produce), Murray's Sturgeon (for smoked fish) and Todaro Brothers (for Italian groceries), even the Jefferson Market (for exquisite personal service and general groceries), haven't moved very far from their sawdust-on-the-floor days - each store is a loud circus where assertive shopping is the key to top service and quality.
But the rising generation of carriage-trade stores sometimes seems to be moving away from the idea of groceries as comestibles and toward the notion of food as art. At the ever-enlarging Balducci's, for instance, the huge and arcane selection of produce is often wilted - but it is always impeccably polished. Dean & Deluca suffers no such quality problems. Every sprig of mountain-grown wild thyme, every scallop with its bright orange roe intact, every green bottle of olive oil has been selected for its perfection. And, even if buying a basket of these groceries can run the price of a small piece of art, it's impossible not to be grateful for this elegant SoHo resource.
Stores such as Balducci's and Dean & Deluca have been designed to soothe the ever-escalating concerns of food shoppers. The gleaming glass cases promise precious ingredients that have been protected from dirty hands and tainted environments. The marble counters don't give up splinters or salmonella. Every ingredient carries a pedigree of its origin, picking time, packing time, shipping time and possible use in the kitchen.
The flavors - of wild strawberries at Dean & Deluca, caviar at Caviarteria, cheese at Cheese of All Nations, herring at Old Denmark, chocolate at Kron, Le Chocolatier Manon or Teuscher - are often astounding. And along with these well-groomed groceries, the food products that were bought before dawn on the fringes of New York reach another apogee in dishes prepared to be sold like groceries. In the heart of the city, where the sidewalks are clean and wide, Good and Plenty sells a remarkable roasted vegetable-stuffed focaccio, Country Host sets out kidney pie, Lorenzo & Maria's Kitchen makes vegetable-stuffed eggplant, Mangia sells current-stuffed English scones, and Word of Mouth offers a fine glazed ham.
THOUGH THESE STORES ARE generally located far from the rough edges of the city, their pristine, white tile floors are not bedrock. They are stages supported by an economy that began hundreds of years ago.
''Where's the gourmets going to be without me,'' asked a rubber-booted lumper at the Fulton Fish Market one recent dawn. Like the previous generations of men who pushed dollies loaded with seafood, he had stopped to warm his hands over a fire built in a metal trash drum. He was scowling. Residents of a nearby co-op, it seems, had called the fire department to complain.

GRAPHIC: At E.A.T. Gourmet Foods, on the Upper East Side, a baker carries a tray of bread baked in one of the three electric ovens in the one of three electric ovens in the store's basement. Thousands of loaves are baked every day; the day begins at around 4:00 a.m. at the Fulton Fish Market, near the southern tip of Manhattan. Each year, millions of pounds of fish, in over 400 varieties, are sold at this venerable fish exchange; the work day also begins early at A. Woursell Inc., on West 14th Street, in the city's meat district. Tons of meat are shipped from this area every year, but the number is diminishing (pg. 22); at Dean & Deluca, the way food is displayed may be as important as how it tastes (pg. 34) (Sylvia Plachy)

COMMERCE. BUYING AND SELLING. MONEY - IF you can make it here, you'll make it anywhere. That's one of the most powerful images of New York City: this is the big time. Seven of the 10 largest banks in the United States are headquartered here, along with 6 of the top 10 financial institutions and 4 of the 6 largest insurance companies. New York Harbor is the most active in the country, moving 2 million tons a year. Over 1.5 million workers belong to 550 union locals in New York.
There are 700 major galleries, museums and nonprofit exhibition spaces in the city; the Metropolitan Museum alone receives 4.5 million visitors each year. About 350 American films were released here in 1988, and 115 of them were shot here as well, at least in part, generating $600 million. 
New York is a complete fashion marketplace. More than 5,000 firms are engaged in the design, manufacture and production of clothing (100,000 lines are on display at any time), and 76 trade publications originate here. Apparel worth $14 billion is shipped annually.
Sometimes New York's predominance is simply a matter of scale. Every town has some kind of food industry, but in New York City last year there were 10,500 eating and drinking establishments employing 132,440 people and generating well over $6 billion; 7,000 food retail businesses made another $8.3 billion. Even the individual businesses can seem over-scale: Zabar's is visited by 35,000 paying customers and 10,000 browsers every week, during which period the store sells 35,000 pounds of coffee, 4,850 pounds of smoked salmon and 2,500 pounds of scallion cream cheese.
But the city isn't all big business. Some 360,000 New Yorkers are self-employed, and small enterprises start up every day. In Queens alone, 6,541 new sole proprietorships and general partnerships were registered last year. All around the block, in every borough, storefront businesses - pharmacies, photocopying centers, video rental parlors -are integrated into our communities. Some are so specialized they probably couldn't support themselves anywhere else (there's a beauty parlor in Murray Hill where owners and pets can get groomed simultaneously). Some will fail, to be replaced by others like them.
It all comes back to buying and selling. More than 405,000 people in the metropolitan area work fulltime in legitimate retail operations. And last year, according to the latest Survey of Buying Power, more than $42.2 billion was spent in this city in retail transactions.
There may be more opportunities to make it in New York, but there also seem to be limitless ways to spend it. Read on.
 
* Nearly 75 percent of all employees in the securities industry work for companies centered in New York.
 
* New York is home base for 6 pro teams, 5 leagues, 2 players' associations and a referees' union.
 
* Production of feature films, TV programs and commercials generates $2.3 billion a year in New York.
 
* In 1988, 3.38 billion feet of mail were delivered in the city. Federal Express made 900,000 pickups and deliveries.
 
* Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 306,000 buyers and browsers saw Santa at Macy's Herald Square.
 
* Broadway sold about 8 million tickets for $262 million last season (1,097 playing weeks). Average price: $33.90.
 
* 1988 diamond imports to the U.S.: 1,644,298 carats ($589 million), most to be cut and polished near 47th Street.
 
* Last year, 19.8 million visitors stayed overnight in city hotels and spent $9.76 billion in New York businesses.

RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON
The Rise of an American Politician.
By Roger Morris.
Illustrated. 1,005 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company. $29.95.
In April 1945, a slightly rumpled 32-year-old United States naval officer, just returned from the Pacific, looked out of the 20th-floor window of a building on Church Street in Manhattan and watched Dwight David Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, ride triumphantly through the ticker tape. The distance between the five-star general and the small-town lawyer from Whittier, Calif., temporarily in uniform, was by any stretch of the imagination unbridgeable, and no one felt this more wistfully than Lieut. Comdr. Richard Milhous Nixon. 
One year later, Mr. Nixon was in the House of Representatives. Four years later, he took his oath as the junior Senator from California. Six years later, before turning 40, he was elected Vice President of the United States on the ticket that took Eisenhower into the White House.
Where had this Nixon come from? To his enemies, many of them from the Eastern Seaboard, the southern California politician seemed to arise from the void, a creature of his own opportunistic self-invention. Even his friends and supporters, as well as some members of his family, found him mysterious.
He is among the most enigmatic figures in American history. Of all our Presidents, Mr. Nixon has been the most Shakespearean in his capacity to self-destruct (Richard III and Coriolanus come to mind) and, even when surviving, to elicit tortuous psychic drama from political action. The only President ever to be forced to resign from office, he occupied center stage in a unique instance of political theater. As if he were pushing the Shakespearean metaphor still further, the loss of the Presidency almost cost him his life.
This life - so internally opaque, so resistant to interpretation, so provocative of deep anger among the legions of Nixon opponents - is now the subject of a projected three-volume biography by Roger Morris, a Harvard-trained political scientist who served Mr. Nixon on the National Security Council before resigning over the invasion of Cambodia. This first volume takes the story up to the Vice Presidential inauguration in 1953.
''Richard Milhous Nixon'' is a massive, powerful biography, absorbing in its research and in its skillful use of anecdote and illustrative detail. When the project is completed, America will have a narrative useful to critics and defenders alike. In fact, it will no longer be possible to damn or defend Mr. Nixon without reference to this great locomotive of a work.
Certain biographers fasten onto their subjects at just the right time: not too early, when meaning is impossible to fix, nor too late, when all that remains possible is merely one more adjustment of the academic record. Like John Morley on Gladstone or Arthur Schlesinger Jr. on Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Morris is writing at a moment when his subject is at once part of history and part of the central political consciousness of our era. The roles Mr. Nixon played, the lines he spoke - in the Alger Hiss case, in the McCarthy controversy, in the Vietnam, Cambodia and Watergate crises - are pivotal points in our contemporary history. By turns admirable, despicable and even tragic, he has played dark or, in the case of China, inspired parts in momentous events that to this day affect our political values and behavior.
All of the protagonist's adult roles in ''The Tragical History of Richard Nixon, Part One'' are a long way from the young Nixon who pulled down the kitchen shades of the family home in Yorba Linda, Calif., so that no one could see him washing the dishes after supper; or who wrote to The Los Angeles Times at the age of 11 asking for a job as an office boy and saying that he would work at any wage offered; or who took a merciless pounding as a junior-varsity tackle at Fullerton High School, pushing himself again and again into the game despite his essential ineptitude; or who became a small-town lawyer after failing to land a job in a fancy New York law firm despite his good grades at Duke University Law School; or who, as a persistent suitor, had his future wife, the astonishingly beautiful Thelma Patricia Ryan, bolt the door in response to his persistent knocking.
Mr. Morris's biography is filled with hundreds of moments in which the reader is tempted to say: ''Now I understand Richard Nixon.'' I am not talking here of psychoanalytic understanding or of a political or ideological response. I mean an intuitive leap - even if empathy wars with distaste - into the inner landscape of another's existence. Outside of his devoted family and a very small circle of close friends, Mr. Nixon has remained curiously resistant to such empathy.
Snobbery has accounted for some of this failure to empathize. Middle-class people like Mr. Nixon do not have the easy appeal to the intelligentsia possessed by patricians or campesinos. Even Arthur Miller finds it hard to like Willy Loman. But Mr. Morris has exhaustively established the human story of Mr. Nixon's early years in all their day-to-day detail, illuminating, for better or worse, defenders or critics, the public man.
The setting of this first installment is southern California, where Mr. Nixon grew up, was educated and got his political start in two ruthless campaigns. For many educated Americans, the area is terra incognita, as unsusceptible to interpretation and as tempting to scornful invective as Mr. Nixon himself. But it has been richly harvested by Mr. Morris.
Outside of those employed in the movie business, few southern Californians have entered the national arena, a surprising fact given the region's wealth, population and politically important entertainment industry. Those who have achieved national reputation - for instance, Gen. George S. Patton Jr. and Ronald Reagan - have by and large had their California associations held against them. Besides, Patton was an aristocrat, impeccable in his Virginia ancestry, and Mr. Reagan was a Midwest import turned film star. In southern California terms, Richard M. Nixon was the real thing.
Thus, when he went on television during the 1952 campaign to make his famous Checkers speech, he defended himself as the common man in politics, the sort of fellow who could afford only a cloth coat, not a mink, for his wife, Pat. This desperate ploy worked, in part because Mr. Nixon, so clumsy, so eager in his white starched shirts, perfectly embodied the lower-middle-class aspirations at the core of the southern California experience in the early 20th century. As a boy in the 1920's, Mr. Nixon was often taken, along with his brothers, to the Angeles Temple in Los Angeles to hear Aimee Semple McPherson preach. Brilliantly, ''Sister Aimee'' knew just what the Nixons and the others in her congregation wanted to hear: a message of redemption, economic as well as religious, amidst the bungalows and citrus groves.
Frank Nixon, the future President's father, was a sometime streetcar conductor who worked just such a citrus grove. But when the bills came due before the lemon trees matured, he turned to running a gasoline station and a grocery store. He had married above his station, into a clan of Whittier Quakers named Milhous, which could never accept Hannah Milhous's choice of a poorly educated, intermittently surly motorman as her husband. In later years, Hannah - a radiant figure by all reports, emanating a fundamental goodness born of an intrinsic spirituality - experienced both the positive and negative results of her choice. On the one hand, her husband adored her. And yet he could be difficult, sitting truculently in a parked car while she was visiting her relatives and honking the horn if she stayed too long. She worked by his side in the gasoline station-grocery store. Indeed, he seemed to panic when she was not by his side.
The major portion of the book concerns Mr. Nixon's political races against Jerry Voorhis and Helen Gahagan Douglas, his involvement in the Hiss case and the 1952 Presidential campaign. Each of these sections derives its power from the fact that a superbly told story is grafted onto the earlier narrative of Mr. Nixon's private life, extending through World War II. These youthful years are not employed as reference points to justify psychologically any of Mr. Nixon's more egregious offenses - the redbaiting of Douglas, for example, whom he defeated for a Senate seat in 1950. But described in detail, they do present, for the first time, a portrait of the 37th President as a full, if flawed, human being and not merely a symbol to be accepted or rejected on partisan grounds.
We see Mr. Nixon at age 12, losing his beloved younger brother Arthur to influenza and, later, his older brother, Harold, to tuberculosis. We see the teen-age Nixon rising at 4 A.M. to buy vegetables at the farmers' market for his father's grocery store, yet refusing to wear a grocer's apron and still delivering orders for his dad after he passed the bar and became a lawyer. We see him in high school, avoiding the dirty corduroy pants that were the fashion, angling for election as student body president. We see his inhibited college courtship of Ola Welch, who left him for a man who was more fun. And we see the dean's-office break-in he undertook with two fellow students at Duke to get an early look at their grades. That incident, which could have cost him his career had he been discovered, showed his massive insecurity even as a second-year law student (and, of course, is chillingly prophetic of a future break-in that would cost him the Presidency).
Mr. Nixon's courtship of Thelma Patricia Ryan has all the power of a realist novel set in southern California. Raised on a hardscrabble ranch in Artesia, Calif., she initially craved the bright lights and the big city. She attended junior college in Fullerton, Calif., and worked in a New York City hospital before returning to graduate from the University of Southern California. Resourceful enough to earn one speaking line in the 1935 film ''Becky Sharp'' (the line was cut), she opted instead for the respectability of becoming Miss Ryan, teacher of commercial subjects at Whittier High School.
Mr. Morris allows none of these early details to obscure his narrative's honesty or to sentimentalize it. Those who loathe Mr. Nixon because of his role in the Hiss case or the smears he leveled against Helen Gahagan Douglas in his Senate campaign will find much to corroborate their judgments.
In terms of the major events of the early career, Mr. Morris recounts a great deal that is new. During the Hiss case, for example, Mr. Nixon was in secret and risky contact with the F.B.I. He was also being fed information by the Rev. John Cronin, a priest who had his own extensive network of informants. Mr. Morris discloses Mr. Nixon's support in the anti-Communist Roman Catholic community, including that of then-Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, and the equally important support of elite WASP's in Pasadena and San Marino, Calif. It was these gentlemen who created the fund that allowed Mr. Nixon to avoid out-of-pocket expenses for campaigning, and consequently almost cost him his place on the 1952 ticket. The account of this crisis reveals Mr. Nixon at his most complex, by turns brooding, despairing and courageous. Turning public opinion around with his Checkers speech, a televised tour de force, he buried his face in the studio curtains after the broadcast, convinced that he had blown it. He was soon capable, however, of forcing a previously vacillating Ike to eat humble pie in Wheeling, W.Va., then collapsing in tears again after the ordeal was over.
Such accounts give this biography its authority, and it will continue to be read as long as there are those who understand that to fathom Richard Milhous Nixon and his career is to come close, very close, to the inner landscape of middle-class America in all its aspirations, strengths and deficiencies. The composer John Adams understood this in his opera ''Nixon in China.'' So does Roger Morris.

HEADLINE: CHILDREN'S BOOKS;
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO WRITE ABOUT THE RICH

BYLINE: By MARK JONATHAN HARRIS; Mark Jonathan Harris's most recent novel for children is ''Come the Morning.''

 BODY:
During the discussion after a recent talk I gave at a school, a sixth grader asked me, ''Why are people poor?''
Surprised by his question, I stalled and asked the class. Hesitantly at first, then with increasing liveliness, they offered their views: ''stupidity,'' ''hard luck,'' ''not enough jobs,'' ''laziness,'' ''drugs,'' ''prejudice,'' ''God's will,'' ''the stinginess of rich people.'' Although many of their responses reflected the attitudes of their parents or the news media, what struck me most was the children's passion. This was a middle-class school, in a racially mixed neighborhood in Los Angeles, yet many of the children had firsthand experience of poverty. They had encountered the homeless in the streets as well as on television; they knew families who had suffered financial hardships; and from the fervor of some of their replies, or their embarrassed silences, I suspected that several of them were poor themselves. Almost all of them had had some personal glimpse of economic deprivation, and they wanted to understand it. 
Of all industrial countries, the United States has the highest proportion of children living in poverty. Approximately 13 million children - one out of every five - in this country are poor. Yet recent children's books have largely ignored the subject.
The 1960's and 70's saw the introduction of a new candor and realism into children's novels. Writers could tackle death, disease, divorce, addiction. Generally, however, these problems were all viewed from the perspective of the white middle class. Yet in the second half of the 19th century Horatio Alger wrote more than 100 books proving that even the poorest dead-end kid could make it to the board room - if only he were willing to work hard and use his initiative. Margaret Sidney also celebrated the triumph of pluck over poverty with her best-selling ''Five Little Peppers and How They Grew'' in 1881. The most enduringly popular of the cheerful school of poverty books are Laura Ingalls Wilder's ''Little House'' series, eight autobiographical novels, written from 1932 to 1943. For Wilder, like Sidney, poverty is only a temporary obstacle to be overcome by resourcefulness, courage and the love and kindness of the family.
In the 20th century the Depression took the romantic edge off poverty, and two world wars, urbanization and divorce began to erode the nuclear family. When children's fiction began to deal more frankly with contemporary life, idealized families like the Peppers and the Ingallses disappeared. Two decades ago, a pair of books by Vera and Bill Cleaver showed that parents can't always be counted on to protect their children from the ravages of adversity. In ''The Mimosa Tree'' (1970) and the Newbery Award-winning ''Where the Lilies Bloom'' (1969) the Cleavers present two impoverished families in which the children have only themselves to rely on. The second book portrays the rural poverty of Appalachia, the first the slums of Chicago, but in many respects the novels are virtually identical. The ailing father in ''Where the Lilies Bloom'' dies; the father in ''The Mimosa Tree'' is blind and never leaves the apartment. In both books it falls upon the gritty 14-year-old heroines - Marvella Proffitt and Mary Call Luther, respectively - to make the hard decisions for the family's survival. Although the poverty the Cleavers portray is much grimmer than that of Sidney or Wilder, their fictional children are larger than life, with a strength and resilience that, at times, borders on the mythological.
When Americans were more optimistic about the chances of working one's way out of penury, it was easier to write about the subject for children. Today most of us are skeptical of the rags-to-riches myth, and few would be willing to preach the character-building virtues of impoverishment. Because there are no easy solutions to the problem, most writers simply avoid dealing with it.
Two exceptions are Alice Childress and Walter Dean Meyers. Although written in 1973, Ms. Childress's novel ''A Hero Ain't Nothing but a Sandwich'' (which is not about poverty per se, but a 13-year-old boy on his way to being hooked on heroin) speaks to our bleaker view of poverty. Told from a variety of perspectives, it remains one of the most powerful and complex portraits of people trapped in the urban ghetto. ''We think of poverty as a condition simply meaning a lack of funds, no money,'' the school principal says in the novel, ''but when one sees fifth, sixth, and seventh generation poor, it is clear that poverty is as complicated as high finance.''
Walter Dean Meyers has written a number of books about black children and teen-agers growing up in our toxic inner cities. One of his latest, ''Scorpions,'' depicts the tragic consequences when Jamal, a 12-year-old, comes to possess a gun. The book is notable for the way Mr. Meyers conveys his protagonist's sense of powerlessness. Jamal wonders if there will ever be a time when he won't have to worry about somebody beating him up. Even when he gives the gun up at the end of the book, a part of him, ''a part that [is] small and afraid,'' still wants to keep it.
The families in both ''Hero'' and ''Scorpions'' are working poor, not second or third generations living on welfare; yet as the few examples of poor people in contemporary children's books, they may not be able to counter the commonly held belief that poverty is a problem of the underclass. The absolute increase in poverty, moreover, is among whites rather than blacks, among two-income rather than single-parent families. To think about poverty as mainly an underclass or minority issue is not only to misconceive it, but also to wall it off and make it alien.
With rare exceptions like ''Scorpions,'' in the last decade the social-problem novel has fallen into disfavor, swept off the shelves by the Reagan-era nostalgia for traditional values and a preference for simplistic, ''just say no'' solutions. Book-buying adults - who, by and large, purchase the books that children read - seem to be opting for works that extol community, continuity, security. Publishers, eager to cater to their middle-class buyers, produce more and more upbeat entertainments.
Like all of us, children want to make sense of the world around them. Poor children want to understand how others in similar circumstances cope with their feelings of anger, frustration and deprivation. Middle-class children may wonder if they should fear the poor, or pity them, or what might happen if their own family's fortunes were to founder; and they wonder how to help.
Books are still one of the most important ways that children extend the range of their experience. In the privacy of their reading, children can test their beliefs and perceptions without having to defend them against disapproving peers or parents. The writer's art and the reader's imagination free children to rethink, reassess and refeel their own attitudes about themselves, about others and about the world in which they live. In our increasingly divided society, it is critical that we not disdain or ignore the experience of one-fifth of our children.

HEADLINE: Like His Team, Tarkanian Is Always on the Run

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
''Athletically we are not a bandit school, we are not an outlaw school. We're good academically, that's been documented. We've made mistakes, like other people. But we're not outlaw, we're not crooked.'' - Dr. Robert Maxson, president, University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
 
When Jerry Tarkanian became the head basketball coach of Nevada-Las Vegas in 1973, the school was still being referred to in certain circles as Tumbleweed Tech, a derisive reference to the fact that the university opened in 1957 with 300 students and one building set on a 60-acre plot of desert.
There was no identity, no tradition, just an educational oasis in the midst of sand and casinos. 
''In the early 70's, if I said that I was from U.N.L.V. at various meetings, people would always ask 'Where?' '' said Dr. Richard Baepler, who was president of the university in 1973 and actively lobbied for the school to hire Tarkanian. ''We realized that we could use the athletic team to get the kind of attention that helps the academic side. We don't get that response anymore.''
Runnin' Rebel basketball under Tarkanian has put the school so solidly on the map that one can hardly think of Nevada-Las Vegas without thinking of a fast-break game and the sad-eyed coach known affectionately - by some - as the Shark.
Under Tarkanian, U.N.L.V. has reached the Final Four twice. His 1976-77 team went 29-3 before losing in the semifinals; his 1986-87 team, which some say was his best team until this season, was 37-2.
The 59-year-old coach begins the 1989-90 season with the highest winning percentage of any active coach (.823) and a team that many think is his best ever.
The Rebels have been ranked No. 1 in most preseason polls, marking the first time in Tarkanian's 28-year college coaching career that one of his teams has begun the season ranked at the top.
''When I came here 17 years ago, this was not a good job, there weren't many people who wanted this job,'' said Tarkanian, who came to U.N.L.V. from Long Beach State where he had turned that program around. ''I'm really pleased with the way the program has grown.''
''I'd like to coach a few more years and then retire,'' the coach added when asked about his future. ''I don't know how many more years I have. If things work out I'd like to stay here, but you never know.''
That final thought seems to come out of nowhere. Indeed, it seems odd that a coach of Tarkanian's stature would be uncertain about his future, particularly at a school that he has virtually helped create.
But the doubts about a solid future are more than the musings of a coach contemplating retirement. At a time when most men at his age, in his profession and with his accomplishments are enjoying the fruits of their labor, Tarkanian still finds himself being pursued by secret agents.
For the last week investigators from the National Collegiate Athletic Association enforcement staff have been in Las Vegas interviewing a wide range of athletic and non-athletic personnel about charges of improprieties within the men's basketball program. It is the fourth time in five months that the N.C.A.A. has been on campus. Tarkanian, despite a good front, admits that he is worried.
''They're not going to find a major violation,'' Tarkanian said. ''We haven't done anything. Absolutely haven't done anything. But there's not a program in the country that they can't go into and spend as much time as they've spent in our program and they might not find something minor. But they aren't going to find a major violation.
''I'd walk away from the program if they did.''
As if it weren't enough to have N.C.A.A. investigators on campus, a local newspaper in the last two weeks has raised questions about late-model cars that some Rebel players have been driving around Las Vegas. As it turned out, Mark Warketein, the assistant to the athletic director, was able to document the origin of the cars in question and in one instance pointed out an investigative error by the newspaper.
Nonetheless, the reports only served to intensify a conflict between Tarkanian and the N.C.A.A. that has been going on since 1974 when the organization placed Long Beach on probation, a year after Tarkanian left for U.N.L.V.
In 1977, the N.C.A.A., apparently continuing its pursuit of Tarkanian, put the U.N.L.V. basketball program on a two-year probation. The organization ordered Nevada-Las Vegas to suspend Tarkanian but was prevented from doing so by an injunction. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which last year ruled favorably for the N.C.A.A. and left the organization free to renew its effort to discipline Tarkanian.
Now a new investigation threatens to turn the university into a battle ground at a time when it is attempting to forge a reputation as a solid academic institution.
The reality is that the fervor that swept Tarkanian onto campus in 1973 and allowed unchecked expansion of the basketball program has been replaced by fervor to erase the bandit image of a basketball school. University and coach have clearly arrived at a crossroads and a stalemate.
As one member of the Board of Regents said: ''There was a time when we really needed it, the exposure that the basketball team could bring. Now it seems that we've outgrown the need.''
The university may have outgrown basketball in a figurative sense. As a practical matter, however, the Runnin' Rebels have become an integral part of the university's economic infrastructure.
The athletic department operates on an $8 million budget. It receives $1 million from the state and $1 million from student fees. The basketball program generates $5 million and single-handedly supports the university's sports program. Dr. Brad Rothermel, the school's athletic director, estimates that if the Rebels win a national championship, the program could bring in $6 million this season.
If the school is placed on probation it could cost the university $3.5 million a year in lost television and post-season revenue.
But the focus on finance, and even on Tarkanian's personality begs the larger questions: Has Tarkanian's basketball empire operated in accordance with N.C.A.A. regulations? More important, has that empire been built on the backs of players, the majority of whom were black and often poor, who put far more into the university than they were equipped to receive?
There is no clear-cut answer and Tarkanian has his own view: ''The way I look at it, if you bring a kid in that can't read and write, somebody nobody will touch, and you keep him here four or five years, teach him to follow the rules, make him responsible for what he does, at the end if he can read and write a little, you've done him a favor. Even if he doesn't have a piece of paper you've given him a chance to straighten out. I don't see anything wrong with that.''
From the time he began his college coaching career at Riverside City College in 1961, Tarkanian has specialized in finding and getting the most out of players who were overlooked, avoided or cast off by other programs. The pattern continued at Pasadena City College and began to attract attention at Long Beach State where Tarkanian, relying on a team of primarily junior-college players, had his team ranked seventh nationally in 1971-72.
''All I looked for was the kids who were committed to basketball,'' Tarkanian said. ''Often those were the black kids. I don't take another coach's word about a kid being a problem.''
Tarkanian has stretched the margins of his philosophy. In 1986 he authorized the recruitment of Lloyd Daniels, a player who attended four different high schools, never graduated from one, and was so controversial that no major program touched him. Except U.N.L.V. The result was one misadventure after another. Warketein became Daniels's guardian and the nature of that guardianship is the foundation of the N.C.A.A.'s current investigation. Daniels was admitted as a regular student in 1986. In 1987 he was arrested in a sting operation for attempting to buy cocaine.
Should the university have been involved with Daniels?
''If you're asking me if Mr. Daniels should have been recruited in the first place, I'd say you have to ask the coaches that question,'' Maxson said. ''I think you hold the coach responsible for who is recruited. I think that's the coaches' responsibility, they ultimately have to be responsible for the people they recruit. Once that person enrolls, then it becomes the business of the institution. I don't know of any president in the country that knows who's being recruited at any given time.''
Tarkanian admits that the experiment backfired, but stands behind the philosphy that allowed Daniels into his program.
''Lloyd Daniels was a real project, he had two and a half strikes against him when we took him,'' Tarkanian said. ''If it worked out, that would have been a great story. But it didn't work out and in all probability it wasn't going to work out. The odds of him working out were probably one in five. But we took that chance and it didn't work out.''
Critics point out that only 4 of the 13 players on U.N.L.V.'s 1977 Final Four team have received degrees. Only one of the four was a starter and another received his degree from another institution. Two of the 13 were unemployed as of last year, two worked as valets in Las Vegas, three are playing basketball, one is a security guard, one is a teacher, another a realtor, one a college coach, and another works in a paper mill.
Over the last five years, as the push for academic reform in athletics has become more rigorous, the basketball program has spent more than $60,000 a year for academic support programs. Since 1983, 10 of the 23 players who were eligible to play in their senior year graduated. Five of six seniors on the 1987 team also graduated. Seven players are back in school pursuing their degrees with fifth-year scholarships provided by the U.N.L.V. basketball Alunmni Association.
Maxson appears comfortable with the school's powerful basketball program.
''I do not believe there is an inherent conflict between good academics and good athletics,'' Maxson said, ''but you have to do them both with integrity, you have to be honest, you have to do what's right.''
Have the Runnin' Rebels done the right thing?
''Coach Tarkanian tells me that we have no problems, no major problems, in our program and I accept that,'' Maxson said. ''Until someone shows me differently, I accept what he tells me.''

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Town-House Rentals;
East Side Project Back in Construction

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
''IT'S the biggest bargain in New York!'' said Monica Dalton, casting an admiring glance upwards toward the dazzling skylight in the one-family town house she is trying to rent out for the owner. The skylight covers the entire room. It swoops down from a height of 45 feet, halting 17 feet above the living room floor.
Bargains are relative. The owner is asking $21,000 a month in rent for this 5,000-square-foot house at 222 East 67th Street, between Third and Second Avenues. That is about the annual income of the average New York City household. But in the town-house market on the Upper East Side, where prices in the $5 million range are no longer unusual, Ms. Dalton has a case. The wealthy user may work it out that the cost of renting will compare favorably to the net cost of owning. 
On East 67th Street, the interesting point is that the one-family house and the 10 houses that stretch down the block from it - which were started in 1983 and only now are being completed - are for rent at all. The first house was completed as a model, and the builder offered to finish the others and sell them to buyers for $4 million.
But buyers demurred and the marketing effort ceased. The buildings sat untouched, hollow shells of floors and walls behind a pink-granite facade, until this year. Now all 10 are back in construction, with a triplex and a duplex in each building. They are on the market for rent at $12,500 or $13,000 a month for the triplexes, with 3,050 or 3,100 square feet of space, and $8,500 or $8,750 for the duplexes, with 2,100 or 2,150 square feet. Leasing began in September. Occupancy starts in December.
The builder is Sheldon H. Solow, one of the Manhattan's few remaining producers of market-rate rental housing and one of the more innovative. The houses share a building lot with a 46-story apartment house, 265 East 66th Street, which Mr. Solow finished in 1979. The distinctive 301-unit, gray-glass apartment building has an underground parking garage that occupies ground beneath the town houses.
In the 70's, as the owner of a 40,000-square-foot site shaped like a backwards L - half along the west side of Second Avenue from 66th Street to 67th Street and the other half along 67th Street - Mr. Solow could have developed his site quite differently. He might have built a 35-story avenue tower and a 12- to 15-story midblock building, or a 51-story tower on Second Avenue, leaving the midblock area open as a private park.
Instead, he decided to use 50,000 square feet of floor area available under the zoning law for 11 five-story town houses. Their 60-foot height is in scale with the midblock buildings behind them on East 66th Street, which Metropolitan Life Insurance Company owns as a protective buffer for its full-block Manhattan House rental development across the street. The low scale also would assure better views for residents of lower floors in the tower.
The town houses have 18-foot frontages, 30-foot rear gardens behind 70 feet of structure and facades that are alternately flat or curved. Inside, there are 17-foot-high living rooms for the triplex occupants, broad skylights over the duplexes, which are reached by private elevator, and a level of luxury in the fixtures and interior construction that comports with the rents. The architect is Eli Attia.
''What we wanted was the feeling you get when you drive down Madison Avenue or Fifth Avenue - it feels like a fabric,'' Mr. Solow said. ''It had to be simple but luxurious.''
NEW town houses are a rarity in Manhattan, whether for rent or for sale. Gut rehabilitations of older shells are the more common form of constuction on the Upper East Side. ''You need 45 feet at a minimum for new development, and most of the sites are landmarked anyway,'' said Hope Parodi, a town-house broker with Brown Harris Stevens.
Beyond that, the Solow site was farther east than builders might normally be expected to venture with houses selling for $4 million.
In Greenwich Village, Ambassador Construction Company has completed eight speculatively built colonial-style brick town houses with garages on an 8,000-square foot site between Christopher Street and West 10th Street, and began offering them five months ago at $1.2 million to $1.4 million. The project is called Greenwich Mews. Two have been sold and one has been rented. The builder is willing to rent out the others at about $5,000 a month.
Rentals are gaining in the resale market as well. Brokers report resistance to the prices being asked for resale properties, whose formerly elevated price structure partially reflected the availability of steep income-tax deductions on mortgage interest. The 1986 tax reform act sharply cut the marginal tax rate for high-income taxpayers, so that the deduction is less significant than before.
TWO years ago there were about half as many town-house rental listings on the East Side as there are now, according to Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, which handles town-house rental listings. The firm has about 30 such listings, she said. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, which is handling the Solow town-house rentals, says it has listings of 125 private homes for sale on the East Side. Asking prices have a huge range - from $2.75 million to $11 million - suggesting the sensitivity of the market to the precise location as well as the wide variation in the condition of the properties.
The Solow town houses have links to the apartment house. They are tied in with its security system and are maintained and serviced by its staff. As for prices on a square-footage basis, they are renting for about $49 a square foot a year, topping even the average $42 that the builder is getting at East River Place, a 50-story, 415-unit building he has been renting out at 525 East 72d Street, on the East River, since January 1988. A total of 270 apartments have been leased.
The user's decision on renting or buying at this extreme high end of the market probably will be based on matters other than economic. Nevertheless, on financial grounds alone specialists say that the case for renting has improved in recent years.
Taking the example of the $156,000 annual rent for a triplex in a Solow town house, they make a comparison to the cost of a owning a one-family East Side house with a comparable 3,000 square feet of space. That much cash would suffice to pay the annual after-tax cost of owning a town-house unit of a similar size bought for about $2 million. This assumes that the buyer pays 20 percent in cash and gets a fixed-rate 10 percent, 30-year mortgage.
The buyer's net cost for the town house at the end of the first year would be about the same as the renter's, except that the buyer would also lose the interest he might have earned on the $400,000 down payment.
Eventually, buyers would recover their investment at resale, and possibly benefit from appreciation in value as well. But people expecting a shorter-term occupancy give that factor less weight.

HEADLINE: TALKING: Windows;
To Repair, Restore or Replace?

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
FROM almost every source - television, radio, direct mail and print ads - homeowners are being bombarded with promotions for thermal-pane replacement windows. A homeowner with an aging house and no restrictions on exterior modifications can find all this quite tempting.
The old windows may have unslightly rotted frames, which can let moisture and insects in. They may have deteriorated sashes, which make them hard to open and close. They may leak air, which results in heat loss. And the wooden muntins - the vertical and horizontal dividing bars - can be an annoying visual barrier and make cleaning difficult, although they also may add style and authenticity to a facade. 
But before deciding to plunge ahead there are less expensive alternatives to weigh, for even the most economical job is likely to cost an average of $300 a window, plus installation. In addition, there are so many types of replacement windows on the market that it is important to know the questions that need to be asked. (It is also possible, by shopping around for dealers and installers, to replace the glass alone.) First, some claims need to be discounted. Heat conservation experts insist that, assuming the house already has a full set of storm windows, even old ones, there is no evidence to confirm manufacturers' statements that there will be a major saving on fuel costs. ''There will be virtually no difference unless your windows leak and you don't already have storms,'' said Peter Judd, an assistant commissioner in the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Thus having the job done just to lower heating bills may be misguided. Further, brokers say, replacement windows will probably not add to resale value. ''It doesn't make much difference,'' said Ruth Brewster, president of Brewster Realty of Elizabeth, N.J., unless the existing windows are so decayed, rusted or warped that the house looks shabby and the fuel bills are far above average.
Typically, therefore, Jared Edwards, a partner in Smith Edwards Architects of Hartford, Conn., recommends replacing existing windows only when the owner wants more light or wants to escape the burden of maintenance.
For replacement windows truly are easier to maintain. Most have panes that can be tilted for easy cleaning from the inside, lessening the need for professional window services. If the new windows are double-glazed, which they should be, this eliminates the need for storm windows. And the frames are now being ''clad'' - permanently coated with vinyl or enamel-covered aluminium - to eliminate the need for periodic repainting.
In addition, the muntins will be slimmer and may be ''optional,'' meaning they can be clipped in or out at will. Or they can be embedded between the layers of glass for greater cleanliness and ease of maintenance.
Elimination of muntins, for example, was the goal of Norma and Alva Anderson, who replaced six rotted windows in their 50-year-old Cape Cod in Fairfield, Conn., earlier this fall. ''I love the open look,'' said Mrs. Anderson. Like many couples the Andersons did not change all their windows at once, dividing the job into two parts, which spread the cost over a longer period. An equity loan is another financing alternative.
Homeowners who opt for replacement windows need to decide if they wish to replace only the sashes - the movable frames holding the glass - or the sashes and the entire stationary frame within which the sashes move. Most prices quoted cover only sash replacement, and this may not suffice. Mark Russo, housing specialist with Cornell University Cooperative Extension Services in New York City, noted that often it is the frame that is rotted, since it often is unprotected by storm windows and therefore is most exposed to weather.
And the difference in price is steep. George Nemeth, vice president at Clearview Inc. of Bridgeport, Conn., a company that supplies and installs replacement windows, charges homeowners around $300 for a double-hung thermal replacement sash fully installed and $500 for the entire window with framing.
REPLACEMENT windows can be bought in either vinyl or aluminum for about the same price, said Mr. Nemeth. Vinyl has become more popular, he noted, possibly because ''it has more of a wood look.'' Homeowners, he said, should visit a dealer-installer's showroom to see the actual windows before deciding on a brand or model. They should also visit one or two homes where a job was recently done. He cautioned that a carpenter will probably also have to be hired if a change of window size or shape is being contemplated.
Installers and homeowners who have bought replacement windows say it should take no longer than one or two days for a crew to make the complete changeover if only sashes are being replaced, and about a week if new frames are included.
It is also a good idea to have the manufacturer send his own representative to measure each new window being ordered. Consider, for instance, what happened to Paul and Jane Mattingly of Elizabeth, N.J. A year ago they spent $9,000 replacing 30 windows at the four-bedroom, Tudor-style home they had just bought because the original iron casement windows, dating to 1926, were severely rusted and no longer closed properly. Storm windows were not feasible.
What they had feared - and what indeed did occur - was that three windows were incorrectly measured and had to be returned and rebuilt. Had a carpenter or other intermediary measured those windows, said Mr. Mattingly, there could have been a prolonged dispute over who was responsible for paying for the error. This way the manufacturer was clearly responsible.
If esthetic change or convenience is not the issue, then fixing the old windows might be wiser and more thrifty, and will enhance the integrity of the original facade in a manner that replacement windows rarely match. The rise of the restoration movement, noted Mr. Edwards, the architect, has helped develop many techniques for fixing even the most severly rotted sash or frame. Now available are replacement pieces and epoxies that restore a rotted area like a filling in a tooth cavity. Local preservation organizations are an excellent source of technical help for this kind of work.
Anyone opting for repairs should, at the same time, consider replacing old storm windows that may have warped and become unsightly. The newer storm windows are less obtrusive and more energy-efficient. ''Some of them are almost invisible,'' said Mr. Edwards. New storms cost about $80 to $100 each, installed.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Rights of a Co-op Renter
Question: I own a vacant apartment in a co-op that has no subletting restrictions. A potential tenant, who now lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in a nonevict co-op, expressed an interest in renting it but is worried because the apartment is not stabilized. He said he would not have the statutory protections he now enjoys, nor would the Division of Housing and Community Renewal come to his aid if I were to harass, overcharge or try to evict him. Is he right? Can I register the apartment under rent stabilization? . . G. T., Manhattan
Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the division which has jurisdiction over rent-regulated housing, there is no mechanism for adding units like yours to the rent-regulation system. Your prospective tenant is right; the agency would not be involved in any dispute that might arise between the two of you. 
However, a tenant does not have to be in rent-regulated housing to be protected against such things as harassment or illegal eviction. For example, to evict a tenant a landlord would need a warrant of eviction from Housing Court. Moreover, any tenant can bring a claim against a landlord in Housing Court and would not need a lawyer to do it. As for rent, while you are free to ask what you want, you could offer a lease-based rent and increases set by the Rent Guidelines Board.
 
Property Rights
Question: The property of my home is separated from my neighbor's by a fence eight or so inches inside his property put up many years ago by the previous owner. A tall hedge on my side of the fence has been cared for by my gardener for 30 years and my neighbor took for granted that we would trim and fertilize it.
The neighboring property was recently sold and the new owner has let it be known he is claiming the strip of property on my side of the fence, basing his claim on a survey, which is probably correct, that shows it belongs to him. The amount of land is minimal and of no practical use to him. Do we, by reason of ''historical'' considerations, have any rights to the strip on which the hedge is located? . . . S. P., Whitestone, Queens
Answer: Probably not. There is a legal doctrine known as ''adverse possession'' under which a person who openly and exclusively occupies real property continuously for 10 years under hostile circumstances, might be able to gain title from the owner of record.
''But it would depend on the relationship with the previous owner,'' said David L. Smith, an attorney who specializes in real estate matters. ''If he had an agreement to use this strip, it is likely that this would be considered an easement. Therefore, a claim to title under adverse possession would probably fail.''
Also, as a practical matter, the cost of making such a claim in court would probably far outweigh any benefits.
 
Prepayment Penalty
Question: I am a homeowner with a 30-year fixed- rate mortgage. According to the terms of my mortgage, there is a penalty for prepayment. I recently read that prepayment penalty clauses are no longer enforceable. Is this true? . . . M. E., Woodmere, L.I.
Answer: Yes, in most cases. According to Section 5 - 501, 3B of the New York State General Obligations Law, no lender can impose a prepayment penalty after the first year of a mortgage as long as the mortgage is on a residential property of between one and six units and is occupied by the owner. If you wish to file a complaint, write to the mortgage division of the New York State Department of Banking. The New York City office is at 2 Rector Street, New York, N.Y. 10006.

HEADLINE: Parking Spaces

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Imagine someone landing from Mars or Oshkosh and seeing your ''Talking'' column on Oct. 15 on protecting rent-stabilized parking spaces in a cooperative conversion.
Tenant attorneys, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and the State Attorney General all offer opinions on why a tenant should keep his place on a waiting list for a space after a building goes co-op. 
None of the experts seems concerned that the Rent Stabilization Law, designed to protect New Yorkers from rent gouging in a housing emergency, has become a windfall for car owners who happened to rent a space in a garage a few years before their neighbors.
Originally, the Rent Stabilization Law directed the state housing agency to establish guidelines for garage rents to prevent landlords from requiring exorbitant parking fees in connection with leasing a low-rent, regulated apartment - in other words, so that you couldn't be required to rent a $1,000 parking space to keep your $300 apartment.
The law would have been satisfied by rules limiting parking fees to tenants to those prevailing for all other garage customers. Instead, state regulators decided to treat parking spaces exactly like apartments, with their own stabilized leases, renewal notices and annual percentage increases way below market - all monitored at taxpayers expense.
By the same logic, New York should now buy every homeless person a car to live in.
P.S. I park on the street.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Carriage Houses;
New Home For Ballet

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Ten years ago the Ballet Hispanico of New York, a minority-oriented dance group that was gaining a foothold in the entertainment world, formally asked New York City officials if it could convert two former carriage houses in the West Side Urban Renewal Area into a permanent headquarters for the company and its school with studios, dressing rooms and office space.
Last Wednesday, after a decade of program reviews and the rehabilitation of the buildings, the new headquarters of the ballet group at 167-169 West 89th Street near Amsterdam Avenue was formally dedicated at a reception attended by 300 supporters. 
A total of $1.8 million had been raised from government, corporate and private donors to buy and renovate the two buildings. The structures were built in 1892 from a Romanesque revival design by the architect Frank Rooke as carriage houses, with the first floors as stables and living quarters on the second floors.
In 1984, the Ballet Hispanico bought the two buildings from the city for $110,000 as part of the West Side urban renewal effort.
The architect for the renovation of the buildings, which were gutted, joined and given a new roof, was the Manhattan firm of Buck & Cane.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Reverse Mortgages and Repairs;
New Help for Older Homeowners

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Two government programs announced this month offer loans and grants to older homeowners having low incomes or housing problems or both. In Washington, the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, made available for the first time about $200 million in guaranteed funds for 2,500 so-called reverse mortgages to be insured by the Federal Housing Administration. In Albany, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal made available $750,000 for emergency home repairs. 
Fannie Mae will guarantee loans by 50 lending institutions, which will issue mortgages for people at least 62 years of age who want to tap into the equity in their homes for living expenses. The terms of the reverse mortgage guarantee the homeowner that he may live in his dwelling for the rest of his life. The mortgage's concept involves gradually increasing the loan, rather than decreasing it as is customary. Upon the homeowner's death, his estate repays the outstanding debt through the sale of the property.
The pilot program, enacted by Congress to be run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, lets homeowners choose either a monthly income check or a line of credit. Payments are based on age, interest rates, the type of plan chosen and the value of the property. Details are available at local offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, reachable in Manhattan at 264-8053.
The state program, called Restore, for Residential Emergency Service to Offer Repairs for the Elderly, makes grants to local community action groups that provide up to $5,000 to low-income homeowners for repairs. To be eligible in New York City, a homeowner must be at least 60 years old with a yearly income not exceeding $18,950 for a single person, or $21,650 for a couple. Amounts differ in other parts of the state. For information, call the state housing agency in New York City at 519-5856 or in Albany at (518) 473-2104.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Victors Break New Ground But Face Old Woes

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
WHEN State Senator John C. Daniels was elected Mayor of New Haven last week, the retiring Mayor, Biagio DiLieto, felt a tinge of pity for his celebrated successor, the first black to occupy the city's top executive post.
Standing alone in a corner at Mr. Daniels's victory party Tuesday night, cupping an ever-present cigarette, Mr. DiLieto, also a Democrat, said he could think of no worse time for anyone to be taking over the reins of the city.
''I don't envy John Daniels,'' said Mr. DiLieto, a former police chief in his fifth term as Mayor. ''I could go on ad nauseam about all the problems he'll be facing.''
Much the same could be said for Bridgeport and its Republican Mayor-elect, Mary C. Moran, a real estate manager who brought about the biggest political upset of the year in Connecticut by defeating the incumbent, Thomas W. Bucci, a Democrat. Indeed, Ms. Moran, who will be the first woman to be a mayor in Bridgeport, may face the greater challenge of the two new Mayors. 
 
Problems of Cities
Ms. Moran, who has described herself as a housewife, has no experience in public office and will govern a city widely regarded as the state's most ungovernable, a long-dead industrial hub burdened with serious fiscal problems, a soaring crime rate and a seemingly indelible image as the shantytown of Fairfield County. ''The next two years are going to be difficult,'' Mr. Bucci said. The problems facing both cities are those facing many cities in Connecticut and elsewhere: a decline in Federal aid and a shrinking local tax base, rampant poverty, racial divisiveness, AIDS, homelessness and a weakening of public school systems.
Then there are the myriad social ills that stem from those problems: drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy and infant mortality.
 
'On the Edge'
''Our city is on the edge in many ways,'' said Mr. Daniels, who easily defeated white challengers from the Republican and Green parties in a campaign virtually free of racial conflict. ''We can only pull back from the edge if we all pull together.''
Mr. Daniels, a part-time college football referee in addition to his work as a legislator and the owner of a plumbing business, will govern a city with 127,000 people.
His chief goals are to focus on poverty in the city, which ranks as the seventh poorest city in the nation among cities its size. The Mayor-elect also plans to push for more police manpower in poor communities and for more inner-city development projects ''This administration has staked itself on economic development, downtown development,'' said Khalid Lum, Mr. Daniels's press secretary.
Ms. Moran, who defeated a former mayor, Leonard S. Paoletta, by 32 votes in a seven-way primary in September, will head the state's largest city with 140,000 residents.
She should be helped more than previous administrations by amendments to the city charter that were approved by the voters on Tuesday. The amendments will create a Department of Finance and an Office of Policy and Management.
''We're going to market this city and turn it around,'' said Ms. Moran, a Bridgeport native who has held several jobs in residential real estate and labor relations and ran unsuccessfully for city clerk in 1977.
 
'We're Novices'
Ms. Moran's victory turned out to be the shocker of Tuesday's municipal elections in 158 towns and cities. Perhaps the next biggest surprise was her arrival at her victory party in a white Rolls-Royce.
''We're novices, but we didn't make one backroom deal,'' said Ms. Moran. ''When anybody said, 'What are you going to give me? I said, 'A better Bridgeport.' '' Her campaign manager, David DeFelice, said: ''Everything is timing. This was Mary's time to run. She always said she wanted to be the first woman mayor of Bridgeport.''
 
Financial Crisis
Mr. DeFelice credited her victory to widespread dissatisfaction with Mr. Bucci and his handling of the city's long-running financial crisis. He said Ms. Moran's backers were the ''taxpayer constituency.'' He said Mr. Bucci raised taxes by 31 percent over four years and helped create a $60 million deficit that forced the city to ask the state for a bail-out plan.
''He went and put the city in state receivership,'' Mr. DeFelice said.
Mr. Bucci, who during the campaign cast his opponent as being a pro-developer candidate who would allow condominiums to be built throughout the city, credited his loss simply to a desire for change. ''For two years, we were the bearers of bad news, especially on the financial side,'' he said. ''I think the voters wanted a new messenger. They wanted someone fresh, someone new, someone with no experience.''
Ms. Moran, who is 56 years old, had 15,624 votes, or 53 percent, to Mr. Bucci's 12,368 votes, or 42 percent. Four other candidates had petitioned themselves onto the ballot. Combined, they received 5 percent of the votes.
In New Haven, Mr. Daniels, 53, had 68 percent of the vote, as against 29 percent for the Republican candidate, Robie Pooley, an Alderman, and 3 percent for Matthew Borenstein, the Green Party candidate.
In both cities, the voter turnout, which was moderate, was not a significant factor in determining the outcome of the elections. Neither were campaign contributions nor fund raising.
In Bridgeport, Mr. Bucci outspent Ms. Moran by $280,000 to $78,000. In New Haven, Mr. Daniels raised more than $400,000, a record for a mayoral race; Ms. Pooley raised about $20,000.
Mr. Daniels's victory, however, was never in doubt, as Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city by a 10-to-1 margin. The city has not had a Republican mayor since 1953, when William C. Celantano was elected.
 
Other Races
Elsewhere in Connecticut, the Democratic challenger in Danbury, Gene Eriquez, upset the incumbent Republican Mayor, Joseph H. Sauer Jr. Mr. Eriquez had 57 percent of the vote, Mr. Sauer 42 percent.
Mr. Sauer was a political novice who won election two years ago chiefly because of a political scandal that led to the indictment last year of Mayor Thomas E. Dyer, a Democrat. Mr. Dyer's trial starts tomorrow in United States District Court in New Haven.
In Stamford, Mayor Thom Serrani, a Democrat, won a fourth term, easily defeating the Republican in the race, Leonard Vignola Jr., a business consultant, for the second time. Mr. Serrani collected 58 percent of the vote to 42 percent for Mr. Vignola. The margin was greater than expected.
And in Middletown, State Representative Paul Gionfriddo, a Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent, Mayor Sebastian J. Garafalo, by 362 votes out of the 12,564 cast.
In other races around the state, Joseph J. Santopietro, the Republican Mayor of Waterbury, won a third term, defeating his Democratic challenger, Elizabeth C. Brown, a State Representative and a former nun. Mr. Santopietro had 65 percent of the vote to 35 percent for Ms. Brown.
In Hartford, where the power of the mayor's office is diluted by a strong city council-city manager form of government, Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry easily defeated her Republican challenger, Rosemary Z. Cardwell. Ms. Perry had 71 percent of the vote to 29 percent for Ms. Cardwell.
In New Britain, Donald J. DeFronzo, a Democrat, defeated the Republican in the race, Marilyn C. Krazckowsky. Mr. DeFronzo, who defeated the six-term Mayor, William J. McNamara, in the September primary, had 59 percent of the vote, as against 41 percent for Ms. Krazckowsky.
And in an unusual nonmayoral issue that attracted widespread attention, New Haven voters overwhelmingly approved a nonbinding resolution supporting a cut in Federal defense spending to make more money available for social programs. The vote was 7,357 to 1,459.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Women Win Quiet Victories In Equitable Pay

BYLINE: By Charlotte Shapiro; Charlotte Shapiro is associate director of Women on the Job, a nonprofit advocacy group in Port Washington.

 BODY:
PAY equity victories have been and will continue to be won at the negotiating table rather than in the courts.
Recently, a court in California ruled that lower wages paid to women employed by the State of California are not a consequence of sex discrimination but only a condition of the market. Courts rule on the basis of narrowly defined law, but women refuse to be confined by narrow legal standards. On Long Island, women are uniting their energies through political and economic action to challenge historic, market-driven, systemic wage discrimination. These are the women making front page news. 
Equal pay for work of equal value! That is the goal of several well-organized, grassroots coalitions of women. They are office workers, aides, nurses, librarians, women employed in ''pink collar'' occupations. They work for school districts, counties, towns, libraries and universities. Their employers pay them as women - that means 20 to 30 percent less than male co-workers in ''blue collar'' occupations such as maintenance and groundskeeping.
Networks of women in sex-segregated occupations have joined forces with women activists in a coalition of traditional civic, business and professional organizations. Together, these coalitions advocate, negotiate, hold rallies, publicize injustice and gain support from co-workers and the community for wage equity. The victories thus far? In 1985, the Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead was asked to examine equity for women on the town payroll. He soon recognized that fairness required that the town raise the grades and salaries of clerks. Thirty-one employees in four titles were upgraded by three grades to make them comparable to jobs held by men with equivalent responsibilities. This pay equity adjustment was accomplished through a budget resolution, not litigation.
Three years ago, public health nurses employed by Suffolk County won equal pay for work considered comparable to the public health sanitarians. Sanitarians, a male-dominated job classification, ranked two civil service grades higher than nurses. Advocacy by the women's coalitions with county legislators and the County Executive succeeded in closing the wage gap.
Five women employed in a water district in the Town of North Hempstead, last year, also achieved pay equity success. They quietly organized a women's caucus within their union after several meetings with Women on the Job, the founder of the grass-roots coalitions. Armed with information and strategies to advance their cause, they also won access to the job of meter reader (a traditional male occupation) and the inclusion of a comparable worth clause in their contract.
In 1987, Glen Cove School District clericals and aides won $270,000 in retroactive pay increases to bring them up to the wages of maintenance staff after a four-year long pressure campaign of rallies, speaking out at school board meetings, press reports, media appearances and 103 individual complaints filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights. The women also won new respect, professional advancement benefits and recognition for a union that committed itself to negotiating for women's issues as well as labor issues.
School secretaries in Central Islip also filed a sex discrimination complaint with the Division of Human Rights. When the division found probable cause for wage discrimination, the women won a settlement of $2,000 across the board and a 12 percent wage gap increase. As in Glen Cove, their victory depended upon the active support and assistance of the 53 organizations in a coalition called the Women on the Job Task Force.
The ripple effect can be seen in school jurisdictions across Long Island. Since 1985, about 20 school district clerical associations have won compensatory wage increases. Most employers recognize but will not publicize these increases as pay equity actions. However, employers who stonewall the issue are increasingly brought to the New York State Division of Human Rights. Two examples: women employed in the Wantagh and Sachem School Districts.
This year, Adelphi University clerical workers voted to strike when wage gap demands were totally ignored. Their settlement brought recognition of the pay equity issue and a first step toward fair wages. Their success hinges on their ability to organize themselves and take leadership positions within their union.
Most recently, Hofstra University women ended a six-week strike for pay equity. There, a senior executive secretary, after eight years on the job, earned $15,000 a year compared to $20,000 to $23,000 for custodians, guards and tradesmen.
These women are partners in working families where two paychecks are a necessity, or are sole supporters of their families. They can no longer afford to accept a two-tier wage system that assigns them to second-class status and poverty. The experience of the strike, the negative publicity for Hofstra's wage policies for administrative support staff and the women's new-found cohesion spell significant change for the future.
All eyes are now on Nassau County. It is the defendant in the only major lawsuit on sex and race-based wage discrimination remaining. Despite the protracted delays of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees lawsuit filed five years ago, employees anticipate that wage adjustments will soon become a reality.
The county recently responded to long, unrelenting pay equity advocacy from women's groups. It agreed to undertake the first important step in achieving wage equity: a job evaluation and classification study to be completed next February. But, whatever the outcome, the Long Island pay equity bandwagon rolls on.

HEADLINE: School Economies Are Essential

 BODY:
Reading the three letters flailing Mr. Gerber for daring to suggest that economies can be made in school budgets [''Trim the Fat From High Cost of Education,'' Sept. 24] without impacting adversely on the education of children makes me despair of finding a basis for dialogue between the education establishments and the people of their communities. I define the establishment as school board, administration, and PTA.
The letter from the teacher in New York City has no validity for us. We chose to live on Long Island specifically to avoid the conditions she faces every day. And, I might add, compared to her environment, teachers on the Island work in paradise. 
The arguments by the other two writers add nothing to what I am accustomed to hearing from the establishment in Hewlett-Woodmere, which has been, until recently, a sea of affluent tranquillity. I won't go into the details of why the climate changed, but early in the year the first cloud in this blue sky on the South Shore made its appearance when a $28 million bond issue to refurbish our five remaining schools was resoundingly defeated.
The shock waves from that defeat should have taught the establishment that its demands on the pocketbooks of even a comfortable enclave such as ours had exceeded reasonable limits. Should have, but didn't.
In May of this year they proposed a school budget in excess of $36 million, a budget they assured us was ''bare-boned.'' It was defeated. The identical budget was resubmitted in June, with the warning that defeat meant austerity and enumerating the dire consequences therefrom.
An even larger number of my townspeople voted no the second time, and we went on austerity. Miraculously, this bare-boned budget turned out to be not so bare-boned because they managed to cut over $700,000 of fat without doing harm either to themselves or the children. It passed on the third submission in August.
I cannot speak for any district but my own; however, there is a sameness to each. The population is getting older, and the taxes have become a burden to many of our senior citizens, single parent families and working parents. It isn't that we view excellence in education as less desirable, but we have become more aware with the passage of years that school bureaucracies, if not controlled and monitored, will do what all bureaucracies do: grow beyond the point of toleration.
I am well aware of state-mandated costs, of special education classes for the learning disabled, the physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded. I am equally aware that most districts, mine included, pay 100 percent of the cost of medical and dental insurance for our teachers. I am aware that many districts have negotiated contracts with their teachers for the next three years totaling in excess of 25 percent. I am aware that many P.T.A.'s have been successful in lowering the requirements for bus transportation to district schools from the mandated two to three miles to as little as half to three-quarters of a mile.
I remember driving my and other children to school a scant seven years ago and thinking nothing of it. Were they the same age today, they would be bused. I am also aware that increasing class size from 17 to 20 or 22 will not matter one whit so far as education is concerned, but would eliminate some teaching positions. I know, too, that many schools have hired ''consultants,'' many of whom are retired teachers, whose duties and responsibilities are somewhat ambiguous.
The point is that unless we effect economies together, in our respective communities, as surely as night follows day, we will be at each other's throats year after budget year until one day many of our districts will take a giant step backward and find themselves operating under austerity for the foreseeable future. Should that come to pass, we need not look to the stars to fix the blame; the fault, fellow Islanders, will lie at our collective doorsteps.

HEADLINE: For Florio, Fiscal Issues Top Agenda

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
GOVERNOR-ELECT James J. Florio will not have much time to savor his victory on Tuesday. Just ahead is the transition period when he said he hoped to begin his promised audit of state spending.
New Jersey's fiscal health holds the key to the success of the Florio administration, especially in its early months when campaign promises are fresh in voters' minds and expectations are at their highest.
Mr. Florio's victory was so strong, nearly 2 to 1 over Representative Jim Courter, the Republican, that it helped some Democrats who were locked in close Assembly contests to win, and returned control of the Assembly to the Democrats, who had held it for 16 years before Gov. Thomas H. Kean's landslide re-election victory four years ago.
 
Bright Spot for G.O.P.
The one bright spot in Tuesday's balloting for Republicans was the election of Assemblyman Joseph A. Palaia to the State Senate in the 11th District in Monmouth County. The seat had been held by Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, until he was elected to Congress to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Representative James J. Howard. 
John D'Amico, a Democrat, was appointed to fill Mr. Pallone's seat pending Tuesday's special election. The Republican victory reduces the Democratic majority in the Senate to 23 to 17 but does not change control.
On election night, Mr. D'Amico was being mentioned as a possible candidate for appointment as state transportation commissioner.
Democrats now hold the governorship and control both the Senate and Assembly and will be under pressure to solve some lingering problems, notably high automobile insurance costs, in the next two years before the 1991 legislative races, when both houses will be up for election.
 
No Quick Fixes Likely
Promises to deal with insurance costs are usually couched in broad terms - roll back rates, eliminate the state's deficit-ridden Joint Underwriting Association or limit a motorist's right to sue - but the problem is complicated and not susceptible to quick fixes.
And the Republican minorities in both houses are not expected to jump at helping the majority party look good before the next election.
Mr. Florio also faces some problems that did not arise in the campaign, although one could be a blessing in disguise.
''There are a lot of expectations in the inner cities,'' said Richard Roper, director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University. ''Urban redevelopment is on the minds of mayors like Sharpe James of Newark and Randy Primus in Camden, and while it wasn't talked about in the campaign, the mayors expect Florio to focus attention on the problem.
''Growth management is another real challenge facing the state and Florio supported the steps already taken, with modifications, while Governor Kean's support has been timid and he came at it with a suburban prospective.''
''A real challenge is urban education,'' Mr. Roper said. ''Experts say the state and the nation are not doing enough to tap the potential of children in the inner cities, and without some real effort the situation will continue to deteriorate.''
Alan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said he did not expect Mr. Florio's promised audit to yield any major economies.
''Kean has taken everything there is to take, and all Florio may find is a few bucks to make it look like something,'' he said.
Unless the economy turns around dramatically and the state's major taxes begin to produce the kinds of revenue needed to support new initiatives, Mr. Florio may have to seriously consider raising taxes early in his administration, Mr. Rosenthal said.
The state's looming budget problems began coming to light late last year when collections of some major taxes - principally the state sales tax and corporate taxes - failed to keep pace with projections. The gap between expectations and projected collections grew from slightly more than $150 million to more than $250 million on an annual basis.
But with the state originally expecting to end the fiscal year last June 30 with more than $500 million in unexpended funds, the drop posed no immediate problems. It merely reduced the amount of money on hand with which to begin the current fiscal year.
 
Quarterly Monitoring
The trend may really begin to hurt if it continues next spring. Mr. Kean has said that tax collections, which are monitored quarterly, could pick up by then. A couple of weeks before the election, he also announced that the state had found more than $100 million in unexpended funds from the previous budget that could help weather the period of sluggish tax collections.
If the economy continues to soften, it may be next to impossible to get any tax changes through the Legislature two years from now, when all 120 legislative seats will be on the ballot. After that, Mr. Florio will have to guage what effect a tax increase will have on his re-election chances in 1993.
Something that could take the decision out of Mr. Florio's hands is the latest challenge to New Jersey's system of financing public education, which has made its way to the State Supreme Court.
 
Reliance on Property Tax
In 1973, the Democratic-controlled Legislature and Brendan T. Byrne, then the Governor, enacted the state income tax after the court ruled that the state's reliance on local property taxes to finance public education discriminated against poorer urban school districts and was unconstitutional. The court ordered the schools closed, which forced the lawmakers to pass the income tax after several unsuccessful attempts.
The latest challenge, Abbott vs. Burke, makes the same argument. Despite annual increases in state school aid, poor urban districts that lack the tax base on which revenue is derived are still unable to provide the same level of educational opportunity found in more affluent suburban districts, critics assert. An administrative court judge has agreed; the state education commissioner has disagreed, and the matter is before the court.
If the court orders a dramatic increase in state aid to poor districts, it could force a decision on raising taxes that would get Mr. Florio off the hook and provide a reason that few could attack - financing public education.
 
Auto Insurance a Priority
The day after his election victory, Mr. Florio reiterated that solving the auto insurance problem would be an early priority of his administration, and he announced that Douglas Berman, a lawyer who had been his campaign manager, would serve as chairman of his transition team.
Steven P. Perskie, a former State Senator from Atlantic County who stepped down from his seat on the Superior Court to work in Mr. Florio's campaign, will be director of the transition staff.
Other members of Mr. Florio's campaign will now move to the transition effort. They include Brenda Bacon, a campaign adviser who will be Mr. Perskie's deputy director; Karen Kessler, campaign finance director, who will be personnel director, and Angelo Genova, who will serve as legal counsel, as he did for the campaign. Jon Shure, campaign press secretary, will be communications director.
Mr. Florio said he had talked to Mr. Kean, who told him he was impressed by the size of the Democrat's victory. ''And he promised the best, most orderly transition ever undertaken in the state,'' Mr. Florio said.

HEADLINE: WESTCHESTER OPINION;
The Census: How a Head Count Grew and Grew

BYLINE: By Lincoln Diamant; Lincoln Diamant, who lives in Ossining, is the author of ''Chaining the Hudson: The Fight for the River in the American Revolution.''

 BODY:
THE first United States census was taken almost two centuries ago. It was designed as a simple head count to regularize the composition of the House of Representatives, with one seat for every 30,000 citizens. (Excluded were American Indians not paying taxes.) No one dreamed that by 1990 the tabulation would blossom into a vast statistical analysis, both reflecting and regulating much of our economic life.
That first census was ordained by Article I, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, which reads, in part: ''Representatives...shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers...The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of 10 years...'' 
Until the results of that first census were certified, 6 of the 65 seats in the first House were arbitrarily assigned to New York State.
The ''first meeting of the Congress'' that was mentioned in the Constitutional mandate took place in New York City, then the nation's capital, on March, 4, 1789. More or less on schedule, Congress implemented the census procedures two years later.
In less than six months, local governments in 14 states (Vermont had just joined the Union) finished their head count. In New York State, the census takers, led by William S. Smith, completed their job early, on July 26, 1791.
The totals, including the Westchester County figures, were forwarded to Philadelphia, the new capital of the United States, where they were compiled and certified by George Washington's Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson. He transmitted them to Congress on Oct. 24, 1791.
The pen-and-ink tabulations were quickly set into type by Joseph Gales, an enterprising Philadelphia printer, in his little 56-page book, ''Return of the Whole Number of Persons With the Several Districts of the United States, etc.'' It became a best seller. The statistics were even reprinted in England, where the British may have been curious - or skeptical - about this new American procedure of apportioning at least half the Federal legislative seats by a head count.
The totals for Westchester County demonstrate the vast changes that have taken place since those first census takers broke down the country's population into five simple categories:
* Free white males 16 years old and older - militia age (5,939 was the total for the county).
* Free white males younger than 16 (5,330).
* All free white women of any age (10,958)
* ''All other free persons,'' an indiscriminate group that in 1790 numbered less than 2 percent of Westchester's 24,000 inhabitants (357)
* Slaves, who were still 6 percent of the county's total population (1,419). Slavery was not completely abolished in New York State until July 4, 1827.
Today, four of the statistics from the first census are of particular interest:
* In 1790, 7 percent of the state's total population lived in Westchester County; in 1980, it was 5 percent.
* Males and females showed the traditional almost-even division - 51 percent to 49 percent (that holds today).
* More than 47 percent of all the males were boys younger than 16.
* The county held 1,419 African-American slaves. (They were counted in Philadelphia as only 851, under the ''three-fifths'' clause of the Constitution. That clause was a compromise - affecting the representation count - between the Northern and Southern states that endured until the Civil War.
Population density for the county's 438 square miles has risen from about 55 people a square mile in 1790 to about 2,000 today. In the 1980 census, Westchester's total head count was 866,599. That is an increase of 3,500 percent over the 190-year period.
In the first census, almost all the inhabitants of Westchester were farmers; today the Bureau of the Census counts 95 percent of Westchester's citizens as living in ''urbanized areas.'' Median family income in 1980 was $27,278, with 6 percent of the population beneath the poverty level. And Westchester citizens are generally well-educated: 75 percent are high school graduates and 28 percent went to college.
Today's black population is 12 percent of the county's total, and 55 percent of all blacks are female, compared with 53 percent of all whites. The first census also ignored gender differences among all nonwhites.
The five headings of 1790 have evolved into almost 40 different statistical categories, including ancestry, marital history, fertility, language spoken at home, travel time to work, means of transportation, poverty status and characteristics of people 60 years and over.
The preservation of confidentiality is essential to any good census and the Bureau of the Census does not ''disclose information about specific individuals.'' In a few parts of the United States, in fact, it even ''suppresses census data on characteristics based on a small number of persons and/or housing units.'' The census privacy mandated by law is respected.
Within such protective guidelines, the 20th census of the United States - the 1990 Census - will soon be counting heads, to eventually tell the citizens of Westchester County exactly who we are and what we do.

Students Go for Pop Music, Pop Novels, Pop Tarts

 BODY:
What do Madonna, Tom Clancy, the Macintosh computer and Pop Tarts have in common? All are hot items on campuses these days, interviews with 300 students at 20 colleges and universities indicate.
Campus bookstores have been flooded with requests for books based on popular comic strips, including ''The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book,'' by Bill Watterson, Gary Larson's ''Pre-History of the Far Side'' and ''The Night of the Mary Kay Commandos'' by Berke Breathed, creator of ''Bloom County.''
Also selling well are the novels of Mr. Clancy, Stephen King and Tom Wolfe, all of whom have been at the top of bestseller lists with their novels ''Clear and Present Danger,'' ''The Dark Half'' and ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' respectively.
College bookstores are doing a brisk business in word processors and computers, especially those of the Macintosh variety. The Vassar Bookstore has sold 746 Apple Macintoshes since 1983, including 150 this year. I.B.M. personal computers and Smith-Corona word processors are top sellers, as are Zenith laptop computers, which students can fold up and take to the library or away on weekends. 
 
Fast-Selling Boxer Shorts
''Without my computer, I think, I'd be dead,'' said Sarah Doll, a senior at Vassar who is from Shaker Heights, Ohio.
Sweatshirts and pants with the school's logo set the fashion pace, as do boxer shorts (worn by both men and women).
''They're popular because you can walk around school in your underwear, and people won't look at you in a funny way,'' said Richard Crisler, a 1988 Duke University graduate, whose company, Yo Boxers, based in Durham, N.C., has sold 35,000 oxford-cloth boxers on college campuses since May 1988.
Shop managers report that during exam season, students buy snack foods and eccentric knickknacks to break the tension of nonstop studying. ''Survival foods'' like Pop Tarts, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Cup O'Noodles and diet soft drinks lead the shopping list, along with yo-yos, Nerf footballs and ''jaw breaker'' chewing gum. The campus stores at Duke sell 14,000 boxes of Pop Tarts each year to the 5,781 undergraduates, said Thomas Craig, manager of West Campus Stores.
At Georgetown University in Washington, coloring books, Mr. Potato Head toys and chewing gum that turns your teeth black are big sellers, said Sandy Manus, manager of The Corp, a student-run store. ''We sell lots of spontaneous items that people like to buy when they're feeling kind of silly,'' she said.
 
Big Car on Campus
The ''Goosh,'' a little ball composed of cut rubber bands, is a big item at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Jared Kurtzburg, a senior from East Northport, L.I., dubbed the novelty ''the yo-yo of the 90's.''
Clerks at campus stores report that Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated, Time, Cosmopolitan and Glamour are the fastest-selling magazines.
Given the strict parking regulations and limited parking space at many schools, ''the popular car on campus belongs to someone else, so you don't have to worry about parking it or putting gas in it,'' said Jami Rhodes, a junior at Georgetown.
But if most students had their way, they would own Japanese cars like the Honda Prelude, Toyota Cressida, Acura Integra and Nissan Sentra, which they praised for low fuel and maintenance costs.
''They hardly ever need service,'' said Irene Anthony, a senior at California State University at Los Angeles. ''That's a big consideration if you're a college student with very little money.''
Among domestic automobiles, four-wheel-drive vehicles like Jeeps, Chevrolet Blazers and Ford Broncos are the hot wheels on campuses this fall, as are Mustang convertibles.
 
Many Business Majors
The cost of tuition often determines the types of cars gracing the campus parking lots. At Tulane University, where tuition, room and board total $19,200 a year, BMW's and Hondas glisten in the parking lot. At Ohio State, where out-of-state tuition, room and board total $5,628, small, used domestic models proliferate.
''You don't want to have a car that's new because it gets beaten up at school,'' said Andrew Poplos, an Ohio State junior from Westerville, Ohio, whose windshield was smashed recently after a raucous reveler tossed a beer bottle off a balcony. ''You just feel safer driving something you don't have to worry about.''
What's hot and what's not extend to academic concerns as well. Business, for example, seems to be the most frequently chosen concentration.
''It's pure and simple: money and power,'' said Nicholas Soulas, a senior majoring in business at Ohio State. ''Business seems to be the easiest way to make money, lots of money, and that's been the motto of the 80's.''
At the University of California at Berkeley, 2,145 students signed up for Introduction to Economics during the 1988-89 academic year, and some college bookstores are reporting heavy sales of Donald Trump's book ''The Art of the Deal.''
 
Choirs and Instrumental Groups
The classes filled to overflowing this fall range from the offbeat to the practical. At California State at Los Angeles, jazz dance and scuba diving are popular electives, and at Wisconsin, African storytelling draws 600 students each term. One of the more popular offerings at Colorado is a general physics course taught by Prof. John Taylor, who demonstrates basic principles of physics by lying on a bed of nails and walking over hot coals.
But at Cornell, where pre-med is especially popular, 2,000 students enrolled this fall in Introduction to Psychology.
Among extracurricular activities, singing in choirs and playing in instrumental groups are in style on many campuses. At the University of Miami, 15 percent of undergraduates belong to one of the 75 performing jazz and classical ensembles.
''Students like to hear fellow students perform,'' said Constance Lackey, a senior who serves on the Student Programming Council Board. ''Students here love music, and about any kind of performer will get an audience.''
Students' musical tastes are eclectic. While many like the pop sounds of Paula Abdul and Madonna, others prefer the rock of the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead. Albums from newer bands like U2, REM, the B-52's, 10,000 Maniacs and Fine Young Cannibals are especially in demand, store managers said.
Many students, like Peter Barreras, a senior at Wisconsin, prefer rap music. ''It's the cutting edge of music,'' he said. ''A lot of other music genres have stagnated.''
 
Pursuit of Exercise
Jack Campbell, owner of Poindexter Records in Durham, N.C., agrees. ''Nothing is particularly in, and nothing is particularly out,'' he said. ''The late 80's will be remembered as a time when there was no clear musical trend.''
Exercise, like working hard and eating well, is still a priority for students. Activities like aerobics, tennis and bicycling are favored by most students.
Fat-tired mountain bikes have become a staple on many campuses. ''Mountain bikes are the four-wheel-drive vehicles of the cycling world,'' said William Karpovich, a junior at Duke from Baltimore.
Wei-Ling Huber, a junior at Wisconsin from Franklin, Ind., said the $500 she spent on a bike and a lock was more than worth it. ''I figured that two years of bus passes would cost more than my bike did,'' Ms. Huber said. ''Also, it's really cool looking.''
Because most colleges and universities include the use of weight rooms, swimming pools and tennis courts in the cost of tuition, few students subscribe to athletic clubs or buy exercise equipment.
But some students, squeezed for time, cannot even use what the universities offer.
''Exercise?'' asked Andrew O'Brien of Yonkers, a senior at Georgetown. ''Are you kidding? College is no time to be fit.''

HEADLINE: Office Space Surplus Is Seen as Easing

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
DESPITE what many believe is the region's largest surplus of office space in a decade, Henry W. Fries, the new president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said the vacancy rate in the county was no cause for alarm.
''At the beginning of 1988, vacancy rates in the county stood at 22 percent,'' said the trade association's new leader. ''Now it's 16 percent. And by next summer, I predict, it will be even lower as current space is absorbed. Downtown White Plains already has one of the lowest vacancy rates in the nation; somewhere between 8 and 9 percent.''
There has been almost no new office construction in the county in the last year, Mr. Fries pointed out. ''The vacant space is being more easily absorbed because only 550,000 to 750,000 square feet of new space, which is a very small amount, came on stream last year.'' 
Also, he continued, there has been a renewed interest among companies in relocating to Westchester. ''Japanese tenants, in partcular, favor Westchester,'' he said. ''They like the tranquillity of the county, and the fairly easy commuting.''
 
Eyes on Japanese Tenants
Mr. Fries, who is the vice president of the commercial/investment and land division of Houlihan Lawrence in White Plains, said competition for Japanese tenants was so intense that his firm had a realtor representative in Tokyo to scout for prospective customers.
''Japanese clients will pay top dollar for office space and properties,'' he explained. ''For example, when Daiichi Financial Corporation of Tokyo wanted the Lakeover Country Club in Bedford, it paid $24.9 million for it. But real estate in the U.S. is a bargain compared to prices in Japan. We have several Japanese clients who are looking for properties; especially golf clubs.''
Recently, Japanese clients have shown a strong interest in acquiring school properties, Mr. Fries added.
''Ten years ago, when we were begging our customers to buy schools, we couldn't give them away,'' he said. ''Now that we have clients like Okanura Seminars looking for sites for Japanese schools in the Westchester area, old schools are scarce. Many of them have been torn down; others have been converted into residential condominiums.''
 
A Pharmacist in Real Estate
Mr. Fries, a licensed pharmacist, said he first became involved with commercial real estate when he owned a pharmacy in Goldens Bridge.
''At the time I was president of a civic organization, the Goldens Bridge Improvement Committee,'' he said. ''We embarked on what was surely the smallest urban-renewal project in the country, the Goldens Bridge Shopping Center. We had 25 shareholders from the community. Real estate, I found, was very different from standing behind a counter all day dispensing medicines. It was exciting. I was 37 and I decided, what the heck, I would change my career. I sold my pharmacy but I used my background to become a drugstore broker; and it was a fairly unusual specialty, so I managed to carve out a place for myself.''
Mr. Fries then joined Frances Billingsley Realtors of Katonah and opened the firm's first commercial division.
''In 1983 I joined Houlihan, which has now become the largest firm in the county. We have 450 licensed sales agents.''
Real estate and construction make up the largest industry in Westchester, he said. ''The market is extremely competitive. A successful commercial broker has not only to know the product and the market but must also be able to act as the client's consultant, banker, accountant and lawyer when those skills are needed.''
 
Dealing With Clients Assessed
Yet dealing with commercial clients is easier than dealing with home buyers, in Mr. Fries's opinion. ''With commercial clients, it's business as usual in a financial sense. Commercial clients are objective, mainly concerned with theeconomic feasibility of a project. No one rents office space because the bathrooms are yellow. What clients are most interested in is getting the biggest bang for their buck. Because office rents in Westchester average $23 to $25 a square foot, as compared with $40 to $45 for similar space in Manhattan, we have an edge financially.''
According to Mr. Fries, the Westchester County Board of Realtors, with 4,000 members divided equally between residential brokers and commercial brokers, is the third largest board in the state and the 25th largest in the country.
''We have more corporate headquarters here in Westchester than anywhere else in the country,'' Mr. Fries said. ''Our members have been influential in putting together some very big deals. And as corporations enter, residential house sales follow.''
But Mr. Fries acknowledged that should the General Foods headquarters building in White Plains come on the block, ''the deal will be too big to stay in the county, or even in the country.''
''The building is not officially on the market, but the word is they'll be asking $125 million to $175 million,'' he said. ''A property that size will be offered to an international marketing firm. My guess is that it will probably be bought by a foreign or a multinational company that wants to make a statement in the United States - and buys a high-visibility building in order to do it.''
In neighboring Fairfield County, many signature buildings still stand vacant. Loss of corporate tenants through mergers, acquisitions and takeovers has left Fairfield County with the highest office-vacancy rate in the New York, Connecticut and New Jersey area - and one of the highest such rates in the country.
 
A Look at Fairfield
''Fairfield County is somewhat different from Westchester,'' Mr. Fries said. ''As office construction in Westchester slowed, the pace of construction in Fairfield led to an overabundance of space. Even without the loss of corporate tenants, there would have been a surplus.''
Mr. Fries said Westchester was in direct competition with Fairfield, with both counties seeking the same tenants, but added: ''My feeling is that Westchester won't lose out, because we are better situated to labor pools in the metro area. We now have as many people coming to work in the county as we have leaving the county every day.''
According to Martin S. Berger, president of Robert Martin Company in Elmsford, a major developer of office parks, commercial buildings and residential condominiums, the rest of this year and 1990 will be a challenging period for realtors and developers. The period will be marked by ''a sharp reduction in the number of players in the marketplace,'' Mr. Berger said.
''In Westchester it will be a period of absorption, and in time we will see much of the space now vacant in Fairfield County also absorbed,'' Mr. Berger said. ''With fewer construction starts, there'll be less space coming on the market and vacant space in Westchester will get back to the normal ratio.'' Mr. Berger said he believes the corporate migration from Manhattan will be accelerated in 1990 as businesses continue to flee from such urban problems as crime, drug abuse and high taxes.
 
Employee Housing a Big Factor
Office construction in the 1990's, Mr. Berger said, will be characterized by mixed-use development projects that contain offices, residential units and retail shops.
''The lack of affordable housing for employees is still the big one in Westchester,'' he said, discussing problems. ''Judging from the success we've had with our project - the Seasons, a 312-unit condominium recently completed in downtown White Plains - the pent-up demand is still tremendous.''
The one-bedroom apartments in the Seasons, with an on-premise health club, are priced at $150,000. Mr. Berger said 120 of the units had been sold since they were put on the market in June.

HEADLINE: Builders Hit Hard by the Housing Downturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
JACK R. KALMAR of Bridgeport has been in construction for 25 years, but in 1987 he decided to phase out his home-building business.
''I've been in it a long time, and I'd like to think I know when to pull in my horns,'' Mr. Kalmar said. ''A recession is like a hurricane. When it has been a few years since you last had one, you know you're due.''
There is ample evidence that Mr. Kalmar's decision was wise. In the last two years the housing market in Connecticut has declined so precipitously that builders are going bankrupt, tradespeople are lowering their hourly rates, and houses are sitting unsold or changing owners through distress sales. 
And some builders say there may never be a return to the boom years of 1983 to 1988, when housing starts in the state peaked at nearly 30,000 units a year.
 
The Boom Years
''I don't think it'll ever come back to that level,'' said Richard W. Davis, the vice president of the Connecticut Home Builders Association. ''That was too much. I don't think I've ever seen such a period of sustained growth.''
''I think,'' Mr. Davis continued, ''that the labor force and the demographics of Connecticut will support production of 18,000 or 19,000 units a year, and that's the gap we're going to have to try to close, realistically.''
But this year, house builders in Connecticut will not approach 18,000 units.
A recent report by the State Department of Housing on the first nine months of the year showed 9,245 housing starts through the end of September - down 38.4 percent from the same period in 1988, the worst year since the housing recession of 1981 and 1982.
Every county has been affected, from Hartford County, which reported a decline of 16 percent, to New London County, which registered a drop of more than 61 percent.
Housing starts in Fairfield County dropped 47 percent; in Litchfield County, 44 percent; Middlesex County, 55 percent; New Haven County, 34 percent; Tolland County, 59 percent, and Windham County, 40 percent.
''We've seen a lot of layoffs,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that from now until Thanksgiving would be a critical period for the housing industry.
Builders, he said, are being forced to sell new homes at bargain prices or lose them to banks because they are unable to make their construction loan payments.
For example, Mr. Davis said, a builder might have constructed a house early this year at a cost of $150,000, and put it on the market for $180,000. But since then, the builder's interest payments might have added $15,000 to his costs. Therefore, he may feel he has to accept $165,000 now and pass up the opportunity to make a profit, rather than risk being unable to sell the house and make back his original investment. ''The simple explanation is, 'Time is money,' '' Mr. Davis said. Steven E. Martinek of Fairfield Homes, which manufactures building panels that can be put up and assembled into a house, said that a few years ago the factory was running two and a half shifts, with some workers putting in 50- and 60-hour weeks.
Now, there is no overtime; there is only one shift, and a couple of months ago he reduced his work force from 34 people to 24.
''I don't think I've seen things this bad in 15 years,'' Mr. Martinek said. ''We're averaging a couple of houses a week right now, but at full production we could ship five or six.''
Steven O. McGuire worked as a builder before he became a banker two years ago. As a ''work-out specialist'' for NESB Corporation, a bank holding company in south central and eastern Connecticut, Mr. McGuire helps builders who have projects on the verge of bankruptcy to determine the lowest possible selling price that would enable them to make a profit. He said that most builders he deals with have cut prices 20 to 30 percent.
''That in effect wipes out all their equity,'' Mr. McGuire said. ''But that's the discount that's necessary.'' The reduced profits have worked their way along the line, he said, so that carpenters who made $18 an hour two years ago now scramble for jobs at $8.50. He said he knew of three builders who went bankrupt in the last week of October alone.
Frank M. Rizzitelli, an owner of Rizzitelli Construction Company in Bridgeport, said that the unscrupulous builder could take advantage of laborers right now.
''I've had guys who've said they'd give me a week's work for nothing if I'd just hire them after that,'' Mr. Rizzitelli said. ''I wouldn't do that to anyone, but that's how desperate these guys have become.''
Mr. Rizzitelli said that he was building and renovating some commercial properties, but that he would not build any houses this year. Last year he built 30 units.
Builders who have stayed in housing have adopted different strategies. Mr. Kalmar, for example, now only frames houses as a subcontractor. Since that work is completed very early in a construction project, he usually gets paid.
''If a builder is going to run out of money, it's usually after the framer is paid,'' Mr. Kalmar said.
Mr. Rizzitelli said most builders have stopped putting up speculation houses, those built not for a specific buyer, but to sell on the open market.
''There are still some companies building for the people in the higher- income brackets,'' he said. ''But to build a house in the hopes someone will buy it, I think those days are gone.''
Mr. McGuire said that most of the builders he deals with give up and let the banks foreclose on homes and projects that have not sold in many months.
''By the time I get them, they've pretty much concluded that they're going to have to walk away from it,'' he said. Since banks typically finance 80 percent of a project's worth, if that worth drops 20 percent there is nothing left for the builder and no incentive for him to struggle to keep the property.
 
Home Equity Loans Cited
Mr. Davis said that the home-equity loan is one factor likely to delay the recovery of the market in new housing. When housing prices were escalating dramatically, banks encouraged peopleto borrow on their equity, which had in the past provided the money that people used to trade up to newer, more expensive houses. But instead of trading up, they are renovating their older residences.
Another factor impeding the recovery is an oversupply of expensive condominium units. So serious is the problem that some builders have begun auctioning condominium units, which was unheard of in Connecticut real estate until a few years ago.
''We went through a time when even if you didn't know anything about building, if you had some money you could buy some property, put up a house and make some money,'' Mr. Rizzitelli said. ''Now, you've got to really know the business if you're going to stay in business.''
Although Mr. Davis and other builders not believe the market will rebound to its highs of 1986 and 1987, Mr. Davis said he is not disappointed.
''Having to produce the number of houses that we did in the time that we had was stretching,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone was comfortable with that pace.''

HEADLINE: VOICES OF THE NEW GENERATION;
Wrong on the Wall, and Most Else

BYLINE: By Eric Alterman; Eric Alterman, a senior fellow of the World Policy Institute, is writing a book about Washington pundits.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Soviet Union embarks on a second revolution and reaches out for peace with the West; East Europeans demand freedom and democracy; East Germans tear down the Berlin Wall and flee their country. These and other amazing changes erupt in world politics, and not one of America's foreign policy gurus comes within a country mile of predicting them. In fact, most foreign policy elites have spent the last few years explaining them away and counseling the West to do nothing. It has been a long and rocky road for America's foreign policy elite since Mr. Gorbachev came to power in March 1985. Not since Copernicus, perhaps, have so many been so wrong so frequently with so little humility.
At first, our experts were telling us that Mr. Gorbachev would be no improvement on his predecessors. ''He has no new ideas,'' assured Carnegie Endowment Sovietologist Dimitri Simes when Mr. Gorbachev was named General Secretary. ''In many respects, more dangerous,'' warned Zbigniew Brzezinski. It will be ''two to four years'' before he can consolidate his power, noted Henry Kissinger. The message: Watch and wait. 
When Mr. Gorbachev began to unveil his program of radical reform, the music began to perk up a bit, but the song remained the same. Mr. Gorbachev then became a clever, almost Mephistophelean manipulator. While blinding us with perestroika, insisted Mr. Brzezinski, the Soviets were actually pursuing peredyshka - a breathing spell. Richard Nixon rehabilitated himself in the establishment's eyes with the view that ''under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's foreign policy . . . has been more aggressive, not less.''
In Eastern Europe, we were told to expect more of the same. The respected Sovietologist Seweryn Bialer of Columbia University wrote in 1986 that the ''main thrust of Gorbachev's Eastern European policy is to strengthen the Soviet hold on its empire and to control the satellite parties more tightly.'' As late as February 1988, Mr. Bialer was still insisting that ''the Soviet leadership . . . has no intention of transforming the major national institutions.''
Once the Mr. Gorbachev's seriousness became undeniable, this chorus of disapproval grew cacaphonous. ''Gorby'' may be worthy of our sympathy, but he was likely to be overthrown by hardliners. The Harvard Sovietologist and frequently televised expert Marshall Goldman was remarkably consistent in predicting Mr. Gorbachev's imminent demise.
When maverick Moscow chieftain Boris Yeltsin was exiled to early (and short-lived) retirement in November 1987, Mr. Goldman told readers of this page that ''the question now is whether Mr. Gorbachev himself can avoid a similar fate.'' Less than a year later, when Mr. Yeltsin's arch-enemy, Yigor Ligachev, met a similar fate, Mr. Goldman returned to the Op-Ed page with exactly the same prognosis: Mr. Gorbachev acted in the face of ''an attempted coup,'' he explained, and might not last more than another six months.
As Poland sped toward democracy earlier this year, the same hypercaution reared its head. In February 1989, Mr. Brzezinski said that further events in Poland could spark a Soviet military takeover in Moscow. In fact, when the crunch finally came between Solidarity and the Communists over the composition of the new government, Mr. Gorbachev - still in power - sided with the union.
Recently, Mr. Gorbachev declared that the Soviet Union has ''no moral or political right'' to interfere in Eastern Europe. Two days earlier, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze admitted that the invasion of Afghanistan and the controversial radar station at Krasnoyarsk constituted ''a serious violation'' of ''proper behavior'' and international law. As voluntary superpower confessions go, these remarks comprise a seismic event of the order of the California earthquake. What sayeth of the U.S. foreign policy establishment?
''This isn't an opportunity for us,'' Richard Perle said on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour. ''Not every Soviet proposal needs to be answered,'' echoed expert Stephan Sestanovich on the same program. Again, just watch and wait.
To be sure, there have been exceptions. The initial response of the Bush Administration was justly criticized as timid by many establishmentarians and a few have gone so far as to declare the cold war over. Secretary of State James Baker stepped up his praise of Soviet reforms and the upcoming summit meeting could lead to a belated awakening.
But as of yet no American of political consequence has suggested that the U.S. match the Soviet Union's military cutbacks with unilateral reductions. Nor have any of the establishment's members taken up Soviet offers of cooperation in environmental cleanup, international peace keeping or third world debt. The reappearance of the ''German problem'' has taken our experts almost completely by surprise. America watches from the sidelines as the postwar European order is reshaped and redefined.
Obstacles to change within the foreign policy establishment are several. First, some of its most prominent members, most notably Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, seem sincerely to prefer the ''remarkably stable and predictable'' atmosphere of the cold war to the uncertainty of a thaw. (When Mr. Gorbachev proposed visionary arms cuts at the United Nations last December, Mr. Eagleburger complained about the timing of the speech.) Another problem arises with the inability of establishment luminaries to examine the assumptions that have shaped their thinking for 40 years. This isn't surprising given the limited contacts they have with the grassroots movements that are inspiring change in the East. As Henry Kissinger admitted at the time of Mr. Gorbachev's ascension, ''nobody'' in U.S. foreign policy circles ''really knows what the younger generation thinks in the Soviet Union. We don't have any contact with them.''
Meanwhile, those who have developed these contacts are almost universally scorned or ignored by the powers that be. Jerry Hough of Duke University predicted the Soviet reform movement in the 1970's. The British writer Timothy Garton Ash has documented grassroots politics in Eastern Europe for The New York Review of Books since 1984. Groups like the Campaign for Peace and Democracy/East and West in New York have worked with activists in five Eastern bloc countries for nearly a decade. Even before Mr. Gorbachev, they reported that pressure for democratic change was building from below.
Throughout Europe, governments, businesses and citizens' groups are forging a new order. Yet, virtually alone within the spendid isolation of the Metroliner corridor, the U.S. foreign policy elite is mired in its stagnant, Brezhnevite mindset.
The current establishment line on Mr. Gorbachev is that while he will survive Kremlin challenges, national animosities and economic inefficiencies will probably do him in. The prescription: Our sincere best wishes, but of course, we must be prudent and cautious. No change in policy.
The establishment has been singing this do-nothing tune for nearly five years now. The question Americans should ask as they watch the walls of arrogance reduced to dust in Eastern Europe: How long can we afford to keep listening?

HEADLINE: CHARITY THAT STRANGLES THE POOR

BYLINE: By THURSTON CLARKE; Thurston Clarke is the author of ''Last Caravan,'' about famine in Africa, and ''Equator.''

 BODY:

LORDS OF POVERTY
The Power, Prestige, and Corruption of the International Aid Business.
By Graham Hancock.
234 pp. New York:
The Atlantic Monthly Press. $17.95.
Here is how Graham Hancock describes the villains of ''Lords of Poverty.'' They belong to a ''notorious club of parasites and hangers-on'' that has set ''record-breaking standards . . . in self-serving behaviour, arrogance, paternalism, moral cowardice and mendacity.'' They are ''unsavoury, greedy, stupid and dangerous,'' not to mention ''maladjusted, inadequate [and] incompetent.'' They work for organizations whose ''ethics are really very little different from those of a drug pusher,'' organizations that have ''condoned - and in some cases facilitated - the most consistent and grievous abuses of human rights that have occurred anywhere in the world since the dark ages.'' 
Mr. Hancock is not talking about Nazi war criminals, toxic waste dumpers or crooked investment bankers. He is talking about everyone, from top officials to field workers, employed by the multinational relief and development agencies - such as the World Bank, UNICEF, UNESCO, the United Nations Development Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization (F.A.O.) of the United Nations, the European Development Fund of the European Economic Community - and by the bilateral agencies of the United States (A.I.D.), Britain, Japan and just about any rich country you care to name. In other words, he is talking about some of our century's most sacred cows, about organizations associated with words such as ''sacrifice,'' ''humanitarian'' and ''generosity'' (although Mr. Hancock would say this is because these are precisely the words their public relations departments use in their self-congratulatory campaigns).
Can these accusations be true? Does Mr. Hancock really mean that the Halloween pennies school children collect for UNICEF, and those sacks of emergency American grain that spill from the bellies of Air Force transports onto the tarmac of third world countries like litters of kittens, that the mighty World Bank dams, the countless A.I.D.-financed village water pumps and, in fact, just about all foreign aid is evil, and should immediately be stopped? Yes, he means exactly that. ''Aid is not bad, however, because it is sometimes misused, corrupt, or crass,'' he says; ''rather, it is inherently bad, bad to the bone, and utterly beyond reform. As a welfare dole to buy the repulsive loyalty of whining, idle and malevolent governments, or as a hidden, inefficient and inadequately regulated subsidy for Western business, it is possibly the most formidable obstacle to the productive endeavours of the poor.''
Mr. Hancock believes foreign aid is ''nothing more than a transaction between bureaucrats and autocrats,'' enriching only the international civil servants who administer it and the ruling classes of the third world countries - ''gangsters and psychotics'' - who steal or misuse it. The ''over-compensated'' civil servants, he insists, enjoy a higher standard of living than they could aspire to in their own countries, and in third world nations they fill jobs that would otherwise go to locals, while back at headquarters they hardly work at all. Their achievements and performance are never subjected to the rigorous evaluation that is normal in private business, or even in other government agencies, and because their profession is ''humanitarian,'' they are never required to demonstrate their worth in quantitative ways - despite the fact that A.I.D., the United Nations agencies and others disperse funds that have been forcibly extracted by taxation instead of donation.
He reinforces these charges with the kind of United Nations horror stories that have become familiar reading. We learn that personnel and associated costs absorb 80 percent of the organization's total expenditures, that some time ago the president and executive board of UNESCO received reimbursements of $1,759,548 for one year's travel and lodging costs, that there are 750 bureaucrats on the staff of the F.A.O. in Rome whose pensionable remuneration ranges from $70,000 to $100,000 a year.
While Mr. Hancock provides considerable evidence that aid has enriched the bureaucrats who administer it and the companies who supply shoddy goods at inflated prices, along with prosperous third world traders and urban intermediaries, there is no evidence, he says, that the poor of the third world have benefited at all. For foreign aid's successes are lucky accidents, whereas its most grandiose projects either ''wreck the lives of the poor'' or leave them untouched. In this regard, he is right to point out that any foreign assistance - including emergency food aid - given to murderous, corrupt regimes can only have the unintended consequence of strengthening the regimes, enriching their ruling classes and increasing the suffering of their populations, in part by blunting the righteous anger that might otherwise overthrow such governments.
To support his assertions Mr. Hancock has assembled a compendium of foreign aid fiascos that he claims are the rule, not the exception. There are small-scale bunglings: food donated to Africa by the European Economic Community during 1988 that was found to be contaminated by radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster; laxatives, anti-indigestion remedies, frostbite medicine, low-calorie soup, chocolate-flavored dietary drinks, and food so old that San Francisco zoo keepers had stopped feeding it to animals, all sent to alleviate starvation in tropical countries.
And there are large-scale disasters: the A.I.D. fish-farming project in Mali that produced fish at an actual cost of almost $2,000 a pound; the donor-financed dam in Guatemala that has led to a 70 percent rise in residential electricity prices; the Sudanese sugar refinery turning out sugar that is sold in Sudan at a significantly higher price than imported sugar; and the World Bank resettlement schemes in Brazil and Indonesia that have destroyed rain forests, obliterated tribal peoples and sometimes left migrants poorer than when they left home.
I cannot agree with Mr. Hancock's extreme condemnation of the development industry. I have seen A.I.D. projects in Africa that were clearly successful and beneficial to the local people, and I have met too many people in the industry who were not monsters of greed and careerism. Nonetheless, much of my experience in Africa and Asia confirms the essential truth of his charges. Mr. Hancock has chosen to levy these accusations in a prose style so shrill and venomous that if books had hands, this one would be reaching out to strangle the United Nations officials who will no doubt be reading it at their desks in brown paper wrappers. This style sometimes distracts from his arguments, but it does not disprove them. Beneath the jumped-up language is a deadly serious book about a desperately important subject, a book that, despite its exaggerations, succeeds in standing the myth of foreign aid on its head, and demands a serious reply from the development industry.

HEADLINE: A HOT STREAK FOR DEMOCRACY

BYLINE: By ROBERT N. BELLAH; Robert N. Bellah is the co-author, with Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, Ann Swidler and Steven Tipton, of ''Habits of the Heart.''

 BODY:

DEMOCRACY AND ITS CRITICS
By Robert A. Dahl.
397 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press.
$29.95.
Robert A. Dahl's ''Democracy and Its Critics'' could not have come at a more opportune moment. Events in Moscow and Warsaw, as well as in Beijing, have kept the word ''democracy'' on our front pages for many months. In the flurry of discussion, reporters have frequently asked how well the Russians or the Poles or the Chinese really understand democracy. Most of these journalists - like most of the rest of us - have complacently assumed that the question does not apply to Americans: who, if not we, understands government by the people? Yet when the idea of a McDonald's in Red Square is taken as a token of the triumph of democracy in the Soviet Union, one might well ask if we are entirely clear on the concept.
What Mr. Dahl, Sterling Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Yale University, has done, in a magisterial work that sums up and goes beyond his many decades of distinguished publications, is clearly and reasonably to describe what democracy means, both historically and at present; why our own democracy is still deeply flawed; and how we could reform it so that it would accord more closely with its claims. ''Democracy and Its Critics'' is a work of extraordinary intelligence and, what is even rarer, a work of extraordinary wisdom. 
Mr. Dahl writes clearly and effectively, keeping technical jargon to a minimum, so that he is accessible to the educated lay reader. But this is not an easy book. He does not flinch from giving detailed philosophical arguments for democracy, for the chief alternatives to democracy - namely, anarchism and guardianship - and for the defense of democracy against these rivals. He gives careful consideration to such issues as who is to be included in a democratic association; the virtues and difficulties of majority rule; and whether minority domination is inevitable even in a democracy. On all these questions, the discussion is fresh and illuminating, the treatment of alternative views careful and respectful, the difficulties in his own views spelled out in detail. An attentive reader of this book will receive a real education in the meaning of democracy.
Still, the power of the book comes not only from Mr. Dahl's careful regard for the arguments but from the historical framework in which he places the development of the democratic process. He describes two great historical transformations: the birth of democratic city-states in ancient Greece and Rome, and the emergence in the 18th century of large-scale representative democracies, which became more numerous and successively more inclusive in the 19th and 20th centuries (even though they still remain a minority among existing nations).
Finally, he asks - and this, I think, is his most important contribution - whether we may not be on the threshold of a third democratic transformation, involving a significant increase in citizen participation in our economic and political life. His raising this prospect is particularly refreshing at a time when others can only lament the decline of voter participation and the cynical manipulation of our political campaigns. It is clear that Mr. Dahl thinks a third transformation, though not historically inevitable, is necessary if we are to continue the moral progress of our recent past, which has included the involvement of women and minorities in the political process. It is the book's aim to help us envision the possibility of this change.
The third transformation does not mean, on the analogy of the second, the rise of large-scale representative democratic entities at the supranational level. With the exception of the Western European community, Mr. Dahl does not foresee such entities emerging in the immediate future. International relations, he believes, can be rendered democratic to only a limited extent, and chiefly through the influence that democratic forces within nation-states can bring to bear on transnational institutions. Here he may underestimate the strength of international public opinion, influenced by transnational voluntary associations such as Amnesty International, but he is surely right to be modest in his expectations about global democracy at this point.
He argues, however, that even nations whose independence of action is quite circumscribed can have vigorous democratic institutions domestically. Some of the smaller European states, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, are examples. Furthermore, in his view, democratization is a process that can and ought to go on at many levels below that of the nation-state, in the regions and localities of countries.
Still, the chief challenges to the possibility of the third transformation come at the national level and have to do with remaining political inequalities that limit the degree of democracy. He sees three major forms of inequality at the present time: ''differences in resources and opportunities for employing violent coercion; in economic positions, resources, and opportunities; and in knowledge, information, and cognitive skills.''
In his discussion of violent coercion, Mr. Dahl shows how the development of military technology requiring the participation of large numbers of ordinary people has helped the growth of democracy. In ancient Greece, armed infantry replaced the chariot warfare of the nobility, and in early modern Europe, the use of large numbers of musket- and later rifle-bearing infantry broadened the ranks of the citizen-soldier. Conversely, he demonstrates how the monopolization of the means of violence by small elites has operated to inhibit democracy. He recognizes that the technology of modern warfare has moved in a direction that has historically been associated with antidemocratic tendencies, but he holds that political control of the military in modern democracies mitigates the dangers.
One might argue that the emergence of nuclear arms and the proliferation of high-technology weapons since World War II have created, certainly in the United States, a powerful sector of society largely invulnerable to democratic control. In this view, national defense in the nuclear age has become such a trump that it gives the President extraordinary powers not envisaged in the Constitution and virtually voids legislative control over the decision to go to war. If this argument has merit, a significant shift toward international disarmament may be a prerequisite for the third transformation. Unfortunately, Mr. Dahl does not give this perspective sufficient attention.
With respect to economic inequalities, Mr. Dahl has argued before, and incisively again here, that there is a great anomaly in our business sector: institutions like corporations, where most of us spend a significant portion of our lives, are governed by forms of guardianship shading toward despotism, yet the society as a whole is supposed to be democratic. He takes it as axiomatic that: ''In an advanced democratic country the economic order would be understood as instrumental not merely to the production and distribution of goods and services but to a much larger range of values, including democratic values. The economic order would be seen as intended to serve not merely consumers but human beings in all the activities to which an economic order may contribute.''
Since economic resources are so decisively related to the acquisition and utilization of political power, only the institutionalization of effective economic democracy will move us forward in this respect. For example, Mr. Dahl would encourage not only the participation of workers in decisions involving the production process, which is already occurring in a number of American companies, but also worker representation on corporate boards of directors. el3> Finally, Mr. Dahl argues that the third democratic transformation requires us to reduce existing inequalities with respect to knowledge, information and cognitive skills. The danger here comes from monopolization, not by business managers, but by intellectuals, particularly policy makers. Mr. Dahl does not believe, as some have argued, that intellectuals form a ''new class,'' with a common ideology and common interests. He argues that the profound cleavages and disagreements among them help to lessen any such danger. But he does believe that only an educated general public and a series of ''attentive publics'' concerned with particular policy spheres can genuinely democratize the operation of the modern bureaucratic state, preventing rule by experts with no claim to superior moral insight - indeed, whose insight may even be impaired by their excessive specialization.
In short, beneath all the moderation and devotion to intellectual clarity that are so evident in this book, there is the moving presence of a profound passion for democracy. For Mr. Dahl, this remains the essential vision ''in the search for a society in which people may live together in peace, respect each other's intrinsic equality, and jointly seek the best possible life.''

HEADLINE: Governing Long Island: A Jurisdictional Jumble

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Nov. 12

 BODY:
On Old Country Road, a busy four-lane thoroughfare in Nassau County, the speed limit westbound is 30 miles an hour, but the speed limit eastbound is 40. The reason says a lot about why many Long Islanders are challenging the way their local government operates.
Down the center of Old Country Road runs the boundary between Mineola and Garden City, and each village sets the speed limit on its side of the street.
''Sure, it's ridiculous, but no one wants to give up any of their domain,'' said Lieut. Edward Drummond, commander for traffic safety of the Nassau County police, who enforce both limits. 
In the fragmented world of local government on Long Island, two counties and nearly 800 towns, villages, school districts and special taxing entities vie in a jurisdictional jumble that often results in duplicated services and exasperating inefficiencies.
Stirrings to reorganize local governments are being felt throughout the New York metropolitan region. In Connecticut, where county governments were abolished nearly 30 years ago, growing unease over regional problems like traffic, solid-waste disposal and housing has spurred talk of creating an intermediate level of government to coordinate efforts between the state and its 169 municipalities.
Just seven states - California, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas - have a greater number of local governments than New York, according to the Census Bureau, and even fewer share New York's overlapping structure of villages existing within towns within counties. #95 Villages, 127 School Districts ''It's all very confusing to voters and even to the people in government,'' the chairman of the Westchester County Planning Board, William N. Cassella, said. ''When the system does not perform well, it's difficult for citizens to hold someone accountable.''
Nowhere is the confusion and frustration more acute than on Long Island, one of the most heavily governed suburban regions in the country, with 2 counties, 2 cities, 13 towns, 95 villages, 127 school districts and more than 500 special districts, most of which have taxing powers, for services from garbage collection to hydrant rentals.
For years, a robust economy on the island of about 2.8 million people supported the proliferating governments. In the spirit of home rule, villages and towns freely expanded services like youth programs and nutrition classes for the elderly that paralleled existing county programs. But with the economy slowing, residents are questioning the consequences of too much government.
Property taxes have soared, inciting a tax revolt that helped defeat two Suffolk County legislators in primary races and one more in Tuesday's general election.
 
Mix-ups and Turf Battles
''My property taxes have gone to $5,000 a year from $2,800 four years ago, but I don't see any difference in my services,'' said Paul Cerniglia, a fish and wildlife inspector in Lindenhurst, a Suffolk County village of 27,000 people.
Mr. Cerniglia has only to look down his driveway to Strong Avenue, a well-trafficked two-lane road, to see Long Island governments in action. Within five blocks, four highway departments - the state, the county, Babylon Township and Lindenhurst - sweep and plow the roads.
''Most people have no idea who does what,'' said Mary Anne Weber, a spokeswoman for Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, Democrat of Suffolk, whose Congressional office handles 2,000 complaints a year, mostly from constituents frustrated in finding help for local problems like garbage pickups and broken water mains.
With so many crossing jurisdictions, mix-ups are common and turf battles are frequent. The 605-acre campus of the State University at Old Westbury is carved into five police and fire districts. It is not unusual, university officials said, to have two or three departments respond to an accident; in rare cases, if one department thinks another is answering the call, no one responds. #4 Shot, 4 Police Forces After a sniper shot four people in the Riverhead area last December, officials from four police forces with jurisdiction - Southampton Town, East Hampton Town, Suffolk County and the state - issued conflicting information about the incidents and privately criticized one another for hindering the investigation.
The struggle between local control and broader regional agencies extends from environmental protection to education to the economy.
Suffolk has one water authority that serves 75 percent of the county's 1.4 million residents. Nassau has 41 suppliers, each with staff and consultants. ''By dividing everything up, there's no one with overall responsibility for the resource,'' said Sarah Meyland, a former director of the State Legislative Commission on Water Resource Needs of Long Island.
Two years ago, the State Environmental Conservation Department imposed pumping limits on Nassau suppliers to prevent the water table from sinking dangerously low. If Nassau had one large water authority to address such concerns, ''it may not have been necessary to impose the caps,'' said the the regional director of the department, Harold Berger.
 
'They're Overgoverned'
There are 56 school districts in Nassau and 71 in Suffolk, and studies have found that consolidation would cut costs, increase efficiency and broaden offerings.
Local interests and state financial-aid formulas that discourage mergers often combine to create maddening situations.
In Suffolk, the Mount Sinai District is building a $24 million high school to accommodate its growing enrollment. A neighboring district, Comsewogue, closed two elementary schools recently and faces steadily declining enrollment.
''Talk to anyone in business, anyone building or expanding, and there's no question they're overgoverned,'' said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, the largest business organization in the region. ''The simplest permit subjects you to a miasma of processes and procedures.''
 
Affordability and Taxes
Nancy Booker operates a small youth agency in Bay Shore that provides tutors, counseling and recreational services to 475 children and families in the Bay Shore School District. Each month, she compiles three service reports to the governments that finance the agency, the Town of Islip, Suffolk County and New York State.
''I end up explaining myself over and over,'' said Ms. Booker.
Per capita spending by local governments in Nassau and Suffolk is $2,645, according to the Census Bureau, compared with $1,536 in Fairfield County, Conn., and $1,525 in Bergen County, N.J. Most Long Islanders pay more than 7 percent of their household incomes to property taxes, nearly double the amount that residents in suburbs of Boston, Washington, Los Angeles and Dallas pay, according to a survey by Newsday, the Long Island newspaper.
''People here moved away from the city to foster a certain way of life,'' Steven Levy, a Suffolk County Legislator from Holbrook, said. ''All that is irrelevant if you can't afford to live here in the first place.''
 
'I'm Bitter We Had to Leave'
That is what happened to Vincent J. Ruisi, a retired clothing designer who left Westbury for Citrus County, Fla., 18 months ago.
''We couldn't afford the taxes anymore,'' said Mr. Ruisi, 77 years old, who now pays $175 a year in property taxes, compared with $3,200 a year on Long Island. ''I'm bitter we had to leave. We wanted to stay.''
Taxpayer groups are demanding that governments cut costs and maintain services. Many political leaders and scholars said that they doubted the entrenched bureaucracies would budge.
''Local governments jealously guard their jurisdictional powers,'' said Philip Y. Nicholson, a history professor at Nassau Community College who has studied suburban problems. ''They like to make contracts. They like to make jobs, and they like to hold the purse strings.''
Yet there are glimmers of hope. Six schools in eastern Suffolk, ranging in enrollments from 16 to 1,225, are discussing a merger. The Town of Babylon recently agreed to sweep 31.5 miles of Suffolk roads within its borders, saving the county $160,000 over five years. This year the Town of Huntington eliminated its Office of Consumer Protection because it duplicated efforts of a county agency.
''The solutions won't be massive or generic,'' Mr. Larocca said. ''They will be a series of base hits rather than a major home run.''

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST: CITY WITH A PAST;
The Old Berlin: A Culture of Spies and Symphonies

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN, Nov. 12

 BODY:
There were moments this weekend that recalled the years before the wall when there was a lively mingling between the people of the two sides of this divided city, and even a breath of the era when Berlin was the imperial German capital.
As in the days of the Kaisers, hundreds of thousands of Berliners promenaded on a warm Sunday afternoon, sightseeing on the showy streets like the Kurfurstendamm in the West and Leipziger Strasse in the East.
Except this time the people themselves were the riveting sight - one people who had been torn asunder, together again in one city.
''I had to be here,'' said Jurgen Busing, a 40-year-old environmental scientist who flew in from Brussels for the weekend. ''It cost me 1,000 marks, but it is worth it. Everything happens only once.'' 
For an American journalist who worked in Berlin before and during the building of the wall in 1961, the contrasts and parallels are compelling.
 
Spies and Counterspies
In the years before the wall, Berlin pulsed with excitement and danger. Many countries maintained huge intelligence operations. Agents were kidnapped right and left. Before he died last year, John Peet, an English journalist who had sought asylum in the East, recalled being approached by a Soviet intelligence officer in the 1950's and asked to pose as a British officer in one such snatch operation in West Berlin. He refused.
Hermann Kant, an East Berlin novelist, remembers being approached for an espionage mission by a Soviet intelligence officer and a Polish intelligence officer on successive weekends. They left him alone after all three met by coincidence in a restaurant.
In the early 1960's, the C.I.A. station had more than 130 officers working in Berlin, and at one point it was conducting 40 separate covert operations against the East. In those days, North Koreans from Pyongyang and South Koreans from Seoul journeyed halfway around the world to meet in Berlin - the only place where that was possible then. So did North and South Vietnamese. The wall put an end to much of that.
 
A People Used to Sadness
Today, all the panoply of postwar division seemed to recede - the uniformed troops of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, with their air corridors, their bases and their special rights as occupying powers - leaving just the Berliners.
Still, the shock of the sudden change leaves many, especially in East Berlin, wondering how quickly this moment might pass.
A physician in his 60's grimly recalled the euphoria of June 17, 1953, when workers led a revolt in East Berlin that ended under the treads of Soviet tanks, of hopes engendered by John F. Kennedy's visit to West Berlin in 1963, of the slight easing of conditions that followed West Germany's recognition of East Germany in 1971.
''I'm waiting for the hammer,'' he said, using the German slang for a crackdown.
 
Then and Now, Money Talks
It is startling to discover that the total number of Berliners today is again what it was at the beginning of World War II - four million, of which 2.2 million are in the West and 1.8 million in the East -a result of new jobs and new housing on both sides. At one time, several decades ago, the total population had hovered around three million.
In the days before the building of the wall, 60,000 West Berliners worked in the East and 10,000 East Berliners worked in the West. They were paid half in East German marks, a weak currency, and half in the strong Western marks.
For those in the East, an advantage lay in low-priced consumer goods that were heavily subsidized then as now by the Communist Government. That led to large-scale smuggling and black marketeering, a vestige of which continues.
When the wall went up, in 1961, Walter Ulbricht, then the East German Communist Party leader, said the open border had cost his country 100 billion marks and that he wanted it back. Some East German economists have since estimated the loss at double that.
 
The Human Traffic Stops
As long as the 28-mile border was open, Berliners went back and forth freely by car, subway and elevated train.
In the 1950's, for example, one could drive through the Brandenburg Gate that is the city's best-known architectural landmark, and undergo only a cursory document check by an East German policeman.
From 1959 on, these checks became more frequent and more thorough. East German physicians could pass through easily, but old women who came west to buy bird feed for their canaries were stopped, and sometimes their purchases were confiscated.
In 1961, the wall went up. Overnight, there were only five crossings, and from the East, almost no Berliner was allowed through.
 
Death's Several Faces
The hardening of the division separated the citizens in a most painful way: even telephone calls across the wall became fewer and farther between - and this in a city where every third West Berliner has relatives in the East.
Then came the deaths at the wall - of old people in Bernauer Strasse who tried to jump from their apartments on the border into the West and missed the outstretched safety nets, and of the young who were killed by border guards as they tried to cross, and even of some border guards themselves shot to death by snipers from the West.
Berlin - which had thrilled to the first zeppelin flights and, in the late 1920's, to the first German rocket experiments by Fritz Sanger and the young Wernher von Braun; Berlin, whose composers like Paul Hindemith, filmmakers like Fritz Lang, scientists like Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn and Albert Einstein, and theater directors like Max Reinhardt and Ernst Piscator, had made it one of the world's great cultural magnets - this city fell in its separate pieces into the shadows.
Certainly there was a fine philharmonic orchestra in the West and a fine comic opera in the East, among other cultural showpieces.
Certainly the ruins of World War II, which left mile upon mile of bombed buildings gaping like blackened rotted teeth, had been largely removed - replaced by many striking new structures and some lovingly rebuilt monuments. But something was missing - the spirit of the old city, on both sides.
 
'The Islander'
Gunter Neumann, the late songwriter, caught something of it in his verse about the typical Berliner called ''The Islander.''
 
Der Insulaner verliert die Ruhe nicht
Der Insulaner liebt keen Jetue nicht. . .
Der Insulaner hofft unbeirrt
Dass seine Insel wieder schones Festland wird.
 
(The Islander doesn't get upset
The Islander doesn't like a fuss. . .
The Islander keeps up his hopes
That his island will again become part of the mainland.)
Hanns Peter Herz, who worked with Mr. Neumann at the American-operated radio station RIAS here, recited that verse today and remarked: ''I used to say that Berlin was Germany in a nutshell. Now I can say we are, for the moment, mankind's capital.''
 
One Woman's Refuge Delayed
Elsewhere there are mixed feelings.
Rut, an East Berlin widow in her 50's, remembered planning to skip to the West in that fateful August nearly three decades ago and even depositing some bedsheets with a friend in West Berlin. The wall prevented her plan, and she continued at her job until now.
''I'm not going yet,'' she said, ''even though I already have the visa. I have to let it sink in for awhile. When I think of all the years we missed,'' she murmured. Her eyes were sad.
Thomas Mahmke, an East Berlin factory worker, said he had driven over for a couple of hours to the West, looked in some shops but passed up even the bargains, bought a curry-spiced sausage, and returned.
''It cost one mark and 90 pfennigs,'' - about $1 -he said. ''A bit expensive for us, but it tastes better than ours.'' Next time, he might take in a movie as he had in West Berlin before the wall went up. ''It is as if we were liberated,'' he said. ''It makes working worthwhile.'' One currywurst made it worthwhile? ''Jawohl!'' he replied.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST: VIEW FROM WASHINGTON;
U.S., Its Vision Blurred, Avoids Crisis Mentality

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that in view of the recent events in East Germany they are studying every ''way-out scenario'' imaginable for Europe, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, but for the moment they intend to sit tight, let the dust settle and not do anything that will be regretted later.
Indeed, there was no sense of crisis in Washington today, no special ''Berlin task force'' to monitor events. Officials were home watching the Washington Redskins football team on television, just as they were last Sunday when the Berlin wall was still a real barrier.
At the State Department, more energy seemed to be devoted to monitoring the leftist guerrilla offensive in El Salvador than the drama in East Berlin. 
This is not because Administration officials are indifferent to the events unfolding in East Berlin. It is rather that they evidently feel that the developments are generally in America's interests, and the product of American policies over the last 40 years, so there is little reason to get in the way.
Even if they wanted to put events on a different course, officials argue, they have few resources to accomplish this at the moment, and no clear, long-term vision of Europe yet that could guide them.
A top Administration policy maker, trying to explain the apparent contradiction between heavy American news coverage of Berlin and the absence of major activity in Washington, said: ''It is natural that symbols take on great emotional meaning in international relations. And of all the symbols, the division of Berlin and the Berlin wall is one of the greatest.
''Both the apparent and real breaches in the Berlin wall naturally lead to a rush of speculation that a new order is in the offing,'' he said. ''But it is not going to happen overnight.
''We are probably on the start of an era where American diplomacy can help shape the lines of a new international order,'' he added. ''But what is important at this point is not crisis management, but considered thinking about the shape of that new order and how we get there, and that's what we're doing.''
It appears that the only Administration decision has been to agree with the Soviet Union and West Germany to play down talk of any immediate reunfication of the two Germanys, and to refrain from doing anything that might inflame the situation.
Administration officials said that President Bush has an informal understanding with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany that Washington will continue to speak positively about the ''principle'' of German reunification, even though this is anathema to many allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In return, they said, Bonn must closely coordinate its activities with the United States and refrain from taking any immediate steps toward unification until a proper European security framework is established.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union indicated a similar preference in his letter to President Bush on Friday, officials said.
These understandings rang through loud and clear in remarks by a variety of American, Soviet and German diplomats over the weekend.
When asked about German reunification on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said, ''In my view, it is at least premature to jump, to make the great leap - and it is a big leap - from right of free travel on the part of East Germans to the question of reunification.
''There are many things, it seems to me, that have to take place in between,'' he said. ''One of those is fair and free and even multi-party elections in East Germany. Another is movement to a free economic system, free markets, free enterprise.''
Earlier, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, was asked on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' whether the Kremlin was ruling out German reunification.
''Reunification is being talked about by people who are not in office, not in government,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. People in authority, he said, are not discussing it.
''We have two military organizations opposing each other, NATO on your side and the Warsaw Pact on the other side,'' he said, ''and the German Democratic Republic is a very important member of the Warsaw Pact for us, and we have our troops there just as Americans have their troops'' in West Germany. ''So how can you reunify it now? So we must wait and let events take its own course.''
When Mr. Gerasimov was asked whether Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush might share a view that Europe's borders must be kept as they are, he answered: ''I think that they may come to a common ground concerning that both countries, and actually everybody, is interested in stability, in not too much upheaval in Europe. I think this is in the common interests of both countries.''
On the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made clear that for now, the Bush Administration sees NATO and the Warsaw Pact continuing to play important roles in Europe.
Asked what President Bush would say if Mr. Gorbachev proposed the dissolution of the two alliances, Mr. Cheney said: ''Well, I think he should say that that's totally inappropriate at this time. It seems to me that what we're witnessing in the East is partly the triumph, if you will, of Western strategy for the last 40 years, and the NATO alliance has been the heart of that.''

HEADLINE: Flossmoor Journal;
For Pickup, No Parking In Its Own Driveway

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLOSSMOOR, Ill., Nov. 11

 BODY:
When they pass Jim Minx's driveway, some people scoff and roll their eyes. Others lament the decline of standards. One resident became so incensed that he took pictures of the awful sight to Village Hall, demanding action at once.
''But gee,'' said Mr. Minx, ''it's only a pickup truck.'' 
A pickup truck, indeed, parked blatantly in the driveway, a clear violation of law in this affluent Chicago suburb.
Flossmoor, an old community of 8,000 people, is known for good schools, well-tended lawns and expensive cars. It is not known for pickup trucks. As a real estate agent fretted, ''What will my clients think?''
Until March, it was illegal to keep a pickup truck even in one's own garage. The law was then liberalized so pickups may now be kept in ''an enclosed garage.''
Mr. Minx said he would be happy to put the truck, a small, well-maintained Mazda, in his garage. ''But I'm remodeling the house,'' he explained, ''and my garage is full of furniture.''
So he keeps parking the truck in his driveway, and Flossmoor police keep giving him tickets.
But Mr. Minx has not been paying them. Instead, he has filed suit in Federal District Court in Chicago, charging that his civil rights have been violated. ''It is my truck and my driveway,'' he said. ''I pay my taxes. I have my rights.'' The flap over Mr. Minx's truck has stirred passionate debate in Flossmoor, where some houses are valued at more than $1 million.
In the view of many residents, Mr. Minx is destroying an old established sense of esthetics here. They worry that the presence of pickup trucks might hurt property values. The presence of pickups could create ''a slum environment,'' John A. Komer warned in a letter to The Star, the local newspaper.
Mayor Frank Maher said many residents of Flossmoor, once home to executives of the steel companies, simply find pickup trucks ''offensive.''
''What if somebody's got a truck with wheelbarrows or lumber sticking out of it?'' he said. ''Nobody wants to look at that.''
Richard Rosenthal, a leader of the anti-truck residents, said he does not so much mind new trucks ''when they're nice and shiny.'' But they inevitably become ''rusty and bumpy.''
Mr. Minx says such a rationale discriminates against trucks. ''What about rusty, bumpy cars?'' he asks.
Mr. Rosenthal and others say Mr. Minx misses the point.
''In Flossmoor,'' Mr. Rosenthal said, ''people do not have rusty, bumpy cars.''
Some residents say the dispute is not really about trucks or cars but about economic class.
Mr. Minx, an Illinois state trooper, lives in a subdivision of town called Flossmoor Highlands, where houses are more modest. And some of his neighbors, who support him, say the wealthier residents across town are being pretentious.
''It's class discrimination,'' said Harold Nelson, a retired steelworker who lives across the street from Mr. Minx. ''Who drives pickup trucks? Blue-collar people, that's who. And that's what this is all about.''
The Highlands subdivision, where some houses are valued at less than $100,000, was annexed to Flossmoor about 20 years ago. Mr. Nelson said its residents have always been held in low regard.
''I saw the same thing when my kids were in school,'' he said. ''They weren't as well accepted because they came from this section of town.''
But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue centers on taste, not income.
''This has always been an affluent society here,'' he said. ''If these people can find a house in Flossmoor they can afford, then fine - but don't try to change the ways of the town.''
Mr. Minx said he found it puzzling that Flossmoor residents were not offended by the presence of pickup trucks owned by carpenters, bricklayers and plumbers who come into the village to do repairs.
''I guess it's all right to hire tradesmen,'' he said, ''just so that they don't live here.''

HEADLINE: Fate of Bush Housing Plan Depends on Resolving Larger Tax Issues

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The fate of President Bush's proposal for a multibillion-dollar housing package to assist low-income families, first-time home-buyers and the homeless will hinge largely on how Congress and the Administration resolve the broader political battle over the budget and taxes, lawmakers and housing experts said today.
Mr. Bush's proposal, unveiled with much fanfare in Dallas on Friday, draws heavily on ideas and approaches already under consideration in Congress.
The lawmakers said that while it will clearly take time to find agreement between the President's proposals and those in Congress, Mr. Bush's interest in housing assistance is important after eight years of dismantling such programs by the Reagan Administration, and virtually guarantees that some form of major housing legislation will be enacted next year.
Indeed, even the name that Mr. Bush chose for his package - the Home Ownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere, or HOPE - is similar to the name of a bipartisan proposal now making its way through the Senate Banking Committee. The senators call their package HOP, for Housing Opportunity Partnerships. 
 
'Life and Momentum' for Plan
''HOP, HOPE, I'll go for anything,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is co-sponsoring the Senate legislation with Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California. ''This gives the legislation life and momentum.''
As with his domestic initiatives on issues like drugs and crime, Mr. Bush's housing proposal leaves unanswered the critical question of how the new assistance will be financed. The President has called for a three-year program with a price tag of about $7.2 billion, divided between $4.2 billion in grants and subsidies and new or expanded tax breaks that will cost the Treasury an additional $3 billion.
The Congressional proposals also do not spell out financing. The Senate package, due to be considered by the Banking Committee on Thursday, carries a $3.8 billion price tag over one year and envisions that tax breaks similar to some of those proposed by Mr. Bush will be adopted separately by the Senate Finance Committee.
''Where the money comes from is an issue that the leaders in the House and Senate and the Administration are going to have to resolve in next year's budget struggle,'' said Donald Campbell, Mr. Cranston's senior housing aide.
To the extent that the Administration has suggested any source of money, it has pointed to one that most Democrats in Congress consider politically unpalatable and economically dubious, a cut in the capital gains tax. Such a tax cut raises money for a few years as investors sell off their holdings and pay the taxes they owe so they can take advantage of the lower rate. But over time, opponents contend, the tax cut would drain billions of dollars in revenue from the Treasury.
 
Battle Likely Will Resume
Mr. Bush, faced with fierce Democratic opposition in the Senate, has been forced to abandon his hope of winning a capital gains tax cut this year. But lawmakers in both parties expect the battle to resume with even greater intensity next year as Congress and the Administration scramble for ways to slash as much as $40 billion from the Federal deficit while making room for new spending on priority items like housing, education or anti-drug efforts.
''When Congress and the Administration want to find the money, they can, like they did with the savings and loan bailout,'' said Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the housing experts who served on a special task force the Senate established to help draft its housing legislation. ''The question is, how much of a priority is housing?''
According to Government officials familiar with the program, the Administration is prepared to commit $250 million in new spending for housing programs in the fiscal 1991 budget that goes to Congress in January. But much of the President's initiative would rely on transferring money from existing housing programs or revamping those programs to encourage more private investment.
''You couldn't spend a billion dollars in the first year, even if you had it,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''Despite the political posturing that we're going to get, Congress and the Administration are on the same wavelength. The reality of the fiscal situation is that the most ardent housing supporters on Capitol Hill recognize that the pot of gold simply isn't there.
''Instead of tens of billions of dollars for housing, we're going to have to settle for hundreds of millions and some new directions.''
 
Serious Differences Are Seen
But Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who serves on both the House Banking Committee and the House Budget Committee, said that even if the Administration and Congress could agree on how much to spend for housing assistance, there are serious differences over the substance and direction of Federal housing policy. He noted that the Senate approach, while bipartisan, has never been well received by House Democrats, who believe that something must be done to expand the dwindling supply of low-cost housing.
''You can take all the public housing you want and convert it to tenant ownership, but that is not going to create a single unit of new housing,'' Mr. Schumer said, referring to one of the major components of Mr. Bush's proposal. The President's plan specifically precludes construction of new, low-income housing units, and the Senate plan places emphasis on rehabilitation of existing rental units.
Mr. Schumer said that while many House Democrats support the idea of tenant ownership and believe that some of the existing assistance programs need revamping the real need is for Federal financing of a housing production program. ''We need more dollars and better programs, and the Bush proposal has neither,'' he said.
The Federal Government is currently spending $7.1 billion a year on assisted housing, a decline of more than 70 percent from the $26.7 billion that was spent in 1980, or of more than 80 percent if the effects of inflation are taken into account. Mr. Schumer said that while the House and Senate may differ in their approaches, both would like to see the current figure increased to something over $10 billion next year.
''The bottom line is that in the area of housing, there is no substitute for money,'' he said. ''If $250 million is what the Administration has in mind for next year, then I've never seen more words and hype about less dollars than at any time in my political career.''

HEADLINE: Honor in the House - and Senate?;
Eliminate Honorariums

 BODY:
The list below details the honorarium fees that two prominent Senators, the majority leader, George Mitchell, and the minority leader, Robert Dole, received from private interest groups last year. The potential for conflicts of interest, real or apparent, is obvious.
Cleaner government requires stiff rules prohibiting such income combined with a reasonable pay increase for the lawmakers. Just such a package was recommended by a Presidential commission last year. But it failed when the size of the raise and the chance it would be approved without a recorded vote generated a furious public response. 
Now House Speaker Thomas Foley and the House minority leader, Robert Michel, are again trying to raise salaries as part of a broader ethics bill. They show commendable political courage. But they may not win approval without similar courage from the Senate's leaders, and the President.
Members of Congress deserve to be heard when they say they need more than their $89,500 annual salary. That may sound high; but many could earn much more in private-sector jobs, and the need to maintain two households is a genuine financial burden.
The salaries of other top Federal officials are linked to those of senators and representatives. Because of Congress's reluctance to vote itself pay raises, judges, Cabinet members and high-level civil servants have seen their paychecks eroded by inflation. That frustrates recruiting.
Congress, meanwhile, doesn't feel the same pinch. Under present rules, members may take back-door raises in the form of honorariums from interest groups with a heavy stake in legislation. These ethically questionable fees now total more than $9 million annually. Republican and Democratic leaders and members of powerful committees pocket the most.
This system erodes public trust and taints the business of Congress. The new House ethics plan, developed by a special bipartisan task force, offers the public and Congress an attractive alternative. It would forbid honorariums and replace the lost income with a cost-of-living adjustment in pay and a 25 percent raise beginning in 1991. Judges and other officials would also receive needed boosts.
The new House proposal is far more modest than the 51 percent pay increase rejected last January and, as necessary and reasonable, warrants adoption. President Bush, who prodded Congress last summer with pay and ethics proposals of his own, can help by backing up his general statement of support with a strong White House lobbying effort for the House bill.
Senators, who generally receive more in honorariums than members of the House, have greater obligation to press for change. Senators Mitchell and Dole say they favor the kind of approach embodied by the House bill. But the legislation they are considering would merely scale back Senate honorariums, not eliminate them.
For the nation's top lawmakers to mortgage themselves to monied private lobbies insults democracy. The new House ethics package offers a rare test of Congressional self-respect.

HEADLINE: Crops and Livestock Thrive Without Chemicals, Studies Show

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A crucial point in the debate on the effects of decreased farm use of chemicals concerns food production. As Jim Sinner points out (letter, Oct. 8), food production will determine the cost and, hence, the possibility of reducing this important source of environmental pollution.
Assessments of the economic consequences of large-scale reduction in farm chemicals have been based on arbitrarily assumed levels of yield reduction. However, it is possible to make such assessments more firmly by using the results of the many field experiments on organic agriculture carried out in the last 10 years. 
A search of the scientific literature has yielded 226 field comparisons of yields from conventionally grown crops and livestock with crops and livestock grown organically - that is, those produced without the use of any manufactured chemical fertilizers, pesticides or growth stimulants. The experimental data covered 26 crops and two livestock products - milk and eggs - and was measured at 21 sites in Europe and the United States.
Yields produced without any farm chemicals averaged 88 percent of those produced with the recommended optimum levels of application. In more than a quarter of the comparisons, yield differences were less than 10 percent, more than half the yield differences were less than 20 percent, and in nearly three-quarters of the comparisons, yield differences were less than 30 percent.
In 49 out of the 196 comparisons, crops not receiving farm chemicals gave greater yields than those conventionally grown, while half the 30 animal products compared showed greater yields from livestock that had not received chemically grown feedstuffs, feed additives or antibiotics.
There was no evidence from analysis of the experimental data to show that the use of farm chemicals affected year-to-year variability in yields, either climatically induced variability or that caused by transitional or conversion effects.
This experimental finding, that the reduction in yields associated with the nonuse of farm chemicals averaged only 12 percent, has important economic and environmental implications. Equally significant is the challenge to agricultural science to explain this surprising refutation of the commonly held view that heavy applications of farm chemicals are essential for a productive agriculture.

List of Promises From Dinkins: Checking It Twice

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Somewhere between the poles of consistency and expediency lie valid reasons to break campaign promises.
Keeping them is not necessarily a test of leadership or even fidelity. Events may force different priorities. So may the broader perspective demanded by higher office. But campaign pledges are worth remembering as a benchmark against which to measure how far a candidate, once elected, has strayed or grown. 
When David N. Dinkins was elected Manhattan Borough President in 1985, he promised to make housing, education, personal safety, health care and employment his priorities, to pay special attention to communities in jeopardy and, while striving for balance, to empower constituencies that were underserved. He largely kept to that agenda, though the limitations of his office, at least, necessarily left him longer on promise than performance.
It would be impossible to compare Mr. Dinkins's record as mayor with what might have been had 20,000 or so voters changed their minds and elected Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican. But it is possible to measure it over the next four years against his campaign promises. Here are the highlights in capsule form:
Crime: Double the 825 police officers and supervisors assigned to community patrol. Hire an additional 2,500 officers.
Assign an officer to every subway train at night while maintaining present platform patrols. Press for tougher penalites for crimes committed by gangs of three or more. Punish every crime, first offenses included, with penalties ranging from community service and house arrest to boot camps and prison. Oppose more jail barges as ''not a reasonable alternative.'' Create an all-civilian police complaint review board.
Drugs: Begin random drug tests as a condition of probation and parole and return those who test positive to prison. Give drug treatment on demand. Provide a guard in every school and drug education in every grade.
Housing: Require developers of commercial space to build, or help finance, affordable housing. Penalize landlords who keep habitable apartments vacant for more than a month. Freeze the tax burden on single-family homes. Accelerate housing rehabilitation, particularly for individuals.
Education: Transform school buildings into community centers open all year and evenings. Oppose tenure for principals in specific schools. Involve parents in local school boards and appoint a parent of a public-school student to the Board of Education.
Health and Welfare: Open 25 school clinics in medically underserved comunities. Provide prenatal care for every pregnant city resident. Scrap a needle-exchange program for drug addicts. Expand neighborhood health clinics and services and benefits for poor children and troubled families.
Economic Development: Impose binding commercial rent arbitration for small businesses. Provide economic incentives to small businesses, light manufacturing and emerging industries. Encourage regional cooperation. Expand opportunities for government contracts for businesses owned by women and minority groups. Make hiring of city residents a condition for city assistance to businesses ''whenever possible.'' Create an adult education institute. Make zoning and tax concessions for companies contingent on their providing child-care space or assistance.
Environment: Impose a moratorium of up to four years on garbage-burning incinerators. Speed recycling programs to handle 50 percent of the garbage by 1997. Shift vehicles owned and licensed by the city from gasoline to alternative fuels, beginning next year with 10 percent of all vehicles purchased. Improve the racial climate.
Last week, Mr. Dinkins offered a first look at his agenda. Visiting City Hall after an election he had almost lost, in part because of questions about his personal finances, the Mayor-elect, encouraged by Mayor Edward I. Koch, lobbied to loosen an ethics law. Few question the wisdom of delaying the law, which by more severely limiting future employment of city government officials could disrupt the transition by provoking a stampede among them. Yet some questioned the judgment of elevating a sensitive issue that was not even a campaign promise to a seemingly top priority.
That could hint at a short honeymoon for Mr. Dinkins. His most ardent supporters may be hopeful, but other New Yorkers, among them the nearly one-half who voted for somebody else last week, presumably harbor lower expectations. Low expectations for many public officials rarely breed disappointment.
''David has one asset,'' said Mark Green, a Dinkins adviser. ''He's invariably underestimated.''
And therein may lie his greatest promise.

HEADLINE: Teachers' Leader Ready to Reap Gratitude

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

 BODY:
As the president of the United Federation of Teachers, New York City's teachers union, Sandra Feldman is one of the most powerful figures in the city's public sector.
Now she and her union are poised to see their influence magnified even further when both a new Mayor and new Schools Chancellor take office in January.
The incoming Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, was the union's first choice to head the city's public school system.
For the Mayor-elect, David N. Dinkins, Ms. Feldman and her members provided an important early endorsement in the Democratic primary and vigorous support in his successful general-election campaign against Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In private conversations, so numerous as to be almost public, Ms. Feldman has been claiming a large share of the credit for helping Mr. Dinkins become the city's first black mayor. 
When Mr. Fernandez arrives in January from Miami, where he has led the Dade County schools, he will bring a philosophy of increasing the influence of teachers in running their schools and presumably some gratitude for the U.F.T.'s support.
In endorsing Mr. Dinkins, the union, with its 102,000 active and retired members, broke with its recent practice of not backing anyone in mayoral primaries. Ms. Feldman engineered the change.
To do so, she eschewed the advice of her longtime mentor and predecessor as U.F.T. president, Albert Shanker. Mr. Shanker had initially recommended that the union support Richard Ravitch in the Democratic primary.
But Ms. Feldman argued that the union's interests were best served by backing Mr. Dinkins. She felt comfortable with the candidate philosophically, and she thought he would win.
The Mayor-elect has also been a good friend of Ms. Feldman's husband, Arthur Barnes, since their boyhood days in Harlem. The two men are so close that many expect Mr. Barnes, the head of the Urban Coalition, to get a high-level job in the Dinkins administration.
In addition to the manpower that comes with any union's support, the U.F.T.'s endorsement provided Mr. Dinkins with the public approval of an organization widely seen as white and middle-class and, to a lesser extent, Jewish.
The image is largely accurate. About 70 percent of the city's 62,000 active teachers are white, and most of them are among the oldest. About 19 percent of the teachers are black, and almost 10 percent are of Hispanic heritage. The racial makeup of the student population has been changing more quickly: fewer than 20 percent of the city's public school students are white.
Fewer than a third of the teachers are men, and they are concentrated in the high schools.
 
Teachers Versus Parents
The image of the union as white and Jewish was forged during the 1968 teachers strike, which became one of the city's most brutal racial conflicts. The strike, which began over an experiment to give parents in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn a role in running the schools, pitted white, mostly Jewish, teachers against black parents and their supporters.
The strike deeply affected many people who now have leadership roles in the public schools, especially Ms. Feldman. At the time of the strike, the union was six years old and an uncertain factor in city affairs. The strike, ostensibly over the local school board's efforts to get rid of several union teachers, gave the U.F.T. an opportunity to coalesce and demonstrate its influence.
It thrust Mr. Shanker into the forefront of city politics and, with him, Ms. Feldman, his personal assistant. He sent her into Ocean Hill-Brownsville at the beginning of the strike ''to provide a union presence,'' she recalled in an interview.
''He picked me because I was tough,'' she said.
 
'No Role Here'
It was through Mr. Shanker's patronage and support that Ms. Feldman rose to head the union, succeeding him in January 1986. She is paid an annual salary of $119,000.
Ms. Feldman acknowledged that when she became president she was at first uneasy about being seen as merely Mr. Shanker's surrogate at the U.F.T. while he moved on to head the American Federation of Teachers, the smaller of the two major national teacher unions. ''I knew I had to establish myself,'' she said.
Asked whether Mr. Shanker had a lingering role in U.F.T. affairs, Ms. Feldman answered abruptly, ''He has no role here.'' She said she dreads comparisons with him.
Friends of both said that right after she assumed the union's presidency, Ms. Feldman felt a strong need to demonstrate her independence. Nowadays, they said, she is more secure about her leadership.
''When there are very weighty things, I give him a call,'' she said, although she added, ''I don't talk to him a lot.''
 
Tougher Economic Times
Bert Pogrebin, who has served for many years as special counsel to the Board of Education in contract negotiations with the U.F.T., said the union under Mr. Shanker ''was probably one of the most effective labor unions in the city.'' He said the union dominated labor relations at the board until the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's, and even after that. Teachers, he said, ''expected Shanker to deliver everything.''
Ms. Feldman, he said, has to contend with tougher economic times for the city. Nonetheless, she negotiated a contract three years ago without resorting to arbitration, as Mr. Shanker did three years earlier.
The current contract expires at the end of next September, just as school begins. Ms. Feldman made it clear in the interview that in coming negotiations she wants to increase teachers' salaries, now ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. ''Teachers have to be valued,'' she said.
The mayor is the principal figure in setting the city's budget, which helps determine teacher salaries and how much is spent on some educational programs.
Although Ms. Feldman was a full-time teacher for only three years, she is admired by her members for her awareness of their emotional needs, especially their craving for respect and their sensitivity to criticism.
 
'Like a Miracle'
Ms. Feldman, who is 50 years old, grew up in poverty in a Coney Island tenement. She descibed her childhood as difficult and one redeemed by school, which she found to be a wondrous place.
''When I got to school, it was like a miracle,'' she recalled. ''I remember my very first moment there, being made to line up with the other kindergarten kids in the lunchroom of P.S. 188.
''I loved the smell of the school. I loved the smell of the teachers with their perfume.''
While she is rapturous about the long ago of her childhood, she is less comfortable talking about the 1968 strike, which so affected the public schools. ''I hate it when it keeps getting brought up,'' she said. ''It was so long ago.''
The strike's most lasting legacy was the decentralized system of administration that was put into place in 1969 and still endures. The city was divided into 32 districts, each with locally elected boards to govern the elementary and middle schools. The high schools continued to be administered by the central Board of Education.
 
Teachers on Boards
Many teachers who had opposed decentralization moved swiftly to turn the new system to their benefit, running for election to the local school boards. While teachers, along with principals, could not run in the districts where they worked, they could become members in other districts, often trading favors among themselves. Board of Education employees, mostly principals, accounted for nearly a third of the local school board members until a recent law prohibited them from serving. Teachers accounted for about 10 percent of the seats.
In addition, in elections where the turnouts were as low as 3 percent of eligible voters, the U.F.T. found it could easily influence the makeup of school boards through endorsements and campaign contributions. Until a recent change in policy, the union would also challenge nominating petitions of candidates it opposed. Such candidates were usually overmatched by the union's formidable legal and financial resources.
Ms. Feldman noted that the U.F.T. supported the new law prohibiting teachers and other Board of Education employees from serving on local school boards. After several of the local boards came under investigation on corruption charges, the union had to respond to complaints that it had worked to elect most of those politicians. Ms. Feldman said the union has become more careful in its endorsements and withheld support last May from those under investigation.
She said she shares the growing concern among officials and educators that the 20-year-old decentralized system has to be changed.
''I think everyone in New York has felt for a while there have to be significant changes in the decentralized system,'' she said.
The change she most looks forward to is Mr. Fernandez's efforts to bring to New York the innovations he has tried in Miami. Mr. Fernandez has said he will try to replicate what he called the ''Miami experiment,'' in which schools are largely run by committees composed of teachers, principals and parents.
''I don't expect we'll be totally in agreement with everything he wants done,'' Ms. Feldman said. But when asked what issues come to mind on which they might disagree, she said she could not think of any.

Adjustments Expected in Mexico Pact

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Mexico is getting far less in new loans than it hoped for when it worked out a debt agreement with its bankers in July. Because of this, bankers involved in the agreement say that some difficult last-minute adjustments are likely to be necessary.
While the figures are still not final, bankers estimate that Mexico will receive no more than $4.5 billion in new money over four years - half the $9 billion it hoped for when the debt accord was signed in July.
The debt restructuring plan came after four months of negotiations and was the first under the Bush Administration's new debt-reduction strategy. Under the proposal, which covers $52.7 billion in Mexico's medium- and long-term debt to commercial banks around the world, banks must choose between accepting a 35 percent reduction in the value of their existing loans, offering new loans or doing a combination of the two. 
 
Smaller Debt Burden
This preference for debt reduction and the shortage of new loans means Mexico's overall debt burden will be cut a little more than originally anticipated. That will help in the future but provides less economic relief now. Originally, the package had been estimated to provide $2 billion to $3 billion a year in new assistance.
This last-minute problem also illustrates some of the difficulties of restructuring debt by giving banks the choice between debt reduction and new loans. While debt reduction has been tried before, this is the first time it has been combined with new loans as an official policy, backed by the United States, its allies and key international financial institutions.
Shafiqul Islam, a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, called the approach ''a bad idea in principle and in tactics.''
 
''It Will Work''
Despite the expected need for adjustments, several bankers, all of whom asked not to be identified, said they expect the deal to go through. ''It will work,'' one banker said. But the lack of new money may lead to renewed criticism among bankers of the Administration's debt strategy, which is called the Brady plan for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Bankers said the Mexicans and some bankers were still trying to encourage more banks to offer some new money along with debt reduction. But many banks, especially those that have recently increased their reserves against loans to the third world and taken large losses, are resisting such suggestions.
 
Problems With Canadian Lenders
Several bankers said that Canadian banks seem to be posing the biggest problem. One American banker said he thought some Canadian banks might not be unhappy if the deal failed.
Citibank, which heads the advisory committee of banks that negotiated the debt agreement, is alone in opting all for new money. Its chairman, John S. Reed, has pushed that approach aggressively, partially because of the bank's large exposure in Mexico.
Japanese banks have opted mostly for principal reduction, bankers said, but a few have offered new loans. Both Bank of America and the Swiss Bank Corporation, which is a co-chair of the committee, have opted for a combination of debt reduction and some new money.
A. W. Clausen, Bank of America's chairman, said the bank would mostly take debt reduction. But the commitment to some new money, he said, shows confidence in Mexico's future.
But the Swiss Bank's reason for choosing to make some new loans, one official said, was to preserve the structure of the co-financing agreement it has with the World Bank on loans made to Mexico in 1986.
Several British banks are doing all debt reduction, while one or two are said to be still considering a combination.
The obstacle to completing the deal is that there may not be enough money to provide the guarantees promised. One option is to reduce the existing principal on loans by 35 percent and get interest at market rates. The other is to accept a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent on the existing face value of the loans.
In the original proposal there is $7 billion for these guarantees or enhancements from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Japan and Mexico. The money would provide for 18-month rolling guarantees on the interest reduction bonds and the purchase of Treasury bonds needed to guarantee the remaining principal on the debt reduction bonds.
With fewer new loans and more debt reduction than forecast, the expected cost of the guarantees is rising, bankers said.
One top banker said there are only two possible sources for more guarantee money - the banks and Mexico. Mexico would have to provide more money from its reserves or the banks would have to accept a lesser guarantee. What is being discussed in this vein is interest guarantees of less than the 18 months assumed, the banker said. But the banks already agreed to ''stretch'' these enhancements once with a $1 billion letter of credit in September.
The original assumption discussed by both the Mexicans and bankers after the intitial agreement in July was that banks would choose interest rate reduction on 60 percent of the existing loans, principal reduction on 20 percent and new loans on 20 percent.
As of now, with more than half the replies in, new loans are less than 10 percent, and they are not expected to go above that when the selection process is finished at the end of the month. There was a bonus fee for opting for new money by Oct. 31 but one banker said, the ''new money was very light.''
Another problem with the lack of new money is that it may indicate that fewer banks will be willing to lend to Mexico in the future, which could hurt growth.
Far more than 20 percent of the choices, however, are for principal reduction.
Salomon Brothers, in a new analysis of the debt reduction options, concluded that the interest rate reduction bond is more valuable in terms of cash flow than the prinicpal reduction bonds. But the study also suggests that to hedge against the movement of interest rates, the banks could buy some principal reduction bonds.
 
Inflation Outlook
The president of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said in his State of the Nation address last week, that the Government was now expecting less new money. And he also indicated that inflation this year could be higher than expected.
Mr. Islam of the Council of Foreign Relations said that if Mexico appeared to face greater problems in meeting its near-term financing needs it could erode some of the new confidence that was generated with the signing of the debt agreement. This would also hurt near-term growth prospects because the return of capital the Mexicans have been counting on could slow down.
In another debt negotiation, banks had until Friday to respond to the Philippine Government's offer to buy back up to $1.3 billion of its debt at 50 cents on the dollar. The outcome is expected to be announced this week.
 
Japanese Courted
NAGOYA, Japan, Nov. 12 (Reuters) - Latin American finance ministers and central bank governors met here today in an attempt to attract Japanese investment.
The three-day symposium is being sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank and Japan's Export-Import Bank and will be addressed by several Latin American economic ministers, as well as executives of banks that have lent money in the region.
Private sector bankers said they expected the Japanese Government to promise financial support to several Latin American and Caribbean countries. A Japanese Finance Ministry official said an agreement to provide all or part of a promised $2.05 billion in loans to Mexico over the next three years was likely to be signed.

HEADLINE: More Aid for Addicts on the Job

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Hundreds of American employers, angry and frustrated about drug-related losses in productivity, accidents, absenteeism and surging medical expenses, have begun offering counseling programs to addicted employees in recent months in an intensified campaign against drug abuse in the workplace.
''The number of chronic abusers and addicts is at record levels, both in the workplace and outside,'' said Mark A. de Bernardo, director of labor law at the United States Chamber of Commerce. Government and industry experts say drug and alcohol abuse is costing the employers more than $100 billion a year.
Employers and Government experts say that many drug abusers also have problems with alcohol, which remains the most serious substance-abuse problem. Counseling programs typically offer help with both drugs and alcohol. 
 
Joint Efforts by Corporations
Many of the small and medium-sized companies, which make up 99 percent of the nation's employers, have recently overcome their earlier reluctance to confront drug abuse problems and are joining in the campaign.
In California, Florida, Texas, Michigan, Washington and at least six other states, large corporations have recently formed groups that share information and resources to help deal with the problem. And they are helping smaller companies start anti-drug operations.
''There's been a phenomenal growth rate in the number of companies offering employee-assistance services in the last year, as a result of employers' concerns about substance abuse,'' said J. Michael Walsh, director of workplace initiatives for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a Federal agency.
For example, 80 companies signed contracts to purchase therapy programs for alcohol and drug abuse in the last year from Human Affairs International, a unit of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, which supplies employee-assistance services to both large and small employers. And thousands of companies that have Federal contracts are now required to adopt anti-drug policies, under provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, which went into effect on March 18.
The assistance programs, which are often coupled with company drug-testing policies, are now available to more than 26 million workers - three times as many as five years ago, when the crack form of cocaine emerged as a major problem. 20 Million Workers Use Drugs Nationwide, an estimated 20 million American jobs are now held by people who use illicit drugs like marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and crack, a smokable form of cocaine.
Company counselors say they are encountering a growing number of employees and their relatives who are using alcohol, crack and other drugs in combination, and they report that they are having difficulty keeping pace with such multiple addictions, which they say are the biggest killer. But despite these new problems, industry leaders feel they have important assets in offering therapy.
''The workplace is an easier place to deal with drugs than any place else,'' said James E. Burke, chairman of the strategic planning committee of the board of Johnson & Johnson, the medical products company. ''You have more control, and you can build a supportive environment, which is sometimes difficult to do in the community.''
Richard Lesher, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said: ''Employers have the most effective weapon in the war on drugs, the paycheck. If you and I believe that our jobs are contingent on our being drug-free, it creates a powerful incentive.''
 
The Search for Answers
''We are really dealing with problems of work performance, which also include marital and family problems, stress and emotional problems,'' said Ron Finch, employee-assistance director at BellSouth, the telephone company based in Atlanta. ''A lot of drug and alcohol abusers are trying to medicate themselves.''
The big Detroit automobile makers and many other large employers are providing space in hundreds of plants and offices across the country for Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which serve employees, their relatives and people from nearby communities.
 
An Employee Who Got Help
''I try to attend at least two Narcotics Anonymous meetings a week,'' said R. Craig Redner, a 39-year-old food-catering salesman in Novi, Mich., a Detroit suburb. He said that he had been addicted for years, first to heroin and later to crack, and that his employer had helped him to stop using drugs.
''Our goal is not to find people and kick them out; that merely dumps people on society,'' said John F. Maciarz, a General Motors Corporation spokesman. ''Our major objective is to turn them back into the successes they once were.''
Mr. Redner said: ''The final two weeks, I was actually free-basing on the job. My boss at Gary's Catering said if I didn't get help, he would let me go.'' Mr. Redner said he was hospitalized for two weeks, which his company's health plan paid for.
''They hired me back the day I got out,'' he said. He continued with ''one-on-one therapy'' for seven months. Since then, Mr. Redner said, ''I have been straight for a year and nine months.''
 
New Jersey-New York Efforts
In one of many regional programs in which corporations are cooperating in attacking drug problems, business executives will meet on Thursday to discuss anti-drug strategies under the auspices of the New York Business Group on Health and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association in Ridgewood, N.J.
Thousands of executives have attended a variety of drug conferences this fall organized by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the Swiss-owned pharmaceutical concern, and other sponsors. Irwin Lerner, president and chief executive of Hoffmann-La Roche, said the goal was to ''sensitize business organizations around the country'' to bring the campaign back to local areas.
Mr. Burke, who recently retired as chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, heads another cooperative program. It has created hundreds of anti-drug messages that have been broadcast free or published without charge in newspapers and magazines. The broadcast time and ads, if purchased, would have cost $310 million.
General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union are sponsoring a 13-week television series on televison station WBKD in Detroit in which recovering alcoholics and drug abusers like Mr. Redner tell their stories.
 
Help for Families
As drug abuse has spread, executives increasingly have had to deal with colleagues and relatives in need of help. ''We got into drug testing when it was determined that the chief executive's driver was using drugs,'' the employee-assistance director at one company said.
Bruce Liebert, 38 years old, a self-employed aquarium sales and maintenance man in Houston, said his wife's insurance at her job at the Exxon Corporation had paid for treatment at Spring Shadows, a Houston drug program, for his longtime cocaine addiction.
''After 18 months, I went off on another binge and shot coke for, like, a day and a half,'' he said. ''The end was a few mornings after. I ended up on the steps of my church, totally devastated.''
Mr. Liebert said the church sent him to Canaan Land, a treatment center in Alabama. Since then, he said, he has been free of drugs for two years. ''Now the whole thing that keeps me straight is helping people,'' he explained. ''I was asked to speak at Exxon to the executives. It's a problem with everybody, not just down in the ghetto.''
 
The Cost Factor
''Corporations can easily spend more for drug treatment than cancer, AIDS or open heart surgery,'' said Otto Jones, president of Human Affairs International in Murray, Utah, which provides employee-assistance services to insurers and employers that cover five million people.
''Drug users will incur 300 percent more medical costs, on average, than the rest of a company's employees,'' he said. ''The users lose twice as much work as the average employee and are five times more likely to be involved in accidents off the job.''
Spending on employee health care has been increasing by 15 percent a year for the last 12 years.
''The high-cost case is often the child of an executive in a dual-career family who is institutionalized for more than a year,'' Mr. Jones continued. ''The parents just wanted to put them someplace, and often the institutions got them on other kinds of drugs just to manage them.''
When experienced workers are in short supply, providing help takes on an added economic rationale. ''With the workplace pool of potential employees shrinking, it makes real clear sense to try to rehabilitate employees rather than terminate them,'' said Jack Rose, an employee-assistance administrator with the Lockheed Corporation in Burbank, Calif.
 
Increased Use of Testing
Testing for drugs has become an important part of the program at many American corporations, and experts say thousands more will soon be testing as they comply with the new Drug-Free Workplace law. According to a Labor Department survey last year, 17 million people worked for employers in the private sector that test for drugs.
Johnson & Johnson, like many large companies, tests all job applicants for drugs. ''Companies put the message out there: 'Don't apply!' '' said Helen Axel, executive director of human resources research, at the Conference Board, a business research group in New York.
Employees may be tested if they are involved in accidents or other unusual behavior. At Johnson & Johnson, people in high-risk jobs are tested without advance notice, several times a year. Those identified as drug users are directed to the company's assistance program, which is tied in with counseling to cope with psychological stress and to promote physical fitness.
 
Unions Oppose Coercion
Labor unions generally support employer drug counseling and therapy programs. But the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and many member unions oppose coercion in drug programs and oppose testing as a violation of privacy.
''Job loss is an effective deterrent, but the threat of job loss should be restricted to failure to perform the job,'' said Noel Beasley, a vice president in Chicago with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. Drug testing, he added, reduces the incentive for people to enter rehabilitation voluntarily.
Mr. Rose at Lockheed said a record of having offered assistance was important in defending lawsuits claiming ''unlawful'' dismissals in states like California.
The Supreme Court recently upheld the legality of testing railway employees after accidents and the legality of pre-employment testing for Federal customs agents. Challenges to random drug testing of employees are making their way through the courts.

HEADLINE: Pacific Economic Group Makes Progress at Meeting

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The inaugural Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, attended by representatives of 12 countries last week, achieved modest progress.
United States officials said the new group might develop common positions involving other international groups, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Telecommunications Union.
''We have not completed all the decisions that hopefully we will ultimately take, but this is a very clear and substantial step forward and should be welcomed worldwide,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who led the United States delegation. 
The delegation also included Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills.
 
Who Participated
Other countries represented included Japan, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia and the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei.
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong did not participate, in the face of opposition from some ASEAN nations. Trade officials at the meeting said the group's effectiveness would be limited by their absence.
Negotiations are to continue on participation by China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, with the possibilities ranging from full membership to observer status.
The meeting of the new group was intended as a message to the European Community that the Asia-Pacific region is committed to the success of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks being held by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Low-Key Strategies
The United States and Japan followed similar low-key strategies at the conference, with both sides emphasizing substantive projects for the region.
The organization's structure reflects proposals made recently in the United States for increasing dialogue between governments in the Asia-Pacific region, which has seen the most rapid expansion of any area in the world economy in the 1980's.
The recent transition in some East Asian economies from labor-intensive production to technology-based manufacturing has created a need for both capital investment and technology transfer. To help meet these needs, Japan outlined a human resources development program that includes provision for a center in Osaka to train managers and engineers and money to support technical training in the region.
In a move to allay the concerns of Indonesia and Malaysia, which fear that ASEAN'S identity would be threatened by the new, larger group, the six non-ASEAN countries agreed to certain concessions.

HEADLINE: Producers of Electricity Criticize Clean Air Plan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
President Bush's plan to reduce acid rain by limiting pollutants from the smokestacks of electric utility plants is drawing criticism from some of the nation's cleanest utilities as well as the dirtiest.
Those that burn natural gas and low-sulfur oil instead of high-sulfur coal are complaining because the Bush proposal would require them to cut pollution from existing plants if they want to build new ones. This, they say, is nearly impossible because there is little room left for improvement.
Utilities that use oil argue that the companies that use coal can easily clean up older plants because coal is so dirty to begin with. The oil-burning utilities also say the bill does not recognize their costly efforts, mostly to control sulfur dioxide, a pollutant released into the air when the sulfur in coal or oil is burned. 
Environmentalists are skeptical of all these arguments. ''This is another in a series of very creative excuses utilities have come up with,'' said Constance M. Mahan of the National Audubon Society.
''They're dirtier now because the law permitted them to buy cheaper and dirtier fuel, and that's what they're doing,'' said David G. Hawkins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former assistant administrator for air programs at the Environmental Protection Agency. ''They're trying to do the classic thing polluting firms have always tried to do: maximize their permission to pollute.''
 
Objections From the Northeast
A related objection has been raised by some coal-burning utilities that have already cleaned up. For example, utilities in Wisconsin, under a 1985 law, have already cut their emissions below the level that Washington now proposes, and complain that they would be in a better position today if they had not cleaned up four years ago. And utilities that have not cleaned up are complaining that it would be very costly for them to do so.
Combined with those objections, the the objections of the oil- and gas-burners in the Northeast may make the President's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act more difficult to get through Congress.
One of those objections by the Northeastern utilities is that the President's proposal would require electric companies that already meet the new standard to match the level of emissions they achieved in 1985. At that time, the utilities could buy abundant natural gas at low prices, resulting in very low pollution. Most have shifted back to oil, because of price changes and higher electric demand.
''It's arbitrary, and we're being unfairly penalized,'' said Frank M. Lee, manager of environmental affairs at the Boston Edison Company, complaining about the selection of 1985 as the base year. He added that his company could do little more to clean up, because it is already buying low-sulfur oil, as Massachusetts requires.
''If acid rain is a problem, our customers have already paid the price for clean air,'' he said. ''We've already paid our dues.''
But Mr. Hawkins of the Resources Defense Council counters: ''If you start handing out allowances to people who burn gas, where do you draw the line?''
At Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and part of Massachusetts, Emmanuel S. Forde, a spokesman, said the company was already using fuel with a sulfur content so low that if it had to make further efforts to clean up in order to expand, ''you might have to find a fuel with minus quantities of sulfur.''
 
Many States Have Rules
Most East Coast states have rules that have already accomplished the kind of cleanup that Mr. Bush proposes for utilities in the Midwest that use high-sulfur coal. For many years, New York and Connecticut, for example, have required many generators to use oil with a sulfur content no higher than five-tenths of 1 percent, although cheaper oil with a sulfur content of 2.4 percent is available. In oil, a sulfur content of 1 percent yields 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per one million B.T.U.'s of heat produced, the level that the Bush proposal sets for coal plants in the Midwest.
The Bush proposal is stated in terms of sulfur dioxide output for a given amount of heat produced, regardless of the fuel used. The quantity of heat used as a standard is one million B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units. A B.T.U. is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. One million B.T.U.'s of heat can run a turbine to produce 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity.
The proposal retricts emissions of sulfur dioxide to no more than 1.2 pounds per million B.T.U.'s used. If the utility already meets that standard, the maximum sulfur dioxide output is set at the level achieved by the utility in 1985.
In New York, the Consolidated Edison Company, one of the cleanest fossil-fuel-burning utilities in the country, said in a statement that the proposal had ''dire implications for the social and economic prospects of New York City and Westchester,'' its service area. The reason, the company said, is that it burned an extraordinarily large proportion of gas in 1985, and would have difficulty reaching that level again. If it wants to add plants, it said, it would have to make existing plants cleaner still.
In 1985, Con Edison's system average was 0.15 pound of sulfur dioxide per million B.T.U.'s; last year, because high demand required burning more oil, the average was 0.19 pound.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Stage Seems Set for Lower Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The positive tone in the credit markets that has largely prevailed since mid-year is apt to remain in place well into 1990, analysts said, setting the stage for further reductions in interest rates.
Recent developments, including an unexpected but welcome move by the Federal Reserve Board to shave short-term interest rates and the dramatic thaw in relations with the Eastern bloc have helped reinforce the bullish attitude.
There is a growing sense among a number of economists that business conditions may be far weaker than recent data suggest.
 
'The Market Was Misled'
''The market was misled by the report on output in the third quarter and by the October employment report,'' said Joseph Carson, a senior economist at Chemical Bank. 
Since the preliminary report was issued last month, figures on capital spending, spending on housing and inventory investment have been revised downward, Mr. Carson said.
As a consequence, when a revised measure of real economic growth for the quarter is released later this month, it is likely to show a much lower level of activity than the 2.5 percent rate that was originally reported.
''I think the revised number could be down as much as a full percentage point,'' Mr. Carson said. ''And growth in the fourth quarter is likely to be 1 percent or less. Businesses are becoming less and less certain about a quick turnaround.''
Healthy income growth so far this year suggests that a sharp drop in consumer spending is unlikely, preventing the slowdown from turning into a recession.
But Richard Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the gains might be short-lived.
''The benefits to discretionary spending power from the summer's dip in energy and other goods prices are waning,'' Mr. Berner notes in the firm's weekly ''Comments on Credit.''
''A less favorable mix between real growth and overall inflation will erode consumer purchasing power and impede the substantial slide in interest rates required to refuel growth in interest-sensitive demands.''
 
Growth Forecast
Despite worries about the consumer and, more important, the economic impact of a continued squeeze on corporate profits, analysts at Salomon forecast growth of 1.5 percent through the middle of next year.
Market participants will be attuned to developments in Washington, where members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making arm, will begin the first of two days of meetings on Tuesday.
After the Fed's easing move last week, analysts do not anticipate the meeting to produce a further immediate change in policy. But additional cuts in the overnight Federal funds rate, which was lowered most recently to 8.5 percent, are likely soon, some said.
''I expect the Fed to ease the funds rate by another quarter of a point before the end of the year,'' Mr. Carson said. ''And by spring we expect to see the funds rate fall by another full percentage point.''
The Fed's action last week prompted some analysts to surmise that a cut in the prime lending rate would be imminent. Indeed two small lending institutions did lower the prime to 10 percent last week.
But officials at large money center banks, who asked not to be identified, said it was unlikely that large lending institutions would cut the prime rate until the funds rate has fallen an additional 25 basis points, to 8.25 percent. The bank officials noted that other financing costs, like the rate on three-month Euro-dollar deposits, have not fallen as rapidly as the Federal funds rate.
Aside from an economic outlook that remains fundamentally positive for the bond market, in the near term recent developments in Eastern Europe in general and East Germany in particular could provide further support.
''As a result of what appears to be historic developments in Europe, over the next couple of weeks we will see more money gravitating to the United States,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in analysis and comment on the bond and foreign exchange markets.
''In the near term there will be confusion and uncertainty,'' as a result of the political upheaval in Eastern Europe, Mr. McCarthy said. ''In those sorts of situations, the dollar becomes a magnet.''
Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International, said that in comparison with other capital markets, ''interest-sensitive instruments are performing best in the United States.
''With the dollar remaining quite stable, we are going to see a lot of money pouring into this country,'' he said.
The influx of East German refugees into West Germany may provide some short-term stimulus to the dollar, but the longer-range implications of recent developments could reverse that move.
''Over the next few months, the effect of large unrestrained inflows of East Germans means more aggregate demand and more rapid growth in West Germany,'' said Charles Taylor, an international economist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''To meet this higher aggregate demand, look for higher West German interest rates and a correspondingly higher Deutsche mark.''
The relative attractiveness of America's fixed-income market will be tested at Treasury auctions today and tomorrow, when the Government is expected to sell a total of $20 billion worth of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
In recent years strong foreign demand for these securities has been seen as a necessary prerequisite for successful auctions.

HEADLINE: Argentine Chief Clashes With Labor

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Saying he is prepared to face ''a thousand strikes'' to rebuild the Argentine economy, President Carlos Saul Menem has entangled himself in a growing dispute with organized labor, the traditional backbone of his Peronist party.
Job actions are spreading across the country. Public-transportation drivers today ended a weeklong strike in Buenos Aires and other major cities; the metal workers' union says it plans sporadic stoppages for the next two weeks, and a number of other unions are seeking wage settlements that go far beyond Government guidelines.
Finally, Saul Ubaldini, whom Mr. Menem has ousted as the head of the General Labor Confederation, is refusing to vacate the union headquarters, and his organization appears more likely than any other political group to assume the leadership of the political opposition. Mr. Ubaldini is a member of the President's party, officially called the Justicialist Party. 
 
Behind the Dispute
The confrontation is a result of Mr. Menem's commitment to restructure or sell off inefficient and deficit-ridden state companies, to promote exports and to hold down inflation. He is also burdened by $64 billion in foreign debt. No interest on the debt has been paid to creditors for nearly two years.
After rising to a monthly rate of almost 200 percent in July, inflation has tumbled dramatically, hitting 5.9 percent for October.
But the relative success in fighting inflation is based on wage and price guidelines negotiated with business leaders shortly after Mr. Menem took office in July. They are intended to bring stability while the Government tries to rouse the economy by letting state-owned companies go private and creating a more efficient tax-collection system.
The Government has set a guideline of 15 percent for wage increases for the period from October through the end of the year. But it has said it will permit larger wage increases in the private sector as long as business leaders, including the owners of the bus lines, do not raise prices to cover the new costs.
Implicit in this policy is the hope that privately owned industry, faced with Government roadblocks to higher prices, will increase output to meet wage demands. There is also the issue of whether business owners will be forced to give up some of their profit margins, which are believed to be much higher here than in the United States, Japan or Western Europe.
The bus strike took riders and the Government by surprise when it began on Nov. 6. The strike snarled Buenos Aires and many provincial capitals for part of last week, but by the end of the week about half the buses were back on the streets, with the owners or their family members at the wheel. Today, public transportation appeared almost normal.
 
What the Drivers Earn
Striking bus drivers were receiving a basic monthly wage of 36,000 australs, or about $55, until October. They asked for an increase to 88,000 australs. After several rounds of bargaining last week, ordered by the Government, the owners raised their offer to 80,000 australs, but the drivers rejected that. Business leaders say the actual wages of bus drivers are two or three times the basic wage, the result of overtime and off-the-books payments, a common practice to avoid taxes.
Although Mr. Ubaldini, the secretary general of the General Labor Federation, was an important figure in Mr. Menem's election campaign, it became apparent soon after the new President took office that the two would have differences over Mr. Menem's plan to turn aside the Peronist tradition by which the state responds affirmatively to most labor demands.
Convinced that Mr. Ubaldini intended to block his economic plans, Mr. Menem first offered the labor leader a diplomatic post abroad, which he rejected.
Then Mr. Menem created a ''liaison board'' of leaders of the General Labor Federation favorable to his ideas, a group made up largely of leaders of unions in private enterprise and led by Guerino Andreoni of the shopworkers' union. Eventually, that group forced new elections for secretary general of the federation and Mr. Andreoni won after the Ubaldini group boycotted the vote.
Mr. Ubaldini and his aides, however, have continued to occupy the C.G.T. headquarters.
''This is the workers' house,'' he said on Friday. ''This is their leadership, and we're not leaving here.''

HEADLINE: New Lebanese President Names Premier

BYLINE: By ALI JABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Nov. 13

 BODY:
President Rene Moawad appointed a centrist Muslim with long experience in Lebanese politics as Prime Minister today and asked him to form a Cabinet.
The new Prime Minister is Selim al-Hoss, an American-trained economist and advocate of Christian-Muslim co-existence who assumed the role of head of government in 1987 and continued to act as Prime Minister during the last year in a Muslim Government that existed in competition with a Christian government led by Gen. Michel Aoun. Mr. Hoss had also served in two previous Governments, and his appointment had been rumored for several days.
Mr. Hoss resigned as Prime Minister Nov. 5, when members of the Lebanese Parliament elected Mr. Moawad as President under a revised Constitution. The charter, which was drawn up with Arab League approval, is designed to reunite Christians and Muslims under one government by redrawing the power balance between them. It increases the relative power of Muslims to take account of changes in the population since 1943, when the previous Constitution was adopted. 
 
The Leaders Meet
General Aoun and his followers have resisted the new arrangement, but some important elements of the Christian community support it, as do Lebanon's Muslims, Syria and the United States.
After the appointment of Mr. Hoss as Prime Minister, President Moawad, a Maronite Catholic, and Mr. Hoss, a Sunni Muslim, met with Hussein Husseini, the Speaker of Parliament and a Shiite Muslim. Under the Constitution, the three top Lebanese posts are held by representatives of the three dominant religious groups in the country.
Officials close to the Prime Minister said he would seek a Cabinet with 28 ministers, six of whom would represent Lebanon's militias and have no portfolios. The rest would be specialists in areas like the economy and education, or be chosen from Parliament.
The appointment of Mr. Hoss was immediately challenged by General Aoun, who commands the main Christian forces in Lebanon and remains the leader of a rival military cabinet. General Aoun and many of the Christians who dominate in East Beirut oppose Mr. Moawad because he supports a Syrian military role in helping to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
The appointment of Mr. Hoss ''would not change anything since the process from the start was unconstitutional,'' the general said today. General Aoun has dismissed the election of Mr. Moawad as illegal and declared Parliament dissolved. He had accused Parliament of compromising Lebanese sovereignty after its remaining members signed the Arab League-sponsored peace accord in Saudi Arabia last month. The accord rested on Syrian promises to redeploy the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, but did not contain a timetable for their withdrawal.
Today's appointment marked the fourth time that Mr. Hoss has been chosen for the Prime Minister's post since 1976, when he was named to head a Government that tried to rebuild Lebanon after the first two years of civil war.
He has been serving as acting Prime Minister since Rashid Karami was assassinated in the post in June 1987, and he continued in that role last September when an interim Muslim government was formed in competition with General Aoun's Christian cabinet.
Mr. Hoss, who is 60 years old, received a doctorate in economics from Indiana University.
 
U.S. Ambassador May Visit
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (Reuters) -The United States is considering sending its Ambassador back to Lebanon for a brief visit to present his credentials to President Moawad, Administration officials said today.
The Ambassador, John McCarthy, and his staff left Beirut in early September after anti-American protests outside the United States Embassy in East Beirut. The officials want to arrange the trip to show support for the new leader. They declined to discuss a date, citing security reasons.

HEADLINE: A Puzzle for Zimbabwe: Too Many Elephants

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Elephant hunting is a big business in this debt-ridden southern African country, a sport indulged in by wealthy Americans able to spend as much as $30,000 for a three-week outing in the bush.
But the popularity of big-game hunting among Americans has left the Bush Administration in an awkward position. On the one hand the United States has strongly supported international efforts to ban the ivory trade, which leads to the devastating poaching of elephants. On the other hand, the Administration has gone on record as backing the stalking of elephants for sport, a pastime popular among well-to-do Americans who covet whole elephant tusks as trophies. 
The contradictory American approach has led to wildlife efforts that seem to be at odds. Although Washington supports international efforts to ban the ivory trade, the United States Agency for International Development recently awarded Zimbabwe and two neighboring countries an $18 million grant for wildlife management that encourages controlled elephant hunting.
Zimbabwe is rich in elephants, and the animals often wreak havoc on fragile arable lands. The country now finds that the enthusiasm in the United States for an international ban on the ivory trade, passed last month at a meeting in Switzerland, is likely to mean the end of Americans coming here on expensive safaris. The safaris helped the Government profit from the necessary culling of elephant herds.
Under Congressional legislation enacted last year and intended to preserve the African elephant, the importing of elephant tusks as trophies was banned except under quotas established by the Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species, which met in Switzerland last month.
But the importing of whole tusks as trophies was banned at the Switzerland meeting, along with imports of ivory for use in jewelry, daggers and carvings. The United States delegation at the meeting stressed the Bush Administration's support for big-game hunting and initially said the ivory ban would not affect hunting for trophies.
After the passage of the ivory ban and the abolition of the trophy quotas, the head of the American delegation, Constance Harriman, Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife in the Department of Interior, tried to get a new set of quotas on tusks enacted. She was rebuffed by other countries, who said it was unreasonable for the United States to favor an ivory ban and also support the importing of tusks as trophies.
For Zimbabwe, the ban on ivory and the United States law forbidding the importing of elephant trophies is a setback to wildlife conservation programs that experts say could be a model for Africa. Unlike many countries in eastern Africa and some in the southern region, where elephants have nearly been killed off by poachers, Zimbabwe has flourishing elephant herds.
 
Safaris Are Very Profitable
Hunting safaris bring in $15 million to Zimbabwe each year, and the sale of tusks from culled elephants brings $1 million more, said Dr. Rowan Martin, deputy director of the Wildlife Department here. Under the Zimbabwean conservation program, which the $18 million A.I.D. grant is supposed to encourage, the country is urging poor farmers to regard elephants and other wildlife as assets rather than as nuisances that trample crops.
With this in mind, farmers in areas with wildlife-conservation programs share in the revenue from safaris as well as in the sale of ivory from culled elephants. In some regions, farmers have set aside parts of their communal farming land to sports hunting because it is more profitable than grain.
''From a conservation point of view, the ivory ban and the hunting legislation is a disaster,'' said Dr. Martin. ''In Africa we want to have a high value on our natural resource of wildlife.''
Dr. Martin said the Government would continue to give export permits to hunters who want to stalk elephants here. ''We're not going to help the United States enforce its law, because we think it is a ridiculous law,'' he said.
Hunters could either try to get their trophies in illegally or leave them in Zimbabwe until the United States legislation is revised, he said.

HEADLINE: MILITARY SPENDING BY SOVIETS SLOWS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
United States Government analysts have concluded that the Soviet Union cut military spending in 1989, as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised, officials said today.
Some Administration officials, among them Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, have acknowledged in recent weeks that the Soviets have made cuts in the production of conventional weapons, including tanks.
But until now no one in the Administration has stated publicly that overall Soviet military spending for this year will take up a smaller share of the country's gross national product than it did in 1988. The analysts interviewed today say that is in fact the case. 
The analysts making the estimates declined to be identified, but they are among the most authoritative specialists on Soviet military power in the Government.
''We can't tell you the exact amount yet,'' one of the analysts said in an interview. ''But we can confirm that the trend is down and it will involve a reduction in defense spending in real terms.''
 
Final Estimate Due in April
The analysts who reached this conclusion work for Government agencies that monitor internal Soviet developments. Their analysis will form the basis of the annual report on the Soviet economy that the Administration provides each year to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
The final estimate of Soviet military spending in 1989 will be provided to the committee around April 1990.
In April, the Joint Economic Committee was informed by Government intelligence experts that Soviet military spending in 1988 was about 15 percent to 17 percent of the Soviet G.N.P., the total value of goods and services produced by the Soviet Union. That constituted a slight increase in military spending from a year earlier.
Although they do not have final figures for 1989, the analysts suggested that their estimate of Soviet military spending as a percentage of the Soviet G.N.P. would slip to between 14 percent and 16 percent.
 
A 'Real Reduction'
Since they also estimate that Soviet G.N.P. for 1989 will be roughly the same as it was in 1988, or perhaps slightly higher, the analysts say this will mean a ''real reduction'' in Soviet military spending. About 50 percent of the Soviet spending goes to manpower, and the rest to new weapons and maintenance.
Because of the difficulties in assigning a real dollar value to the Soviet ruble and other anomalies of the Soviet economy, the analysts declined to put an exact dollar value on the amount of the projected cutbacks.
The C.I.A. estimated in 1988 that Soviet military spending amounted to about $300 billion.
In its annual report to Congress, the Pentagon said that American military spending in recent years had accounted for about 6 percent of the G.N.P. of the United States. ''Up to now Government officials have only hinted at the possibility that total Soviet defense spending may actually be down for 1989,'' said Richard F. Kaufman, a Soviet expert with the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ''It is interesting that what they have seen in the first 10 months of the year is a strong enough trend for them to conclude that spending will be down for the year.''
 
Revision Is Likely
Even after the official estimate is provided to the Joint Economic Committee in April for the prior year's defense spending, it is often revised upward or downward in the next year or two as more information about the Soviet economy becomes available, Mr. Kaufman said.
As the estimates by analysts for 1989 are completed and are fully distributed throughout the Bush Administration in coming months it will undoubtedly influence the debate about how the United States should respond to Mr. Gorbachev.
Only last week, Vice President Dan Quayle said in an interview with NBC News that Soviet ''military spending, contrary to all these statements that are going on in the Soviet Union over the last four years, has increased.''
''The United States has decreased its military spending, not the Soviet Union,'' he said.
The Vice President's spokesman, David Beckwith, said that Mr. Quayle was referring to the last four years as a whole.
''In 1988 our estimate was that defense spending was growing in the Soviet Union,'' the analyst said. ''What we are seeing in 1989 are actual reductions. They seem to be serious. They have gotten themselves into a terrible economic bind. We can't put an exact number yet on 1989, but we can clearly see the trend.''
''I would expect something like this,'' said Abraham S. Becker, director of the Rand Corporation-U.C.L.A. Center for Soviet Studies, and an expert on the Soviet economy. ''Their G.N.P. was clearly having extraordinary difficulties, so the estimate of virtually no growth is reasonable. At the same time, there is also good evidence they are reducing military expenditures, so we should expect a drop in both actual military expenditures and its ratio to G.N.P.''
The latest official United States Government statement on total Soviet military spending for 1989 came in September, when the Pentagon published its annual report, called ''Soviet Military Power.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East: Legacy of Yalta and Potsdam;
Cold War Sealed Germany's Division

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
When the war in Europe ended with Nazi Germany's surrender in May 1945, the victorious Americans, British, French and Soviets did not envision the permanent division of Germany and Berlin.
These long-term divisions occurred as the United States and its allies squared off against the Soviet Union and its allies in the postwar confrontation that became known as the cold war.
Yet the divisions had their roots in decisions made during the war and just afterward, when, as Norman J. G. Pounds, an Indiana University professor of geography, once put it, ''the development of the cold war was only vaguely sensed, and the division of Germany was not expected to last more than a very few years.''
 
Zones of Occupation
At the Teheran conference in December 1943, Allied leaders discussed dividing Germany into separate occupation zones with Berlin, in the words of British planners, ''a separate joint zone, occupied by each of the three major allies'' - Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. France was later included in the arrangement. 
The subject came up again at the Allies' Quebec conference in September 1944, and there, as Churchill later observed, ''the occupational zones were decided rather hastily.''
The following February, the Allied leaders agreed on various aspects of postwar Germany at the Yalta conference, held in the Soviet Ukraine. They put these agreements into effect at the Potsdam conference in July and August 1945 on the outskirts of Berlin.
There, they gave the main governmental authority in the four zones to the Allied commanders for each zone. They also set up a four-power Allied Control Council for questions involving Germany as a whole, and they divided Berlin into four sectors. In addition, they agreed that parts of prewar Germany lying east of the Soviet zone were to be split off and placed under Polish or Soviet control.
 
The Hostility Deepens
Despite the measure of unity achieved at Potsdam, as time passed, suspicion, rivalry and hostility grew between the Western Allies and the Russians. The cleavage also deepened, step by step, between the Western zones and the Soviet zone until the two sides became separate, independent German nations with membership in opposing military alliances - and with separate armies.
An early development in this process came when the Allied Control Council, composed of the commanders of the four occupying armies, worked poorly. The council essentially went out of operation when the Soviets informally withdrew from it in 1948. Similarly, they withdrew from the Kommandatura, a four-power body responsible for governing Berlin. The city's Western sectors came to be essentially unified.
In 1948, the Soviets gradually imposed a blockade on West Berlin, and by August, travel and transportation by land and water between the city and West Germany was cut off. Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the military governor of the American zone, saw the blockade as a power play and pressed the view that it was crucial for the Americans to remain in West Berlin.
He told the Pentagon, as he recalled in his memoirs: ''If we withdraw, our position in Europe is threatened. If America does not understand this now, then Communism will run rampant.'' But the Soviets later asserted that they had mounted the blockade merely to keep a currency reform in western Germany from harming their zone's economy.
 
Berlin Airlift Succeeds
The blockade went on until May 1949. The Allies, with the United States in the lead, mounted the Berlin airlift - sending food and other supplies to the beleaguered West Berliners on relays of aircraft from June 1948 until September 1949.
In that year, with West Berlin unbowed, East Berlin was designated as the capital of the newly created East German nation, the German Democratic Republic.
Afterward, West Berlin formally became one of the states of the new West German nation - the Federal Republic of Germany, which was established in 1949 after a single government had been set up the previous year for the American, French and British occupation zones.
The Western occupation ended, and in 1955 West Germany was acknowledged as a sovereign state and became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In the same year, a sovereign East Germany became a member of the Warsaw Pact.
 
Sharp Economic Differences
With the passage of years, the standard of living in West Berlin and West Germany became so clearly superior to that in the East that East German refugees poured across the still-open boundary between East and West Berlin. The East Germans had earlier taken steps to curb westward emigration across their border.
A continuing exodus through Berlin - largely of productive, younger East Germans - was humiliating and economically costly to the East German Government.
Finally, in August 1961, its police virtually sealed the border between East and West Berlin, and East Germany began the construction of what became a guarded, concrete-and-barbed-wire border wall stretching for almost 30 miles between the eastern and western parts of the city.
The Allies complained but took only limited countermeasures, notably the sending of American tanks in a tense but temporary face-off with Soviet armor at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin.
Eventually the tension abated, and over the years, various East-West transit agreements were reached for both Germanys and for Berlin. Eventually too, in 1973, the two Germanys acquired separate seats at the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East: The European Community;
West Europe Is Called Open To Trade With East Germany

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAKONE, Japan, Nov. 13

 BODY:
A leading trade official of the European Community said today that Western European nations were ''prepared to offer comprehensive agreements on commerce and economic cooperation'' to East Germany in the coming weeks.
Frans Andriessen of the Netherlands, a vice president of the European Community's executive body, left open the possibility that East Germany could apply for membership, saying that ''nothing can be excluded at this point.'' But he said such talk was ''still quite premature.'' 
''That is not the agenda right now,'' said Mr. Andriessen, who is directing the plans of the community for economic integration in 1992. ''The agenda is whether East Germany can continue to foster democracy and economic reform. And the first step is free elections.''
His comments came during an informal annual meeting with the trade ministers of the United States, Canada and Japan at this mountain resort.
 
A Possible Reordering
The main purpose of the meeting is to negotiate changes in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT. But the ministers also took the opportunity to discuss a possible reordering of East-West trade relations and economic cooperation in view of the events in Berlin.
The United States is being represented at the talks in Japan by Carla A. Hills, Washington's Special Trade Representative.
Mr. Andriessen did not say what kind of economic aid the community was prepared to offer East Germany, which is trying to invigorate its economy and slow the flood of workers across its newly opened border. He is expected to provide additional details on Wednesday during a speech in Tokyo.
East Germany is a member of Comecon, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which groups the Eastern European and Soviet economies.
 
'Huge Burden' on West Germany
Meeting with reporters today, Mr. Andriessen said it would take the European Community years to absorb the hundreds of thousands of people who have flowed across the borders to West Germany this year.
''This enormous amount of people moving at once creates problems on both sides,'' he said, with East Germany facing a labor shortage and West Germany struggling to create jobs. ''Many of them are not skilled people, so this could place a huge burden on West Germany,'' he said.
While West Germany has a strong demand for skilled labor, economists have expressed fears that the new emigres will find no place to work or live, and severely strain the country's welfare and taxation system. Mr. Andriessen stopped short of suggesting that East Germans think twice before resettling.
''It would be useful if the situation in East Germany became such that no one felt they needed to leave,'' he said. ''But it is another thing for use to recommend what they should do.''
Mr. Andriessen said he planned a trip to East Germany before the end of the year to discuss aid and expand a ''low-key commercial agreement'' with East Germany. ''It might be possible that they want an agreement of a wider scope,'' he said.

Lech Walesa arrived in Washington tonight on his first visit to the United States, looking for funds and support to help build a Poland that he hopes will become ''the America of the East.''
President Bush welcomed Mr. Walesa at the White House, bestowing the Medal of Freedom on the Solidarity leader who led a movement for change that helped displace a Communist government for the first time in Eastern Europe.
In a ceremony tonight in the East Room, before Congressional leaders and Polish-American guests and labor leaders, President Bush hailed Mr. Walesa as ''the spiritural godfather of a new generation of democracy.''
 
Symbol of 'a Lost Era'
''You were called a 'nobody,' '' the President said. ''But Lenin and Stalin have been disproved, not by presidents or princes but by the likes of an electrician from Gdansk and his fellow workers in a brave union called Solidarity. The Iron Curtain is fast becoming a rusted, aboandoned relic, symbolizing a lost era, a failed ideology.'' 
Visiting as East Germans continued to pour throught the newly opened Berlin wall and as yearnings for democracy change Eastern Europe, the Polish labor leader was expected to receive an enthusiastic reception on visits to Washington, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia this week and to Caracas, Venezuela, on Monday.
The President and Mrs. Bush plan to host a small private dinner for Mr. Walesa Tuesday night.
Mr. Walesa was scheduled to speak Tuesday at the AFL-CIO convention and Wednesday at a joint session of Congress. He will be only the second foreign visitor without an official government position to address the legislators. The Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who helped the United States win the American Revolution, spoke at a joint session in 1824.
As Solidarity has changed into a powerful political party, Mr. Walesa has chosen to remain the power behind the throne, supporting the goverment run by his former adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
 
'Attachments to Freedom'
Hailing the changes that are electrifying Eastern Europe, the President said that some had wondered in the years since World War II ''why we stayed in Berlin.''
''We stayed because we knew,'' he said, ''we just knew, all America, that this day would come.''
Mr. Walesa appeared to be fighting back tears tonight as he listened to Mr. Bush. When it was his turn, he spoke in a strong, happy voice wearing his medal on a ribbon around his neck and standing on a stool provided by the President so that the short, stocky electrician could have stand higher behind the lectern.
He said that, in finally coming to meet his American friends, ''one of the greatest dreams of my life has thus been fulfilled.''
He said that he admired America ''not because it is big or powerful or rich, although you could envy that,'' but because Americans had created a nation of democratic institutions and ''human attachments to freedom.'' $591 Million in Aid Proposed Congress is trying to give Mr. Walesa some, if not all, of the money he wants for his country. On Tuesday, the Senate is expected to consider a foreign aid bill that would provide about $591 million over three years in various forms of aid designed to promote democracy, private enterprise and the development of a free-market economy in Poland.
The legislation has been stalled for several weeks in the Senate, because of wrangling over how much money is appropriate and because of an attempt by Republican Senators to attach Mr. Bush's proposed reduction in the capital gains tax to the measure. Once the Senate approves its version of the bill the leaders of both houses hope to act quickly on a compromise version so the final package can be in place before Congress adjourns later this month.
Even if the legislation is approved, however, another measure that actually allocates the aid money faces the possibility of a Presidential veto. Mr. Bush has said he would veto the bill if Congress passes the current version, which includes money for the United Nations Fund for Population Activity, which the Administration contends is participating in the management of a program in China that involves coercive abortions. Congressional and White House officials are looking for a compromise.
 
Canadian Efforts Criticized
OTTAWA, Nov. 13 (Reuters) - Mr. Walesa sharply criticized Canadian aid efforts today as too little and too late.
''What Canada is proposing right now would be similar to giving a corpse a beautiful new tie,'' Mr. Walesa told a parliamentary committee on the last day of a three-day visit to Canada.
Last month Canada announced $36 million in new aid to Poland and Hungary and the establishment of a development fund.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney met Mr. Walesa for about half an hour, then pledged further steps, including a rescheduling of repayment terms on Canada's loans to Poland.

HEADLINE: 'Unpopular Measures' Urged for Soviet Economy

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Warning that consumers' trust is ''running dry'' and that the economy is in danger of ''a creeping return backward,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chief economic adviser called today for adopting ''strict and unpopular measures'' to invigorate the country's fledgling economic restructuring program.
At the opening session of a three-day conference on radical economic reform, the adviser, Deputy Prime Minister Leonid A. Abalkin, told top officials of the government and Communist Party and the country's leading economists that Mr. Gorbachev's program of perestroika was doomed unless officials devised a comprehensive and doubtlessly painful strategy for putting it into practice.
''Without instituting strict and unpopular measures, we will be thrown back,'' Mr. Abalkin said. Many people have wonderful ideas about a healthy Soviet economy, he said, but ''nobody knows how to get from our current situation to this beautiful picture.'' 
The high-level gathering, attended by Mr. Gorbachev and other members of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, takes place against a dire economic backdrop, with industrial growth mired at 1 percent for the third quarter of this year, the value of the ruble dropping on both the official and black markets and consumers increasingly pessimistic about the government's ability to change the situation.
The conference is an attempt by the leadership to form a consensus among the country's officials and economists on the direction and methods needed to ''jump start'' the perestroika program, which has been foundering since it was approved by the Communist Party at a plenum in June 1987.
But serious disagreement among the participants was apparent from the start. Some of those present in the Grand Hall of Columns attacked Mr. Abalkin's proposals as being either too radical or too insipid.
 
Stock Market Foreseen
The plan includes diverse forms of property and ownership, using the market as the main mechanism for regulating the economy, loosening price controls and introducing partial convertibility of the ruble.
It also foresees the establishment of a stock market, anti-monopoly laws and the conversion of the state-controlled economy to a mixture of state-run industries, publicly owned enterprises and private cooperatives, all to be implemented within six years.
Abel G. Aganbegyan, a senior government economic adviser and a deputy chairman of the conference, said the leadership was being too overprotective of the population and too willing to soften the blows that fundamental restructuring demands. ''Urgent measures are those which are felt by the people,'' Mr. Agenbegyan said. ''Those with no effect, only existing on paper, are not real measures.''
Ed Hewitt, an American expert on the Soviet economy, said that if the plan as drafted was implemented within the designated six-year period it had a ''decent chance'' for success.
''They spent these past few years learning by doing and learning by crashing,'' Mr. Hewitt said at a break in the session, which was broadcast on closed-circuit television to journalists at the Foreign Ministry press center.
The thorniest issues being debated at the conference, and in general in the Soviet press and in the new Soviet legislature, are price reform and private property.
Mr. Gorbachev and many economists have argued about the need to do away with artificial price controls, but their efforts have been stymied by public opposition. This month, the Soviet legislature rejected a proposal to raise prices on luxury items like cigarettes, caviar and beer, saying it would hurt too many people.
And while the program calls for ''diversity of the forms of property'' as a ''fundamental condition for the economic freedom of citizens, the proposal has many opponents. An article on Sunday in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, laying out proposals for a new party code, suggests that party members who support private property would do well to ''belong to some other organization.''

HEADLINE: Tidioute Journal;
An Answer To Prayer In Water Made Pure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TIDIOUTE, Pa.

 BODY:
This picturebook borough, with its white church steeples and suspension bridge across the Allegheny River here in the northwest corner of state, never quite recovered from the Great Depression that wiped out its oil and timber industries.
When the community's water became contaminated in 1987, many residents were ready to give up on the place and move on. But the story has a happy ending, or at least a prayer for one.
''When the water became contaminated, it was the last straw,'' said Sara Davis, a member of the borough's business development association. ''We all considered wearing T-shirts saying, 'Last one out of Tidioute, turn out the lights.' '' 
In recent years, fires took a third of the storefronts on Main Street, a tornado wrecked many houses and many young people moved away to find work. The population of Tidioute (pronounced tidTID-ee-oot) became predominately elderly and poor.
Then, on the Christmas Eve of 1987, state officials found that the stream supplying Tidioute's 840 residents with water was contaminated with Giardia lamblia, an organism causing severe intestinal illness. The village could not afford to upgrade its water-treatment plant - a tank of chlorine in a dilapidated shed - and banks became reluctant to write new mortgages. Real estate prices sagged.
The hero of the story is a state program with an unromantic name -the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority, or Pennvest. The agency solved Tidioute's problems by subsidizing the cost of a $485,000 water filtration system, which is to begin operation this month. When it does, residents will no longer have to boil their tap water.
Pennvest provides local governments with up to $500,000 in low-interest loans and grants for projects involving drinking water or waste water improvements. Launched with $1 billion raised by bond sales last year, Pennvest is designed to subsidize up to 1,500 projects over the next 25 years. So far, $357 million has been spent on 218 projects.
The drinking water part of the program is designed to help small systems comply with Federal standards, in particular one requiring water authorities to filter all surface water supplies to remove disease-causing microorganisms. Pennsylvania has more than 2,100 small water systems, and the state relies on surface water more than any other in the nation. Pennsylvania has also led the nation in the number of waterborne disease outbreaks, reporting 28,760 cases from 1971 to 1985, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control.
''It knocked my block off that this state led the nation in waterborne diseases,'' said Gov. Robert P. Casey. ''I felt we needed to clean up our water for health and safety, but also as a tool for economic development.''
Across the nation, there are thousands of small communities like Tidioute. Community water systems that each serve fewer than 3,300 people now account for 92 percent of all Federal regulatory violations, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But communities have not been pressed to toe the line on regulaations because state and Federal agencies say they lack the resources for enforcement. Of the 97,000 violations issued by the Federal agency last year, enforcement actions were taken by Federal and state agencies in only 2,450 cases. The Federal agency maintains that most violations involve lapses in paper work and water-quality monitoring.
But the National Wildlife Federation plans to sue the Federal agency to make it enforce its regulations. About 13 million people drank water last year that the Government considered unsafe, said Norman L. Dean, a federation spokesman.
Without programs like Pennvest, small communities across the nation will be hard pressed to comply with existing water standards, said Arnie Edelman, the environmental program adviser with the National Association of Towns and Townships, a lobbying organization. So far, only a dozen states have any program comparable to Pennsylvania's.
In Tidioute, meanwhile, the residents are counting their blessings. At a recent banquet that celebrated the completion of their new water purification system, Dana Bierer, a local developer, said this grace: ''Thank you, Father, for the water project. We pray that it will work.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 14 headed ''Tidioute Journal,'' about a Pennsylvania town that overcame water pollution problems, understated the sum made available by the state to improve drinking water and waste systems. A state agency, Pennvest, offers grants of up to $500,000 a community and loans of up to $10 million or in some cases more.

HEADLINE: Enough Foot Dragging on a Rail Link Vital to New York City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 27 editorial supporting completion of the Oak Point link, a railroad trestle connecting rail lines to a planned rail freight terminal at the Harlem River yard in the South Bronx, is right. Completing this long-planned project would save New York City businesses more than $100 million a year in transportation costs and dramatically reduce traffic congestion and air pollution by removing hundreds of thousands of truck trips from New York City streets. Taking freight traffic off city streets and putting it on railroad cars is vital to the city's economic and physical health. It is unfortunate that this project is on the point of abandonment. 
You are incorrect, however, in blaming the New York State Legislature. The Legislature appropriated funds for the link, and even added language to the fiscal year 1988-89 budget declaring the link the ''highest state priority'' and prohibiting the State Department of Transportation from spending funds to study abandoning it. Unfortunately, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo vetoed this language.
It is the Department of Transportation that first stalled the link for years and then, after having paid a private contractor $45 million for work on the link, decided the work had been done incorrectly, released the contractor from its obligations and halted all further work. Now, after having wasted $45 million, the department says it does not have enough money to complete the link and is looking for alternative limited uses for the Harlem River yard without completion of the link.
The public is entitled to expeditious completion of the link and to an explanation of how $45 million was expended to no purpose. All we have been told so far is that ''an engineering mistake was discovered.'' We need to know who was responsible for the ''mistake.'' Either the $45 million should be recovered from the contractor, or some senior Department of Transportation officials should be held publicly accountable.
The history of the Oak Point link is one of ineptitude and foot dragging. A vital project that should have been completed in 1982 is at a standstill seven years later, $45 million has been wasted, and the Transportation Department proposes to cover up this sordid history by abandoning the entire project. The department should be reminded of its responsibilities, the project should be completed, and those responsible for the delays and the waste of money should be held to account.

HEADLINE: A Judge Delays Rules On Tenant Succession

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 13

 BODY:
A state judge today issued a temporary order preventing the state's housing agency from enforcing new rules that would give unrelated people the right of succession in rent-stabilized apartments.
The rules were issued last week, and were to take effect immediately. The order issued today by a State Supreme Court justice in Albany prevents them from taking effect until at least Nov. 28.
The order was a result of a lawsuit brought by a landlords' group, the Rent Stabilization Association.
The rules were adopted by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal in response to a decision by the state's highest court earlier this year that extended the right of succession to nontraditional family members in rent-controlled apartments.
The rules extended those rights to people in almost one million rent-stabilized apartments, mainly in New York City.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Commissioner Reassigned In Aftermath of Agency Scandals

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has shifted Food and Drug Commissioner Frank E. Young to a less influential job created for him at the Department of Health and Human Services.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the department's Secretary, in announcing the shift today, cited no reasons for the change. But Dr. James O. Mason, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Dr. Young's immediate supervisor, said he asked the commissioner to leave his position and to accept the new job, citing a variety of reasons, including discovery of corruption in the agency's regulation of generic drugs..
Dr. Young's five-and-a-half-year tenure at the Food and Drug Administration, which has suffered budget and personnel cuts over the last decade, has been praised by industry for a more cooperative attitude about regulation and the streamlining of the approval process for life-saving drugs. But he was also criticized by Congressional leaders and consumer groups for the looser regulatory approach that they contend led to some of the agency's problems. 
 
A Slow Response to AIDS
Among those are a slow response to the AIDS epidemic, Dr. Young's temporary and costly halt of imported Chilean fruit after discovery of two cyanide-laced grapes, the scandal over corruption in approval of generic drugs, the proliferation of misleading health claims on food packages and the newly emerging controversy over deaths and injuries from medical devices.
In announcing the move, Dr. Sullivan emphasized Dr. Young's acceptance of his new post of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health for health science and environment. ''Frank Young is a man of great intelligence,'' Dr. Sullivan said. ''His scientific credentials are impressive. I know that he will apply his skills as tirelessly in his new position as he did as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.''
Dr. Young would not comment on the reasons for the shift. ''Looking back is never a good idea,'' he said in an interview tonight. ''For a variety of reasons, change is appropriate now.''
 
Oversees Quarter of Economy
The agency now regulates one quarter of the nation's consumer economy, according to some estimates, but has had fewer resources to handle increasing responsibilities. In 1979 the agency had about 8,100 employees, compared with the current 7,500, despite the added burden of AIDS and other work. The budget grew little. Dr. Young's tenure has been called a transitional one in which the agency shifted from an adversial stance toward industry to a ''partnership'' with industry.
This deregulatory approach earned him praise from industry and from others like some AIDS activists who benefited from the speedier approval of drugs.
Critics, however, have said the looser regulatory approach has led to a series of regulatory catastrophes, from the proliferation of misleading health claims on food packages to the recent revelations that at least three agency officials took bribes from generic drug manufacturers, that two generic drug manufacturers submitted false data to the agency, and that manufacturing and record-keeping problems existed at a dozen generic drug companies the F.D.A. investigated.
Dr. Mason said Dr. Young's major achievement in his years at the agency was overseeing the move to a quicker approval of life-saving drugs. The average approval time for such drugs has dropped from 7.1 years before Dr. Young's tenure to 4.7 years.
AIDS activists have said that while they do not believe Dr. Young acted quickly enough to get drugs to those dying of AIDS, they do credit him with responding to their criticism. ''I have no doubt that he believed he was changing the agency attitude from one in which it tried to save people from harming themselves to one allowing dying people to take some of the risk themselves,'' said Jim Eigo of the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.
Dr. James Wyngaarden, nominated to be associate director for health sciences in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said Dr. Young ''has done a spectacular job, taking on larger and larger responsibilities while his resources were going down.
''He gave the job real stability after there had been great turnover,'' Dr. Wyngaarden said, ''and he showed a real willingness to tackle hard issues.''
 
Reagan Administration Blamed
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was one of those chiefly responsible for pressing the investigation of the generic-drug scandal. ''Frank Young had the misfortune to preside at the F.D.A. during a time when it was virtually guaranteed that rogues and knaves would prosper,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''His intentions were good and he did his best when problems were brought to light. But he was handicapped by both the budgets and attitudes of an Administration that let the agency go to seed.''
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the consumer activist Public Citizen Health Research Group called Young ''the worst F.D.A. commissioner'' in the 18 years that Dr. Wolfe's group has monitored the agency. He cited Dr. Young's failure to ban unpasteurized milk, which a court later forced the agency to do, and his belated requirement forcing aspirin manufacturers to warn consumers that taking aspirin during some illnesses has been linked to the rare but fatal Reye's syndrome.
Federal officials said Dr. Young would leave the agency Dec. 18 and soon thereafter would be replaced by an interim commissioner. No names have been mentioned publicly for the job, but one Federal official said a leading contender is Dr. Burton J. Lee, the President's personal physician.

HEADLINE: Governments Start Preparing for Global Warming Disasters

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN the quickening international debate over global warming, the spotlight has played mostly on the question of how and whether to control the growing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.
Now another concern is starting to come to the fore as well. No matter what action is taken, some scientists say, there are already enough of these ''greenhouse'' gases in the atmosphere to cause a major warming, and more are certain to accumulate before the buildup can be halted.
As a result, climatologists, social scientists, planners and government officials are beginning to focus on how society might adapt to rising sea levels, shifting agricultural zones, changing climates and other problems that global warming would bring if it occurs on a significant scale.
Already, state and local governments along the coast of the United States are starting to plan for a possible long-term rise in the sea level, and a few have taken action to cope with it. In the Netherlands, planning is well advanced for an expansion of that country's system of dikes, dunes and other coastal defenses, and the Dutch are also offering their expertise to Indonesia and the Maldives. 
Agricultural researchers are stepping up efforts to develop heat-resistant and drought-resistant crops that might gradually replace traditional crops if the climate changes.
And the electric power industry in America is planning how to meet the increase in the demand for power for air-conditioning that would surely result from global warming. In one of the first studies, the Electric Power Research Institute has calculated that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit in climatic warming, power demand in the summer would rise 2 to 3 percent in the New York metropolitan area - enough to have a sizable effect on the region's limited generating capacity.
These stirrings are somewhat tentative, both because of uncertainty about the whole question of global warming and because of a tendency on the part of some environmentalists and politicians to play down the question of adaptation for fear it will divert attention from what they see as an overriding need to limit production of the greenhouse gases.
But reining them in is bound to be difficult. The world economy runs on fossil fuels, and burning these fuels generates increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Weaning the world away from them is likely to be a long and costly business. For developing countries especially, fossil fuels are tightly linked to prospects for development and a better life for their peoples, leaving those countries reluctant to give up the fuels.
As the difficulty of reducing greenhouse emissions has come home, the focus has shifted somewhat ''from prevention to a focus on adaptation,'' said Michael H. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Dr. Glantz, a social scientist, heads a group that studies the impact of climatic change on societies. And while a number of environmentalists, scientists and officials continue to believe that the first priority should be a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, some are now saying that adaptation must be considered as well.
In a report to President Bush earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences argued that adaptive measures should be assigned a high priority. ''We are already irrevocably committed to major global change in the years ahead,'' the report said, expressing the view prevalent among climatologists. ''The elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases produced to date by human activities will persist for many centuries and will slowly change the climate of the earth, regardless of our actions.''
Still, although many scientists agree on the broad outlines of global climate change, the system is so complex they cannot predict exactly how great the change will be or when and how it will affect specific regions.
This uncertainty means that in planning for a broad range of long-term activities like coastal development, construction of ports, location of waste-disposal sites, water projects and agricultural enterprises, flexibility is crucial, the academy told Mr. Bush.
In studying and planning for the expected impact of global warming, the Environmental Protection Agency is emphasizing this need for flexibility. ''You've got to leave yourself leeway,'' said John Hoffman, the director of the agency's global change division.
The planning options for industrialized countries, with all their resources, are numerous, the academy's report said. But that is not the case for many developing countries. For instance, a one-meter rise in sea level, which some experts consider likely by the end of the next century, would cover broad areas of Bangladesh, Indonesia and Southeast Asia holding some of the world's largest populations and richest agricultural lands. Those countries, experts say, simply do not have the resources to deal with such a disaster.
Some experts, moreover, express concern that the industrialized countries, following a well-documented human tendency, will not take adaptive action until disaster is near, when it may be too late.
 
The Science
Complexity Makes Prediction Chancy
In the greenhouse effect, energy from the sun is trapped in the earth's atmosphere by carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and other trace gases. The more gases, the more heat is trapped.
Carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists say atmospheric concentrations of all these gases combined have increased from about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide at the start of the industrial age almost 200 years ago to the equivalent of 400 parts per million today. At the present rate of increase, scientists say that the level will grow to 570 parts per million, more than double the pre-industrial level, possibly as early as 2030.
Scientists calculating from mathematical models of the earth's atmosphere say this doubling could cause the atmosphere to warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, the atmosphere has warmed by about 9 degrees since the end of the last ice age. But climatic and atmospheric change is so complex that there is great uncertainty about the predictive accuracy of the models.
How long it will take for maximum warming to be reached is uncertain because the oceans slow such warming. Most scientists expect the maximum warming to take place by the second half of the next century.
If change is slow enough, the Environmental Protection Agency said earlier this year in a report to Congress, adaptation may be manageable. But a sudden or rapid change, it said, might make it problematic.
 
Sea-Level Rise
Defending Coasts Is a Concern
A rise in sea level is ''one of the most certain impacts of climate change,'' the agency said in its report to Congress. Higher global temperatures would probably cause glaciers to melt, as well as leading to an expansion of the oceans because warm water occupies a larger volume of space than cold water. If levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere double, sea levels will rise; estimates of the average rise are from 1.5 feet to 6.5 feet. Some leading experts regard a rise of 1 meter, a little more than three feet, as most likely. They expect it to occur gradually in the next century, affecting coastal areas where about a billion people, a quarter of the world's population, now live.
In adapting to global warming, ''the primary issue is coastal defense,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''Planning for sea-level rise must be done decades in advance of the actual unfolding of the consequences. If you're going to protect such areas with seawalls, or carry out a careful retreat of populations, which will be inevitable in some cases, or protect houses, those are measures that must be planned many decades ahead of time.''
Gjerrit P. Hekstra, an ecologist in the environmental protection branch of the government of the Netherlands, said defending a settled coastline or coastal city from rising seas requires ''a complete restructuring of your hydrological infrastructure - ship channels, dikes, canals, rivers, everything.''
Dr. Hekstra's country has been doing that for many decades, and the experience of the Netherlands may prove instructional for much of the rest of the world. For the Dutch, adapting to a sea-level rise means simply an expansion of the elaborate, modern coastal defense system it has developed in the last 30 years. Government studies have shown that to protect the country from a sea-level rise of 1 meter will require an investment, over the long term, of up to $10 billion. The Netherlands has already spent $15 billion on coastal defense in the last three decades.
Coastal defense means building dikes and piling up sand on the coast to strengthen dunes and sculpting rivers and canals to keep sea water from penetrating the soil and ruining both fresh water supplies and agricultural land. Dr. Hekstra said it is his opinion as a private ecologist that all this is well within existing technology and requires only money.
''So I don't think your country and my country is the real problem,'' he said. That is not to minimize the problem, he said, since the United States would have to spend billions of dollars to defend coastal cities and developments against a one-meter rise in sea level and might well have to abandon some low-lying regions altogether.
''We can cope,'' Dr. Hekstra said. ''But not Indonesia, not Bangladesh, not Vietnam. They don't have the resources to do it. Who's going to pay the bill for the developing countries?'' In the United States, the E.P.A. has made extensive studies of the effect of a rise in the sea level, and most coastal states are beginning to plan for it. Questions being examined include not only coastal defense but matters like beach erosion and the intrusion of salt water into rivers and bays where it would foul drinking-water supplies. Possible solutions to salt-water intrusion include the construction of barrier dams in estuaries and canals to divert the salt water from drinking water intakes. Close attention is also being paid to the control of hazardous-waste disposal sites in areas likely to flood.
Most of the efforts are in early stages. But ''I haven't talked to a single coastal state that isn't doing some hard thinking about this and where the government is starting to put together some plans,'' said Thomas W. Curtis, the director of the natural resources group of the National Governors' Association.
South Carolina, North Carolina, Maine and Florida, with sea-level rise in mind, have all enacted standards designed to control construction on their shorelines.
 
Water Resources
Shortages Likely For California
Some predictions of climate change, admittedly chancy, forecast drier conditions for much of the American West, with serious consequences for a region where water scarcity is already a major factor of life and prosperity. The E.P.A. study for Congress, for instance, found that California's water demand could increase, even as water supplies decrease. The decrease would come about partly because more snow would melt in the winter and less in the summer. Since reservoirs do not have the capacity to store all the winter runoff, spring and summer water supplies would drop.
Experts say that a number of adaptive measures could help in such a situation. These could be as simple as lining irrigation systems so that less water is wasted or expensive solutions like building larger reservoirs or even such a harsh measure, should water become scarce enough, as imposing high prices on it.
''Despite a growing awareness of the problem, the institutions involved in managing our water resources are not really taking account of the greenhouse effect,'' said Peter H. Gleick, director of the global environment program of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonprofit research institute in Berkeley, Calif.
''The difficulty is that we don't know how precipitation patterns are going to change,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund. This, he said, underscores the limitations of adaptation.
 
Agriculture
Crop Adaptation Seems Promising
No more critical activity stands to be profoundly affected by global warming than agriculture, but scientists also consider it one of the most adaptable.
Almost all the crops now grown in the United States, for example, originally came from some other part of the world and were adapted to this continent.
Building on this tradition, the Federal Department of Agriculture is preparing to ease the way for whatever transplants might be required by global warming. Jim Duke, an economic botanist at the department's research center in Beltsville, Md., has been collecting data for some years on the temperature and rainfall conditions in which 1,000 agricultural plants flourish. He is now preparing to use this data in mathematical models of climate, which would tell what crops would adapt best if, for instance, New York's average temperature rose three degrees and its rainfall also increased.
The E.P.A. report to Congress said that warming might force abandonment of 10 to 50 percent of the Southeast's agricultural acreage.
''We might lose the conventional crops'' in the Southeast, said Dr. Duke. ''But assuming we didn't go dry, we would bring in semitropical crops. It's just a matter of selecting variety. We could bring in a wealth of tropical fruits and vegetables.''
At the same time, agricultural researchers around the world have long been striving, through both genetic and cultivation techniques, to make many crops more adaptable to harsh environments. Gary Evans, a special assistant for global change issues at the Department of Agriculture, said, ''We are augmenting most of our current plant-stress programs with an eye to what would take place if temperature or moisture shifted.''
Researchers are also striking out in new directions with important implications for adaptation to global warming. At the University of Arizona, for instance, researchers led by Carl N. Hodges are experimenting with getting plants to grow in sea water. If they succeed, the technique could save fresh water in arid areas near oceans.
In Israel's Negev Desert, a team led by Yosef Misrahi of Ben Gurion University of the Negev is growing fruits and nuts at temperatures higher than 115 degrees. In the same area, the Jewish National Fund, the Israeli agency in charge of forestry and land conservation, is experimenting with a genetically improved species of loblolly pine, using seedlings donated by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation. Much of this sort of research is directly related to the prospect of global warming.
 
Prospects
Seeds of Change In Hurricane
Even before Hurricane Hugo, Charleston, S.C., was attuned to two of the major effects scientists expect from global warming: a rising sea level and more frequent and more potent hurricanes. It had already required new buildings near the shore to be built far enough off the ground to escape flooding, which they did in the hurricane. The city had also begun installing pumping stations to insure proper drainage, unlike the situation with sewers that work by gravity, which do not drain when rising water covers their outlets.
But the hurricane certainly made a difference. ''The hurricane deepened our resolve,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston said, ''and made us more confident that our decisions along those lines were wise ones, and it certainly deepened our commitment to new ways of thinking and acting.''
That, according to the conclusions of a study directed by Dr. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is how action to combat a long-term threat usually gets started. A number of case studies sponsored by the center found that a catalyst was usually necessary before governments would act. Once they did act, ad hoc responses were favored over longer-term, planned responses.
These responses, the study concluded, ''have often built into the existing social structures an additional degree of rigidity'' that make it more difficult to adapt flexibly.
Those charcteristics illustrate the difficulties of adaptation, Dr. Glantz said, especially in a situation so fraught with uncertainty as global warming, where the threat, however serious it ultimately proves to be, may not become readily apparent for years or even decades.

Adam Smith Examines Trade With Russia

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Soviet Union is no doubt as meager an exporter of consumer goods as the experts on tonight's edition of ''Adam Smith's Money World'' report, but under Mikhail S. Gorbachev it has come up with a couple of hot sellers for America's public affairs programs - glasnost and perestroika.
Tonight's interesting example, on Channel 13 at 9:30 P.M., asks what's in it for the United States? With a Marriott Hotel opening in Poland, Estee Lauder taking beauty to Budapest and Pepsico's expanding operations in the Soviet Union soon to feature a Pizza Hut close by the Kremlin, the question is plainly in fashion.
Donald Kendall, the head of Pepsico, who has been doing business with the Russians for a decade, notes that the Soviet Union is Pepsi-Cola's biggest overseas market. The Soviet worker, with so little to spend his rubles on, can evidently afford a Pepsi and thereby participate in the American dream. The made-for-Moscow commercials for the soft drink are a gas. 
In a conversation with George J. W. Goodman (Adam Smith in the flesh and spectacles), Mr. Kendall urges American businessmen to try to satisfy the long unsatisfied desires of Russia's consumers quickly, before the Europeans and Japanese move in. All those millions eager for a chance to buy kitchen appliances, clothes and much else besides Pepsi hold out a seemingly irresistible invitation to the American entrepreneurial spirit.
But as several Russia-watchers caution, the invitation is hedged with hazards. The American go-getter has to be prepared for the built-in obstacles of Communist society. There are such practical difficulties as a lack of trade agreements and the unconvertibility of the ruble - and one knowing observer compares many Russians' attitude toward money to the attitude of schoolgirls toward sex - a sort of frightened fascination.
Moreover, the experts note that the dissatisfation and unrest now prevailing in the Soviet Union do not make a reassuring climate for investors. Things are not going all that well for Mr. Gorbachev's economic restructuring, and as Andrei Stroyer, a Soviet official who has been studying American business methods, observes, there may not be much time. ''The only way for our country,'' he says, ''is reform, very active and very fast.'' But can it come fast enough? And if Mr. Gorbachev's promises are not realized and the chronic shortage of all sorts of goods is not soon alleviated, will the old-line antagonists of a liberated market return to power? What American businessman wants to put money into so shaky a situation?
On the brighter side, Mr. Kendall holds out the hope that as both Moscow and Washington reduce their expenditures on arms and increase trade, the American economy can only benefit. The Soviet Union, he points out, is one of the few countries with which the United States has a favorable balance of trade, so why not increase it.
A half-hour is hardly enough time to begin a discussion on so big a subject, but by focusing on the American interest in perestroika, tonight's program becomes manageable, and no doubt there will be follow-ups. Sunde Smith's production, particularly the use of those Pepsi commercials, keeps things lively, and Mr. Goodman's interviews are as businesslike as they usually are in his ''Money World.''

HEADLINE: Price Revolt Spreading On Prescription Drugs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Beginning a buyer's revolt against sharply rising prescription drug prices, a growing number of state government and employer health plans are trying to force pharmaceutical companies to trim prices on brand-name products.
To back up their demands for discounts and rebates, the state and private health plans are threatening to drop some products from their lists of drugs approved for reimbursement.
The lists already favor low-priced generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection. But now the health plans are demanding bids from makers of competing brand-name drugs that have no generic equivalents. Some health plans are even talking of boycotting some products of companies that refuse to cooperate. 
 
A Price Surge Since '80
''We want to send a signal out to the physician, the pharmacy and the manufacturer that there has to be an end to tolerance of rising costs,'' said Dan Heslin, director of employee benefits at Rockwell International, an aerospace company that is negotiating with drug makers on prices and is even opening its own pharmacies to buy drugs in bulk at lower prices.
The price of drugs has risen 88 percent since 1980, ''and it continues to go upward,'' said Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, which plans hearings on prescription drug prices for Thursday.
The Labor Department said prescription drug prices rose 9.2 percent in September from the month a year earlier, more than double the Consumer Price Index. Americans will spend $40 billion on drugs and related products this year, according to Federal statisticians.
 
Drug Makers Fight Back
The drug companies have been fighting the price demands. In California and Kansas, for example, they have been lobbying for legislation that would prohibit state Medicaid programs from excluding higher-priced products, arguing that such policies amount to second-class medical treatment for the poor. And while some pharmaceutical companies have agreed to discuss prices with some large employers and insurers, the purchasers say the companies have refused to give discounts and rebates on brand-name products, except to hospitals and large health maintenance organizations.
Hospitals and some H.M.O.'s have secured price concessions because they shortened the lists of drugs their physicians prescribe, putting pressure on the manufacturers to make deals. But patients not in H.M.O.'s who are covered by employers and Medicaid buy their drugs at thousands of pharmacies that do not have unified buying power. (The Medicare program for the elderly and disabled does not cover prescription drugs outside the hospital, and an expansion of the program to cover such expenses is virtually dead in Congress.) In the political battling over drug prices, the health plans leading the revolt are supported by advocates for the elderly, who use more than 30 percent of all prescription products, and for people with AIDS.
They cite as examples the $6,500 annual cost of AZT, the only federally approved AIDS drug; $6,240 a year for erythropoietin, for anemia associated with kidney dialysis, and $1,375 a year for Eldepryl, a promising new drug for Parkinson's disease.
''Seventy percent of elderly Americans have no insurance for prescription drugs,'' Senator Pryor said.
 
'A Collision Course'
John Rother, legislative director in Washington for the American Association of Retired Persons, an advocacy group, said, ''Drug prices are on a collision course with the political interests of business, older people and government.'' John R. McHugh, president of the group's mail-order drug service, said, ''The brand-name manufacturers' prices in the last few years have been unconscionable.''
Representatives of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group, said prices were rising because the revenues had to finance large research and development programs. They said the companies spent $6.5 billion on research, or 16.3 percent of their $46.2 billion in worldwide sales last year. ''Costs of labor, materials, taxes and promotion have also increased in recent years,'' said Gerald J. Mossinghoff, the association president.
He said drugs, including those for ulcers and high blood pressure, had yielded enormous savings in overall spending on hospital care.
Securities analysts said drug makers have often raised prices to increase earnings even though sales as measured in units have been stagnant over all - about 1.5 billion prescriptions a year since 1982. #21% Increases in '89 The Upjohn Company, for example, has raised the price of both Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Halcion, a sedative, by 21 percent since January, as the number of prescriptions written for both products was dropping, said Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Securities.
Because benzodiazepines like Xanax and Halcion can be addictive and their effects are often compounded by alcohol, physicians have begun to limit prescriptions for both drugs. New York State restricts the number and frequency of benzodiazepine prescriptions. And a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recently recommended that Upjohn be required to warn that travelers who use Halcion may have memory lapses.
The drug makers say drugs often have only a few years of strong earnings before losing ground to new products and, after their patent protection runs out, to low-priced generic versions. Robert H. Uhl Jr., an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that by 1993 two dozen drugs with a combined total of $5 billion in annual sales will have lost patent protection.
 
Industry Highly Profitable
But pharmaceuticals are one of the country's most profitable manufacturing industries: Pretax profits were 22.6 percent of sales in the first half of 1989, compared with 7.8 percent for all manufacturing, the Commerce Department said. By another measure, pretax earnings amounted to 42.7 percent of shareholders' equity, compared with 21.5 percent for all manufacturing.
Rising costs for drugs are a major concern for large employers like the General Motors Corporation, which says it will spend more than $300 million this year for drugs for active and retired employees, up more than 20 percent from 1988.
''A lot of that comes right off the bottom line of their earnings report,'' said Mason Irving, a health-care expert at Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
The Big Three auto makers' major health plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association of Michigan, has obtained price rebates from drug manufacturers for its health maintenance organizations, said Thomas A. Needham, a senior pharmaceutical consultant with Michigan Blue Cross. ''We may try to expand the rebates to all our business,'' he said.
 
Prices Compared
H.M.O.'s, which are prepaid health plans, and hospitals draw up lists of approved drugs, known as formularies, in consultation with doctors and pharmacists. When there is a choice of products deemed equally safe and effective, price becomes an important consideration.
''We negotiate with manufacturers and all vendors,'' said John Middleton, president of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a unit of United Healthcare Inc., an 800,000-member H.M.O. based in Minneapolis.
Rockwell, which has 110,000 employees, operates its own pharmacy at a plant in Iowa and is planning to open pharmacies for its employees in Texas and California. Mr. Heslin said manufacturers had offered to supply drugs to Rockwell employees by mail at special prices.
 
'Truly an Oligopoly'
Five Los Angeles-area aerospace companies - Rockwell, Lockheed, Hughes Aircraft, TRW and Northrop - have commissioned a study of ''the cost-effectiveness of direct pharmacy contracting,'' said Michael J. Barberi, a principal with Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting firm. ''The drug manufacturers are truly an oligopoly,'' he said. ''But employers are getting closer to the door to influencing drug prices.''
Stephen Schondelmeyer, director of the Pharmaceutical Economic Research Center at Purdue University, said: ''In many cases, the purchasers of health care are now as large as the pharmaceutical manufacturers. We're seeing a leveling out of market power between purchasers and producers.''
Deere & Company, a farm machinery manufacturer, operates its own health maintenance organization with 175,000 members. ''Both brand-name and generic drug manufacturers have expressed an interest in talking to us,'' said Richard J. Van Bell, Deere's personnel and health care operations director.
 
Bids Sought
Officials of Medicaid are also pressing for rebates in at least 14 states. Medicaid will spend $3.3 billion on prescription drugs in 1989.
The manufacturers have rebuffed the states in most cases, but last year, when Kansas called for competitive bids on 30 drugs, ''several companies, including brand-name manufacturers, responded,'' said John W. Alquest, the state's Medicaid commissioner. Bids were accepted on six products, each a lower-priced generic version of a brand-name drug. ''If a doctor prescribes the brand-name, we just won't pay for it,'' he said.
Mr. Alquest said drug manufacturers had tried without success to persuade the Kansas Legislature to prohibit the bidding program.
Last month, the California Legislature authorized the state's Medi-Cal program for low-income patients to add or delete drugs from its approved list, thus strengthening the state's bargaining power. Norman Hartman, a Medi-Cal spokesman, said the manufacturers had rebuffed earlier requests to negotiate, and had ''dumped a ton of money trying to defeat the law.''
Medi-Cal has been paying $54.90 for 300 milligrams of the anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beecham, said Richard Iniguez, a Medi-Cal section chief. But because of negotiated discounts, he said, California hospitals and prisons paid $38.50 for the same amount, Los Angeles County Health Department hospitals paid $41.59 and the Veterans Administration paid only $27.60.
Employers, insurers and pharmaceutical industry experts said concerns about drug prices have been compounded by recent Congressional votes to cut back the Medicare program for catastrophic illness, which would have paid for some prescription drugs for elderly Americans. But Senator Jay Rockefeller, who heads a bipartisan Senate-House commission on health care, said a bill to revive a drug benefit would probably be introduced next year.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Olsen of Digital Equipment;
Testing I.B.M. On Mainframes

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
Kenneth H. Olsen, president and founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, has made a career of doing well the things that International Business Machines Inc. does not do. But in October Mr. Olsen's Maynard, Mass., company introduced its first mainframe computer, moving into a market where growth is slowing and I.B.M. jealously guards its territory.
 
Q. Some people believe that I.B.M. owns the mainframe market, and that this market may become obsolete. Why did you choose to enter it now?
 
A. It is owned by I.B.M. in this country, but the Japanese have a big part worldwide. One of the things that we have that is unique, that makes our VAX popular, is that you can grow it in increments - you don't have to buy the big one to start with. As the job grows and the company grows, you can add to it. That makes it very attractive. 
 
Q. What is the place for your VAX computer architecture in the future?
 
A. If you want to tie things together or make a commercial system, then you have to go with VAX or an I.B.M. system; you have no choice. You're not going to put a commercial system on a desk. You're not going to spread your bank's data out on desks. You want absolute reliability and security.
 
Q. Can you look around the economy today and see whole areas of application that haven't existed?
 
A. Oh yes, very much. We've always been a little bored with supermarket retailing. But other areas of retailing badly need computing, and they know it.
 
Q. Are your sales abroad growing more rapidly than here? There's a suggestion that you found Europe and Japan more receptive and dynamic in some ways than the American economy.
 
A. Capital investment in Japan is 18 to 20 percent of their gross national product. In this country it's almost half that. And the thing that is terrifying for the future is the trade balance is going to mushroom in the wrong direction because we're investing less and less, and they're investing more and more. We look at Europe and think they're going to become protectionist in 1992, and if they're protectionist we'll become even more protectionist.
 
Q. How does Digital play its hand? Do you look abroad for your real growth?
 
A. We keep a stiff upper lip. This year we're investing $1.5 billion in research and development and $1.3 billion in capital equipment, most of it in this country.
 
Q. Have you considered participating in I.B.M.'s X-ray lithography semiconductor development program?
 
A. They've talked to us about it, but it doesn't fit in with our plans. My point is that it isn't specific technology. Semiconductor memories are a good example. Semiconductor memories go to the country with the lowest cost of capital. The cost of capital is a major part of the cost of semiconductor memories. When politicians say that they are going to get semiconductor memories in this country, it's like saying we're going to grow bananas in North Dakota. Only a politician would think he could do that, but it ain't going to work.
 
Q. If Japan has a lower cost of capital, and it has a large capital market, why can't you dip into that and even out that advantage?
 
A. I'm not bashing the Japanese when I say this, but we're having a contest with them in which they're generating low interest rates to support their business and we're taxing exports, keeping our interest rates high.
 
Q. Is U.S. Memories, a proposed consortium of chip makers, a little bit like trying to grow bananas in North Dakota?
 
A. No, in terms of being a great success and being competitive. It's more than just getting a few people together and spending a few dollars. But whether it is a good idea to try is another thing. We ought to have the technology here.
 
Q. Are supercomputers a kind of national asset that the United States should do something about?
 
A. Supercomputers are important, but they're not the overwhelming thing. They don't replace guns.
 
Q. Robert Tappan Morris, who in 1988 wrote the program that crashed the national computer network, worked briefly for your company. Do you think he should be punished?
 
A. On different days I say different things. The attitude of many of our people is that it's a shame to ruin such a creative competent human being who did a dumb thing. The other point of view is that you have to make an example of him. I tend toward the view, don't ruin a human being, but I know the weakness of that, too.
 
Q. Do you think there are potential markets in Eastern Europe and Moscow?
 
A. Yes and no. Somebody ought to sell to the Russians because we have a vested interest in their being successful.

HEADLINE: Dow Is Slightly Higher as Caution Persists

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
The stock market posted a very modest gain yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 0.82, to 2,626.43, amid investor caution about the course of the economy and interest rates.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declining ones by slightly more than 8 to 7, with 812 shares up in price and 675 lower.
The market opened mixed as investors took a ''wait-and-see'' stance before a half-dozen key economic reports are released later this week. It remained in a range of about six points higher to six points lower throughout the day. 
The prices of Treasury securities fluctuated throughout the day but ended up with small gains.
Reports on retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization data for October will be released today. Tomorrow, inventory and sales data are scheduled to be issued; on Thursday, the balance of trade report, and on Friday, housing starts.
In the broader market yesterday, the New York Stock Exchange composite index tacked on 0.32, to 188.22, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks added 0.45, to 339.55.
Volume on the Big Board expanded to 140.8 million shares, from 131.8 million on Friday.
''The stock market at 2,626 seems fairly valued,'' said Harold A. MacKinney, the chairman of the investment policy committee at the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''Earnings for the third quarter have been disappointing to some investors, but the stock market seems to have digested the bad news quite well.''
A $1.6 billion bid for Combustion Engineering provided some fuel for the market, as the stock soared 13 1/2, to 39. The gain by Combustion, based in Stamford, Conn., was more than 50 percent and just under the $40-a-share, or $1.6 billion, bid from ASEA Brown Boveri Ltd. of Sweden and Switzerland. Combustion, which analysts said was receiving ''top dollar,'' was also the most active stock on the Big Board, with a volume of more than 5.5 million shares.
 
Nynex Rises to $80
Nynex, rose 1 3/8, to 80. The telephone company, based in New York, said bargaining committees for the two unions representing its 60,000 striking workers were reviewing a proposed settlement on wages and benefits reached by union and company negotiators over the weekend.
Ford Motor, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, slipped 1/4, to 44 3/4. The company said it was recalling about 1.5 million 1985 to 1987 model Ford Escort and Mecury Lynx vehicles to modify or replace the driver's seat track. Elsewhere in the group, General Motors dipped 1/8, to 44 1/8, and Chrysler was unchanged at 20 1/4.
Dow Chemical rose 2 1/2, to 93 1/2. John Garcia, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York, upgraded his rating on Dow to ''attractive,'' from ''neutral,'' because of the political changes sweeping Eastern Europe. He also reiterated his ''attractive'' rating on Monsanto, which jumped 1 5/8, to 116 1/4.
 
Germany Fund Off
The Germany Fund slipped 3/4, to 12 3/4. On Friday, the stock climbed soared 2 3/4, to 13 1/2, in the wake of the easing of restrictions on East German travel to West.
Merck plunged 3 7/8, to 76 1/8. P. Roy Vagelos, the company's chairman, said earnings growth in the near term would slow because of the drug maker's long-term plans and projected research and development expenditures.
The Dallas Corporation, which makes doors and related products, soared 9 1/2, to 23 5/8. The company said it had signed an agreement with the Bessemer Securities Corporation, under which DCO Holding Corporation, a Bessemer subsidiary, would acquirethe outstanding shares of Dallas at $24 each.
In other trading, Philip Morris was up 3/8, to 42 1/4; American Express, off 1/4, at 34 3/8; Unisys, off 3/8, to 13 1/4; Avon Products, down 1 1/2, to 35; Occidental Petroleum, off 2, to 29, and I.B.M., up 1/8, to 98 1/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index added 0.23, to 371.70, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.25, to 455.94.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Prices Rise On Gold Demand in Europe

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of precious metals continued to advance yesterday on stronger demand for gold in Europe and a resumption of platinum buying by Asian interests.
Dealers in New York and London said some buying came from Swiss brokers acting on behalf of United States investment funds.
At the close in New York, the price for spot December Comex gold delivery was up $4.10 an ounce, to $392.70, while the December silver contract at the Commodity Exchange rose 5.8 cents an ounce, to $5.318. The spot January platinum delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed $4.80 an ounce, to $514.40. 
''The dramatic events in central Europe, while welcomed by most people in West Germany and other relatively well-off countries, have also raised fears that mass migrations from the East could undermine their economies,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''And when Europeans are worried, they tend to hoard a bit more gold.''
While the dollar remains the preferred currency, Ms. Raptopoulos noted, ''many overseas investors do not believe there is much further room for appreciation in the dollar or dollar-denominated investments, especially with our economy showing more and more signs of weakening.''
Meanwhile, the rise in precious metals reawakened interest among Asian investors and jewelry makers who had let their stocks of metal run down for much of this year of weakening gold, platinum and silver prices.
William B. O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., said: ''Gold was the first of the sensitive metals to wake up, initially after the Oct. 13 stock market decline and most recently by the events in Europe. Now, platinum is starting to move up as well. But the outlook for silver remains clouded by the huge overhanging supply of the metal. At 228 million ounces, Comex silver stocks are at or near record levels.''
Perhaps equally significant, Mr. O'Neill said, ''is that gold is no longer moving in lock step with the dollar, as has been the case for almost two years.'' He added: ''Consequently, we now find increased interest by investment funds in gold and, to a lesser extent, in platinum. But the main market for platinum remains Japan.''
While the Japanese interest in platinum reflects its use in making a multitude of industrial products, including automotive anti-pollution devices, it has long been the metal of choice among jewelry buyers in Japan. Aside from being rarer and often more valuable than gold, platinum is preferred by the Japanese because they consider it less ostentatious than gold or silver or even precious stones.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drifts Mostly Lower As Traders Focus on Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against most major currencies yesterday as traders were preoccupied with the West German mark.
Foreign exchange dealers said there was little interest in either buying or selling dollars. 
Most buying was focused on West Germany's currency. There has been speculation that the country's interest rates could be raised as the Government tries to counteract the stimulative impact of an influx of East Germans as that Communist nation eases restrictions.
Higher West German interest rates would increase the return on mark-denominated investments and tend to spur demand for the currency. Dealers also said the mark rose as a technically driven rebound from a steep slide on Friday.
''People aren't sure about the positives and negatives of the German situation,'' said Simon Fischer of Bear, Stearns & Company. ''People are trying to assess what the implications are for the dollar.''
The anticipation of several United States economic reports due this week also inhibited interest in the dollar. A weakening in growth could cause the Federal Reserve Board to strike a more generous credit posture, leading to lower interest rates, many analysts say.
This week's statistical lineup includes reports today on retail sales and industrial production plus a reading on Thursday of the merchandise trade deficit, a figure that frequently moves the markets.
In New York, the dollar finished at 143.925 yen, up from 143.40 yen. A pound cost $1.582, more expensive for buyers than Friday's $1.5773.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.8615 West German marks, down from 1.8670; 1.64145 Swiss francs, down from 1.6440; 6.3135 French francs, down from 6.3255; 1,359.75 Italian lire, down from 1,362.50, and 1.16845 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1696.

HEADLINE: Many Economists See Fed Delay on Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Despite mounting evidence that economic growth has slowed to a crawl, the Federal Reserve is likely to shun further immediate steps to trim interest rates, many economists said today.
The dominant view is that the central bank's main policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, will conclude at its meeting on Tuesday that the clear, albeit modest, rate cut of a week ago is all that is needed, or can be afforded, for now.
''We think there will be no further policy move,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, noting that the rate on Federal funds - overnight loans among banks - promptly fell one-quarter percentage point, to 8 1/2 percent, after last week's rate cut, which was reportedly decided upon in an unusual telephone meeting. Over the longer term, however, Ms. Stephansen said the funds rate could slide to 7 3/4 percent by summer if, as she expected, the economy's path remains only barely positive. 
The Open Market Committee, composed of the seven members of the board of governors plus the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, has eight scheduled meetings a year, with Tuesday's intended to set the nation's monetary course for the subsequent five weeks. Occasionally, the Fed finds it necessary to take action between meetings by convening by telephone.
The Fed has so far refused to officially acknowledge last week's session, but economists and analysts are convinced that published accounts of the move, presumably inspired by the steady recent stream of poor to mediocre economic and profit reports, are accurate.
''The market accepts it as a fait accompli,'' said Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Most analysts believe that the Fed responded to the evidence of a deteriorating economy and not, as an apparent minority suspects, to concern about stress in the financial system, particularly among regional banks.
The current issue of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a New York-based bond market newsletter, said: ''Asset-quality problems have spread from the Southwest to the Northeast and to North Carolina and Florida. With the Resolution Funding Corporation already in need of new funds, with the Federal Government breaking records in debt issuance, with the wheels coming off the 'junk bond' market and with new lows quietly being plumbed in the third world debt market, the Federal Reserve does not need a new credit crisis.''
Whatever the Fed's motivation, analysts believe that the meeting on Tuesday will probably not impel further action even if the reports on October industrial production and retail sales are weak. Output, compiled by the Fed itself, is foreshadowed by the previously published employment data, and the report on retail sales has been notoriously unreliable.
Some analysts say more will be learned this week about policy from an account of the preceding Open Market Committee meeting than from market action relating to the current meeting.
On Friday, as is usual on the third day following a scheduled meeting, the Fed will publish what it calls the ''record of policy actions'' - often erroneously called minutes - for the committee's session on Oct. 3. Mr. Logan said he was very eager to see whether recent Fed easing had followed some kind of schedule or whether it was in response to specifically cited developments.
Analysts will also be looking at the Fed's meeting record for an account of the reported telephone conference call last week, which is expected to show up as an addendum covering events since the scheduled meeting.

HEADLINE: With a Recess Near, Congress Scrambles To Save Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
In Congress's rush to adjourn before Thanksgiving, the list of important legislative initiatives that will be postponed until 1990 is growing fast. But little on Capitol Hill stands in the way of a popular tax break, especially one that taxpayers already enjoy, and lawmakers in both parties were scrambling today to save nine that have already expired or are due to expire at the end of the year.
The Senate, in fact, attached all of these, plus several others, to a measure providing economic aid to Poland and Hungary.
The tax breaks include a credit to businesses for research and development expenses, a credit to developers for investment in low-income rental housing and an income exclusion for workers whose employers have provided education assistance benefits.
Individually, the breaks are not popular with all members of Congress. Serious questions have been raised about whether some of them, including the research and development credit, achieve any of the purposes for which they were intended. 
Collectively, however, the tax breaks enjoy an almost mystical legislative status. They have survived the months of budget battles and partisan wrangling that made temporary casualties of measures like child care assistance, Medicare reforms and even the President's pet initiative, a cut in the capital gains tax.
If Democrats have their way, the extensions of the expiring tax breaks -or ''extenders,'' as they are known on Capitol Hill - will be included in the deficit-reduction plan under negotiation between the House and Senate. The theory is that the breaks will attract enough bipartisan support to insure that the package is enacted.
Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee proposed that the deficit-reduction plan incorporate a one-year extension of the tax breaks, which would cost the Treasury more than $1.6 billion in the 1990 fiscal year and more than $4.5 billion between 1990 and 1994.
In a counteroffer today, the Senate Finance Committee suggested a six-month extension, a period more suitable to Republicans, who see that expiration date as a golden opportunity for reviving the capital gains tax cut. The six-month extension would cost the Treasury just over $1 billion in the 1990 fiscal year. The Ways and Means panel, however, is holding fast to a full-year extension.
 
Republicans Have Doubts
But Republicans, particularly those in the Senate, are not altogether happy about tying the tax breaks to deficit legislation that President Bush has suggested he might veto. So 12 extenders cropped up as the amendment attached to the Poland-Hungary aid bill. The amendment, providing a six-month extension, was sponsored by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, and was agreed to by voice vote today, The Senate later approved the full bill on a vote of 99 to 0.
Supporters of the various breaks were elated by today's Senate action, taking it as a signal that President Bush was prepared to accept the extensions and was happy to leave lawmakers to sort out in the next few days which piece of legislation would finally incorporate them.
By late today senators in both parties were suggesting that the extenders might be kept in both bills just in case.
Mr. Bush's position on the extenders has been far from clear over the last six months. In testimony to Congressional committees and in conversations with individual lawmakers, Administration officials have offered conflicting positions, some suggesting that he would favor extension of the research and housing credits and others that the President would oppose all of them because the budget squeeze did not permit extending them this year. Last week, however, Mr. Bush called for extension of the low-income housing credit as part of a housing assistance proposal he announced in Dallas.
To underscore the importance of the housing credit for cities faced with shortages of low-income rental units, half a dozen mayors were on Capitol Hill today to urge that lawmakers find a way to renew it; several pressed their cause in a visit to President Bush at the White House.
Business organizations, municipalities and other interest groups with a stake in one or more of the breaks have been making their pitches more quietly, but no less urgently, in behind-the-scenes lobbying.
The groups have pushed for permanent extension of the tax credits, particularly those for research and development and low-income housing, two areas where long-term planning is crucial. But permanent extensions for all the credits would cost the Treasury $3 billion to $5 billion in this fiscal year alone - a daunting amount at a time when lawmakers are struggling to agree on how to shave $14 billion from the deficit and win Mr. Bush's approval for the reduction plan.
 
'Valuable Commodity'
''Predictability is a highly valuable commodity in the housing world, and this doesn't allow us with confidence to carry forward with projects or to raise investment funds,'' said Paul Grogan, president of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a New York-based nonprofit housing and community development organization, of a temporary extension. Mr. Grogan said, however, that even the six-month extension would be enough to save a 1,000-unit rental rehabilitation project in New York City.
Mr. Grogan's organization pools the credits allocated by states and municipalities for housing construction or rehabilitation and then arranges for the participation of private investors who benefit by being able to apply their share of the tax credit against a Federal income tax liability. Mr. Grogan said a corporation or developer investing $1 million in such a project could expect a 15 percent rate of return on that investment.
Over the last three years, supporters of the credit say it has resulted in 210,000 low-income rental units.
The on-again, off-again approach to the tax breaks has played havoc with employees whose companies pick up the tab for their studies. A tax break enacted in 1978 had allowed workers to exclude from their taxable income up to $5,250 of tuition paid by employers. But the exclusion, which expired at the end of 1987, was renewed retroactively for a brief period in 1988 and then lapsed at the end of that year.
 
Coping With Uncertainty
To cope with the uncertainty about whether it will be renewed this year, some companies began withholding taxes from employees' paychecks to cover the tuition that may be subject to a tax liability. Under the proposals being considered by the tax-writing committees, the exclusion for employer-paid tuition benefits would be restored retroactively for 1989 and then extended for six months. Without the extension, a worker under current law can avoid tax liability for the education benefits only if the education is related to a current job.
''It is extremely important that we take every step to support American companies that want a trained and skilled work force,'' said Representative Frank Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat who has been the chief proponent of extending the credit in the Ways and Means panel.
There has been considerable disagreement among lawmakers and economists about whether the 20 percent credit for research and development enacted in 1981 does much for research. Robert Eisner, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, is convinced that it does little.
''To a large extent it's a ripoff,'' he said. ''It is giving money to companies who would be doing the same thing anyway.'' Mr. Eisner's studies during the mid-1980's indicated that from 1975 to 1981, before the credit took effect, spending on research grew at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, while from 1981 through 1987, research spending rose by 3.8 percent.
Mr. Eisner noted that as the credit is now structured, it actually has the perverse effect of discouraging research spending because some companies would get a larger break by spending less. Partly in response to such criticisms, the proposals for extending the credit would include modifications in the way it is calculated.
Martin Bailey, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, said that with the modifications, the credit should increase research spending by 10 percent over what it would otherwise be.
''There is a substantial social benefit from R.&D. that exceeds any benefit just going to the company,'' he added. Mr. Bailey, who helped conduct a study for the corporate-sponsored Council on Research and Technology, said the study showed that between 1981 and 1985 the credit raised research spending by 3 to 7 percent over what it would have been.
 
Concentrating Their Efforts
There are 11 tax breaks that expire at the end of this year. But the tax writers in both the Senate and the House are concentrating their efforts on saving the seven breaks with the broadest support, as well as two popular measures that expired previously. Besides the credits for research, low-income housing, and the exclusion for education benefits, the nine include: a tax credit for employers who hire disadvantaged workers; a provision that allows self-employed individuals to deduct a portion of their health-insurance cost; and a credit for certain energy conservation measures.
The other popular measures involve the research allocation rules and exemptions for mortgage bonds and manufacturing bonds.
In addition to these, Mr. Danforth's amendment includes one that allows tax-free withdrawals from certain employee stock ownership plans, one for employer-provided group legal services and an accounting change in rules that govern the Railroad Retirement Trust Fund.

HEADLINE: Brazilians Vote Today for President In a Free and Unpredictable Election

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 14

 BODY:
After a gap of 29 years, Brazilians vote for president Wednesday in the first round of elections expected to set the direction for Latin America's largest nation in the 1990's.
With 82 million voters headed for the polls, Brazil takes a key step toward becoming the hemisphere's second most populous democracy after the United States.
For 80 percent of the voters, the election represents the first chance to vote for president. Given the electorate's inexperience, analysts today could only agree on one prediction - that Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old center-right former state governor, will be one of the two candidates making the runoff scheduled for Dec. 17. 
The other slot is hotly contested by two socialists, Leonel Brizola, a fiery 67-year-old former governor, and Luis Inacio da Silva, a 44-year-old trade unionist with strong Marxist support.
 
'Lula' Draws Huge Crowds
In a thundering finale to his campaign, Mr. da Silva, widely known as ''Lula,'' drew crowds of more than 100,000 to a series of weekend rallies in Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. Known as Brazil's ''industrial triangle,'' these three states account for 44 percent of an electorate distributed over 26 states and territories.
Favoring Mr. da Silva, the name Lula leads the list of 21 candidates on the ballot, and his party, the Workers' Party, is widely considered the best organized in Brazil.
''My guess is that the Workers Party will probably have five times more people at the voting stations than anyone else - and that means a lot in a country where 70 percent of the people don't have a party and 35 percent don't have a candidate,'' said Alfred Stepan, a visiting political scientist from Columbia University who has written several books on Brazilian politics.
Nervously watching Mr. da Silva climb in the polls, Mr. Brizola lashed out last week against his younger rival.
''Lula is unprepared and incompetent,'' he said, and ''needs more training and less vanity, because experience is not gained from one day to the other.'' Mr. da Silva is the only major contender who lacks a college education.
 
Voting Is Obligatory
Mr. Brizola was deeply marked by the 15 years he spent in exile during the late 1960's and 1970's when Brazil was ruled by Army generals. Mr. da Silva, a federal deputy, has called his rival ''a salesman of old records.''
Indeed, the Brazil that votes Wednesday is radically different from the Brazil that last voted for President in 1960, a year when Mr. Brizola, was governor of Rio Grande do Sul state.
With the extension last year of voting rights to the illiterate and to 16-year-olds, this election will be decided by Brazil's poor. Voting is obligatory in Brazil, with violators facing a series of fines and sanctions.
In the fullest expression of democracy in Brazil's 100-year history as a republic, 57 percent of the population is eligible to vote. By contrast, only 22 percent of the population could vote in 1960.
But despite a 17-fold increase in Brazil's gross national product in the last 30 years, this nation remains riven by one of the world's sharpest inequalities in income distribution.
 
'Aberrant' Income Disparity
Two-thirds of Brazilian families survive on less than $500 a month. With massive migration to cities since 1960, rural poverty now lives cheek by jowl with urban wealth.
''Today they live in the same cities, on the same streets,'' Helio Jaguaribe, a Brazilian political scientist, wrote in his recent book, ''Brazil: Reform or Chaos.''
''In no country of the world, not even in India, are there such aberrant contrasts,'' he said.
Indeed, in India, the poorest 60 percent of the population receive 30.1 percent of the national income. The richest 20 percent receive 49.4 percent of the national income.
In Brazil, the poorest 60 percent of the population receive 16.4 percent of the national income. The richest 20 percent receive 66.6 percent.
 
Few Readers but Many TV Fans
Furthermore, Brazil's economic growth of the last 30 years has failed to make a dent in abysmally low levels of education. Only one-fourth of the electorate lining up at polling booths on Wednesday will have finished primary school.
In a country of 144 million people, the four most influential newspapers of Rio and Sao Paulo sell a total of just one million copies a day.
''Brazil has one of the lowest levels of newspaper readership in Latin America,'' said Eliane Alvarenga, a Sao Paulo researcher on mass communication here. ''Brazil has an oral tradition. Today people are acculturated by television.''
Largely because of television, an unlettered population does not necessarily mean a politically illiterate population. With televisions now in 72 percent of households, up from 5 percent in 1960, an estimated 94 percent of Brazilians watch television regularly.
Ratings surveys estimate that the nightly hour of free political advertising from mid-September until Sunday drew a daily audience of 35 million people.
With the future of the world's eighth-largest market economy at stake, analysts also note that there is little correlation in Brazil between poverty and leftist political voting patterns.
The most recent Gallup poll here gives the largest slice of poor voters, 34 percent, to Mr. Collor, the center-rightist. Mr. da Silva comes in second with 14 percent.
 
The Anti-Corruption Candidate
Mr. Collor's deep appeal to the poor is attributed to his vigorous campaign against corruption. Last year, he captured the nation's fancy by uprooting ''marajahs,'' or overpaid, corrupt government officials, from state bureaucracies.
The leader in the polls since May, Mr. Collor has seen his support slide in the last three months from 45 percent to 25 percent. Seeking to avoid further slippage, he refused to debate other candidates on television.
A largely invisible presence in the campaign has been Jose Sarney, Brazil's highly unpopular president. Since Mr. Sarney took office in March 1985, consumer prices have risen 170,719 percent. Many economists predict an explosion of hyperinflation after the December runoff election.
All 21 candidates are running against Mr. Sarney, including Ulysses Guimaraes, the nominee of his own party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB.
Although this party controls 22 of Brazil's 24 state governorships, Mr. Guimaraes regularly wins approval ratings of about 3 percent in public opinion polls.
On Sunday, a headline in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper offered an epitaph: ''PMDB navigates for 23 years and dies on the beach.''

HEADLINE: Millionaire Hands Out Money to Help People Start Businesses

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Barbara Erickson was in the unemployment line here recently when someone told her that a local millionaire was giving money to help people start small businesses.
Ms. Erickson and a thousand others, some from as far away as New York State, telephoned the millionaire, T. David Franklin, a 31-year-old former computer salesman. Ms. Erickson, an illustrator, was one of the 15 selected to receive his money.
Three weeks ago, Mr. Franklin placed classified advertisements in newspapers here saying, ''Local millionaire will put you in business. Street people and welfare applicants can apply.'' 
 
Strain Breaks Answering Machine
Street people and welfare applicants did apply, as did commodity brokers, engineers, former convicts and the husband of an anchorwoman for a television news program. Mr. Franklin's answering machine broke under the strain.
The businesses proposed included the plausible and the absurd, Mr. Franklin said. One person wanted to market a special potion to cure every medical problem known to man.
''The first night I couldn't sleep at all, I was so shaken by the response,'' Mr. Franklin said. He made the offer because he believed that many people were willing to work hard but lacked direction and money. And, he said, he has long been involved in civic affairs, starting at age 12 when he sold merchandise door to door so his Boy Scout troop could buy tents.
''I don't want to invest in the stock market when I can invest in people,'' he said.
Mr. Franklin, who is from Baltimore, estimates his net worth at just over a million dollars, most of it from about 20 buildings he owns in Maine, Maryland and New Hampshire.
He said he hopes the people he chose for investments will be able to repay him, but he will not charge interest. He also hopes the group will set aside money from profits to perpetuate the project.
 
Mail Sorting to Housecleaning
Until quitting earlier this year to invest in a computer company in Portland, Mr. Franklin had sold computer systems for three years for Convergent Dealership Systems, a subsidiary of Unisys Corporation based in Hunt Valley, Md. His supervisor, Pat Agnew, said he was a good producer, earning several trips as bonuses. When he quit his job, he had about $200,000 from retirement benefits and other bonuses to invest.
Mr. Franklin said several hundred of the people who called him had good ideas, but he decided to select 15 because he wants to help manage the businesses, teaching the owners basic business principles. He does not know precisely how much money each will receive because he intends to study each proposed expenditure and sign all the checks.
He chose a varied group of proposals: mail sorting for large companies, credit card sales, housecleaning, photography, a handyman business, commodities trading, blood sampling, business equipment repair, crafts, property management, painting, comic book publishing, making Art Deco pins, medical transcription and word processing.
Four of the people he chose are in business now, six are on public assistance, two are employed by other companies and the rest are ''just getting by,'' Mr. Franklin said.
Ms. Erickson, the artist, will do watercolors of people's homes. Mr. Franklin's offer came at an opportune time, she said. She had been laid off from her job in marketing at a retail clothing concern in September and money was becoming tight. But, she added, it was not only money she was seeking from Mr. Franklin but also the business lessons.
''You pray every night and say what direction am I supposed to go, and then this happens,'' Ms. Erickson said. ''It's always been a dream to have my own business.''
 
'This Guy Is a Dream'
Andy Beaudet, the president of AAris Corporation, the computer company Mr. Franklin invested in, said: ''He knows a lot about getting companies started. I give him a lot of credit for doing something the government should be doing.''
Bonnie Robinson, whose idea for starting a housecleaning business appealed to Mr. Franklin, said she has wanted to end her reliance on welfare but could not find a way. She receives $326 a month through the Federal Aid to Families With Dependent Children program.
''Me and my daughter are living bad,'' she said. ''We run out of everything before the month ends, and I know you can make a lot of money cleaning. This guy is a dream. I just want enough to get me on my feet, to make sure my daughter has the best.''
Mr. Franklin said he realizes he must be careful with people like Ms. Robinson because he does not want to jeopardize her Federal benefits before her business can support her.
''I have a chance to help people make their lifelong dreams come true without a concern for money,'' he said. ''This gives me a great deal of satisfaction.''
Several people who know him said they do not believe he is showing off. ''I truly believe he's civic minded,'' Mr. Beaudet said. ''He's never put a press release out, only took out that small ad. And this comes at a really good time because so many people need a helping hand.''

Using the Big Top To Put Normalcy In the Lives of 500

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
rrTomorrow morning a group of 500 people have a special invitation to the Big Apple Circus, now playing at Lincoln Center. They will be entertained by death-defying aerialists, stampeding Pekingese dogs, a dancing elephant and much, much more. Most won't see a thing. They're blind. But they will taste the cotton candy, bounce to the rollicking circus music, smell the pachyderms, read a Braille program and feel wind from galloping horses. And, through earphones, they'll hear a running commentary by two sportscasters.
''This is easily the most difficult thing I've ever had to do,'' said Marty Glickman of WCBS News radio, who will be doing act-by-act with a colleague, Bill Daughtry. 
At a recent performance, the two scouted the action to prepare descriptions for people who may have never seen anything. The goal is to be as concrete as possible. An acrobat swings so fast his hair is standing straight up. A buffalo is a horse covered with a shag rug. Mr. Glickman anxiously asked if he could describe an entertainer's pants as being ''as white as snow.''
''Yes,'' answered Tammy Barry, superintendent of the school run by the Jewish Guild for the Blind, which is bringing the 500 blind and visually impaired spectators. ''They know snow is white.''
What Jay D. Leventhal knows about snow is that it is a pain in the neck. The 31-year-old Queens native has been blind since age 2 but went to regular schools. He encountered his first snowbanks at Syracuse University. ''It can be disruptive,'' he said of navigating with a cane. ''You lose all your landmarks.'' Since 1982, Mr. Leventhal has worked at the American Foundation for the Blind at 15 West 16th Street. His job has been testing products for the workplace and then helping the blind with the new technology. After interrupting his reading - a scanner funneled the page of a journal into a computer, which spoke the words in a flat voice - Mr. Leventhal was glad to chat about his work.
He has interviewed 1,160 blind and visually impaired people about how they cope with their jobs. They include lawyers and psychiatrists who just need tape recorders to mathematicians who need vast computer systems. He also answers questions from employers. Which computer array, for example, best displays large type?
It is an intriguing form of networking. Several weeks ago, a blind woman in Phoenix called to say she was interested in solar research. Mr. Leventhal referred her to a California man who owns a small solar company. A blind politician once wanted to know if there were any blind elected officials in case his opponent tried to use his disability against him. Mr. Leventhal found several. The American Foundation for the Blind sells intriguing things through its catalogue. Talking thermometers, tape measures and wallets. Tactile poker chips. A bacon crisper blind people can use and a Braille monopoly set. But for those who prefer to shop in a store, why not drop by a retail establishment that opened just yesterday?
It is the Lighthouse Shopping and Information Center at 111 East 59th Street, operated by the Lighthouse, the not-for-profit visual rehabilitation agency. The Lighthouse used to operate a craft shop in the same space. There is still some of this - the creations of a woodworker who scavenges to find different kinds of wood, for example.
But the focus is on things to help the visually impaired lead a more normal life. There are talking watches (one speaks English and Spanish), a talking scale with a voice sufficiently accusatory to force pounds off anybody, and a radio that brings in television stations. There are self-threading needles, a Braille Scrabble set and a telephone that repeats each number dialed.
If you buy a Braille Christmas card, the store will add your name in Braille for no charge. Gift-wrapping of everything is free, and there is no sales tax.
Barbara Silverstone, the Lighthouse's executive director, said the store represents a shift toward thinking of visually impaired people as intelligent consumers rather than clients or patients.
''This isn't a mystery,'' she said. ''This isn't strange. Visual impairment can happen to anybody.''
The bottom line of today's eye chart is that things seem to be getting better and more bountiful for blind people. But there are vast distances still to go. As many as four-fifths of this well-educated group are unemployed.
Oh, one last thing. Mr. Glickman, the sportscaster, is nagged by a worry. With tomorrow's ''Circus of the Senses'' only hours away, he is up in the air as to how to describe a baboon.

 BODY:
Strange political twists seldom surprise anyone in this gritty city on Long Island Sound. After all, P.T. Barnum, the showman and circus master, was once mayor here. So was Jasper McLevy, a Scrooge-like Socialist who reigned for 24 years until 1957. So was John C. Mandanici, a target of death threats and car firebombings, who, during a failed 1981 re-election bid, often wore a bulletproof vest while campaigning.
But last week's election of Mary C. Moran, a Republican, as mayor of Connecticut's largest city jolted even jaded Bridgeporters. 
Mrs. Moran, a self-described housewife and real-estate broker, has no experience in elective office and was virtually unknown to the public until two months ago. The city's first woman to become Mayor, she defeated a two-term incumbent, Thomas W. Bucci, a Democrat who tried to end the city's long-running debt crisis with a $60 million state bailout plan.
Even more shocking was Mrs. Moran's victory margin: 11 percentage points. Republicans in Bridgeport are outnumbered 4 to 1 by Democrats.
''There is an expression here,'' said Michelle Sullivan, Mrs. Moran's acting press secretary. ''They never vote you in - they vote you out.''
Mrs. Moran's victory may signal dissatisfaction with Mr. Bucci more than approval of her austerity platform, which calls for cutting city services, except for police and fire, and increasing taxes only in an emergency, like an impending bankruptcy.
In the last week, though, Mrs. Moran's newness, charm and effervescence have inspired a small rejuvenation in this city of 143,000 people.
''She is fresh and exciting,'' said former Mayor Nicholas A. Panuzio, a Republican and chairman of Black Manafort Stone & Kelly, a Washington-based lobbying and consulting concern. ''She'll be a high-profile mayor.''
''It's all somewhat surprising,'' added another former mayor, Leonard S. Paoletta, who was upset by Mrs. Moran in a seven-way Republican primary two months ago. ''But if the people really respond to her administration the way they responded to her campaign, she could be the one to turn the city around.''
The inauguration, traditionally held at City Hall, was moved to the stately Klein Memorial Auditorium to accommodate the overflow crowd of 1,500 who attended the emotional, two-hour swearing-in ceremony Monday night.
The 56-year-old Mayor blinked back tears as the band of Central High School, her alma mater, welcomed her with the song ''Maria'' from ''West Side Story.'' ''It was as close as they could get to 'Mary,' '' Mrs. Moran said.
Throughout the evening Mrs. Moran's husband, Stephen, a truck driver for Airborne Express, seldom left her side. ''I'm ecstatic,'' he said, noting that his buddies at work now call him ''Mr. Mom.'' ''It's a dream come true,'' he said. In her inaugural address, Mrs. Moran, previously known to many local Republicans only as a loyal party foot soldier and a defeated city clerk candidate in 1977, promised to hire what she has called a ''drug czar,'' a police chief to replace the recently retired one, a chief financial officer and an economic development administrator.
Mrs. Moran, who received much of her support from the city's business community and the more affluent North End and Black Rock sections of the city, also emphasized that her primary goal would be to keep property taxes from rising and to slash nonessential or nonproductive city workers from the payroll.
''We are a city in trouble, and austerity has to become our theme,'' she said Stress on Finances ''Ed Koch would always ask his constituents in New York, 'How'm I doing?' '' Mrs. Moran added. ''In Bridgeport the question will be, 'Are you getting your money's worth?' ''
Mrs. Moran's campaign manager, David DeFelice, credited her surprising victory to anger over Mr. Bucci's handling of the city's financial crisis. He said Mr. Bucci had raised taxes by 31 percent over four years. He also called Mrs. Moran's backers the ''taxpayer constituency'' and said Mr. Bucci had put the city ''into state receivership.''
Mr. Bucci, who during the campaign cast his opponent as a pro-developer candidate who would allow condominiums to be built throughout the city, credited his loss simply to a desire for change.
''We were the bearers of bad news, especially on the financial side,'' he said shortly after his defeat. ''The voters wanted a new messenger. They wanted someone fresh, someone new, someone with no experience.''
 
Industrial Decline a Factor
Bridgeport financial problems are rooted primarily in its fall in the last 30 years as an industrial hub. A century ago the city was one of the manufacturing centers of the world.
In this time P.T. Barnum built a castle with minarets named Iranistan, which served as the architectural model for many buildings in the city. He donated most of the land for Seaside Park, where there is a statue of Barnum.
There were other problems besides the decline of the city's factories. Suburban flight was one. Mayor McLevy's long tenure and legendary frugality also left the city with a substandard infrastructure and social services. Corruption exemplified by Mr. Mandanici's administration - 19 members were indicted on various charges, 15 convicted - contributed to the city's miseries as well.
Over the last decade, though, sloppy tax collection, routine overestimates of revenue and overall mismanagement, mostly in administrations preceding Mr. Bucci's, left the city millions of dollars in debt and with a dangerously low credit rating.
The city received an infusion of capital two years ago when the state agreed to back $60 million in bonds to help pay off municipal debts. But in return, the city was forced to relinquish its fiscal oversight to a review board made up of state and local officials.
 
'Old and Deep' Trouble
''The roots of our financial trouble are old and deep,'' Mrs. Moran said. ''And what has demoralized many citizens is the rush of events and revelations over recent years which suggest a hopeless situation, one out of control.''
But before Bridgeport can rebuild its troubled fiscal foundation, Mrs. Moran said, it has to spend more time repairing its image.
''The prestige of our city is down, and the morale of our city is down,'' she said. ''But I am ready, willing and able, and I will lead this city back.''

HEADLINE: Community Shrinks From Crack's Embrace

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
With its handsomely restored brownstones, well-organized block clubs and political activism, the southern part of Bedford-Stuyvesant contradicts the popular view of it as a crumbling and dangerous ghetto.
''We know most people on our block,'' said Maurice Reid, 48 years old, administrator of the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College, who bought a 17-room brownstone on Bainbridge Street with his family 10 years ago. ''This is a community. Every place else I've been has had a lot of people, but no sense of community.''
Like communities throughout New York City, however, this part of Bedford-Stuyvesant is engaged in a wearying, day-in day-out struggle with drugs. Crack, residents say, is posing a mortal threat to the neighborhood's fragile stability. 
 
Neighborhood 'Reclaiming Itself'
Dissatisfied with the level of police protection they receive, clergymen, educators and many of the middle- and working-class people who make up the bulk of the neighborhood are trying to fight back. They have sponsored seminars on neighborhood security for residents, set up block-watcher programs and formed civilian patrols. A nun who is the principal of a Roman Catholic elementary school has spent so much time battling nearby drug dealers that she won an award from the Federal Education Department.
''As the community organizes itself, it is reclaiming itself,'' said the Rev. Fred Lucas, pastor of the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest black church in Brooklyn.
To outsiders, the name Bedford-Stuyvesant conjures up images of decay and degradation - of drug dens, crumbling tenements and ragged urchins romping in rubbish-strewn lots.
But the neighborhood's southern half, loosely bounded by Broadway and Atlantic Avenue on the north and south, and Marcus Garvey Boulevard and Saratoga Avenue to the east and west, is honeycombed with broad streets studded with grand brownstones dating from the turn of the century. Residentially, most of Bedford-Stuyvesant's blight is concentrated in its northern fringes near Myrtle Avenue and on its eastern edge.
The southern blocks embrace the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District, a 13-block enclave of 430 buildings dating from the 1870's. ''Bedford-Stuyvesant is basically a community of blocks,'' said Edwin Marshall, a planner for the city. ''You can walk down one street and find beautiful blocks. But if you go one or two blocks over, you find abandonment and blight.''
The fear of residents is that their community will be caught in the same explosion of violence that has engulfed nearby areas of Brooklyn. Through July, the 81st Precinct, which encompasses the southern half of Bedford-Stuyvesant, recorded 17 murders there. During the same period there were 24 homicides in the neighboring Bushwick section, 30 in nearby Crown Heights and 55 in East New York.
 
Residents See Misconceptions
''This area has been coming back economically and politically,'' said James P. Sullivan, 45, former president of Community Board 3, which includes Bedford-Stuyvesant. ''The drug problem threatens everything.''
Longtime residents resent what they see as the misconceptions about their neighborhood. ''When I was working, my colleagues couldn't conceive of me living in Bedford-Stuyvesant,'' said Anna Gary, 63, a retired secretary who lives with her daughter and grandchild in a house on Macon Street that was first owned by her parents. ''They visualize you walking out into your yard and confronting guys with guns.''
The black professionals who moved into Bedford-Stuyvesant to take advantage of the neighborhood's low housing prices are also proud homeowners.
The influx of young black professionals has helped stem population loss. From 1970 to 1980, Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is nearly all black, lost almost a third of its 196,600 residents. By 1985, the last year for which figures are available, the area's population had rebounded by only a few hundred, to 133,800.
 
Sharp Rise in Drug Activity
Southern Bedford-Stuyvesant has 130 block associations, more than 100 churches and a reputation for political strength. Its State Assembly District, the 56th, produced 28,384 votes for Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins, the third-highest total among all the city's 60 Assembly districts.
But the growing sense of vigor and community is jeopardized by the growing drug menace. The police report 232 arrests for sale and possession of drugs in the 81st Precinct during the first nine months of 1989, an 18 percent increase over the same period last year. But reports of drug activity phoned into the 81st Precinct by the public have risen by 40 percent for the same period. The police say this increase indicates both stepped-up drug activity and a willingness of the community to do something about it.
''People in the community are the best informed and the best source of information I have,'' said Deputy Inspector Wilbur Chapman, commander of the 81st Precinct.
For now, cooperation between the police and southern Bedford-Stuyvesant appears good, police and community leaders say. Residents say, however, the police can do more. Some want a tactical narcotics team, a special police unit that conducts intensive sweeps through a drug-infested neighborhood.
 
Not Hemorrhaging
''I made an impassioned pitch for T.N.T.,'' Inspector Chapman said. ''My rationale was that this is a neighborhood that is taking a stand. I felt that we could hit the pockets where there is trouble and probably wouldn't have to come back for a long time.''
The patrol commander of Brooklyn North, Assistant Police Chief Thomas Gallagher, says that he is sympathetic to the argument but that manpower constraints force him to pay most attention to neighborhoods that are hemorrhaging, rather than those that are merely bleeding.
''I understand the desire to go in and nip it in the bud,'' he said. ''But I would like to reserve T.N.T. for the most needy areas.'' The nearest such operation is in the 83d Precinct, in Bushwick.
Residents find little solace in such reasoning. ''I guess we have to get to the stage where we have shoot-outs on the street before they take action,'' said Mr. Sullivan, the former community board president. ''We need them to do something before the problem gets really bad.''
 
Nun Chases Dealers
Typical of the community's desire to aid in the fight against drug dealers are the efforts of Sister Mary Jane Raeihle, 49, principal of St. John the Baptist School, a Roman Catholic elementary school on Lewis Avenue.
In the last four years Sister Mary Jane has chased away drug dealers loitering near the five-story school, pressured the city to seal a nearby abandoned building that had become a crack house and told the police about suspicious activity.
''The people in the neighborhood know I inform the police on what's going on,'' Sister Mary Jane said. ''Sometimes they are afraid to be seen talking to me on the street, so they tell me in church after Sunday Mass.''
St. John students even videotaped drug deals on the street near the school and sent copies of the tape to Mayor Edward I. Koch. That resulted in an invitation for Sister Mary Jane and several of her students to meet with Mr. Koch. ''Nothing has changed,'' she said.
 
'Love for the Children'
Sister Mary Jane said that she and her staff have been threatened and that the school had received at least two bomb threats.
''You'd be a fool not to be afraid,'' said Frank Coughlin, 31, a religion teacher at St. John who has shooed drug dealers away from the school. ''But it's not the first thing you think of. Love for the children and concern for their safety, that comes first.''
As a result of the efforts of Sister Mary Jane and her students, St. John was one of 47 schools honored in June for excellence in drug prevention by the Federal Department of Education.
Parents of St. John students say they think Sister Mary Jane's efforts have borne some fruit. ''I think it's a little better around here,'' said Patrick Bowers as he stood outside the buff-colored school one recent morning with his great-granddaughter, Chakima Bowers, 7, a third grader. ''I don't see as many people on the street as I used to.''
Yet given the allure of crack, and the vast sums to be made from it, some wonder if efforts like Sister Mary Jane's are little more than holding actions.
''They'll never get rid of it; it's too built in,'' said Tracy Kirkland, striding quickly towards St. John, her 5-year-old son, Tyreek, in tow. ''The best you can do is make sure it doesn't get any worse.''

Dartmouth Divestment Announced

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Dartmouth College has said it will sell off $11.5 million in investments in companies doing business in South Africa by the end of the year.
The Board of Trustees of the school, where South Africa's apartheid policies have been hotly debated, said Monday it would also refrain from such investments in the future. 
James O. Freedman, Dartmouth's president, read an announcement from the board at a faculty meeting, and 250 to 300 students who were present cheered.
The board said that the investments had ''great symbolic meaning'' and that disputes over them undermined Dartmouth's ability to achieve educational goals.
Since 1972, Dartmouth has adopted investment policies that prohibit investments in South African companies, financial institutions from making loans to the South African Government, companies from supplying goods and services that are involved in enforcing apartheid and companies from conducting business in South Africa that have failed to follow certain employment practices.
The school's investments in companies conducting business in South Africa have declined to $11.5 million, or less than 2 percent of its endowment, from a high of $63 million, or 15 percent, the trustees said.
In November 1985, students built shanties on the Dartmouth green to protest apartheid. The following January, 12 students, including 9 members of The Dartmouth Review, an independent conservative weekly, attacked the shanties with sledgehammers, saying that the school should not be held hostage by any group and that the shanties were erected illegally.

HEADLINE: Alcohol Warning: Impact Is Debated

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Under a law that is to go into effect Saturday, alcoholic beverages produced after that date will have to have warning labels alerting consumers to the dangers of drunken driving and drinking during pregnancy.
The law requires all alcoholic beverages sold in this country to carry the warning ''in a conspicuous and prominent place.'' While some companies, like the Miller Brewing Company, have already begun to label their products, most warnings will not appear for several months.
The new warning will read: ''1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. 2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.'' 
The regulations governing the text and placement of the warning, written by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, are temporary. The bureau will probably issue permanent regulations by the end of the year, said Dot Koester, a spokeswoman for the agency. The warning does not have to be in advertising.
Advocates of labeling say the current wording does not go far enough and are urging the bureau to strengthen it. They also say that the temporary rules do not give the warnings enough prominence. The rules require containers of more than eight ounces to present the warning in letters no smaller than two millimeters, the size of capital letters in this article. Letters on containers less than eight ounces can be one millimeter.
''It's almost impossible to read,'' Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, said today at a news conference announcing a campaign to call attention to the warnings. ''The A.T.F. has purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is illegible.''
Ms. Koester of the bureau said, ''Certainly we'll be considering everybody's complaints,'' in drawing up final regulations.
The law is the first time the Federal Government has required the industry to warn the public about its products. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, who wrote the legislation, had sought similar measures every year since 1969.
The bill was passed after a compromise in September 1988, made in light of growing anti-drug sentiment and after medical evidence was presented linking alcohol consumption during pregnancy to birth defects. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law on Nov. 18, 1988. Companies may be penalized up to $10,000 a day for not complying. Representatives of the alcohol industry have opposed the law, fearing that the labels would harm sales. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade association representing manufacturers of liquor sold in this country, said in a statement that the law was not necessary because consumer awareness of the dangers of alcohol ''is and has been extraordinarily high.''
But F. A. Meister, president and chief executive of the council, said recently, ''Although we do not believe that any additional reminders are necessary, we are prepared, as a responsible industry, to comply fully with the requirements.''
Senator Thurmond and Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, who introduced Mr. Thurmond's legislation in the House, contended in a letter earlier this year to Stephen E. Higgins, director of the alcohol bureau, that the law should be strengthened.
''Alcohol is a drug,'' the lawmakers wrote. ''Its misuse is perhaps the most costly of all substance abuses, responsible for more than 100,000 deaths a year, $116 billion in lost money to our economy, thousands of birth defects, tens of thousands of addicted Americans and broken families, and a series of health disorders and diseases.''
Christine Lubinski, representative of the National Council on Alcoholism, said in an interview that the warnings were not strong enough and that the Bush Administration's anti-drug policy had ''quietly left out the biggest drug problem in this country, which is alcohol.'' Ms. Lubinski is one of many advocates who argue that warnings should also cite alcohol's link to hypertension, liver disease and cancer; its potential hazards when combined with other drugs, and its possible addictive qualities.
Advocates also hope the final regulations will require bigger warnings placed prominently on the products.
Ms. Lubinski said: ''In our view, the requirements of the temporary rule represent the lowest common denominator of compliance with the law.''
Jeff Becher, vice president of the Beer Institute, which represents American brewers, said the institute believes that the regulations proposed by the alcohol bureau are reasonable and that the the labels are readable.
Tom Hills, a spokesman for the bureau, said in response to critics of the temporary rules, ''I think they should wait to see the final regulations. We had to put out something within 90 days of passage of the law.''

Japan's Comedy Legend Comes to the United States

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
In Japan, the character of Tora-san is as familiar and popular as Mickey Mouse is in America, as bumbling and endearing as Ralph Kramden, as durable as James Bond. Since 1969, 41 films have centered on this cheerful, middle-aged street vendor who embodies traditional values of family and home life while remaining an unambitious, unattached drifter in an increasingly buttoned-down, economically driven society. Tora-san has become so spectacularly successful that for years sociologists have pondered the cultural roots, class consciousness and moral implications of these decidedly unsophisticated comedies. 
''Tora-san Goes to Vienna,'' the latest in the series and the first to be commercially released in this country - it opens today at the Carnegie Screening Room - is more successful as a sociological study than as a comic film. It has the plodding pace and easy sentimentality of ''Family Ties Goes to London,'' or any other made-for-television movie that tries to enliven an aging sitcom formula by dropping the characters into fresh, photogenic settings.
As usual, Tora-san solves a problem, is disappointed in love and inevitably returns to his extended family, including a sympathetic sister who explains that Tora didn't reject the world; it rejected him.
But Tora's evidence suggests that the modern world is worth rejecting. An overworked businessman named Hyoma throws himself under a train on which Tora is riding. The train stops in time, the good-hearted Tora throws a party with Hyoma's money, and the businessman is so cheered up that he sets off for a vacation in Vienna, taking Tora along in gratitude.
Yoji Yamada, who has directed all but two of the Tora-san films, races through Vienna as if he were churning out a hack travelogue. The city is merely backdrop for Tora's predictable homesickness, which he shares with a pretty Japanese tour guide.
Even before the hero leaves Tokyo, though, the film maps out its themes. Tora sees in Hyoma the effects of ''severe competition among white-collar workers'' and warns his nephew, who is struggling to pass college entrance exams, ''Your type will soon get sick.'' It is easy to understand why audiences might escape from their own workaday competition by cheering for Tora-san, and more difficult to understand why they find him funny.
Slangy expressions in the subtitles suggest some untranslatable dialogue. But even the perfectly accessible visual jokes - Tora wears sandals to visit Mozart's statue and eats Cup O'Noodles in his hotel room -seem lame. Japanese audiences have 20 years' worth of familiarity to build on; Americans coming in late may be as baffled as if they had just been introduced to someone's favorite uncle, who turns out to be an awfully banal guy.
 
YOU HAD TO BE THERE - TORA-SAN GOES TO VIENNA, directed by Yoji Yamada; screenplay (in Japanese with English subtitles) by Mr. Yamada and Yoshitaka Asama; photography by Tetsuo Takaba; music by Naozumi Yamamoto; art direction, Mitsuo Degawa; produced by Kiyoshi Shimazu and Kiyo Kurosu; released by Kino International Corporation. At Carnegie Screening Room, Seventh Avenue at 57th Street. Running time: 111 minutes. This film has no rating.

HEADLINE: Delta Order For Boeing, McDonnell

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines, announcing plans to expand what is already one of the most modern fleets in the industry, said yesterday that it was ordering or placing options on 260 aircraft worth about $10 billion with the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. The total is one of the largest orders in the history of the industry.
Ronald W. Allen, chairman and chief executive of Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, said the company has orders or options for 160 of McDonnell Douglas's new MD-90 aircraft worth about $6.4 billion. Delta's order means that McDonnell Douglas can begin making the plane, a derivative of McDonnell Douglas's popular MD-80. 
Delta has chosen a 150-seat version of the plane, which is powered by V2500 engines made by International Aero Engine, a venture owned by United Technologies, Rolls-Royce, Japanese Aero Engines, Fiat Aviazione and the MTU unit of Daimler-Benz.
 
Help for McDonnell
The company is also buying 100 Boeing 737-300 aircraft worth about $3.6 billion, which will have 120 seats. The plane will be powered by CFM56-3 series engines from CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Snecma of France.
While the large order will help McDonnell Douglas stay in the commercial aircraft business, analysts said the company would not make much money because it gave Delta low prices. They said Boeing, the industry leader whose planes are far more in demand, would get a better price for its planes.
Phil Friedman, the airline analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the company would have to develop new airplanes instead of relying on derivatives.
 
Strengthening Its Hubs
Delta plans to use the short- and medium-haul planes to strengthen its biggest hubs at Atlanta and Dallas, as well as smaller hubs in Cincinnati, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla.
The carrier already had 260 aircraft on order. Its present fleet of 406 planes is one of the youngest among the large American carriers, with an average age of 8.4 years.
Delta's stock closed down 25 cents yesterday, at $66.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Boeing, which has been hampered in its ability to build planes by a six-week strike, fell 50 cents, to $55.375, and McDonnell Douglas stock rose 12.5 cents, to $69.25.
Several of Delta's competitors among the leading airlines have bought new aircraft recently, and in the past year, a number of even larger aircraft orders have been placed.
Last April United ordered 370 airplanes worth $15.74 billion from Boeing, the largest aircraft order ever. The same month, GPA Group Ltd., the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, ordered $9.4 billion worth of planes from Boeing.
Mr. Allen said the order gave Delta a lot of flexibility. He said that if the economy continued to be strong, Delta could keep some its older planes and use the new planes to expand.
If the economy slows, he said, the planes will be used mostly to replace older aircraft.
Mr. Allen said most of the planes would be purchased by Delta from its cash flow although Delta may decide to lease some of the planes.
He said that Delta could buy the planes without sharply changing its debt structure, although the airline had a $1 billion line of credit to draw on if needed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Auto Sales Drop By 23.1%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Early November sales of domestically produced cars plunged 23.1 percent, prompting gloomy predictions from industry analysts of more plant shutdowns and layoffs in the near future.
''Clearly we're in a full-blown automotive recession with plenty of implications for the industrial sector,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. ''The next three to six months in Detroit are going to be tough.''
If sales continue to fall for the rest of the month at the same rate as in the first 10 days, Mr. Merlis said, ''it would be tantamount to the bottom falling out of the market.'' 
 
More Plant Closings Likely
Some auto plants have already been shut temporarily, and more could be closed before the industry's traditional Christmas holiday break, which lasts for about a week and a half, or sometime in the first quarter 1990.
In either case, analysts said, fourth-quarter profits were likely to be reduced by the drop in shipments to dealers, an increase in discounts and rebates offered to customers, or both.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the period was 5.6 million. There were nine selling days this year and last.
The lagging sales came despite extensive rebates of up to $1,000 on certain models. But some analysts said the latest rebates are less than what was being offered in August and September on 1989 models and are offset by higher prices on 1990 models.
 
Big Three Sales Down
In October, car and light-truck sales by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation fell 14.1 percent from the year before. That slump helped push all retail sales for October down by 1 percent, the first decline in eight months. In other economic reports, industrial production tumbled seven-tenths of 1 percent and the operating rate at factories and utilities fell to 82.8 percent in October. [Pages D2 and D3.] In the Nov. 1-10 period, sales at G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, fell 29.1 percent, to 62,549 cars. Ford's car sales were off 23.5 percent, to 43,808, and Chrysler's car sales were down 22.5 percent to 20,766.
The Honda Motor Company, which has become an important domestic producer in the last few years, postedan unusual decline, reporting sales of 7,431, down 30.5 percent.
The Big Three and five Japanese auto makers reported retail sales of 143,467 cars in the period, compared with 186,521 in the comparable period last year. The Nissan Motor Corporation and the Toyota Motor Corporation reported gains while the Mazda Motor Corporation's domestic-car sales were off 11.8 percent.
 
Slower Decline for Japanese
Although the Japanese auto makers that make cars in the United States have also experienced softer sales, their business has been stronger than that of the United States companies. As a result, the Japanese are increasing their market share.
Light-truck sales for the period totaled 92,283, which included sales of mini-vans, pickups and utility vehicles, a 15.3 percent decline from 108,976 in the period last year.
 
Nissan Light-Truck Sales Up
G.M.'s light-truck sales were off 20.9 percent; Ford's 14.3 percent, and Chrysler's 9.9 percent. Nissan's light-truck sales jumped 30.6 percent.
Analysts were divided on whether the slow sales, which started in October, partly constituted a sales ''payback'' for the aggressive discounts offered in the fall. Typically a period of strong sales spurred by discounting is followed by a period of unusually weak sales, after which the trend returns to roughly the same level it was before discounting.
''Consumers are not interested in buying cars at these prices,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company. ''By this time the payback should be starting to ease.''
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer & Company said: ''I was a little disappointed sales didn't bounce back. We've had a pretty strong run of sales and whether it takes three or four or five 10-day periods to get back to normal; you have to be patient.''
Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry trade publication, estimated on Monday that fourth-quarter car production would be about 1.68 million units, down from 1.89 million units last year. Analysts, however, agreed that the fourth-quarter total is still too high given the current level of sales.
On a preliminary basis, production planners for the auto makers have been telling Ward's that first-quarter production will be about 1,781,000, down from 1,899,000 in the period a year ago. But Ward's said the planners were not sure whether the estimates were realistic ''because of the changing market.''
''It's probably too late to cut production much in the fourth quarter,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities, since auto makers must give suppliers some notice so they can curtail shipments of parts. ''But they'll have to slash production in the first quarter.''
Slow retail sales cause the inventory of unsold cars and trucks to swell, which in turn increases dealers' financing outlays. For the last several months, franchised dealers have been ordering fewer cars from the factories in an effort to keep the inventory manageable. That has caused temporary shutdowns.

HEADLINE: At Last, a Practical Electric Vehicle?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J., Nov. 14

 BODY:
In the quest for clean air, the utility industry today introduced a high-technology entry to curb pollution from autos: an electric van that speeds along at up to 72 miles an hour, and can run for more than 100 miles without having to be recharged.
The shiny maroon vehicle, housed in the body of a Chrysler van, is a prototype that the producers hope will be in production in about three years. But at a national conference here, begun today, the Electric Power Research Institute also showed off less advanced models based on the body of a General Motors van, which customers can order today for delivery next year.
''Go out and kick the tires -they're real,'' said Richard E. Balzhiser, president of the power research institute, which is sponsoring the two-day conference. 
 
Long a Dream
Replacing gasoline with electricity in vehicles has been talked about and tinkered with since the early days of the automobile, and particularly since the 1973 oil embargo. But the cars have never had the range or durability to be very useful. Today, however, improved technology and the prospects of tougher environmental enforcement are beginning to make electric vehicles look more practical.
Moreover, even advocates concede that electric vehicles will be a modest niche market for the foreseeable future, mainly used as delivery trucks, service vans and the like that travel short distances each day. Optimists predict that the potential market is more 100,000 electric vehicles a year, compared with a total American market of 15 million cars and light trucks.
Still, the first factory production of an electric vehicle in North America in recent years, with the General Motors van body, is scheduled to begin in May. The power research group, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to sell 500 next year.
''We are looking for a foot in the door that will convince the population,'' Mr. Balzhiser said.
According to C. Dennis Bausch, a vice president of Vehma International Inc., a developer of the General Motors-based van, North American production of the G.M. Vandura, the Ford Econoline and the Chrysler Ram models comes to 440,000 a year. Half are for commercial use and, he estimated, electric vans could substitute for perhaps half of those -120,000 a year..
 
Clean-Air Campaigns
The main force behind the push for electric vehicles is that clean air is suddenly a national priority. Nearly 60 percent of the population of the United States lives in areas that do not meet Federal clear air standards. One area that violates the standards, Los Angeles, has mandated that 40 percent of passenger vehicles and 70 percent of freight vehicles run on clean fuels by the year 2000. And Glenn Barr, a Los Angeles Deputy Councilman, said the vehicles shown here demonstrated that the technology exists to make those vehicles electric.
In fact, the higher-technology Chrylser-body van, still a prototype, shows that substantial progress has been made. Its nickel-iron batteries are 30 percent lighter than standard lead-acid batteries storing the same amount of power, an important consideration since a heavier battery means more energy to move the vehicle, and therefore less range. And the fuel economy of the new van is half a kilowatt-hour per mile, a substantial improvement over earlier models.
The model about to enter production is known as the G-Van, after General Motors' designation of the body style. It was developed by the power research institute; Vehma, a subsidiary of the Magna International Company, a Toronto-based auto parts maker; Chloride EV Systems, which made the batteries, and General Motors, with support from the Southern California Edison Company.
Although it uses lead-acid batteries, it also represents technical progress. In test rides today, it accelerated acceptably, but designers are still working on the whine of the motor.
 
It's Not Cheap
Like all electrics, this van uses no energy when it is not moving, in contrast to internal combustion engines, which continue to burn fuel while idling. Thus, the advantage of electric vehicles is magnified as traffic worsens, engineers say. But it had better have an advantage, because it sells for $32,000, roughly double the cost of a four-cylinder gasoline model.
Yet with opinion polls showing a popular willingness to spend more to protect the environment, the appeal of the electric vehicle is obvious. The vehicles produce no pollution at the point of use, and the power plants that supply them are substantially cleaner sources of energy than gasoline engines. The research institute, comparing the G.M.-based electric van with its gasoline cousin, found a 97 percent reduction in pollution.
The attraction is obvious for the utilities, too. A single electric car would use about one and a half times as much electricity as a typical household, said Lawrence Hamlin, manager of research at Southern California Edison. The utility has enough slack capacity to run 600,000 vehicles, which would add $90 million a year to profits, Mr. Hamlin said.
The new Chrysler-based van is meant to be charged by a 220-volt circuit - the kind used in households to run electric ovens or central air-conditioning - at 40 amperes. That amount of electricity is the rough equivalent of running every electric-using device in a typical house. Some industry officials foresee more advanced technologies, like power lines buried in the pavement from which cars pick up electricity..
First, however, the business is struggling to get off the ground. The van will be sold through General Motors dealerships. Marketing plans for the Chrysler-based van are less certain.
In the face of that uncertainty, however, there is appetite. Martin F. Gitten, a spokesman for Con Edison, said his company had already tested some cars converted to electricity, and ''everywhere you took them, it was like the Pied Piper of Hamlin, it drew a crowd.''
''There is a public fascination,'' he said. ''All we need now is the technology.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Monetary Policy: A New Old Twist

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FOR nearly a century, monetary theorists have been searching for their Holy Grail: a way to figure just the right amount of money to keep the economy on an even keel. Now two more pilgrim-scholars, David Glasner, an economist at the Federal Trade Commission, and Earl Thompson, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, are hot on the trail.
It is too early to say whether their clever variation on a long forgotten proposal of the great pre-Keynsian economist, Irving Fisher, will stand up to critical scrutiny. But the idea, described in surprisingly readable detail in Mr. Glasner's new book, ''Free Banking and Monetary Reform'' (Cambridge University Press, $32.50), should intrigue anyone who thinks that even the Federal Reserve can make mistakes. 
At awesome risk of oversimplification, strategies for fine-tuning money and credit fall into three categories. Those who believe in a gold standard (or a standard based on other commodities) think the best monetary policy is one that runs on automatic pilot. They would fix the value of the currency to the weight of the commodity - say $400 for an ounce of gold.
Commodity standards work: When prices rise people trade their cash for metal, reducing the money supply and dampening inflation. When prices fall they exchange gold for cash, easing credit and stimulating business activity.
But ebbs and flows in the supply of the standard commodity can in themselves become the engine of inflation. The discovery of gold and silver in the New World, for example, caused a great inflation in 16th-century Europe. That is one big reason why monetarists, believers in the second approach, prefer an indirect method of fixing the quantity of money to the direct fixing of its value in terms of precious metal. Unfortunately, though, the successful working of a quantity standard is even more problematic.
The definition of money is elusive in a modern deregulated economy with a dozen different ways to hold liquid assets. And however money is defined, it is hard to control the supply with any precision. Moreover, control of the monetary ''aggregates'' has proved to be a highly imperfect means of controlling either prices or output.
The alternative to a value or a quantity standard for money is the third category - seat-of-the-pants pragmatism. And since 1982 the pragmatists at the Fed have managed to contain inflation without generating sustained unemployment. But past victories hardly insure future ones, and the Fed's luck may not hold indefinitely.
That is where the Glasner-Thompson idea fits in. They start with Irving Fisher's plan for the ultimate commodity standard. As in a gold standard, currency would be redeemable for gold. But the amount of gold received would be linked to an index of prices for the whole economy, rather than some fixed weight of the metal.
The Fisher approach really would end inflation: Unlike a monetarist approach, no slippage is possible because control over the value of money is direct and automatic. But the price of price stability a la Fisher could prove very high in the event of an economic shock. Robert Hall, an economist at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., estimated that a successful effort to contain 100 percent of the price impact of the 1974 OPEC oil shock would have resulted in 15 percent unemployment.
Glasner-Thompson would soften the potential blow to output and employment in a novel way, linking currency value to an index of money wages rather than a broader index of prices.
A bit of inflation (or deflation) would thus be possible as real wages rose or fell around average wages fixed in nominal terms. But the resulting potential slippage in prices would serve as a welcome buffer to rapid changes in output and employment. And the likely bounds of both inflation and unemployment, Mr. Glasner argues, would be far narrower than they are in today's world of discretionary monetary policy.
Something akin to a price-index standard for money has been used in Chile with apparent success for some years. For the moment, though, the Glasner-Thompson approach is an intellectual curiosity in the industrialized world. Radical ideas, even good ones, are easy to ignore when the world seems adequately served by familiar old ones. And as Mr. Glasner ruefully admits, this idea is so complicated that it would even be hard to sell in a buyer's market.
But times could change. A stumble by the Fed, and people might again begin to wonder why we trust a handful of bankers and bureaucrats to take care of monetary policy, when monetary policy just might be able to take care of itself.

HEADLINE: Factory Operating Rate And Output Show Drops

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Industrial production tumbled seven-tenths of 1 percent last month to its lowest level in three and a half years, the Federal Reserve Board reported today, as an aircraft strike and the California earthquake hammered the economy's already sluggish manufacturing sector.
The Fed said that without the strike at the Boeing Company and the disruptive effects of the San Francisco earthquake, ''the total index would have been nearly unchanged in October, continuing its recent sluggish trend.''
The decline was the steepest since a 1.3 percent plunge in March 1986.
Industrial production, which was unchanged in September, has shown weakness in recent months, as the Fed kept a tight grip on credit to slow the economy and curb inflation. 
 
Report on Factories
But while the Fed's interest-rate policies were having an adverse effect on the manufacturing sector, another report indicated the central bank was being successful in keeping inflation in check.
In that report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell eight-tenths of a percentage point, to 82.8 percent in October. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or more to be inflationary because it could lead to shortages and thus higher prices.
Factory use had dipped in September to 83.6 percent from 83.8 percent in August.
The October output was foreshadowed by the Labor Department's report earlier this month of a loss of 13,000 manufacturing jobs in October, a drop in the average manufacturing workweek and virtually no factory overtime.
But David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York, said the sluggishness was worsened by the strike, which caused a four-tenths of 1 percent decline, and the earthquake, which was responsible for a two-tenths of 1 percent drop.
''If you take into account the special factors, we were down just one-tenth of 1 percent,'' he said. ''That is much more consistent with the pattern of preceding months in which the industrial sector is showing weakness while the others, particularly the service sector, are holding up well.''
John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said fairly steady consumer spending coupled with a weak manufacturing sector indicated ''a little bit of a two-tier economy showing up again, similar to what we had earlier in this economic expansion.''
Industrial production at manufacturing plants that make both durable and nondurable goods fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in October after falling two-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Durable manufacturing was off 1.5 percent, compared with a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent in September and a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent in August. Nondurable manufacturing rose one-tenth of 1 percent after falling that level in September and rising one-tenth of 1 percent in August.
 
Output at Utilities Up
Output was unchanged at mines, compared with gains of 2.1 percent in September and six-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. Output at utilities was up five-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.2 percent advance in September and a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in August.
The Fed said its industrial production index in October stood at 141.4 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent a month earlier.
At the same time, it said the manufacturing-plant operating rate fell from 83.7 percent in September to 82.8 percent last month. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
The rate at factories producing durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last more than three years -dropped 1.4 percentage points, to 80.9 percent. The rate at factories producing nondurable goods fell two-tenths of a percentage point, to 85.5 percent.
The operating rate at mines was up one-tenth of a percentage point, to 84.6 percent, while it rose four-tenths of a percentage point, to 81.2 percent, at utilities.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Sugar Prices Reach Highs On Lagging Global Output

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
World sugar prices resumed their advance yesterday and posted new contract highs in New York. The yearlong rise in prices of free-market sugar also exerted upward pressure on the controlled domestic market.
At the close of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the March 1990 world sugar delivery, the most actively traded contract, soared 37-hundredths of a cent a pound, to a contract high of 15.24 cents. The closing low for the contract, 8.40 cents, was set on Oct. 10, 1988. The previous closing high was 15.19 cents, set on Friday. 
Meanwhile, the thinly traded spot January domestic sugar contract rose a tenth of a cent a pound, to 23.20 cents.
''The cause of the rise in world sugar is simply that global output in 1989-90 is expected to fall short of consumption for the fifth year in a row,'' said Harri Schwartz, head of tropical commodities research at Cargill Investor Services.
The F. O. Licht Organization, the leading statisticians of the industry, said global sugar consumption in the year ended Aug. 31 was roughly 107 million metric tons, while the output was 104.8 million tons. Licht, based in Hamburg, West Germany, projected consumption in the current year to exceed output by 109 million to 108.8 million tons.
 
Out-of-Reach Luxury
But rising output has failed to keep pace with consumption in recent years. One reason is that sugar is still an out-of-reach luxury in much of the world. In most developing countries, economists link sugar consumption to improvements or declines in living standards because it is considered an essential part of the diet. That is why retail sugar prices in much of the third world are often kept low by government subsidies.
In the United States, sweeteners made from corn are increasingly taking a share of the market. Now, for example, 90 percent of domestic caloric soft drinks have high-fructose corn sweeteners.
Most recently, sugar prices have been responding to increasing imports by the Soviet Union, the world's largest sugar producer. Soviet output comes almost entirely from sugar beets. The sucrose from beets is indistinguishable from that obtained from sugar cane.
 
'Caught in a Bind'
In the latest statistical sugar crop year, which ended Aug. 31, the Soviet Union produced an estimated 9.4 million metric tons of sugar. Brazil and Cuba ranked second and third, as each produced about 8 million tons, while the United States output from sugar cane and beets was fourth with 6.6 million tons.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Sharp Decline; Mark's Advance Continues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against all major currencies, while the West German mark continued to take center stage in foreign exchange.
Gold prices gained ground. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $393.30 an ounce, up $2.30 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $392.50 an ounce, up $2.40. 
Currency dealers said continued signs of an economic slowdown in the United States helped depress the dollar by renewing speculation that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. A reduction in rates could hurt the dollar's value.
The Government reported yesterday that retail sales slipped 1 percent in October while industrial production declined seven-tenths of a percentage point that month.
 
German Rate Rise Seen
But dealers said attention in the marketplace was again concentrated on cross trading as the mark continued to climb. They said the flood of East Germans crossing into West Germany has raised the possibility of higher inflation in West Germany and higher interest rates there.
The dollar fell to 1.8540 marks from 1.8615 in London, and to 1.8350 marks from 1.8615 in New York.
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar closed up 0.25 Japanese yen, to 143.80 yen. It traded at 144 yen in London, and at 143.05 yen in New York, down from 143.925.
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5810 in London, up from $1.5805 late Monday. It traded at $1.5945 in New York, up from $1.5820.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, were: 1.6175 Swiss francs, down from 1.64145; 6.2280 French francs, down from 6.3135; 1,343.00 Italian lire, down from 1,359.75, and 1.16975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16845.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose to $5.408 an ounce, from $5.297 late Monday.

HEADLINE: After 54 Years, River's Quirk Gives Up a Clue in a Killing

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Wash.

 BODY:
Cold and violent, the Spokane River runs gray this time of year, concealing quirks of nature and forgotten crimes, mysteries flowing away with the river itself.
A few months ago, the river gave up one of its secrets: the murder weapon in a 54-year-old unsolved killing that was the subject of the nation's oldest active homicide investigation.
With the aid of the rusted pistol recovered from the river bottom, the sheriff of a wilderness county on the Idaho border has identified a 90-year-old suspect in the 1935 case. In the process, he has opened a window on a Depression-era subculture of black-market food and corrupt police detectives, a desperate world in which men killed for cheese. 
From the beginning, this was no ordinary murder; here in Pend Oreille County it was the crime of the century. Sheriff George Coniff, a good man by reputation, was shot four times on the night of Sept. 15, 1935, when he confronted two men who were breaking into a creamery to steal cheese and butter, prize black-market commodities during the depths of the Depression.
 
Detective Is Named as Killer
Fifty-four years after the slugs from a .32-caliber gun were removed from Mr. Coniff's body, one of his successors, Anthony Bamonte, learned about the case while researching a history of homicides for his master's thesis. Sheriff Bamonte came across an old police report in which a detective from Spokane was named as the killer.
The detective was named in 1935 by a man who told a police investigator that he had been involved in the creamery burglary. The investigator wrote down the information at the time but kept it in a confidential report. But in a memo addressed to his superiors and a neighboring sheriff 15 years later, the investigator, saying he wanted to clear his conscience before he died, told of his earlier confidential report and urged that the case be reopened.
But it never was, partly because the neighboring sheriff died shortly thereafter.
The man who said he was involved in the burglary had described a pattern of creamery burglaries in the 1930's, with extensive dates and details. The man said the 1935 crime was masterminded by Clyde Ralstin, a Spokane police detective.
According to the police report, the stolen creamery products were exchanged and sold through the detective's ranch and a restaurant owned by another man. Man With 'Dirty Conscience'? The report was apparently never investigated at the time by the Spokane police, whose ranks included survivors of the era of $10 bribes. But with the report as his clue, Sheriff Bamonte asked the Spokane Police Department, in the county just south of his, to help reopen the case.
''Could there be an old man out there somewhere with a dirty conscience?'' Mr. Bamonte wrote to the department.
When a local newspaper published an article about Mr. Bamonte's interest in the case, it spurred the memory of Daniel Mangan, a retired Spokane detective who is now 86 years old.
Mr. Mangan told Sheriff Bamonte he believed Detective Ralstin was the 1935 killer. He knew, he said, because two days after the killing, he and a fellow officer were told by their captain that an officer was in trouble. They were handed a gun, wrapped in paper, and told to dispose of it.
Asked by Sheriff Bamonte why they would do such a thing, Mr. Mangan, who has suffered two strokes since his interview with the sheriff, told of widespread corruption. Every officer had something on others, he said.
''I got envelopes in the mail and there would be $10 bills in the envelope with my name,'' he said.
 
'He Always Wanted to Tell'
The retired officer led Sheriff Bamonte to a bridge over the roaring Spokane Falls, a favorite spot for suicide, and said it was the place where he and his partner had thrown the gun.
''He always wanted to tell somebody this,'' Rosemary Miller, Mr. Mangan's daughter, said in an interview.
Next, Mr. Bamonte found Officer Mangan's former partner, Bill Parsons, in a Spokane nursing home. Mr. Parsons, though barely able to breathe without supplemental oxygen, had a vivid memory of the case. A rookie in 1935 who rose to become Chief of Police in the 1960's, Mr. Parsons told Sheriff Bamonte the same story about Detective Ralstin and the gun that Mr. Bamonte had already heard from Officer Mangan and added details about graft among Spokane police officers in the 1930's. A few weeks after his interview, Mr. Parsons died.
''You don't realize how far we've come until you get something like this that shows just how corrupt your average policeman used to be,'' Mr. Bamonte said.
Last August, after a long spell of dry weather, the flow of the Spokane River changed, exposing rocks and mud where half a century earlier the water ran deep. There, wedged between the rocks, Mr. Bamonte found a rusty hunk of metal beneath the bridge. A laboratory report later confirmed that it was a .32-caliber pistol like those issued to Spokane police officers in the 1930's.
 
Police Also Suspect Detective
The sheriff was ecstatic. At last, he believed, he had found the murder weapon. Now, he wanted to talk to Mr. Ralstin, who had reported his .32-caliber revolver stolen not long after the Coniff killing.
Prodded by Mr. Bamonte's discoveries, the Spokane Police Department opened an investigation of its own, interviewing witnesses, studying the police reports unearthed by Sheriff Bamonte and assisting with the laboratory analysis of the gun. Lieut. Gary Johnson, head of the department's internal affairs office, said the department concluded that its former detective was the likely killer of Sheriff Coniff in 1935.
Mr. Bamonte tracked Mr. Ralstin, who is now 90, to the modest home he owns on Flathead Indian Reservation land in Montana. The retired detective refused to talk to the sheriff.
His lawyer, Philip Grainey, said in an interview that Mr. Ralstin ''absolutely denies'' that he killed George Coniff. Mr. Grainey said his client's poor health prevented him from cooperating in the investigation.
''I'm very concerned that a criminal interrogation might just kill this old man,'' said Mr. Grainey. If Mr. Bamonte has enough evidence, ''he should put up and file charges or shut up and let this man die in peace,'' said Mr. Grainey.
 
More Evidence Is Needed
Because there is no statute of limitations on first-degree murder, Mr. Bamonte hopes that charges will eventually be filed against the former detective. But the prosecutor for Pend Oreille County (pronounced pond oh-RAY), while praising Mr. Bamonte for ''an amazing job just to get this far,'' said more evidence was needed.
''If some old codger comes forth and says this former cop told him he did it, we may file,'' said the prosecutor, Tom Metzger. ''But I'm not holding my breath.''
Even if Mr. Ralstin is never tried, Mr. Bamonte believes that a certain level of justice has been achieved and that a psychic duel is settled.
''He knows that I know,'' said Mr. Bamonte. ''I might not have every fact. But it's there. I won't let him die thinking he got away with it.''

HEADLINE: VENTURE PLANNED BY G.E. IN HUNGARY

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Moving to take advantage of political and economic change in Eastern Europe, the General Electric Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy control of a Hungarian light-bulb manufacturer for $150 million, making it the largest Western investment in Hungary since World War II.
The General Electric deal with the Tungsram Company, one of Hungary's largest industrial concerns, represents the kind of economic payoff that Eastern bloc nations have been seeking as they adopt political reforms and economic policies more attuned to market forces. Under the terms of the deal, G.E. will broaden the Hungarian company's range of lighting products, and transfer management skills and manufacturing technology to Tungsram.
 
A Pace Setter in Change
Long considered the most entrepreneurial of the Eastern bloc nations, Hungary has led the way in the recent wave of change in Eastern Europe. Since May 1988, when the Communist Party's General Secretary, Janos Kadar, was deposed, Hungary has carried out far-reaching economic and political reforms. Restrictions on foreign investment were virtually scrapped, allowing 100 percent ownership of local enterprises, to help the stagnant Hungarian economy. 
In explaining the deal, John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chairman, stressed the improving economic climate in Hungary for business and confidence that the trend would continue.
''This is the right business in the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Welch said, noting that the deal was ''made possible by the Hungarian Government's policy of encouraging foreign investment and looking to world markets.''
In a statement, Andras Gabor, the president of Tungsram, said: ''Hungary is on the way to democracy and the development of a free-enterprise system. G.E.'s participation in Tungsram gives us the opportunity both to grow our lighting business and to embrace this process of change.''
General Electric agreed to spend $150 million for a 50 percent stake in Tungsram plus one share, giving G. E. control of the Hungarian company. General Electric, one of America's largest industrial corporations, also has the option to buy an additional 20 percent of Tungsram.
G.E. will take over management of the company after the purchase is closed, which is expected before the end of the year. Plans call for the new entity to market bulbs bearing both the G. E. and Tungsram brands. Existing Tungsram products will continue to bear that brand, but higher-technology products introduced by G. E. will carry the G. E. brand.
A spokesman for General Electric said negotiations with Tungsram had been under way since the summer, after the state-owned Hungarian Credit Bank had signaled that the lighting company could be bought when it sold a large stake in Tungsram to a consortium of Western banks led by the Austrian Girozentrale. To complete the deal with General Electric, the Hungarian bank will repurchase those shares and sell them to G. E. Called a Logical Choice Hungary, according to analysts, was a logical choice for one of the biggest Western investments in Eastern Europe. ''Hungary has described itself as the easternmost Western country,'' said Daniel A. Sharp, a foreign-policy consultant to American corporations. ''It has long had a history of entrepeneurial management.''
Mr. Sharp added that while Hungary was the most desirable Eastern European country for Western companies, there was even greater potential in East Germany if economic reforms took hold there. ''You start with Hungary, but then you look to East Germany, because that's where the money is.''
The Tungsram deal is viewed by General Electric as a way to enlarge its ''modest position'' in the European lighting market, according to Mr. Welch. G. E. officials said Tungsram's product lineup would be broadened by the addition of General Electric products including industrial lighting, automotive lamps and miniature halogen and infrared quartz bulbs.
 
Will Introduce New Techniques
The company said it planned to ''invest substantial technological and human resources'' in the venture ''to modernize plant and equipment and to introduce state-of-the-art management techniques.
The Tungsram deal is just the latest action General Electric has taken to bolster its presence in Europe in the run-up to the 1992 deadline for the 12 Western nations of the European Community to establish a single, barrier-free market. The company formed a joint venture this year with Ericsson, the Swedish company, to market mobile radios and cellular telephones, and formed a link with the unrelated General Electric Company P.L.C. in Britain to sell appliances and electrical distribution equipment in Europe.
 
Gain in Trade Expected
Tungsram already sells some products in Western markets, and analysts foresee the G. E. deal as part of a larger trend of West-to-East investment that will increase trade.
''This is a harbinger of movement toward economic integration in Europe,'' said Elliott Zupnick, director of the Institute of Western Europe at Columbia University. ''I think you will see Hungary, Poland and East Germany as associate members of the European Community.''
General Electric officials described Tungsram as a 90-year-old company specializing in light bulbs with sales of $300 million a year. They said that about 80 percent of its sales come from exports, which are about split between Eastern and Western Europe.
 
A Deal in 1913
Ties between the two companies go back a long way. ''In 1913 we gave them some technology for filling light bulbs with gas and obtained a small equity stake in return,'' said Bruce Bunch, a General Electric spokesman. He said it was not clear if the shares were sold or nationalized in later years.
Mr. Welch said General Electric was prepared to make other deals in Eastern Europe and elsewhere if they fit the company's basic plans. ''We have a strategy of trying to be No. 1 in 13 global businesses,'' he said. ''We are not looking in Eastern Europe for a 14th or 15th business. But if we can enhance our existing businesses, we are looking everywhere.''
G. E. officials said they were not concerned about eventually being able to repatriate profits from the Hungarian investment. And Professor Zupnick viewed that statement and the controlling stake that General Electric was taking, with an option for further investment, as a vote of confidence in the future of Hungarian reforms.
''It means that they plan to transmit profits back to the United States at some point,'' he said. ''That says a lot about what they see for the convertibility of currency and the movement of capital.'' The Hungarian currency, the florint, is not currently convertible into Western currencies.

HEADLINE: CUTS ARE EXPECTED FOR U.S. FINANCING IN HIGH-TECH AREA

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Supporters of increased Government backing for initiatives to maintain American high-technology industries said yesterday that they believe the Bush Administration plans sharp cuts in Defense Department programs that bolster commercial research and development.
Reports have circulated in Washington since Monday that the Administration has directed the Pentagon to cut back financing for high-definition television research and other high-technology efforts. Such programs, which have both military and civilian uses, are viewed by many as vital to American competitiveness.
In a letter sent to President Bush last night, four legislators said they had learned of classified and unclassified documents that called for cutting programs financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. 
 
Critical to Electronics Industry
The programs include high-definition television, an advanced technology that provides a much sharper picture and is considered critical for both the Pentagon and the consumer electronics industry; X-ray lithography, a sophisticated manufacturing technology needed to make semiconductors in the 1990's, and the Pentagon's Manufacturing Technology program, which is intended to develop robots and other computer-assisted equipment.
The letter - signed by Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Mel Levine and Norman Y. Mineta of California, all Democrats, and Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania - also said a number of reports from other members of Congress and White House officials indicate that the Administration intends to end all backing for Sematech, a Government-industry consortium that is trying to develop advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and gets $100 million a year from the Government.
 
'Economic Insanity'
The letter said eliminating any of the programs would be ''economic insanity.''
Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, also sent a letter to President Bush last night questioning the Administration's actions on high-technology financing. The Senator said he plans to send a letter to his Congressional colleagues today expressing his concern that current financing not be cut back.
White House officials would not comment on the reports, and Dr. Craig Fields, director of Darpa, also had no comment.
In recent years the Defense agency has played a central role in supporting critical United States high-technology industries by financing and coordinating a series of research programs ranging from support for developing advanced chip-making equipment to research into high-definition television, known as HDTV, which gets about $10 million a year in Federal backing. Darpa is also the Government agency that backs Sematech. ''We have a frightening situation in which the ideologues in this Administration are trying to dismantle the most important programs within our Government which focus on the key technologies of the future,'' Mr. Levine said in an interview last night.
Several Congressional staff members and officials at Government agencies said they had been told that Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood had in recent days sent an internal document, called a Program Budget Decision, to Dr. Fields that calls for placing a number of recently released HDTV research contracts on hold. Several companies that have received grants from the agency recently said yesterday that they had not heard of any proposed cuts.
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, also reportedly sent a memorandum to the Defense Department last week calling for a much broader range of cuts in the 1991 budget. The cuts would cover projects backing research and development into technologies that would be useful for both military and civilian applications.
Several Government officials raised the possibility that the reports are part of an Administration effort to rein in the 1991 Federal budget, which is expected to include cuts in military spending.
''The Bush Administration appears to be on the brink of abandoning our best high technology in the name of budgetary expedience,'' Mr. Mineta said.
 
Merger at Defense
Last week the Administration confirmed that it was planning to merge the Defense Manufacturing Board, organized in March to advise the Pentagon on manufacturing matters, into the Defense Science Board, an older body that provides advice to the department on technical matters. Robert C. McCormack, an agency official, said at the time that the merging of the two bodies was a way of strengthening Defense Department research activities.
In an interview last week, Mr. McCormack said there was no intention to cut Sematech funds.
Members of the Bush Administration have been locked in a debate over how to strengthen American high-technology industries to meet the challenge from Japan and other nations. The lines have been drawn between those in the Administration who insist the Government should play a bigger role in providing money, antitrust relief and other support for industry, and those who argue that such help is not only unfair but probably a waste of taxpayers' money as well.
Mr. Darman and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, are widely reported to be opposed to extensive Government backing for high-technology research consortiums. One White House official said Mr. Darman believes that the research programs are not as valuable as many high-technology supporters have argued and that the programs can have only a limited impact on America's industrial base. Mr. Darman argues that the technologies are better developed with funds from business and industry.
Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and D. Allan Bromley, the President's science adviser, have generally been viewed as supporting high-technology initiatives.
 
No Full Commitment
In September, the Administration backed away from a full commitment to backing HDTV research. At the time, Mr. Mosbacher said he was dropping his plan to develop a Government-industry HDTV initiative in favor of a broader policy of support for high technology.
If the reports are accurate, it would indicate that the Administration is preparing to reject a series of recommendations that are expected to be made on Tuesday by a national advisory committee on semiconductors. That panel is expected to propose that the Government establish a multibillion-dollar venture-capital operation intended to resurrect the American consumer electronics industry. The group, made up of high-level semiconductor industry leaders and Government officials, is known as the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors.
Former Reagan Administration officials also said yesterday that they were concerned about the reports of a Government pullback from high-technology research. Robert Costello, who as the Pentagon's top procurement officer under President Reagan began many civilian-military research and development programs, including Sematech and the Pentagon's HDTV program, said yesterday that he had heard the reports and was ''bewildered'' by the actions.
''I don't understand these people,'' said Mr. Costello, now a scholar at the Hudson Institute. ''If that's what they're doing and it's some kind of economic policy, I think they don't understand what the consequences will be for our national defense.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East: Gratitude and a Request;
In Talk to Congress, Walesa Urges A Marshall Plan to Revive Poland

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Lech Walesa, the founder of Poland's Solidarity movement, called for a second Marshall Plan today as he addressed a joint meeting of Congress. He warned that without the sort of commitment that helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II, the situation in his country could become dangerous.
The former shipyard electrician began by expressing his gratitude for the support his movement received from Americans in the years that it was supressed and driven underground. He also gave thanks for the support the United States has given to more recent political and economic changes in Poland. 
Nevertheless, to the accompaniment of repeated rounds of hearty applause, Mr. Walesa made it clear that more assistance would be needed to keep Poland from becoming so poor that it could destabilize the region.
''We are not asking for charity or expecting philanthropy,'' he said. ''But we would like to see our country treated as a partner and a friend.'' [Excerpts, page A22.] He chided Americans for offering a surplus of good wishes but a paucity of money. ''We have heard many beautiful words of encouragement,'' he said. ''These are appreciated, but being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful but the demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now.''
 
Boisterous Reception
Mr. Walesa's entrance was announced in much the same manner reserved for the President before a State of the Union Address. ''Mr. Speaker, the leader of Solidarity,'' said the doorkeeper. Mr. Walesa entered the chamber to a boisterous reception and as he made his way down the center aisle, members of Congress struggled to get close and shake his hand.
Among those vigorously applauding Mr. Walesa was Yuri V. Dubinin, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington, who was sitting in the audience.
Mr. Walesa became the third person to address both houses of Congress jointly who was not a sitting head of state. The first was the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who helped finance the American Revolution, who appeared in 1824, and the other was Winston Churchill, who spoke after he was no longer the British Prime Minister.
But today's event was more like the appearance three years ago of President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines - a celebration of a person largely identified with a country's turn to democracy.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat whose great-grandmother came from Poland to Baltimore for an arranged marriage, was one of those in the audience who wept during the address. ''I never thought this day would come,'' she said afterward. ''I just didn't think it was Poland's destiny to be free.''
At a banquet in Mr. Walesa's honor at the Capitol tonight, the guest of honor excused himself before the speeches began, pleading fatigue.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, gave an emotional speech that touched on his own Polish heritage. Of Mr. Walesa, Mr. Rostenkowski said: ''He's freedom. We've got to help these people.'' Mr. Walesa, describing in his address the efforts of the new non-Communist Government in Warsaw, said, ''Our task is viewed with understanding by our Eastern neighbors and their leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.''
But he also said the imposition of a Communist economy on Poland for 40 years had brought it to the ''verge of utter catastrophe,'' and that ''all the countries of the East bloc are bankrupt.'' He recalled that at the end of World War II, Stalin pressed Poland to reject an invitation to take part in the Marshall Plan.
''It is worth recalling this great American plan which helped Western Europe to protect its freedom and peaceful order,'' Mr. Walesa said. ''And now it is the moment when Eastern Europe awaits an investment of this kind - an investment in freedom, democracy and peace, an investment adequate to the greatness of the American nation.''
At a lunch meeting with Senators after his speech, he offered a gloomy assessment of the consequences if the new Solidarity-led Government fails to get control of the economy.
Speaking of his own turn of fortunes, which led him from the shipyard to the Nobel Peace prize and a key political role, he said through a translator, ''I was happier as an electrician and did not understand how difficult it was to make that jump to the public arena.''
 
Poles Proud of Walesa's Speech
WARSAW, Nov. 15 (AP) - Poles expressed pride and satisfaction at Mr. Walesa's speech today to the joint meeting of Congress, which was broadcast live nationwide on Polish TV and radio.
Hundreds of people gathered around TV sets in Warsaw's main train station to watch the speech.
''I think he expressed what many Poles could have expressed,'' said a police officer who declined to give his name. ''It was the right thing to do and it was a pleasure to listen to him.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 23, 1989, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 16 about an address by Lech Walesa to a joint meeting of Congress described the precedents incorrectly. He was the fourth foreigner other than national leaders to address such a meeting. Winston Churchill was not the second such person; he was Prime Minister all three times he spoke to Congress.

HEADLINE: Bush Aides Call for Higher Airline Liability Limit

BYLINE: By RICHARD WITKIN

 BODY:
The Bush Administration urged Congress yesterday to ratify a treaty amendment that would increase airline but bar award of additional damages based on an airline's fault or misconduct.
In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Government officials said the current $75,000 damage limit on flights to and from this country was woefully inadequate.
Jeffrey Shane, an assistant secretary in the Transportation Department, said he personally would be inclined to recommend renouncing the treaty forming the initial basis for damage limits if there was no prospect of considerably higher awards. These would come from the amended treaty and a proposed supplementary insurance plan. 
 
Lawyer Opposes Amendment
The proposed treaty amendment was strongly opposed by Lee S. Kreindler, the chief plaintiffs' lawyer in cases growing out of the bombing of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last December. He said the treaty amendment, by setting a higher damage limit without exceptions, would simply be protecting airlines from the embarrassment of having lawyers ''poking around in their record of fault and wrongdoing.''
Mr. Kreindler said the Pan Am group that provided security in loading the first leg of Flight 103 in Frankfurt, Germany, was run by a man with a criminal record who promoted and demoted people based not on their skills but on personal and sexual relationships.
The projected treaty amendment on damages is included in the so-called Montreal Protocols, a modification of a much-amended 1929 treaty known as the Warsaw Convention. The convention, initially intended to protect fledgling airlines from damage suits that might bankrupt them, currently provides that an airline is not liable for damages over $75,000 per person on an international flight unless it can be shown to have been guilty of willful misconduct.
 
Willful Misconduct
Courts have found willful misconduct in only two or three cases. But airlines have frequently settled cases out of court for amounts considerably above the limit to avoid the cost and risks of a trial.
In the early 1980's, a effort was made to increase the potential damage limits. The United States signed the Montreal Protocols, which would now raise the limit to about $127,000. And companion legislation was introduced creating a supplementary compensation program that would provide up to $200,000 more per case.
The extra $200,000 would come not from the airline involved but from a fund supported by an international ticket charge.
Though the Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly supported the treaty amendment, it fell short of the two-thirds vote required for ratification when it came to the Senate floor.
The issue is not expected to be resolved until the 1990 term.
 
Why It Lost in 1983
In supporting the new treaty amendment, Mr. Shane of the Transportation Department said the 1983 defeat in the Senate came because many Senators thought the proposed damage limits -$117,000 at the time in the treaty and $200,000 in the supplementary plan -were inadequate.
He said that his department, along with the Departments of State and Justice, had drafted a new supplementary plan.
The new plan would remove the limit on economic damages, generally based on a victim's future earning power, and it would also permit recovery of noneconomic damages, like pain and suffering. But it would not permit recovery of punitive damages.
Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general, said the new treaty amendment and supplementary plan ''would provide a welcome alternative to the present system, which can embroil innocent passengers in expensive and time-consuming litigation.''
But Mr. Kreindler said that the best alternative was to renounce the treaty on damage limits altogether.

HEADLINE: Bolivia Declares a State of Siege After Breakdown in Strike Talks

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Government declared a three-month state of siege today and rounded up at least 700 teachers and labor leaders a day after negotiations with striking teachers broke down.
Three teachers on a 24-day hunger strike were taken to private clinics where they were in critical condition.
Many of the teachers and labor leaders who were arrested were sent to detention centers in the Bolivian tropics, said Raul Loayza, the Under Secretary of the Interior. 
The Union of Education Workers has been demanding that the country's 80,000 public school teachers, who earn $75 a month, be paid a $103 bonus to compensate for a rise in the cost of living. The Government says it cannot afford the bonus because of the state of the economy. Education spending takes up 18 percent of the country's budget.
 
Elections Called the Spur
The state of siege allows the police to arrest and hold people without charge for 48 hours without a judicial order. Rules governing public meetings and other activities must be determined by state governments.
The center-left government of President Jaime Paz Zamora said it acted to guarantee peaceful local elections next month.
There was little police presence in La Paz and other cities, and business and commercial activity was normal. Power stations in the capital were guarded by soldiers but no violence was reported.
In recent days, teachers and students clashed with the police in La Paz, and the Government closed schools two weeks ago when tens of thousands of workers marched in support of the teachers.
Mr. Paz Zamora's Government, trying to maintain an austerity plan, said in the state of siege decree that the illegal strike created ''a climate of social unrest with demands that the state cannot attend without risking the economic and financial stability of the country.''
 
Cost of Living Is High
The minimum monthly wage is $25. The cost of living, meanwhile, is one of the highest in South America, with the prices of poultry and dairy products comparable to those in the United States and Europe.
Mr. Paz Zamora, who heads the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, a Social Democratic group, pledged to maintain stability after taking office Aug. 6 and has continued austerity measures of the previous Government.
The measures include a wage freeze and lower Government spending to combat a 1985 annual inflation rate of 24,000 percent. The rate has since dropped to 12 percent, and the economy is expected to grow by 2.5 percent this year after years of decline.

HEADLINE: Salvadorans Ask U.S. for Arms Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Government of El Salvador has asked the United States for arms and ammunition to help beat back a guerrilla offensive, American officials said today.
The request was the first since the rebels began a series of attacks in San Salvador, the capital, on Saturday.
''The Salvadorans asked us for munitions, and we more or less agreed to provide them,'' an Administration official said.
Another American official said, ''We are working with the Salvadorans to replenish stocks on an emergency basis.'' He said that El Salvador was not getting anything more than it was already scheduled to receive, but that deliveries would be expedited. El Salvador is supposed to get $85 million worth of military aid in the current fiscal year, the same amount as in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. 
The request for arms and ammunition was made through the United States military assistance group in El Salvador, headed by Col. Milton R. Menjivar of the Army.
 
Tracing Users of Weapons
Administration officials said that El Salvador had also asked for laboratory equipment to help the authorities identify people who had been using firearms - presumably rebels who put down their arms and flee San Salvador with civilian residents.
''We are reviewing the request and intend to provide the help if we can,'' an American official said, referring to the tests for chemical residues of gunpowder and gunshot. ''An individual who showed up positive on such tests might well be a guerrilla or a deserter from the Salvadoran Army, and in either case, the authorities would want to arrest him.''
In San Salvador, thousands of civilians fled their homes today, terrified by bombing, strafing and gunfights in the streets and alleys.
Timothy O'Leary, a spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development, said the Administration was assessing Salvadoran needs for food, clothing, medical supplies and other equipment. Agency officials said they might send special shipments of medicine, tents and water containers.
Heavy casualites in El Salvador are creating an urgent need for medical help, American officials said. An aide to Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, said, ''If the need is confirmed, we will go to American pharmaceutical companies and ask them to donate medicine, and we will arrange for distribution of the supplies in El Salvador.''
 
State Department Statistics
Richard A. Boucher, deputy spokesman at the State Department, said, ''Military sources have told us that 146 Salvadoran troops, 461 guerrillas and 50 civilians have died thus far, and that more than 1,000 Salvadorans have been wounded.'' The actual numbers are almost certainly higher than indicated by these ''early and incomplete figures,'' he said.
Mr. Boucher said the Bush Administration had ''full confidence'' that President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador and his armed forces could ''deal with the guerrilla offensive.''
However, Administration officials said civilian casualties were inevitable, in part because rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front were based in densely populated working-class neighborhoods. ''We think it's the height of hypocrisy for the F.M.L.N. to go into neighborhoods and use civilians as a shield, and then complain about civilian casualties,'' Mr. Boucher said.
A senior Defense Department official said the Pentagon had ''no knowledge'' about targets hit in aerial attacks by armed helicopters of the Salvadoran armed forces.
 
Areas of Combat
The fighting today was limited mainly to areas in and around San Salvador and San Miguel, a province capital in eastern El Salvador, the official said, adding that roads and bridges remain open throughout the country.
He reported that Salvadoran security forces were on alert over the weekend because they knew that the guerrillas ''had been building up to this offensive for two months.''
Members of Congress today denounced the guerrillas and expressed hope that President Cristiani would use the minimum force needed to dislodge the rebels from their strongholds.
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, said that liberals in the United States had been slow to criticize what he called a ''terrorist assault'' by Salvadoran guerrillas. If the Nicaraguan contras, supported by the United States for the last eight years, staged such an attack on Managua, he said, ''the liberals would be queued up'' to condemn them.
 
Condemnation of Rebels
Representative Dave McCurdy, Democrat of Oklahoma, said the Salvadoran rebel offensive showed that ''the F.M.L.N. is a desperate and violent organization that hopes to achieve through terror in the cities what it cannot achieve at the ballot box.'' He said Mr. Cristiani was responding with ''considerable restraint.''
Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the fierce fighting showed the need for his bill to halt the deportation of Salvadorans currently in the United States. The bill has been passed by the House and is being considered in the Senate. Salvadoran officials have said that 500,000 of their countrymen, representing about 10 percent of the population, may be living in the United States.
The Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, the Rev. Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, said today that human rights abuses by the Salvadoran Government and Salvadoran death squads provided some justification for the latest guerrilla offensive. ''There is obviously a link between the Government and the death squads,'' he said.
In an interview here, Father d'Escoto said: ''Cristiani is a decent person. I have no problem with him.'' The Nicaraguan Foreign Minister said that Roberto d'Aubuisson, whom he described as ''a bloodthirsty butcher,'' retains substantial power in El Salvador as a leader of Mr. Cristiani's right-wing Arena party.

HEADLINE: Aid to Cambodia Non-Communists Is Detailed

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Nov. 15

 BODY:
With growing concern in Congress that any American military aid to non-Communist forces in Cambodia could work to the ultimate benefit of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, officials have described the way the current system functions.
The United States, like Britain and the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, insists that it has no ties to Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas and provides them no aid of any kind. China is the Khmer Rouge's sole supplier, officials say, with the help of the Thai Government, which provides transit facilities for Chinese aid and protection for Khmer Rouge notables on Thai soil. 
Aid to the non-Communist Cambodian factions is channeled though an Asean-sponsored organization called the Working Group, which formally consists of Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, but in which American military and intelligence officers participate, as do representatives of the non-Communist Cambodian factions. The Working Group, based in Bangkok, funds the non-Communists and buys them arms.
The Thais and Malaysians do much of the training. The Singaporeans pay for most of the arms, including American weapons made under license in other countries, like South Korea or Taiwan. Those weapons include M-16 assault rifles and anti-tank missiles.
The Americans provide both overt and covert financial aid, but only to purchase nonweapons supplies or fund training in subjects like logistics, map reading and military organization.
Overt aid of $5 million in the fiscal year just ended goes for supplies like medicine and tents. The request for the fiscal year just begun is $7 million.
The covert American aid of some $20 million to $24 million a year, spent by the C.I.A., goes to buy uniforms, some vehicles, rice and canned fish and to reimburse the Thais and Malaysians for the costs of training in ''nonlethal'' skills. The covert funds also pay for some political offices in Bangkok, Tokyo, Bonn and Paris and for two radio stations reaching Cambodia.
The Americans do not provide detailed satellite reconnaissance information to the Cambodians to aid battlefield strategy, though C.I.A. satellite experts sometimes come to brief the Thais or the Working Group.
 
Congressional Monitors
The House and Senate Intelligence committees are heavily involved in monitoring the spending, in part because of widespread abuses in the past, especially by the Thais. Cash no longer goes directly to the Cambodians or the Thais to buy goods, but supplies are purchased by the Americans and then handed over. But cash for the political offices and radio stations is provided by direct payment to the Cambodians.
The Congressional oversight is so thorough, some Asean officials complain, that planning is difficult. But the oversight is also said to insure that no American or Asean aid goes knowingly to the Khmer Rouge. That is not true of United Nations aid, however, which goes to support the 350,000 or so displaced Cambodians living in camps just inside Thailand along the Cambodian border.
These camps exist as bases and captive constituencies for all three resistance factions, including the Khmer Rouge, and food and rations, despite efforts by United Nations officials, are siphoned off to aid the guerrillas.

HEADLINE: Kremlin Faces Conservative Tide Against Change

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Gorbachev Government aclnowledged today that it was bucking an ever more conservative tide of public and political resistance as it prepared to press the national Parliament to endorse radical economic reform.
''The saving of the drowning person is the task of the one who is drowning,'' Deputy Prime Minister Leonid A. Abalkin said, trying to spur the national will toward painful change and strongly rejecting the notion that outside help from the United States can ease the pain significantly.
There can be no further procrastination in the already deferred reforms needed in the antiquated practices of Soviet marketing, pricing, currency and property management, Mr. Abalkin warned, speaking after a special three-day conference of political and economic specialists who looked into the nation's gravely troubled economy.
 
Array of Basic Changes
'''Without restructuring, our country has no future,'' Mr. Abalkin said, pointing toward the next session of the full Parliament on Dec. 12 as the critical forum for moving the long-planned changes beyond the drawing board where they have lingered through most of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's nearly five years as the Soviet leader. 
The elements of the restructuring program have been well known for some time, encompassing a six-year-long array of basic changes in everything from property ownership to the price of bread, changes that are traumatic enough to be giving fresh pause in the gradually democratizing forum of public debate. The only alternatives, the economist warned, were a retreat to rationing and other restrictions that will worsen the downward economic spiral.
''The main goal in the coming year is to assure that the situation does not get worse, that we stop this movement toward the brink of the chasm,'' he declared.
In what amounted to a campaign speech for the latest economic drive, President Gorbachev implored students at a national conference here to resist the growing tendencies to panic and loss of faith.
 
Mindful of Polls
Mr. Gorbachev, clearly mindful of recent polls showing widespread pessimism about his economic program, noted that the future was endangered both by conservatives nostalgic for old-fashioned tyranny and skeptics who favor ''total renunciation of the experience of socialism.''
Mr. Abalkin, an economist and political strategist for the Kremlin program, said the main discovery for him in the three-day conference of experts was not the anticipated complaints that the changes were not radical enough, but rather the increasingly conservative mood of criticism and resistance.
''Maybe it reflects the general situation in the country,'' he said, conceding that the novelties of organized public opinion and the nation's new more competitive, more outspoken electoral process now complicate the process of radical change in this long-time dictatorship.
''There will be a shift to the right,'' the economic chief declared glumly in estimating the looming political fight. ''It will complicate our program but it will not make us retreat,'' he promised.
''If we do not manage our program and stabilize our economy in the next year, a rationing system would become inevitable, and this would be the end of the reform,'' he said, obviously working to bestir the missing ingredient from President Gorbachev's economic prescriptions, strong public support. In fact, rationing is already in effect in most regions for sugar, and is being introduced in some areas for meat and cheese.
'''Congress can be very contradict ory,'' he added, speaking on the basis of a setback earlier this month when the fledgling Parliament rejected the Government's proposals to raise the price of popular goods like cigarettes, beer and caviar. He sidestepped the basic question of what might happen should the Parliament reject the reform program. ''Let them find someone else who can pursue a better program,'' he said, adding that he did not think this would happen.

HEADLINE: Super Negotiator;
With Borders Open, His Job Is Over

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, Nov. 15

 BODY:
After a quarter-century of arranging passage across the Berlin wall for some of the most celebrated prisoners of the 20th century - from spies to C.I.A. pilots to heroes of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union - Wolfgang Vogel may have just lost most of his law practice.
''If I should become unemployed through the changed circumstances, it would be a very happy unemployment indeed,'' he said, sitting in a study lined with pictures of his most famous cases.
Mr. Vogel was a shadowy figure when he first came to public attention in the West in 1962, when he negotiated the exchange of the downed C.I.A. spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers, for the convicted Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and an American student accused of spying in East Germany.
 
Fixer for Both Sides
Nearly a quarter of a century later, he was involved in the 1986 exchange, across the same Glienecke Bridge in the north of Berlin, that freed Natan Sharansky, then known as Anatoly B. Shcharansky, from a Soviet prison camp where he had been jailed for his human rights activities. 
And for nearly as long as the 28 years the Berlin wall divided East from West, Mr. Vogel negotiated the release of thousands of East German political prisoners, their release paid for in hard cash by the West German Government at rates that have risen from $10,000 to $50,000 a head since 1964, according to German officials.
East German officials do not publicly acknowledge this shadowy business at all. West German officials do not like to talk about it, but it began under the auspices of the West German Lutheran Church, which like so many German institutions had more links under and around the wall all these years than it let on.
 
Old Ties to the West
In a way Mr. Vogel, an East German who drives a yellow West German Mercedes, personifies them. His wife, Helga, is from West Germany, and he could travel freely between East and West long before last Thursday, when the new Communist Party leadership under Egon Krenz gave the same right to all 16 million East German citizens.
Mr. Vogel was in West Berlin when that announcement, in effect making the wall porous while leaving it standing, was made. ''I was in West Berlin on the night it went up, the 13th of August 1961, too,'' he said.
For years, East German leaders thought the end of the wall would mean the end of German Democratic Republic. Whether that judgment was right or wrong is not yet something Mr. Vogel is prepared to talk about, nor are his close ties with the deposed Communist leader whose judgment it was, Erich Honecker, now believed to be ill and in a hospital suffering from cancer.
 
A Voice for Honecker
Mr. Honecker called in the lawyer last summer, after the Soviet bloc began to come apart, to try to persuade hundreds of East Germans who had sought asylum in West German embassies in East Berlin, Budapest, Prague and Warsaw that they would be allowed to leave for West Germany if they would first return home.
A few hundred did from Prague, after Mr. Vogel was able to show the Government's good faith by getting it to let two small children whose relatives had simply handed them over the fence to strangers in the West German Embassy grounds, out of the country to rejoin their parents, who had reached West Berlin.
But by last month, tens of thousands of people were flocking to the West German Embassy grounds in Prague. Mr. Honecker, anxious not to spoil the Oct. 7 celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary, consented to let some go west, but the authorities were taking reprisals against their relatives back at home.
 
The Final Straw
And the case that finally drove Mr. Vogel to speak was a family that tried to cross the Neisse River into Poland illegally. The father made it and got out to West Germany, the mother was caught and sent to prison in East Germany and the two small children were put into an orphanage.
''It is impermissible, on the one hand, to allow special exit to West Germany and, on the other hand, to impose prison terms for similar conduct,'' he said then. ''The criminal prosecutions against demonstrators who have committed no acts of violence are also legally questionable.''
Shortly afterward, Mr. Honecker was ousted by the Communist Party Politburo, and last week Mr. Krenz declared the entire East German border with West Germany open for the first time since 1961.
 
Act of Desperation
The sudden decision surprised Mr. Vogel no less than other East Germans, who saw in it an act not so much of calculation as of desperation.
He is as skeptical now of people who say they have always been reformers as of those who lay all the blame for what went wrong on Mr. Honecker's shoulders. ''Everybody has to ask themselves now what they did or failed to do that led to this pass,'' he said.
The new leadership has announced plans for a new law permitting travel abroad without any bureaucratic restrictions. It has said that there will be a new law spelling out the right to assemble freely and petition the Government for grievances, and that the criminal law will be reviewed.
This may quickly lead to a reduction in the number of political crimes, including ''flight from the republic,'' which have kept Mr. Vogel in business over the years.
''Maybe I can even think of enjoying retirement,'' he said, as the telephone rang incessantly with calls from clients and West Germans asking him to go over there for meetings and parties to celebrate his role in bringing about the end of the wall.

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East: Pressure Off Bush;
U.S. Finds Relief in Stand By Gorbachev on the East

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warning that it is too early to talk about restructuring Europe was received with satisfaction in Washington today.
The Soviet leader's comments, made during a meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, made it clear that the Soviet Union, like the United States, was not ready to talk about reunification of Germany, a senior Administration official said.
Mr. Gorbachev has also signaled that he is not willing to tolerate anti-Soviet activity in Eastern Europe or secession from either the Warsaw Pact or the East bloc economic alliance, the official said. Breathing Room for U.S. The official indicated that the United States could work within that framework, and he also appeared to be suggesting that Mr. Gorbachev's strictures give the Administration some breathing room from the high expectations that have arisen for the summit meeting Dec. 2 and 3 on Soviet and American warships anchored off the coast of Malta. 
The opening of the Berlin wall and the easing of travel restrictions in East Germany and Czechoslovakia have given rise to speculation about an impending reunification of Germany and other dramatic events. But the official said Mr. Gorbachev's comments highlighted some of the underlying restraints on rapid change.
In a speech today to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., President Bush said: ''We're not meeting to negotiate the future of Europe. The peoples of Eastern Europe are speaking their own minds about that future.''
Mr. Bush, who called on business, labor and Government to be ''partners and activists'' in helping Poland restructure its economy, said he wants to ''to talk with President Gorbachev about the opportunities to move beyond containment in U.S.-Soviet relations.''
The senior official said the White House hoped that Mr. Gorbachev's remarks will rebut Congressional critics of the Administration who have been saying, as they did last spring before the NATO summit meeting, that Mr. Bush should offer a bold response to the changes in Europe, strong leadership in unsettled times and a clear vision of a new order that could emerge from the current upheaval.
 
A Preference for Quiet
In the past, the White House has often seemed to be ignoring such criticism and, when it reached a fever pitch, pulled out a dramatic initiative, like the proposal on reducing conventional armed forces that Mr. Bush brought to the NATO meeting or the announcement of the secretly arranged Malta meeting. It remains to be seen whether that will happen in Malta.
This time, however, the criticism did not stop after the announcement of the December summit meeting because the changes seemed so momentous and Mr. Bush's response was deemed by his critics to be tepid and not expressive of American excitement about the European changes.
As has become his established practice, Mr. Bush has been restricting planning for the December summit meeting to his closest aides - Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d; John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and his deputy, Robert M. Gates.
Administration officials said that they did not feel pressure, either from their allies or from the pace of events, to change their stance toward the European events and that Mr. Gorbachev's own political and economic problems put the pressure on him, not Mr. Bush.
''Gorbachev has made it clear that there are some very real red lines,'' one senior official said. ''We have time to think about what to do with our institutions.''
Another senior official said the Soviet Union had assured the United States that it would not intervene militarily in Eastern Europe, nor would it use force to crack down on ''peaceful dissent'' within its own borders. ''But they make it very clear that they'd feel free to use whatever force was required to resolve interethnic rivalries that might result in either bloodshed or violence,'' the official said.
''If you start getting into questions about secession and independence, for instance of the Baltics, they've got a very firm view that is a 'no-no' because it could very well lead to the complete dissolution of their entire nation,'' the official said.
 
Speech by Eagleburger
He said Mr. Gorbachev had not sought, nor received, any assurances from Mr. Bush about how the United States would respond to a Soviet crackdown on political dissent, nationalism or ethnic unrest.
In a speech today to the staff of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, said: ''There are a good number of nationalities and ethnic groups in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe who have a very poor record of peaceful coexistence and whom we hope will learn to live together by choice and by virtue of a common stake in an emerging democratic order.''
Mr. Eagleburger's speech suggested that the Administration has better coordinated the statements of its top officials, who had been offering conflicting interpretations of the European upheaval recently.
While Mr. Eagleburger had spoken before about the potential for European instability in Mr. Gorbachev's reforms, he said today that ''glasnost and the process of liberalization which has accompanied it offer the first real hope in the postwar era that the Soviet Union and the nations of the West may someday be linked in a community of shared values.''
 
Dole Defends Bush
On Capitol Hill today, Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, sprang to Mr. Bush's defense. ''He deserves our support,'' Mr. Dole said in a fiery speech. ''He doesn't deserve our nitpicking and petty politicking.''
But Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, continued to criticize Mr. Bush, saying he should convene a NATO summit conference before the Malta meeting. ''I think in this kind of a situation, it would be most important for him to be in a face-to-face meeting with all of the Western leaders at one time,'' Mr. Gephardt said in an interview.
The White House has taken pains to say that it is consulting constantly with its allies. In the last six days, Mr. Baker has talked several times with the French, British and West German Foreign Ministers, one official said.
President Francois Mitterrand will brief Mr. Bush either by telephone or through his embassy after a weekend meeting of the European Community, according to American officials and West European diplomats here. Mr. Bush will also meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain at Camp David on Nov. 24.

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East: Remarks to Congress;
Excerpts From Address by Walesa

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech today by Lech Walesa to a joint meeting of Congress:
In the days before the Second World War, there were many people who asked: Why should we die for Gdansk? Isn't it better to stay at home? But war soon paid them a visit, and they had to start dying for Paris, for London, for Hawaii. This time too, there were many who complained: There is that Gdansk again disturbing our peace.
But the recent developments in Gdansk carried a different meaning. This was not the beginning but the true end of that war. This was the beginning of a new, better, democratic and safe era in the history of our world. There is no longer a question of dying for Gdansk but of living for it. 
Peacefully and prudently, with their eyes open to dangers, but not giving up what is right and necessary, the Poles gradually pave the way for historic transformations. We are joined along this way, albeit to various extents, by others: Hungarians and Russians, the Ukrainians and people of the Baltic Republics, Armenians and Georgians, and, in recent days, the East Germans. We wish them luck and rejoice at each success they achieve. We are certain that others will also take our road, since there is no other choice.
 
Understanding From Gorbachev
I ask now: Is there any sensible man understanding the world around him who could now say that it would be better if the Poles kept quiet because what they are doing is jeopardizing world peace? Couldn't we rather say that Poles are doing more to preserve and consolidate peace than many of their frightened advisers? Could we not say that stability and peace face greater threats from countries which have not yet brought themselves to carry out long-ranging and comprehensive reforms, which do their utmost to preserve the old and disgraced ways of government, contrary to the wishes of their societies?
Things are different in Poland. And I must say that our task is viewed with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This understanding lays foundations for new relations between Poland and the U.S.S.R., much better than before. . . . ...
In the Second World War, Poland was the first country to fall victim of aggression. Her losses in terms of human life and national property were the heaviest. . . . . In 1945 she was, theoretically speaking, one of the victors. Theory, however, had little in common with practice. In practice, as her allies looked on in tacit consent, there was imposed on Poland an alien system of government, without precedent in Polish tradition, unaccepted by the nation, together with an alien economy, an alien law, an alien philosophy of social relations. . . .
The atrocities were followed by persecutions of all those who dared think independently. All the solemn pledges about free elections in Poland that were made in Yalta were broken.
Exclusion From Marshall Plan
. . . Stalin forbade Poland to use aid provided by the Marshall Plan, the aid that was used by everyone in Western Europe, including countries which lost the war. It is worth recalling this great American plan, which helped Western Europe to protect its freedom and peaceful order. And now it is the moment when Eastern Europe awaits an investment of this kind - an investment in freedom, democracy and peace - an investment adequate to the greatness of the American nation.
But on our path there looms a serious obstacle, a grave danger. Our long subjection to a political system incompatible with national traditions, to a system of economy incompatible with rationality and common sense, coupled with the stifling of independent thought and disregard for national interests. All this has led the Polish economy to ruin, to the verge of utter catastrophe. The first government in fifty years elected by the people and serving the people has inherited from the previous rulers of the country a burden of tremendous debts they incurred and subsequently wasted, of an economy organized in a manner preventing it from satisfying even the basic needs of the people.
The economy we inherited after almost five decades of Communist rule is in need of thorough overhaul. This will require patience and great sacrifice. This will require time and means. . . . Today all the countries of the Eastern Bloc are bankrupt. The Communist economy has failed in every part of the world. . . .
We know that America has her own problems and difficulties, some of them very serious. We are not asking for charity, or expecting philanthropy. But we would like to see our country treated as a partner and a friend.
We have heard many beautiful words of encouragement. These are appreciated, but, being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now.

HEADLINE: Bush Backs House Plan on Raise and Ethics Rules

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Bush today endorsed a package that would raise the salary for House members and top Government officials by more than a third and tighten rules on ethics.
Mr. Bush's endorsement was widely seen as crucial in assuring passage of the measure, which already has the support of Republican and Democratic leaders in the House. At a news conference this afternoon, the leaders predicted that the bill would win approval by the House on Thursday, culminating a yearlong effort to revise the House rules and raise the lawmakers' pay.
''I believe it will receive a strong majority from both parties,'' said Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House. 
 
Senate Working on Plan
Senate leaders are working on a separate package governing their salary and outside income. In addition, a bipartisan group introduced an ethics bill today intended to tighten restrictions on travel, gifts and lobbying by senators, senior senate staff members, and top Federal officials once they leave the Government.
The Senate could consider the House package as early as Friday, in additional to whatever measure their own leadership produces.
In a letter to Mr. Foley today, President Bush endorsed both the salary increase and the ethical provisions of the measure. ''I fully support the reforms you are prepared to bring before the House of Representatives this week,'' Mr. Bush declared. ''I am also pleased that you have made essential adjustments in compensation for individuals in all three branches of Government.''
The package, whose details were made public today, includes a 7.9 percent salary increase that officials said was meant to make up for inflation for House members, judges and top Government officials, to take effect in 1990. It also includes a 25 percent pay increase in 1991 for those officials, along with another adjustment that year tied to cost-of-living increases. House leaders estimated it would raise the salaries for those officials from a current level of $89,500 to about $125,000 in 1991.
Mr. Bush's statement of support came after last-minute negotiations between the House and the White House. Lawmakers felt the measure would be impossible to pass without a strong statement of Presidential support to help protect House members against a public outcry and potential harm in next year's elections. Earlier this year, when a 51 percent pay increase was proposed, public opposition was so strong Congress eventually abandoned the effort.
Officials said the the current package was also the most extensive revision of the ethical rules and standards of the House in more than a decade, an effort to clarify and strengthen the guidelines that were at the heart of the ethical storm on Capitol Hill this year that toppled the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas.
 
'Restores the Public Trust'
''We want to make sure Congress restores the public trust by doing a better a job of writing, understanding and living with ethical standards and rules,'' said Representative Vic Fazio, the California Democrat who was co-chairman the bipartisan group that produced this package, along with Representative Lynn Martin, Republican of Illinois.
The measure would ban the outside speaking fees that many House members receive and which many critics consider veiled efforts to curry favor. It would also impose new limits on outside earnings. Currently, members can earn up to 30 percent of their Congressional salary in outside income. The new package would cut that to 15 percent and prohibit the earning of directors fees, legal fees and other professional services income.
Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, noted today that the Constitution stipulates that lawmakers shall be ''paid out of the treasury of the United States'' and said it was time for the House to end its reliance on outside sources of income.
''Either because of our ineptness, our incapability or our cowardice in addressing the subject of pay for members, we've resorted to a circuitious route by way of outside income and honoraria,'' said Mr. Michel, a prime mover behind this package.
Under the package, a House member would still be able to give a speech and have the sponsor donate the money to charity.
 
Rewrite Rules on Gifts
The measure also rewrites the rules on gifts, which were the subject of fierce disputes and conflicting interpretations in the Wright affair. Currently, House rules say members cannot accept gifts worth more than $100 from anyone with a ''direct interest'' in legislation. Mr. Wright and the ethics committee had sharply differed over the definition of ''direct interest.''
The new rules simply ban the acceptance of gifts worth more than $200 a year from anyone other than a relative.
The measure would also limit the travel expenses a member could accept for participation in an event or conference. Currently, the rules do not spell out a specific time limit; the new rules would say a member could accept no travel expense for a trip lasting more than four days, and for a trip overseas lasting more than seven days.
It also abolishes a provison in the law governing the use of campaign funds. Currently, members elected before 1980 can convert campaign funds to personal use once they retire. Under the new rules, such members would have to retire by 1993 to convert that money to personal use.
The rules also provide for a variety of new reporting requirements. And, reflecting the reservations many lawmakers said they felt about the ethics committee process in the aftermath of the Wright affair, the measure would significantly revamp the way the House investigates and disciplines its own members.
Currrently, the same committee functions essentially as grand jury and judge, deciding whether to bring charges and then deciding whether the charges are warranted. This measure would create separate subcommittees to perform those functions.

HEADLINE: Showdown for Congressional Honor

 BODY:
President Bush's welcome endorsement enhances prospects for House passage of an ethics package that would begin to break the cozy financial ties between the nation's top lawmakers and government favor-seekers. That shifts the main focus of the ethics debate to the Senate, so far reluctant to act on fundamental reform.
The House is expected to vote today on a reasonable pay raise combined with a ban on the backdoor honorarium fees most members now pocket for speaking and meeting with private interest groups. 
The honorariums have become an open scandal. Representatives and senators collected more than $9 million in such fees last year alone. Meanwhile, the lack of Congressional pay increases has held down salaries of Federal judges, Cabinet officers and other high officials, whose pay remains linked to that of Congress.
Ralph Nader, who helped defeat a more ambitious 51 percent pay raise proposed by a Presidential commission in January, also opposes the new pay initiative as unneeded and undeserved. His stance ignores reality. Adjusted for inflation, the $89,500 annual salary paid to lawmakers is less than the $42,500 Congress was paid 20 years ago. And it grows harder and harder to recruit talented people for important Federal positions when rookie lawyers in major law firms are paid nearly as much as senior Federal judges, and some state health officials earn more than the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Approval of the House package would be a challenge to the Senate, still debating the terms of its own ethics plan. Some senators prefer to take a modest cost of living increase and leave the indefensible honorarium system essentially intact.
Along with the President, House Speaker Thomas Foley and the House minority leader, Robert Michel, deserve much praise for accepting the need to end honorariums and face the heat generated by any bill containing a Congressional pay raise. Today's roll-call in the House will say much about members' opinions of themselves, their institution and the public's ultimate good sense.
A positive vote would leave the Senate alone to explain why elected officials can't get along without hefty salary supplements from favor-seekers.

HEADLINE: Preservation of New York Adirondack Park Wins Wide Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century has held 12 meetings in the last three weeks; six in and near the Adirondack Park, six more across New York State from Buffalo to New York City. The commission has listened to hundreds of people express their concerns for the future of the park. Your Oct. 26 report of the Saranac Lake meeting, stating that the region and state are at odds, does not make clear that the meeting was an anomaly in tone and content. 
Testimony for strengthened efforts to preserve the open space character of the park has been overwhelming. At public meetings in Glens Falls, Watertown, Old Forge, Plattsburgh and Schenectady, scores of park residents called for strong, innovative action to protect the park's natural resources and local communities.
Again and again, the commission has been told that regulatory loopholes should be plugged; a continuing fund source for state land acquisition should be created; the state's easement program should be used widely to protect timber resources; economic development should be on a scale appropriate to the park; a single vision of a park should focus on the activities of all state agencies.
Even at the Saranac Lake meeting, it was evident that there are not two camps - one for protecting the park and one against. A complex mosaic of concerns was expressed. The six-million-acre Adirondack Park is the largest park in the United States outside Alaska and includes the greatest wilderness system east of the Mississippi. Some 58 percent of the land within the park's ''blue line'' boundary is privately owned. The remainder is state land held ''forever wild'' as part of the Forest Preserve.
The crazy-quilt pattern of state and private land means that the use made of each has impact on the other. The pace of subdivision and development (permit applications increased more than 200 percent from 1986 to 1988; 50,000 new lots created in the last 20 years) has aroused deep concern for the future of the park. Changes in the economic forces affecting the timber and agricultural industries have also created serious concern for the future.
The striking thing about the recent meetings on the future of the Adirondacks is not that a few wish to eliminate the Adirondack Park Agency, but that most wish to see the values of the park reflected and preserved through effective land-use management and economic development that is both appropriately scaled and sustainable.

HEADLINE: Misleading Birth Data

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 31 report that United States births are reaching the 1950's levels of four million is misleading.
The 1988 population was 246 million, more than 60 percent above the 1950 population of 152 million. Now we have nearly the same number of births. We need a birth rate of 2.05 per woman of childbearing age to maintain a zero-growth population. The birth rate by your own figures has been below 2 since 1973.
Our population will continue to increase for two reasons: (1) net immigration to our country, and (2) extended life expectancy. The drastically shifted ratio of retired to employed people will face major problems in the economy. The aberration is the coincidence of a lower birth rate and a larger population producing nearly the same number of births as in the 50's.

HEADLINE: On Not Flying Into a Greenhouse Frenzy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The White House is to be commended for not rushing into a hasty agreement to apply controls on the emission of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas (news story, Oct. 27). Despite so-called international pressure, generated mainly by lower-level bureaucrats to force the hand of the President, and huge news media publicity about impending doom, there is considerable doubt in the scientific community about the greenhouse climate warming. 
John Sununu, White House chief of staff, rightly questions the economic wisdom of limiting use of fossil fuels, including oil and coal. Policies suggested are often counterproductive. Extreme conservation measures -e.g., rapidly replacing older energy-using equipment - waste money, resources and energy. We don't want to force people to throw out all cars but compacts. Many renewable energy sources (e.g., solar) are not yet competitive - or folks would be buying them without coercion.
Many antipollution policies lower energy efficiency, putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere: methanol production uses up to 50 percent of the input energy; smokestack scrubbers lower the efficiency of electricity generation; chlorofluorocarbon phaseout means lower-efficiency refrigerators and air-conditioners.
In any case, unilateral actions would produce only marginal results, slightly postponing the date when effective greenhouse gas content doubles. Even costly and coercive controls would merely shift the ''doubling date'' from perhaps 2040 to 2045. And studies show that carbon dioxide controls shift costs from developing to industrialized countries.
Prudent policies exist: gradual improvements in efficiency in response to higher energy prices; a highway user fee (gasoline tax); nuclear energy wherever cost-effective. All these are worth doing even if there is no greenhouse effect. But is the public ready and are politicians courageous enough?

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
What Bush Could Say

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
My fellow Americans, You and I share a rare moment in the lives of any people. A new chapter is opening in human history, and we are privileged to see it. I come to you tonight to speak of the great change that is taking place, and of the part I believe our country can play in it.
The people of Eastern Europe, who for 40 years have been denied the right to decide their own fate, are reclaiming that right. The walls of fear and isolation are crumbling. 
You know me as a cautious man, one who thinks a wise politician should be prudent. I want to assure you that I have felt the same emotions you have at the scenes of the crowds crossing the border in Berlin. It is not an easy thing to put into words, but the feelings are there: wonder, happiness, awe.
Americans have reason to feel some pride, too, in what is happening. For our steadfastness helped to make it possible. Harry Truman drew the line at Stalin's aggression. Dwight Eisenhower brought together, as their first commander, the European and American forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. John Kennedy stood at the Berlin wall and voiced our commitment to freedom.
But what we are seeing these days is not a victory for party or country. It is a victory for humanity. That is the spirit in which we should approach the many questions that now face us: not to gloat but to think how a new Europe can be free and prosperous and stable. Those aims are in the interests of all the states involved, East and West.
The first thing to say is that the issues are primarily for Europeans to decide. America is not going to tell them how to write the new page in their history. When I meet President Gorbachev next month, I can assure you I will not try to make some kind of a deal with him about the future of Europe. Malta will not be Yalta.
And you know, I do not think Mr. Gorbachev will want to do that either. It is right to say here what we all know, that the human yearning for freedom has broken through at this time because a Soviet leader recognized that it was not in conflict with his country's real interests.
Many of us were skeptical when President Gorbachev said the members of the Warsaw Pact should decide their own futures. We remembered Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968. But he has stood by his words, and they are daily becoming deeds. We think the changes in Eastern Europe will be helpful to perestroika, his effort to reconstruct the Soviet economy. And we wish him well.
But the United States and the Soviet Union are inevitably part of the transition to a new Europe. There are 550,000 Soviet soldiers in Eastern Europe, and 300,000 American soldiers in West Germany.
Any sudden unilateral slash in those forces could be destabilizing. The right place to talk about reductions is in the negotiations already under way. Those talks are now urgent. We both have better things to do with our young men and women than to maintain troops in a Europe that is finding its own destiny.
And we have better things to do with our resources. To speak only of our own country, we Americans know that we have many unmet needs: for better schools, health care, highways and bridges, the renewal of our cities. We can hope, now, that in time we will be able to maintain an adequate defense at lower costs - and use the savings for those other needs.
Without intruding on our European friends, I think I can say one thing more. Their vision of security is based not alone on arms, but on political and economic relationships. Europe today has a structure, the European Community, that acts as a magnet of interdependence and increasing unity.
The United States has been in favor of greater European unity from the beginning. The Marshall Plan, when we offered it to a Europe devastated by war, called on the Europeans to create cooperative institutions. We supported Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle and the other great statesmen who brought France and Germany out of their ancient enmity to become close allies. We supported the creation of the community.
We are not afraid of a strong, free, united Europe. We know something about the difficulties of bringing independent states to a common enterprise; the creation of the United States 200 years ago was not so easy. But we are convinced that in Europe, as in America, there can be diversity within unity, bringing greater security and liberty for all.
I know I speak for all Americans when I say that we are watching the other side of the Atlantic with admiration and anticipation. Thank you, and good night.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Those Poor Devils

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
United States Government officials who are charged with estimating the scope of the Soviet threat have told The New York Times they think Moscow's spending on arms in 1989 has been less than in 1988.
If true, that marks a stunning change. For his first four years, Mikhail Gorbachev talked reform but placated his power base in the Red Army by increasing arms spending. In his fifth year, except for strategic weaponry, he has begun to cut back. 
Our analysts (they like to be identified as analysts) say the amount spent on arms, which had been estimated at 16 percent of national output, is down this year to 15 percent, compared with 6 percent in the U.S.
That estimate of that level is in dispute; Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist who was twice quoted in Secretary James Baker's testimony to the Senate Finance Committee last month, has long held that the actual percentage, including dual-use production, is far higher, making the strain on the Soviet system even more intolerable.
But set that long-burning dispute aside; more important than the actual level of non-strategic spending is its downward trend. It means that Mr. Gorbachev has been forced by circumstance to begin to risk offending his army leaders.
He does this with great caution: in planning to cut the size of the army by 10 percent, he has promised to raise the salaries of those remaining by 8 percent, saving little in the near term. And the 100,000 officers cannot be mustered out right away, say our analysts, because no civilian housing is available for them and their families.
The great question: Why is the Kremlin doing this? The answer was suggested in the same briefing in which we learned that less is being spent on tanks, planes and guns.
The Soviet Union's deficit last year was 9 percent of its national product. That was frightening to Soviet leaders; when the U.S. deficit reached 3 percent of our G.N.P., American politicians were scared into the Gramm-Rudman automatic discipline. But the Soviet rate was triple our own.
Now, with all the belt-tightening and market experiments, what does Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika balance sheet show this year? Our analyst's preliminary estimate for the 1989 Soviet deficit is nearly 14 percent of Soviet national product.
The estimate of that sea of red ink comes from the crowd here that has been consistently underestimating Soviet arms spending and economic difficulty. The deficit reality is probably worse, up around 20 percent. No wonder the Kremlin leadership is finally cutting conventional arms spending. It has no choice; that country is going over the cliff.
Imagine what would happen here if the American budget deficit ballooned to 14 percent, or $700 billion a year. To avert disaster, Republicans would grimly propose cuts in defense and Social Security. Democrats would be for raising taxes and clapping controls on spiraling wages and prices. Either way, we would treat the crisis seriously.
Faced with that crisis, caught in a cycle of shortages and strikes, Mr. Gorbachev is merely beginning to reduce arms spending with as little pain as possible to the officer corps. Otherwise, he is emulating Nero's fiddling: with prices controlled as deficits rise, he prints more money to chase after fewer goods and rails against the import of capitalism.
What should he do? Dean Charles Wolf of the Rand Graduate School urges genuine monetary reform: to sop up the unspendable cash overhang, create a ''new'' ruble with large holdings converted into nontradable 10-year bonds, sell many state assets to the people - and then let the market determine all prices.
''There'd be riots in the streets if we did that,'' a top economic adviser to Mr. Gorbachev told me last year. They still resist the salvation of the profit motive; gradualism is killing them.
The last thing America should do is to take the heat off with trade, aid, bonds, GATT invitations and like palliatives. It is not for us to subsidize their subsidy of Cuba or to reduce their difficulty in modernizing weaponry.
Red ink concentrates the mind. At Malta, Mr. Bush should press for the great conventional-force meltdown to parity and an immediate end to the Soviet underwriting of Caribbean Stalinism; he might helpfully suggest a leap into a market economy.
The President adjures us not to taunt or gloat if our longtime adversaries seek to stay afloat by jettisoning heavy cannon. That is in the American tradition: when his crew shouted as a salvo hit an enemy ship off the coast of Cuba, Capt. John Woodward Philip called out, ''Don't cheer, men, those poor devils are dying.''

HEADLINE: When an It Is Labeled A He or a She

BYLINE: By SANDRA SALMANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINTERTHUR, Del., Nov. 10

 BODY:
The Hall of Flame in Phoenix houses one man's formidable display of fire engines - the largest in the world, according to its brochure. In nearby Scottsdale, the Mouse House is an exhibition of 3,000 mice fabricated from cloth, plastic, wood and other materials that had been collected by the same man's first wife.
Men collect images of power; women collect the diminutive and the domestic. One always suspected it, but now it has the official stamp of academia from two business professors who have been researching the subject of collecting. From a sampling of 200 collectors, the professors, Russell Belk of the University of Utah and Melanie Wallendorf of the University of Arizona, reported that men tend to collect cars, rare books and sports items, while women go in for animal replicas and the decorative arts. 
Their findings were among the papers presented at a conference Nov. 9 to 11 on gender and ''material culture,'' anthropologists' term for the study of the objects made and used by a civilization. The conference was sponsored by Winterthur Museum and Gardens. Winterthur, near Wilmington, is the former country estate of the Du Pont family and is now a museum for American artifacts from the 17th to the 19th centuries.
For three days, some 200 academicians and museum curators explored the way gender has been stamped - either explicitly, through design, or implicitly, through perception - on objects from diapers to cars, and how gender imprinting affects the way objects that are innately neuter are treated.
Researchers cited several areas of design, like cars and interior decorating, where objects have become increasingly neutral. But they also found many objects, like toys or Princess telephones, in which gender differences have been created or reinforced through marketing, and other areas, like cosmetics, where perception of gender identity has resisted the best marketing efforts of manufacturers.
Material culture holds a somewhat uneasy place in academia; a graduate student at the conference grumbled that one of her professors dismissed it as ''pots and pans history.''
But Michael Aaron Rockland, chairman of the American studies department at Rutgers University, noted that the ''nice thing about material culture is that there are things you can talk about.''
Most people at the conference were women, and there was a general lament that objects stamped as feminine are instantly devalued or trivialized. For example, Dr. Belk noted that visitors must pay to get into the fire-engine museum, while entry to the Mouse House is free.
If there was any consensus, it was ''a call for a gender-free approach'' to how behavior is evaluated, said Kenneth Ames, a professor of early American culture at Winterthur, which also offers graduate-degree programs in art conservation and the history of American civilization.
Baby clothing, which was neutral for centuries, was branded with gender identities relatively recently, said Dr. Jo Paoletti, an associate professor in the department of textiles and consumer economics at the University of Maryland. For 300 years, American infants of both sexes were dressed alike, generally in white frocks. That changed shortly after the turn of the century, Dr. Paoletti said, when psychologists suggested that gender identification was influenced by nurture as well as nature.
Boys got trousers, girls got dresses and the sexes were color-coded. Around World War I, the boys wore pink (''a stronger, more decided'' color, the literature of the day declared), and the girls blue (''delicate, dainty''). It was only after World War II that pink and blue assumed their current identities; Dr. Paoletti was unable to explain why.
Now infants' clothes, along with their toys, are even more gender-specific, Dr. Paoletti said. ''The baby boomers were the first generation to be color-coded'' in today's color schemes, she noted. There are Luvs diapers for boys (blue, decorated with trains) and for girls (pink, with balloons). Even christening gowns - the last vestige of the dress for boys - have been phased out in favor of robes with white satin bow ties.
Initially, the automobile's inventors thought the internal-combustion machine, which was fast, dirty and had a hand crank, was masculine. They tried to sell women on sluggish electric models, said Dr. Virginia Scharff, a historian at the University of New Mexico. When women said they preferred the gasoline-powered cars, she said, manufacturers replaced hand cranks with electric starters and enclosed the cars.
''Each improvement that made the car safer or more comfortable was treated as a concession to women, catering to their softness,'' Dr. Scharff said. In fact, she continued, ''it allowed the car makers to protect the masculine image of men'' while giving them the changes they wanted, too. Now, ''the automobile has become more androgynous,'' she said.
Many of the papers focused on the American quilt, which has increasingly been elevated from a craft to an art. Researchers complained that by moving the quilt from the bed to the museum wall, art critics and curators have overlooked its original significance. They noted that women used quilt-making as a means of forming friendships and raising money for their communities.
Dr. Beverly Gordon, an assistant professor in the department of environment, textiles and design at the University of Wisconsin, said men and women perceive quilts differently because they relate to objects at different distances: men prefer more abstract, impersonal distances, and women favor intimate spaces.
One matter of hot debate was where an AIDS quilt that serves as a national memorial fits into the tradition of women's quilt-making. The quilt, made by the friends and families of people who have died of AIDS, consists of 11,000 panels, each 3 by 6 feet. It is so immense that the Names Project, the San Francisco group in charge of it, recently said it would no longer be displayed in its entirety.
''The scale doesn't relate,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''It's not an intimate object.''
But Betty Blair, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Los Angeles, maintained that the AIDS quilt embodies qualities traditionally considered feminine: it is nonthreatening and permits mourning.
Finally, she said, the quilt, like women, emphasizes relationships. In some patches, she said, ''the quilters have put their own names. People are literally sewn together.''

Supporters of Government backing for initiatives to maintain American high-technology industries said the Bush Administration plans sharp cuts in Defense Department programs that bolster research and development. Since Monday, reports have circulated in Washington that the Administration has directed the Pentagon to cut back financing for high-definition television research and other high-technology efforts. Such programs are viewed by many as vital to American competitiveness. [Page A1.] Sun Microsystems and Unisys said they would not participate in U.S. Memories, a company being formed to produce computer memory chips. [D1.]

HEADLINE: Inventories Up by 0.2%; Sales Off 0.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Growth of business inventories outpaced business sales in September, the Government said today in a report that analysts said contained a warning of growing backlogs because of the slowing economy.
The Commerce Department reported that inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed two-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $791.8 billion, after advancing four-tenths of 1 percent in August.
Business sales, on the other hand, fell three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $524.6 billion, after a 3 percent gain the previous month. 
 
Ratio Rises to 1.51
The business activity produced a slight increase in the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months to exhaust inventories at the September pace. It was 1.50 in August.
''At the moment, the ratios do not appear excessive,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company. ''But they show the first signs of increases related to a declining business climate.''
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, agreed that on the surface the report suggested inventories were not yet a problem.
''But there are some warning signals in it of some excess at the consumer level,'' he said.
Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as output exceeds demand, a process that could lead to production cuts and loss of jobs. The economy has been experiencing sluggishness as the Federal Reserve tries to contain inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit.
 
Retail Inventories Rise
Retail inventories, up 1 percent in September, were of particular concern since an earlier report indicated they could be worse in October. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales fell 1 percent in October, including a 5.1 percent decline in car sales.
Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of the total, slipped one-tenth of 1 percent and wholesale backlogs, accounting for 25 percent of the total, dropped three-tenths of 1 percent.
Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent in September. Retail and wholesale sales were both up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Overall inventories were 6.4 percent above those of a year ago. Sales rose 6.7 percent over September 1988.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Head Urges Argentina to Make a Debt Payment

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The chairman of Citicorp said today that creditor banks would not talk with Argentina about reducing its $64 billion in foreign debt until they had received a ''good faith'' payment on back interest, estimated at $5.3 billion. No interest has been paid since April 1988.
The chairman, John S. Reed, did not cite a specific sum during a news conference here, but other financial experts said the committee of creditor banks rejected an Argentine offer of $50 million last week. 
About $40 billion of Argentina's total foreign debt is owed to commercial banks, and Citibank has the largest outstanding bank debt, $1.5 billion.
Ricardo Handley, Citibank's president in Argentina, said the banks had said, ''Give us a signal that this time this is serious.''
Mr. Reed, in Buenos Aires to observe the institution's 75th anniversary in Argentina, painted a generally optimistic picture of the progress in resolving the third world debt crisis, but indicated that Argentina would be one of the slower and more difficult cases.
''The Argentine economy isn't doing as well as the others, and it may take two years to get an agreement,'' he said, after describing more positive situations in Mexico, the Philippines, Chile and Venezuela.
Mr. Reed, who met on Tuesday with President Carlos Saul Menem, said ''Mr. Menem understands very well the direction in which he has to go'' in restructuring the Argentine economy but still has to ''orchestrate'' it.
Referring to the options under the Bush Administration's plan for resolving the third world debt crisis, the Brady plan, named for Treasury Secretary Nicolas F. Brady, the Citicorp chairman said the possibilities were: ''Either pay it, exchange debt for something else, go into the market and buy it, or make an arrangement like Mexico's involving exit bonds.''
But, Mr. Reed added, neither the banks nor the Argentine Government knows yet how these possibilities may be applied to Argentina's debt. ''This is going to take time,'' he said.
He indirectly criticized the Argentine Government for having spent $400 million in reserves a few weeks ago to defend the exchange rate of the national currency, the austral, on the black market. At the beginning of last week, the Government halted its intervention, and the American dollar quickly rose about 30 percent above its official rate. The amount spent defending the austral equaled about a month's interest on the foreign debt.
''Seeing the Government spend that money causes concern among bankers,'' Mr. Reed said, ''because that money has now left the country.''
He estimated flight capital, holdings by private Argentines outside the country, at $45 billion to $50 billion, but some professional estimates are as high as $60 billion.
Argentina, with the third-highest foreign debt in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico, also has one of the highest ratios of flight capital to debt.

HEADLINE: G.A.O. Sees Losses in Loan Efforts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The myriad of rapidly expanding Federal insurance and credit-assistance programs exposes the Government to losses of $5 trillion, equal to the value of the economy's total annual output, the General Accounting Office reported today.
Not only are defaults in the programs continuing to increase, the Congressional investigative agency said, but the full magnitude of past losses has not yet been fully recorded because of poor management and inconsistent application of accounting principles by the managing government agencies.
The programs include guaranteeing the repayment of home mortgages, insuring crops and bank deposits and making direct loans to farmers and businesses seeking export orders. Those guaranteeing loans alone number 110, with the programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development accounting for nearly half of them, the report said. 
 
Student Loan Program
The data also noted that the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, managed by the Education Department, experienced one of the highest default rates, growing to more than $1.4 billion in 1988, from $486 million in 1983.
Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who requested the tabulation, said in releasing the report that it also showed that the Government was playing a ''shell game'' by not including some of the programs in the Federal budget to hold down the deficit, thereby masking the future liability of taxpayers. The programs create contingent liabilities that show up in the budget as expenditures after a default or other loss occurs.
''In effect, every single American has co-signed a note for $20,000,'' Mr. Dingell said, saying that present budget-cutting efforts involved mere ''pocket change'' compared with potential outlays from the Government's loan and insurance activities.
Mr. Dingell added that while ''not every program is in trouble,'' some are ''in a serious enough state to be cause for concern.''
The compilation by the G.A.O., which began this summer, drew mainly on existing data but is believed to be the first to put such figures in one place, said Jeffrey C. Steinhoff, who supervised the work.
He said that while the Government in recent years had improved its recognition and documentation of financial management deficiencies, defaults and other trends continued to worsen.
The office, however, made no policy recommendations in the report.
The document placed the programs into one of four categories: insurance commitments, which are valued at $3.6 trillion; outstanding loans of $666 billion by Government-sponsored enterprises; outstanding guaranteed loans of $550 billion, and outstanding direct loans of $222 billion.
Reflecting budgetary restraints, direct loan commitments have declined by $35 billion, or by 13.6 percent, since 1985, but the totals for the other categories are mounting rapidly. In 1965, the four categories totaled $438 million, less than 10 percent of their current $5 trillion.
 
'Cannot be Ignored'
''While the Government will undoubtedly not be required to provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with these programs, its continuing and growing exposure to losses cannot be ignored,'' the G.A.O. said in the report.
Such Federally sponsored organizations as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks generally do not have their obligations expressly guaranteed by the Government, but the agency said that Washington's ''past willingness to assist'' meant that it would be expected to cover losses.
The premiums charged for various loans or guarantees, the agency said, are often designed to cover only a portion of program costs.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Tighter Money And Stock Prices

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
A TIGHT money supply has traditionally been a harbinger of coming contractions in the financial markets. When there is less monetary growth or liquidity is low, it is generally believed, there will be less money around to push up the prices of assets, including stocks.
With some of the shifts in the developed economies over the last decade and the closer coordination of monetary policies and currency valuation among the Group of Seven nations, measuring the money supply has become a more tenuous enterprise. Close integration of national financial markets has made it possible to move enormous sums of money across borders quickly and efficiently. But integration also makes it harder to know just how much is in a particular economy. 
For the last 18 months or so, the growth of the money supply has been anemic, reflecting the Federal Reserve's tight policy. Since May or June, the rate of monetary growth in the United States increased slightly as growing concern about recession led the Fed to ease its grip slightly. But the increases in liquidity still trail growth in the gross national product.
''What we're seeing in the long-term trend is that the Federal Reserve is tightly controlling liquidity over all, but in the shorter term they have loosened in the last three months,'' said Larry Kudlow, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. Mr. Kudlow, who follows the adjusted monetary base and total bank reserves to keep tabs on liquidity in the economy, and many other Fed watchers see little long-term policy impact from the recent easing.
Despite the evident link between tight money supply and contracting equities markets, it would seem that the stock market lately has largely ignored the downward pressure that the lack of extra money in the economy could be expected to have on stock prices, but a few analysts are taking note.
According to Suresh L. Bhirud, Oppenheimer & Company's chief portfolio strategist, the market has been too focused on takeover speculation to notice that the monetary liquidity numbers have been pointing to a drop in high-flying stock prices. He regards the 190-point drop of Oct. 13 as another indication that asset prices have peaked and will be heading down. Mr. Bhirud is forecasting continued consolidation of the market by year-end and a mini-recession by the third or fourth quarter of 1990.
''We had a contraction in money growth until June, and it was calling for some sort of contraction in the stock market and that has now taken place,'' he said, adding that further contraction might not be in jolting declines but a trending downward.
Despite shifts in the traditional correlation between money supply figures and real economic and market activity, Mr. Bhirud argues that in this unusually protracted bull market it pays to watch the amount of money in the system.
''The low liquidity in general means that there will be a downward pressure on asset prices, not just stocks,'' he said. ''Asset prices have been bid up, and there's just not enough money out there to support higher prices. When this develops, the most illiquid assets, like real estate, for example, start first to turn down in price. The real estate market has already turned down.''
Mr. Kudlow, who agrees that the Fed has been following a ''scarce money'' path, views the fight against inflation, however, as being what the equities market is most concerned about, so that tight credit policies encourage higher stock prices.
''The markets savor relatively tight money because market sentiment wants lower inflation that brings down interest rates,'' Mr. Kudlow said. ''The stock and bond markets do not want a loose Fed policy; they like the monetary scarcity because it foreshadows low interest rates and improves confidence in dollar-denominated financial assets.''
The key question here is whether the market is most concerned at this point with the inflation rate or the high stock prices in the context of declining corporate profits and slow money growth. It seems likely that as the reality of falling earnings and tight money sink in, investors may start taking their profits and waiting for the next downturn.
''When you are in a period of significant cyclical weakness,'' Mr. Bhirud said, ''that is, if the economy is weak or corporate profits are bad, then low inflation becomes almost irrelevant. If returns on assets are declining, and corporate profits are clearly going down, people tend to sell before things get too bad.''
As for foreign capital propping up stock prices, according to Mr. Bhirud and other investment strategists, foreign buying of American stocks has come to a screeching halt since Oct. 13, although foreigners have been buyers of Government securities.
''We've had the foreign liquidity coming in, but now it has stopped,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert's senior investment strategist. Mrs. Cohen added that foreign investors were now waiting to see what happened here before they committed new capital.

Moody's Lowers Ratings On Debt of Massachusetts

 BODY:
The ratings on as much as $8.5 billion in Massachusetts debt have been reduced by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation placed the state under review for possible downgrading.
The action of Moody's reduced the state's long-term debt rating to Baa-1, from A. It came on the eve of a sale by Massachusetts of $140 million short-term general obligation notes for financing a deficit in the Medicaid program that provides financial support for medical bills of the needy. 
The rating change by Moody's reflects the agency's concern over the magnitude of the state's projected deficit of $721 million. The agency said that a rise in taxes might be needed.
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's kept its rating on the state at A, but placed it under review for possible downgrading if Massachusetts did not resolve its difficulties by next month.
When borrowing in the debt market, lower debt ratings mean that lenders will demand higher compensation in the form of higher interest rates for the borrower.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Overseas, But Posts Advance in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday in domestic trading against major foreign currencies after declining overseas.
Gold prices fell in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $391.30 an ounce, down $2 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $390.90 an ounce, off $1.60.
Ronald Holzer, a vice president and chief dealer for Harris Trust and Company, in Chicago, attributed the dollar's gains in New York partly to ''a small correction from yesterday's selloff ahead of the trade figures.''
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release this morning the merchandise trade figures for September, and the market sentiment is that it will show a narrowing of the deficit to $8 billion to $9 billion.
But Mr. Holzer said that if the report discloses further economic weakness, particularly by showing a decline in United States exports, the dollar could head lower.
''The fundamentals are still working against the dollar,'' he said.
 
Data Point to Slowdown
Several recent economic reports have pointed to an economic slowdown, which spells bad news for dollar investors because it could signal lower interest rates. Lower rates tend to depress a currency.
In New York, the dollar rose to 143.795 yen, from 143.05 yen on Tuesday. The pound fell to $1.5803 from $1.5945.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, were: 1.8390 West German marks, up from 1.8350; 1.6265 Swiss francs, up from 1.6175; 6.2495 French francs, up from 6.2280; 1,351.75 Italian lire, up from 1,343.00, and 1.17095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16975.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Philip Morris Ads Anger Congressman

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
A CONGRESSIONAL opponent of tobacco advertising is expected to introduce evidence today that he says indicates that the Philip Morris Companies' ad campaign extolling the Bill of Rights was specifically undertaken to head off further restrictions on tobacco advertising. But the company takes issue with the interpretation by Representative Thomas A. Luken, Democrat of Ohio.
Representative Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommitee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials, is scheduled to convene hearings this morning on Philip Morris's $30 million Bill of Rights campaign, which it has undertaken with the National Archives, a Government agency.
Under an agreement signed in August, Philip Morris is to pay $600,000 to the Archives, which will locate such materials as recordings of past Presidents for the campaign. Critics of the tobacco industry assailed the deal, but the Archives defended it as a way of supplementing budget. 
In the upper house, Senator Edward M. Kennedy proposed legislation yesterday that would give the Government control over tobacco products and finance an anti-smoking campaign. The Massachusetts Democrat said he decided not to propose tough limits on cigarette exports and advertising to increase the chances that the bill would pass.
The legislation, which is still being drafted, would call for a total of $185 million in Federal spending next year on an anti-smoking advertising campaign, grants to states, schools and businesses that promote anti-smoking programs and money to establish a new Center for Tobacco Products.
The center would for the first time give the Federal Government regulatory control over the contents of cigarettes. Packs of cigarettes would be required to carry information either on the package or inside about the various tobacco additives, ''many of which are carcinogenic,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
Mr. Luken questions whether the mere mention of Philip Morris's name in the television commercials, and the appearance of its name in print ads that do not contain the Surgeon General's warning about the health hazards of smoking, violates laws restricting the content and placement of tobacco ads.
Philip Morris, which owns Kraft General Foods and Miller Brewing, says the ad campaign has no connection to its tobacco advertising or cigarette brands, of which Marlboro is the leader. Although the company has long had a Philip Morris cigarette brand, it announced last month that it was changing the brand's name to PM.
An aide to Mr. Luken, Ben Cohen, said the subcommittee, which oversees the Federal Trade Commission, had a copy of a letter from a public relations agency that worked for Philip Morris in 1986 stating that an essay contest undertaken then was created to forestall legislation against tobacco advertising.
''Why should we believe them when they say the thought of tobacco advertising never crossed their minds, when they tried this on a smaller scale three years ago?'' Mr. Cohen asked.
Mary A. Taylor, the director of special projects at Philip Morris, said the 1986 essay campaign ''was specifically aimed at tobacco advertising,'' and disputed any notion that there was a hidden motive to the advertising then, or to the current campaign. ''That's comparing apples and oranges and walnuts,'' she said.
The company's ads announcing the essay contest said, ''We believe that a tobacco advertising ban, currently under consideration in Congress, is a clear infringement of free expression in a free-market economy.'' The contest rules asked essay writers to ''specifically question the ramifications of a tobacco advertising ban.''
Mr. Luken's office said he would also maintain that Philip Morris's new television ads violated the 1971 ban on broadcast tobacco advertising. Mr. Cohen said the appearance of Philip Morris's name in the ads conflicted with a 1982 interpretation of the law by William F. Baxter, then the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Mr. Baxter wrote a letter contending that the televising of a cigarette brand's logotype placed on the floor or posts of a boxing ring during a match could constitute a violation of the law.
Mr. Luken said that informal opinion could be read to apply to names of cigarette brands that appear in ads or on programs.

HEADLINE: Soviets to Liberalize Emigration, Hoping to Gain U.S. Trade Deal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Soviet officials here and in Moscow promised today that Soviet emigration laws would soon be revised to permit freer emigration from the Soviet Union. In return, they asked that the United States lift trade barriers against Soviet exports.
At news conferences in the two capitals, Soviet officials seemed to be hoping that President Bush would recommend removal of the trade barriers in time for his meeting early next month with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev off the coast of Malta.
Administration officials and members of Congress indicated that the United States was unlikely to respond so swiftly. 
The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Yuri V. Dubinin, said that the Soviet Parliament would soon approve legislation liberalizing emigration procedures for Soviet citizens, and he said, ''We expect positive steps from the American side,'' including ''full normalization'' of trade relations.
Soviet pleas for more favorable tariff treatment appear to have become more insistent as Soviet economic problems have deepened. A meeting of senior Soviet and American officials here this week set the stage for a trade agreement that would lower more than a half-century of high American tariff walls against Soviet exports.
Details of the legislation were not immediately available. Soviet officials said it would retain some restrictions on emigration for people considered to have had access to state secrets.
Richard Schifter, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, gave the Soviets high marks for their efforts and said that the Administration would look favorably on the legislation if its provisions are carried out ''as we hope they will be.''
Members of Congress and some Jewish groups also welcomed the Soviet efforts, but said that details of the legislation were too sketchy for Mr. Bush to grant the Soviet request for trade benefits at this time.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said the Soviet Government might become eligible for more favorable treatment under American trade laws ''within the next one to three months'' if it carries through on its promise. But it might take longer, he said.
The State Department emphasized Mr. Bush's position that the emigration bill must not only be passed but also ''implemented'' before the United States would suspend trade barriers imposed on Moscow in the last 15 years. A 1974 law, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, says that Communist countries may not receive favorable tariff treatment or credits from the United States unless they permit free emigration by their citizens.
The Soviet legislation would apply to Soviet citizens who wish to travel abroad and return to their homeland, as well as to those who want to settle permanently in another country.
Trade experts say that not many Soviet products would be competitive in the American market. But if the United States removed trade barriers, Soviet officials believe there would be an increase in American investment in the Soviet Union.
Ambassador Dubinin acknowledged that the Soviet legislation, which received preliminary approval on first reading on Monday, has not been published in the Soviet Union. American officials said they did not have the text of the draft law and therefore could not evaluate its details.
 
Rights Group Commends Moscow
Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a human rights group, praised Moscow for taking a first step to revise its emigration laws. In a joint statement, Mr. DeConcini, a Democrat, and Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the co-chairman of the commission, said, ''We will not support a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment until the Soviet law receives final approval and a period of implementation takes place.''
In an interview, Mr. Schifter said that the United States had had two principal concerns about Soviet emigration. ''Applicants for exit permits who left security-sensitive jobs 10, 15 or even 20 years ago were denied permission to leave,'' he said. ''In addition, some adult applicants who were unable to obtain the consent of their parents for their departure could not leave.''
''It is my understanding that the new law would deal with both these issues,'' Mr. Schifter said. ''If it does, and if its provisions are implemented as we hope they will be, our concerns will have been met.''
Under the bill, Soviet citizens with access to state secrets could be forbidden to emigrate for up to five years. It is not clear whether this provision is retroactive, nor is it clear whether Soviet citizens denied exit permits for the last five years could immediately leave the Soviet Union.
 
'Just a Technical Matter'
Mr. Dubinin said that such questions, considered to be of paramount importance by Soviet Jews and their advocates in the United States, were ''just a technical matter.'' In general, he said, the new law will be administered in a generous spirit, and ''there will not be obstacles of a technical nature.''
But Micah H. Naftalin, national director of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, expressed concern that ''Jackson-Vanik will be prematurely waived in the euphoria of the moment'' when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev meet.
Mr. Dubinin said he did not know exactly when the emigration bill would become law. Soviet emigration has already increased dramatically, with Soviet Jews, evangelical Christians and Armenians accounting for most of the exodus in the last 18 months. The United States, overwhelmed with applications from would-be Soviet refugees, has established new procedures to restrict their admission to this country.
President Bush has set a limit of 50,000 on the number of Soviet citizens who can be admitted to the United States as refugees in the current fiscal year.
 
Some Questions Remain
Pamela B. Cohen, president of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, said her organization had a list of 253 Soviet families denied permission to leave the Soviet Union ''on a variety of pretexts.'' The list, she said, includes 105 families denied exit permits because of access to state secrets and 121 who could not get the necessary permission from relatives.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, ''The Soviet Union has made real and dramatic improvements in emigration policy, but has still not said whether it will release all the long-term refuseniks.'' Thus, he said, it would be premature for the United States to lower tariffs by giving the Soviet Union ''most-favored-nation treatment'' under the trade laws.
Mr. Dubinin, like Soviet officials in Moscow, said there was ''absolutely no linkage'' between the Soviet emigration bill and recent events in Eastern Europe, where thousands of East Germans have fled their country. He noted that the bill liberalizing Soviet emigration procedures was introduced in the Soviet Parliament in August.
But American officials said the Soviets displayed no sense of urgency about the legislation until this month.

HEADLINE: Kaufman View On a Recession

 BODY:
Interest rates are likely to decline as the economy slows, but the beneficial effects of lower rates may not be enough to forestall a recession in the United States, Henry Kaufman, the economist, said yesterday.
''The question is whether small declines in interest rates can overcome the retarding influence'' of huge debt burdens on consumers and corporations, he said in a meeting with reporters before speaking to the Money Marketers, a New York University group. 
Mr. Kaufman, the president of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm, was formerly the chief economist of Salomon Brothers. He said he believed that chances of a recession were ''much better than 50-50'' in the next three years, but added that 1991 was more likely than 1990 for a beginning.
When a recession does begin, he said, the Government will be hampered by already-high budget deficits from pursuing an aggressive fiscal policy. It will fall on the Federal Reserve to quickly ease credit to avoid a deep recession, ''more or less regardless of whether the inflation rate is unacceptably high at the time.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Stage a Retreat

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gave ground in spotty trading yesterday, as dealers took some profits and awaited further developments that might allow the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates.
The Government's release of merchandise trade data for September, with results much better than expected, prompted a brief flurry of buying early in the session. But sell orders began to emerge as the market moved higher.
''There is a growing awareness that there is no number due out over the next two weeks that will make the Fed ease policy,'' one Government bond trader said. ''The Fed will probably wait until they see the November employment data on Dec. 8 before they do anything. And between now and then we have to take on some fresh supply of two-year and five-year notes. I think the economy looks very weak, but given the near-term outlook, and with prices at these levels, you might as well sell.'' 
In addition to the Treasury note sales, which will be announced next week, participants in the credit markets face the second large infusion this autumn of intermediate- and long-term securities from the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Yesterday the T.V.A. said it would sell a total of $3.5 billion worth of seven-year notes and 40-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan, Stanley & Company. Because of strong demand for the 40-year issue, which is not callable for 10 years, the size of the bond offering was subsequently raised to $2 billion from $1.5 billion.
The securities are likely to be offered to investors today.
Price talk in advance of the issue put yields on the seven-year notes at 50 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent seven-year Treasury notes.
In advance of the actual pricing, investment bankers familiar with the transaction said the bonds were being offered to investors at a yield of 1.10 percentage points to 1.15 percentage points above the prevailing yield on the 8 1/8 percent Treasury bonds of 2019.
Last month an offering of $4 billion worth of T.V.A. securities was snapped up by investors. The offering is part of the T.V.A.'s plan to refinance $6.7 billion in high-interest debt.
For the most part, word that the nation's trade deficit contracted to $7.94 billion in September, the lowest level since late 1984, from a revised $10.1 billion in August, left credit market investors unmoved.
''Aside from the fact that this September figure tells us nothing about what the economy has done since, the trade number was basically a good news/bad news sort of figure,'' said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. ''It was good because the improvement was better than expected, but bad because it shows that the economy was stronger than we might otherwise have thought.''
As noted, the flurry of buying in the Treasury market following the trade report gave dealers an excuse to take profits later on.
By late in the session, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 103, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 7.86 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 15/32, down 3/32, to yield 7.80 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were unchanged on the day, at 102 1/8, to yield 7.70 percent.
Activity in the Treasury bill market was highlighted by the sale of $9.7 billion of new one-year bills.
At the auction the bills were sold at an average rate of 7.17 percent, the lowest rate on a one-year bill since the auction on June 30, 1988. At the last one-year bill auction on Oct. 19, the bills were sold at an average rate of 7.35 percent.
In the secondary Treasury bill market, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 7.65 percent, up three basis points. Six-month bill rates rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.40 percent.
In the taxable corporate bond market, the Consumers Power Company yesterday offered $200 million of 10-year notes at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets won the issue. The 8 7/8 percent notes, which mature Nov. 15, 1999, were priced at $99.434 to yield 8.961 percent, 1.15 percentage points over the prevailing yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that the price of most issues slipped by about 1/8 of a point yesterday. Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Nov. 6. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Altered TW Deal Angers Holders

 BODY:
IF a customer buys a box of corn flakes and finds less than the label promised, a refund can be expected and obtained. But on Wall Street, things are not so easy, and some buyers of new shares in TW Holdings Inc. are furious.
The financing plan for completing TW Holdings' takeover of TW Services Inc. was changed. TW's operations include the Denny's, Quincy's and El Pollo Loco restaurant chains. As a result of the change, shares in the new company appear to be less valuable than they would have been under the first plan. But those who bought the shares in the when-issued market have been told they will have to accept shares under the latest plan. 
The shares, which had traded for as much as $8 and still traded for about $5.50 after the first financing plan was dropped, were quoted yesterday at $4.25 bid.
The decision was made by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which regulates trading in the over-the-counter market. The winners are those who sold the ''stub'' shares that were to be left outstanding after the offer was completed, a group that includes many risk arbitragers. The losers are those who bought them, betting on the success of the newly leveraged company.
In when-issued trading, investors buy and sell securities that are expected to be issued, often as part of a pending takeover. But the trades are not concluded, with cash changing hands, until the securities are actually issued. If they are not issued, or if the terms are substantially changed, then all trades are canceled. Some traders sought such a cancellation, but the N.A.S.D. rejected it. ''Our basic underlying idea is that it was a common stock, and it still is,'' said James F. Peck, an N.A.S.D. governor and chairman of the organization's Uniform Practice Committee. ''We've taken the position that the relative worth of the two transactions is not the issue. The issue is the security itself.'' He said he had not examined the changes in the company's balance sheet before making the decision, and saw no reason to do so.
Had the security been a bond in which the interest rate and maturity were changed, that would have been a different situation, said Mr. Peck, the chairman and president of Wyoming Financial Services Inc. of Casper, Wyo. But, he said, the TW case was viewed as being equivalent to a company suffering a business reversal.
That decision angered some traders. ''There were going to be 60 million shares outstanding. Now there will be double that many, for the same company,'' complained one buyer in the when-issued market, asking not to be identified. ''What I find scary is you can do this and get away with it. I'm not sure I'll ever do a when-issued trade again.''
Some buyers have considered appealing within the N.A.S.D., but have not done so. ''It's probably an exercise in frustration to do so,'' one buyer said.
The new capitalization structure of TW Holdings, which will own the companies now in TW Services, reflects the inability of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation to sell the ''junk bonds'' needed to finance the original deal. In the new deal, Coniston Partners will own more shares and have a larger investment in the company.
That will result in a less leveraged company with a better financial cushion should it encounter rough times, but instead of 60 million shares outstanding, the company will have at least 110 million shares, and possibly 126 million because of a convertible bond issue. If it prospers, the rewards will be spread over more shares, and thus diluted.
James Murren, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell, estimates 1990 cash flow, after interest payments, at $1.55 a share, down from $2.33 under the original plan.
For Coniston, the new structure leaves it with about the same percentage ownership of the company, but it has to leave more cash in it. Coniston's original plans had called for it to take out more cash than it had invested when it bought its TW stake. Now it will have at least $100 million invested, and possibly much more. Part of that is likely to be in the form of $50 million in bonds that may be resold to Japanese investors next year.
Current shareholders in TW Services are getting another option. For each share in the current company, they will be able to take $26 in cash, plus two new shares, or they can choose from the previous options of $34 in cash or $30 plus one share. Depending on their decisions, Coniston will end up controlling from 49 to 74 percent of TW Holdings, and Donaldson, Lufkin from 14 to 22 percent. Yesterday, the shares of TW Services fell 12.5 cents, to $33.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Whether the deal closes depends on whether the new securities are bought. The current talk is that $100 million will be raised from a convertible bond issue paying 9 percent to 10 percent and convertible into common at $6 to $7 a share; $320 million from a zero-coupon bond paying about 17 percent, and $200 million from a subordinated debenture with a coupon near 15 percent. Buyers of the latter issues are to buy 16.5 million shares of stock.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 3.08 Points, To 2,635.66

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks ended narrowly mixed yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.08 points, to 2,635.66.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange edged advances by 748 to 735. Volume on the Big Board contracted to 148.4 million shares, from 155.1 million on Wednesday. 
The Dow was initially buoyed by a Commerce Department report of one of the smallest monthly trade deficits in recent years. The department said a drop in imports and higher exports combined to narrow the nation's seasonally adjusted merchandise trade deficit to $7.94 billion, the lowest since a $6.79 billion gap in December 1984.
 
'A Mixed Blessing'
''The trade numbers were a mixed blessing,'' said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management in Princeton, N.J. ''While they improved over all, the drop in imports was significant and caused concern about a slowing of the economy. The question over the next couple of months is whether investors are going to accept the 'soft landing' scenario.''
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.04, to 340.58, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index dipped 0.01, to 188.75.
Dun & Bradstreet was the most active stock, falling 2 points, to 42 1/2, on a volume of nearly 7.4 million shares. On Wednesday, the credit-services company said it expected its earnings next year to drop 10 percent.
Hilton Hotels plunged 5 3/4, to 96. The company said that it was uncertain about whether it could announce a deal by the end of the year for the hotel chain's purchase as it it had previously stated.
Browning-Ferris fell 1 5/8 points, to 40 1/4, after Bill Genco, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, changed his rating on the company from a ''strong buy'' to an ''above-average buy.''
UAL dropped 4 1/4, to 184 3/4. A spokesman for British Airways said his company was not holding talks with anyone on the possibility of joining a new UAL buyout and did not plan to be involved in any UAL buyout in the near future.
 
Earlier Deal Failed
A deal in which British Airways, UAL's pilots and management had planned to buy the parent of United Airlines for $6.8 billion was ended last month when the group could not obtain financing.
Unisys rose 1 1/2, to 14 7/8, on speculation that A.T.&T. was considering a bid for the company.
Active glamour stocks included Philip Morris, up 3/8, to 41 1/8; Bristol-Myers, off 1/4, to 55 3/8; I.B.M., down 3/4, to 97 1/8; Occidental Petroleum, off 1/8, to 30, and General Electric, up 3/4, to 57 1/2.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index added 0.36, to 372.51, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.56, to 455.28.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
An Outsider Is Named As Volvo's President

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has repeatedly surprised the Swedish business establishment in his 18 years as the head of A.B. Volvo, did it again yesterday: He paired the announcement of disappointing third-quarter earnings with the news that Christer Zetterberg, the chairman of a state-owned bank, will become Volvo's president and chief operating officer in May and will eventually become chairman and chief executive.
There was no indication when Mr. Gyllenhammar, who is 54 years old and is Scandinavia's most prominent business leader, plans to step aside. Mr. Zetterberg, 48, will replace Gunnar L. Johansson, 61, who is retiring.
Volvo also said that Roger Holtback, president of its car-making subsidiary, and Sten Langenius, president of its truck operations, would become executive vice presidents and take seats on an expanded eight-member executive committee. 
In going outside Volvo's ranks to choose a successor, Mr. Gyllenhammar said he was seeking someone with a broad industrial background and executive experience. Mr. Zetterberg had taken the helm at PK Banken in Stockholm early last year with a mandate from the Government to prepare the bank for a more competitive era when foreign banks would be allowed freer access to Sweden. Before that, he had been president of Holmens Bruk A.B., a large Swedish pulp and paper company; Tibnor A.B., a metals and industrial equipment distributor, and Celor-Celsius A.B., an industrial pipe company.
Mr. Zetterberg said he was enthusiastic about the opportunity to return to manufacturing, describing the task of heading Volvo as ''the finest managerial post there is in Sweden.''
Volvo, based in Gothenburg on Sweden's west coast, is Scandinavia's largest industrial concern and employs nearly one out of every seven Swedish workers. Best known in the United States as a vehicle producer, Volvo is active in aerospace, the food business and financial services. It also owns more than 44 percent of A.B. Pharmacia, one of Sweden's largest drug companies.
Mr. Zetterberg's appointment is expected to add new dynamism to a management team that has been on the defensive this year. Volvo has recently jangled nerves in Sweden with the news that it had been discussing a possible merger or joint venture with Renault, the far-larger state-owned French auto maker.
Volvo is heavily dependent on its automotive business as a result of the failure of some of Mr. Gyllenhammar's more ambitious diversification moves, notably into oil. Its operating earnings, which were off nearly 50 percent in the most recent three months from a year ago, reflect tough competition in the United States, as Japanese producers move into Volvo's market for higher-priced vehicles. The company is also worried about the effect of Europe's economic integration in late 1992.

HEADLINE: Movie Theme Park Planned For Disneyland in France

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that it would open a second park, which will have a movie studio theme, at its Euro Disneyland complex near Paris.
The company said the second park, to open in 1996, would be called the Disney MGM Studios-Europe, and would be similar to the Disney-MGM Studios theme park that opened in May at Disney World near Orlando, Fla. The first phase of Euro Disneyland is under construction and is scheduled to open in 1992. 
Disney had previously said it was planning a second phase for the European complex. Analysts said the choice of the studio theme was natural, given the success of the studio park in Florida. Disney has already announced plans to double the size of the Florida park, and is planning a studio-theme attraction at the Tokyo Disneyland.
 
Working Studio
Erwin Okun, a spokesman for Disney, declined to say how much the company planned to spend to build the Disney-MGM park in France. Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that the Florida studio park had cost about $500 million to build and that a European version was likely to cost somewhat more, especially after inflation was factored in.
''The company has shown its intention to expand Euro Disneyland in phases, and to draw on the concepts they have developed in other parts of the world,'' Mr. Vogel said.
Disney uses the MGM name under license from the MGM/UA Communications Company. Disney-MGM Studios Europe would contain a working motion-picture and television studio that would allow the company to increase its live-action and animated production in Europe.
''In addition to the already opened television and motion picture animation company in France, employing 100 artists, we are excited at the prospect of bringing additional full-scale movie and television production to Europe, while providing guests with the entertainment magic of a second Disney theme park,'' Michael D. Eisner, chairman of Disney, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Re-evaluation Is Urged on Cutting High-Tech Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Officials in the White House who favor a Government pullback from financing advanced military research and development programs with commercial applications may need to re-evaluate their position because of the needs of high-technology industries and the political climate, a number of economists and legislators said today.
On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of legislators challenged the Administration to clarify its position, based on a series of reports that have circulated in Washington in recent weeks. Those reports have indicated that in the 1991 budget the Government is preparing to cut financing for a variety of high-technology programs that are viewed by many as the foundation of an American response to Japanese and other foreign competition.
Yesterday Administration and Pentagon officials continued to refuse comment on the reports. A Pentagon spokesman said the agency was engaged in setting its 1991 budget and would not comment until the new budget was released in January. 
 
'Trial Balloons'
The reports may represent ''trial balloons'' during the budgetary process, sent up to gauge reaction to potential cuts in Federal high-technology initiatives, said economists and policy makers who have followed the debate closely. But many said they were concerned that if the reports were accurate, the Administration had taken steps against such programs as Sematech, a Government and industry consortium to develop advanced chip-making equipment, and the high-definition television research program financed by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Sematech officials said yesterday that despite a prior five-year financing commitment, they were concerned about losing financing in 1991, which would be the third year of that commitment.
In a letter to Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Defense Industry and Technology of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas (where Sematech is based), said he was concerned that a big push would be made to cut Sematech and other advanced technology initiatives from the fiscal year 1991 budget. In this budget year, he said, ''we may need a broader effort to salvage these important programs.''
 
Division in White House
The White House officials who back a Government pullback from support for high-technology initiatives include Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Yesterday, an Administration source said that John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, was also opposed to such financing.
There is, however, a contingent in the Administration that favors some form of Federal support for a number of high-technology projects. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher and the President's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, are known to favor Federal programs that will strengthen United States industrial competitiveness.
Economists and legislators who believe that the White House may yet need to re-evaluate what seems to be its prevailing opposition to Government high-tech financing point to the fact that on Monday the White House is expected to release a long-awaited report by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors that argues for a multibillion-dollar program to restore the United States semiconductor industry to world leadership. Release of the report has been delayed twice in recent weeks while Administration officials explored its impact.
 
Argument in Chip Report
A cover letter that accompanies the report was released yesterday by Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, stating that the document will outline a national semiconductor strategy and that it argues that the deterioriation of America's semiconductor industry poses an unacceptable threat to United States economic and national security.
''It looks a little like the left lobe doesn't know what the right lobe is doing,'' said Michael Borrus, deputy director at the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics, a policy reserch center. ''It's possible that they're flying both positions to see which way the wind is blowing.''
Robert B. Reich, a Harvard economist and advocate of a national competitive strategy, said that while recently a faction of the Administration led by Mr. Boskin and Mr. Darman had systematically tried to roll back programs that appear to embrace an industrial policy, in the future the Administration will come under increasing pressure from United States business efforts to back such initiatives.
 
Demands of Business Noted
''The business community is beginning to demand action out of Washington,'' he said. ''American business is beginning to say things that would have been anathema five years ago.''
Mr. Reich also said that while programs financed by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that have both civilian and military uses have been under attack recently, in other areas the Federal Government has been active in supporting federally financed industrial policy initiatives. He cited programs at the National Institutes of Health that have supported the nation's biotechnology industry as examples of such Government activities.
This week's heated controversy over high technology has also led to charges that the Administration is sacrificing international competitiveness for budgetary reasons and that Japanese lobbying efforts in Washington have effectively altered Administration policies. A Commerce Department official said yesterday, for instance, that the Japanese have made a concerted effort to influence the United States to cut off funding for high-definition television research. The Japanese already have a lead in setting an international standard in that technology, which provides much sharper television images.
 
Need for New Models Seen
Observers said yesterday that despite the bitter policy debate between the Administration and Congress, ultimately the United States must find a way to develop peculiarly American models for coorperation between the Government and private industry.
''The Japanese have a centralized style of organizing industrial cooperation,'' said W. Russell Neuman, director of the communications research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''I think that the awareness exists in the United States that something needs to be done, something that is uniquely American in style that fits the way we need to do business. But leadership has not come from the Bush Administration to develop these models.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Did C.I.A. Distort Soviet Outlays?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WITH the breakdown of the Communist economies, the United States is facing some critical choices. And a major issue is whether this nation can seize any opportunities to reassert its economic and political leadership without jeopardizing its security interests. Doubts about whether and how much the United States should scale back military spending have been compounded by analyses of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, which indicate that the Soviet Union has been substantially outspending the United States on military programs for 15 to 20 years.
But a leading American analyst of Soviet military programs, Franklyn D. Holzman of Tufts University, asserts in a new study that the C.I.A. overstated Soviet expenditures by some 50 percent. 
These overestimates, he maintains, stem from three sources:
* From 1975 to 1983, the C.I.A. said, Soviet military expenditures rose by 4 to 5 percent a year. In 1984, though, the agency admitted that the growth had been only 2 percent a year, but it failed to adjust its figures.
* The Soviets introduced price reform in 1982, and in 1986 the C.I.A. switched its estimates to the new prices. That caused them to make a large upward leap for Soviet military spending. But in November 1987, the C.I.A. admitted the uncertainty of its changes. It said it expected Soviet weapon prices to rise more slowly than those of civilian goods because they were more closely supervised. Despite these admissions, the C.I.A. left its figures at the higher levels.
* The C.I.A. has used a category for Soviet military spending that includes civil defense, civilian space activities and internal security forces, swelling the size of the military budget.
The Holzman study maintains that when the agency's estimates are corrected for these and other factors, Soviet military spending as a share of gross national product falls from about 16 percent to 9 percent. On May 30, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced what he called a ''real'' Soviet military expenditure figure of 77.3 billion rubles, or 9 percent of G.N.P. ''It is difficult to understand why, after having admitted its errors, the C.I.A. failed to make the appropriate adjustments in its estimates,'' Professor Holzman said. ''It is the hypothesis of my paper that the C.I.A. was 'persuaded' not to do so by the Pentagon's research arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency, whose estimates have always substantially exceeded those of the C.I.A.'' He concluded by suggesting that the C.I.A.-D.I.A. estimates of the ''military spending gap,'' like the ''bomber gap'' of the 1950's and ''missile gap'' of the 1960's, have contributed to the unnecessarily costly arms race of the last 20 years. Caution within the Administration reflects doubts about whether the Soviet Union has really been cutting military expenditures this year, as Mr. Gorbachev promised. But this week United States Government analysts acknowledged that Soviet military expenditures this year would take a smaller share of G.N.P. And the analysts are still using the C.I.A.-D.I.A. figures as their base. If the approximate decline of 1 percent in Soviet military spending holds for the lower base numbers, it will decline to about 8 percent of G.N.P.
The lower base figures in themselves will not result in American military cutbacks. That remains a difficult strategic issue. But some American economic and military experts maintain that cutbacks in the military would actually enhance United States military and economic security.
William W. Kaufmann of Harvard concludes in a study for the Brookings Institution that the United States has strong international and domestic incentives for reducing military spending. He maintains that the United States ''has a stake both in ending the cold war and in fostering economic and political change in the Communist bloc,'' and considers that this would ease a transfer of Warsaw Pact resources from military to civilian purposes, ''even if the process lasts no more than a decade, and even if Gorbachev falls from power.''
The essence of a revised military spending plan, he said, would be to cooperate in ending the military competition with the Soviet Union and in reducing the resources both sides devote to that rivalry. But such a change could be achieved only in stages and would be a long and difficult process to negotiate. The process is likely to face obstacles from industries and regions that will see military cutbacks primarily in terms of lost income.
Basically, the United States has two ways to get the capital it needs if it is to play its full role in building a more stable and prosperous world: it can raise taxes or reduce military spending. As President Kennedy said, to govern is to choose.

HEADLINE: Korea's Trade Surplus Is Criticized

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today increased pressure on South Korea to reduce its large trade surplus, warning of possible trade sanctions unless it acted quickly to liberalize its currency and financial markets.
David Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said Korea, and to a lesser extent Taiwan, must recognize the risk that a frustrated Congress will take tough measures unless they reduce their large trade surpluses with the United States. 
At a hearing of the Senate Banking subcommitee on trade and exchange rates, two Senators said South Korea was obtaining an unfair trade advantage by holding down the value of its currency, the won. ''There's no more tolerance for that here on Capitol Hill,'' Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said.
Mr. Sarbanes said there was a growing sentiment in Congress to resort to trade laws to offset the benefit that some exporting countries enjoy from currency manipulation.
Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, complained that Korean steelmakers had a competitive edge because of the cheap won. ''American workers and American companies and American communities are suffering,'' he said.
Mr. Mulford said South Korea's trade surplus had fallen by 63 percent in the first eight months of 1989 and that its surplus with the United States dropped by 25 percent, to $4.2 billion. But he traced the improvement to transient factors, like strikes. He said Seoul would have to let the won rise but that it had, instead, allowed the currency to depreciate slightly this year.

HEADLINE: Evans Making a Quick Exit From Supercomputer Field

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16

 BODY:
A promising newcomer in the supercomputer business has decided to drop out only four months after introducing its first machine. The decision raises further questions about the ability of American companies to compete in the risky, costly industry.
The Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation, which introduced its supercomputer with great fanfare in July, said this week that it would close its supercomputer division in 60 days unless it could find a buyer or a partner. 
The company, based in Salt Lake City, said more problems were discovered in the machine, delaying the date when it could be brought to market. Moreover, it said, it appeared that the machine's advantage over others was less than anticipated.
 
Over $30 Million Invested
The company has invested more than $30 million in the project over three years, and such investments dragged down its earnings by about 60 percent in the first three quarters of this year. Leaving the business will allow the company to concentrate on its core business of making computerized flight simulators.
The decision is the latest setback for companies that make supercomputers, multimillion-dollar machines that can perform billions of operations a second and are used primarily for scientific tasks and military purposes. American supercomputer makers are under pressure from Japanese competitors and from other American companies making smaller, cheaper machines that can run almost as fast.
Earlier this year, the Control Data Corporation said it would leave the business. The market leader, Cray Research Inc., has had declining earnings and has split itself in two, with its founder, Seymour Cray, starting a new company.
Such events, particularly the failure of Control Data's supercomputer business, ''have made many, many companies afraid'' of getting involved in the supercomputer business, said Oliver McBryan, director of the Center for Applied Parallel Processing at the University of Colorado, an early customer of Evans.
 
'Down in Flames'
The supercomputer ''could cause the whole company to go down in flames,'' he said. ''Or it could be their future. It's a big, high-risk venture, but I would judge it worth taking.''
Officials of the division, based in Mountain View, Calif., were said to be saddened and angered by the news, which was announced while they were displaying the machine in Reno on Tuesday. Management is trying to arrange financing for a buyout of the division. There have also been inquiries from several companies, including a large Japanese conglomerate, people close to the situation said.
These people said it might take $10 million more to complete the machine. Evans & Sutherland said it would take a pretax write-off of up to $14 million in the fourth quarter if it could not sell the unit.
