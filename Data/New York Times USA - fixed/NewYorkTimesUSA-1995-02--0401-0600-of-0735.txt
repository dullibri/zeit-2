DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif.

 BODY:
THE Walt Disney Company has leased 170,000 square feet in an office building here, in a move that buttresses the company's position as the city's largest office tenant. The lease has also underscored the position of Burbank, which is 10 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, as one of the tightest office markets in Southern California.
Disney already occupied 70,000 square feet of the Tower office building before it agreed late last year to take an additional 100,000 square feet in the same building, following a decision by Warner Brothers Inc. to vacate the space. 
 While the Disney lease is one of the largest office deals in recent months in the Los Angeles area, it appears small in comparison with the company's total commitment to office space in Burbank and in neighboring Glendale. In those cities alone, Disney has leased about 1.5 million square feet of office space, and a comparable amount of industrial space. That tally does not include company-owned buildings on Disney's studio lot.
Burbank, a city with an industrial ambiance and a population of 93,000, is arguably the nerve center of the entertainment industry in Southern California. The industry's rapid expansion has benefited the city, where entertainment companies occupy about one-third of the city's four million square feet of office space.
The high demand for office space in Burbank is an anomaly amid the otherwise slack office market of greater Los Angeles. Burbank's vacancy rate is about 7.9 percent, far less than the vacancy rates of 18.6 percent in downtown Los Angeles and 15.8 percent in the San Fernando Valley area, according to fourth-quarter 1994 figures compiled by CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc.
While developers in other parts of the Los Angeles area are trying to find tenants for buildings, officials in Burbank are talking about a need for new office and industrial buildings, a topic little discussed elsewhere in Los Angeles County.
"We can't meet the demand," said Robert M. Tague, Burbank's director of community development. "We are referring users to other cities, such as Glendale and Pasadena, because we no longer have the space to house them. Believe me, it does not make us happy."
Entertainment companies are seeking space in surrounding cities, which previously held little attraction. Warner Brothers, itself one of the city's largest tenants, signed a lease in December for 100,000 square feet in neighboring Glendale at the 500 North Brand building because no comparable block of space was available in Burbank. Another company formerly based in Burbank, Lockheed Air Terminal Inc., recently signed a lease for 35,000 square feet in Glendale at 330 North Brand Boulevard.
The Glendale buildings are "the beneficiaries of the voracious appetite for space that Disney has," William Boyd, a CB Commercial broker, said. He and a fellow broker, Doug Marlow, negotiated the Disney lease on behalf of the landlord, Tochikogyo USA Inc.
The lack of space in Burbank, where no new office building has been completed since 1991, was one of the factors that has driven Disney's conquest of local office space. In 1992, the company formulated a plan to obtain space for its operations, "in anticipation of where we saw our business going, on a macro-economic level, and where we saw the real estate market going," George H. Garfield, Disney's director of asset strategy, said.
That strategy, in short, was to tie up as much space as Disney could possibly need, then "grow or contract within the envelope, so to speak, without being exposed to market factors," Mr. Garfield said.

HEADLINE: China's Known Brands Are Most Often Japanese

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
American companies eager to win allegiance from China's 1.2 billion people are fighting an uphill battle, according to a comprehensive new poll of consumer attitudes on the Chinese mainland that was released yesterday.
Six of the top 10 foreign brands identified by the survey's respondents were Japanese, even though those surveyed were asked to pick from a list containing twice as many American as Japanese names. Four of the Japanese brands -- Panasonic, Hitachi, Toshiba and Toyota -- were also the ones the respondents said they held in highest regard. 
 Coca-Cola was the most widely known American brand, finishing second with 62 percent recognition, just behind Hitachi's 65 percent. The next closest American finishers were Mickey Mouse, which is a distinct brand in China and was the seventh-most-recognized name, with 54 percent, and Marlboro, which was eighth, with 51 percent.
"U.S. multinationals have their work cut out for them," said Richard W. Burkholder Jr., director of worldwide operations for the Gallup Organization, which conducted the poll.
The survey showed that brand loyalty was relatively weak in China, where consumers are chiefly concerned with the price and quality of the goods they buy and where Chinese manufacturers are still favored in the countryside.
The poll was conducted to promote Gallup's entry into China and was partly financed by the Japan Management Association. Gallup said the survey was the first truly representative sampling of the habits and attitudes of Chinese adults.
Gallup representatives fanned out across China from May 2 to Sept. 15, asking more than 400 questions of a single individual in each of 3,400 households. In especially remote areas, like the Gobi Desert, Mr. Burkholder said, Gallup interviewers traveled on horseback or by camel.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent, he added.
"We're comfortable that these results project what all people in China would have answered if we could have asked each one of them," Mr. Burkholder said.
In a country buffeted by fierce political winds over the last five decades, the survey shows how deeply the free-market policies introduced in the late 1970's by Deng Xiaoping have permeated the national psyche.
Asked their personal philosophy, 68 percent of those polled said it could be summed up by the phrase "work hard and get rich." Only 4 percent summarized their personal belief with a Maoist credo: "Never think of yourself. Give everything in service to society."
The survey also shows a country that has grown relatively affluent, especially in urban areas. More than 90 percent of the homes in China's nine largest cities now have both a color television set and a refrigerator. That compares with 40 percent with color televisions and 25 percent with refrigerators nationwide.
China's distribution network is not sophisticated enough to allow most foreign companies to sell consumer products beyond the biggest markets around Beijing, Shanghai and in Guangdong province, near Hong Kong. So, changing tastes in those urban areas can be a barometer for what may develop throughout the country. For example, instant coffee was found in only 6 percent of the households nationally, but in 37 percent of the households surveyed in the country's nine largest cities.
Over all, the consumer items most likely to be owned in a Chinese home were a bicycle, an electric fan, a radio, a television set and a rice cooker. The most popular planned purchases were a color TV, a washing machine, refrigerator, tape recorder and videocassette recorder.
Those polled were about equally divided when asked if they were satisfied or dissatisfied with their jobs, income and the quality of their food. But a larger number expressed dissatisfaction when asked about the furnishings in their homes and their general standard of living.
"Clearly this is a very materialistic society, and not all the aspirations are being met, particularly in rural areas," Mr. Burkholder said.
The poll found that the habits of drinking alcohol and smoking were heavily dominated by Chinese men. More than 80 percent of the men said they smoked "regularly" or "occasionally," while the national average for women was 11 percent.
On the other hand, only 66 percent of the respondents said they drank alcohol, a lower percentage than was found in any Western country except the United States (53 percent) and Spain (64 percent).

HEADLINE: Emilio Collado, a Creator of the World Money System, Dies at 84

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Emilio Gabriel Collado, an economist and oil company executive who helped design the international post-World War II monetary system and served as America's first executive director of the World Bank, died at the Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Fla., on Feb. 9. A resident of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., since 1993, he was 84.
Mr. Collado died of heart failure, said his wife, Maria. 
 Mr. Collado, who was widely known as Pete, was born in Cranford, N.J., and lived most of his life in the New York area.
In 1934, Mr. Collado (pronounced coe-YAH-doe) joined the Treasury Department as an economist specializing in international monetary issues, after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, where he had earned a doctorate in economics. From 1936 to 1938 he worked at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, where he headed the Latin American and Far Eastern sections.
In 1938, he moved to the State Department and went on to hold several senior economic positions during World War II.
Most notably, he was a member of the American negotiating team at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 at Bretton Woods, N.H. There, the United States and Britain effectively designed the postwar international monetary system, creating the International Monetary Fund to oversee a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates between currencies and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as the World Bank is officially called, to finance reconstruction after the Allies' victory.
The previous year, he took part in the international conference at Hot Springs, Va., which set up the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.
In 1946, President Harry S. Truman nominated Mr. Collado to be the first American director of the World Bank, representing the United States on the bank's executive board.
In 1947, he joined the Exxon Corporation, rising to executive vice president and a director of the company at the time of his retirement in 1975.
Last October, President Clinton wrote to him to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement, saying the agreement he had helped frame had produced "five decades of international cooperation and the greatest economic growth in the history of the world."
He was also a trustee of the Hispanic Society in New York, a former director of J. P. Morgan & Company and a former chairman and director of the Americas Society of New York.
His first wife, Janet Gilbert, died in 1972. Besides his second wife, Maria, he is survived by a son, Emilio Gabriel, of Vienna, Va.; a daughter, Lisa Collado Ford of New York City; a stepson, Pedro M. Lopez-Tanco of Orlando, Fla., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Conservatives Forge New Strategy To Challenge Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15

 BODY:
An effort by two San Francisco-area academics to eliminate affirmative-action programs in California has set off a debate over civil rights that is rapidly spreading across the country and threatens to be one of the most divisive national dialogues in years.
The two professors, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, who describe themselves as "staunch conservatives," want the issue of affirmative action put to a popular vote in California sometime next year. It is an approach that poll takers and political analysts already say has a good chance of overturning the state's affirmative-action laws. 
 Mr. Custred, an anthropology professor at California State University in Hayward, said, "Affirmative action has been losing steam with the general public, and we think we've hit upon the sure way to finally reverse it and restore true color-blind fairness in the United States.".
To get their proposal on the ballot, Mr. Custred, Mr. Wood and their supporters will need to gather about a million signatures on petitions. That effort, which the two men say will begin in a matter of weeks, could cost upward of a million dollars.
Few political experts doubt they will exceed both requirements.
"The climate is now such that they'll just blitz through," said Mervin Field, the dean of California poll takers who runs the California Poll.
Recent surveys show the professors' effort may succeed, not just in California but elsewhere. It is an approach that is already being injected into the 1996 Presidential race and that is also beginning to spark some ugly exchanges, even among old friends and political allies.
Even some Democrats with impeccable liberal credentials are beginning to break with their party's traditional hard-line support for affirmative action. They suggest that the system of extending special preferences based on factors like race and sex has outlived its usefulness and should be abandoned or changed so that preferences are extended only on the basis of economic need.
As for Republicans, many who once hesitated to publicly criticize affirmative action are now openly attacking it, sensing a change in the national mood, particularly since the November 1994 elections.
Susan Estrich, a California law professor and veteran Democratic campaign strategist, sees political danger in continuing to argue on behalf of affirmative action.
"Affirmative action was never meant to be permanent, and now is truly the time to move on to some other approach," she said in an interview. "You can try to paint Republican opponents as having been captured by the far right and the like, but that's not going to make the Democratic Party the majority party again. In fact, there's a bad potential for this issue to drive a wedge right through the Democratic Party, if it doesn't yield some."
Government, schools and thousands of businesses rely on affirmative action as a tool of redress when hiring, promoting, awarding contracts or admitting students.
But to Mr. Custred and Mr. Wood, a former philosophy professor who now heads the California Association of Scholars, a Berkeley-based group of conservative educators, affirmative action is a corruption of the civil rights laws passed in the 1960's.
"The specific goal of those laws was to prohibit discrimination," Mr. Custred said. "The laws rightly encourage reaching out, but it's a perversion to say they permit the hiring of people by quota, or the admission of students without regard to academic merit, or the letting of contracts according to race-based formulas."
This is the proposed referendum that the professors hope to put on the ballot: "Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system of public employment, public education or public contracting."
Mr. Custred and Mr. Wood hope to raise enough money and gather enough signatures to put the affirmative action question on the ballot in California, possibly for the March 1996 primary but more likely for the November 1996 general election. Then they plan to encourage ballot efforts in other states and, if their movement spreads, eventually press Congress to act.
If they succeed, next year's Presidential hopefuls will have to adjust accordingly when they come looking for votes in California, the so-called "must win" state. On the Democratic side, the adjustment will require special care, given the party's liberal history on civil rights.
Already the Custred-Wood proposal, which its authors call the California Civil Rights Initiative, has been labeled "Son of 187," a reference to Proposition 187, the immigration-control measure that California voters passed overwhelmingly in November but that the courts have mostly put on hold, citing concern over its constitutionality.
Recent opinion polls indicate that dissatisfaction with affirmative action has grown, with two of three Americans, including Californians, having serious doubts about the fairness of the concept, especially when remedial devices like hiring quotas and contract set-asides are used.
The Republican landslide last fall was attributed in part to pent-up anger in white men, many of whom told poll takers that they were fed up with affirmative action, whether mandated by law or voluntary.
"Count me among those angry men," said Mr. Wood. "I know the sting of affirmative action. I was once passed over for a teaching job because, I was told privately, I was white and male. The worm has turned."
Civil rights leaders fear the worst. Of particular concern is that many of their supporters are seeming to drift away as affirmative action becomes more controversial.
For example, Ward Connerly, a black member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, recently asserted that the state's college admissions officers were going too far with affirmative action, directly violating a 1978 United States Supreme Court ruling.
"What we're doing is inequitable," he said. "We are relying on race and ethnicity not as one of many factors but as a dominant factor to the exclusion of all others. To those who say, 'Affirmative action now, affirmative action forever as it is now' -- that's what George Wallace said about segregation."
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, has already traveled to California to voice opposition to the Custred-Wood proposal and to any retreat on affirmative action. He called for a "register and resist" voter campaign.
Noting that Gov. Pete Wilson, a potential Republican Presidential candidate, had offered kind words for the Custred-Wood initiative, Mr. Jackson said: "Pete Wilson is liken unto George Wallace of Alabama. He wants to stand in front of the schoolhouse door."
Elizabeth Toledo, the head of the California branch of the National Organization for Women, that group's largest branch, was more measured, as she, too, vowed to resist the Custred-Wood initiative, calling it "divisive scapegoating" and "one of the most significant attacks yet on our rights."
In Washington and elsewhere on the national political scene, members of Congress and prospective 1996 Presidential candidates are scrambling for position, some eager to run with the issue, others not sure whether to plunge into the coming fracas or to flee headlong from it.
Both President Clinton, who has supported affirmative action, and the Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, most of whom have long held doubts about it, have assigned aides to study the issue. Among suggested alternatives is replacing race-based and sex-based quotas with quotas based on economic need, as measured by income.
In Sacramento, some Democratic state legislators have also begun to study alternative approaches, with an eye toward taking the issue away from Republicans.
In an example of how the debate is beginning to divide old friends and allies, the Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr., perhaps the nation's best-known black state legislator, lashed out on Tuesday at those who would moderate employment and education considerations for women and members of minorities. "The attack on affirmative action is totally phony," he asserted during a press conference.
Mr. Brown was particularly harsh on Bill Press, the head of the California Democratic Party, who has suggested that Democrats consider alternative approaches to "protect" affirmative action and to head off the San Francisco academics and their Republican allies.
"Listen," Mr. Brown said, "I'm practical enough to know how Democrats love to try to survive. And I'm also practical enough to know that you don't survive unless you show some evidence of principle."
William Kristol, a leading Republican strategist in Washington, said: "The whole way the American people look at affirmative action has changed since last November's election results. It's no longer beyond the pale to be critical."

Campus Protest Against Slurs

 
 BERKELEY, Calif., Feb. 15 -- Some 200 students and faculty members from the University of California at Berkeley rallied today to denounce the distribution of fliers attacking affirmative action in derogatory and racist terms. The fliers, put in the mailboxes of 15 minority students at the Boalt Hall Law School, were discovered on Saturday.
"Rejoice, you crybaby niggers. It's affirmative action month," the flier said in part. "When I see you in class it bugs the hell out of me because you're taking the seat of someone qualified."
The University Chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, promised to try to find those responsible.
"The older I get, the more convinced I become of the centrality of the issue of race in American society," he said at the rally. "The issues surrounding it never go away. They remain under the surface for a period of time, but inevitably, it seems the melting pot boils over. We are in one of those periods now."
Nicole Wong, a law student, said: "There are a lot of messages going out throughout the state saying racism is O.K. All those things send out these messages that people of color are an O.K. target."

HEADLINE: IRAQ SAID TO SELL OIL IN SECRET PLAN TO SKIRT U.N. BAN

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Iraq has set up a system over the past year to export crude oil and refined products and thus bypass United Nations sanctions barring such sales, senior oil industry executives and traders said today.
The executives said the sales had generated $700 million to $800 million in revenue for the Iraqi economy, which is crippled by sanctions imposed by the United Nations after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
 The executives, some of whom are directly involved in the sales, said Iraq was relying on a growing network of traders motivated by big discounts. Traders said Iraq was selling the oil for as little as $8 a barrel, compared to a current market price of about $14 for Middle Eastern crude oil of that type.
Hundreds of trucks are carrying the oil through Kurdish territory in Iraq's northern region into Turkey or to Iran, where the oil can be sold quickly at a profit without being re-exported.
The advantage for the Iraqi Kurds or for Iran, normally adversaries of the Baghdad Government, is financial profit, said the traders, whose accounts were confirmed by senior oil executives in France and Britain.
Baghdad allows Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq to collect a tax on each truck passing through, with much of the revenue funneled to Kurdish political leaders who have previously fought against the Iraqi Army. And the Iranian Government has financial links to many of the middlemen who operate along Iran's long border with Iraq.
Dozens of small tankers are also sailing from Umm Qasr, an Iraqi port south of Basra and near the Kuwait border, to the Persian Gulf area near Dubai, where the oil is reloaded onto other tankers bound for markets in the Mediterranean.
The profits for the traders far outweigh the danger of occasional interception by United Nations vessels, mostly American warships, patrolling the Persian Gulf, the traders say.
"They are selling their oil at $8 to $10 per barrel," one trader based in London said. "That's a big discount, which explains why many of us are willing to take risks to move that oil."
By offering the discounts, Iraq has raised the total exports through these routes to about 200,000 barrels a day, bringing in revenue of more than $700 million in the past year, industry executives said.
That is less than 6 percent of the $12.7 billion Iraq would earn if it were still exporting 2.5 million barrels a day at world prices, as it did before the gulf war. Nonetheless, the income is significant for a country with few sources of revenue.
The oil-smuggling network, largely managed by senior Government officials related to President Saddam Hussein, including his son, Uday, and his brother-in-law, Industry Minister Hussein Kamil, shows every sign of expanding further as operators on both sides of Iraq's borders improve their logistics.
Oil executives and Iraqis say exports have expanded with the tacit support of Turkey, Iran, Jordan and others in the region that believe the sanctions against Iraq have been in place too long and are costing them too much in lost trade with Baghdad.
Dozens of international oil companies, including some from France, Italy, Russia, Britain, Spain, Canada, Asia and Latin America, are said to have concluded talks with Baghdad about plans to produce and export Iraqi oil once the sanctions are lifted. The goal would be to boost Iraq's production over the next few years to five million barrels a day.
This month an oil industry newsletter published in France, Petro strategies, quoted the chief executives of the two giant French international companies, Total and Elf-Acquitaine, as confirming that they had completed talks on a project to exploit some of Iraq's largest oil reserves as soon as the sanctions were lifted.
"If an opportunity arose to sign an agreement with Baghdad before sanctions are lifted for implementation afterwards, we would do so," Serge Tchuruk, the president of Total, was quoted as saying.
To advance such talks, Baghdad is planning a major international oil conference on March 11-12. Titled "The Future of the Oil Markets -- 2000-2010," the conference is expected to attract scores of industry representatives.
Last month Iraq's Oil Minister, Safa Hadi Jawad Habubi, was quoted by the Middle East Economic Survey, an oil industry newsletter, that the talks had produced "contracts" that "will be implemented once the sanctions are removed."
The United States has steadfastly refused to consider lifting the United Nations sanctions, saying Iraq has failed to comply with resolutions passed by the Security Council during the Persian Gulf war.
Washington also cited an Iraqi troop deployment near the Kuwaiti border last fall and accused President Hussein and his associates of living in luxury while ordinary Iraqis do without staples.
The United Nations currently allows Iraq to export only about 75,000 barrels of oil a day to Jordan. Under that arrangement, money is deposited in Jordan's central bank to cover Iraqi costs for the purchase of medicine and food. Iraq is now relying on the cash from the secret oil sales to buy additional necessities, one Iraqi official said.
The sheer size of Iraq's oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia's, has alone been a powerful incentive for international oil companies to stay in close touch with their Iraqi counterparts over the last few years of Baghdad's isolation. Iraq's oil reserves are estimated at 100 billion barrels, roughly 10 percent of known global reserves.
Current oil production is estimated at 750,000 barrels a day. The country refines a substantial amount into gasoline, fuel oil and other derivatives, some of which are now exported.
Many of Iraq's oil fields are located in the north near Kirkuk, close to the Turkish border, and in the south at Basra, near the border with Iran. From 1991 to 1993, the Iraqis were not able to use up all the oil and resorted to injecting some back into the oil fields. The growing export trade has now eliminated that surplus, the executives said.
Oil industry executives said the rush by French companies to seal new deals with Iraq was based partly on support from the French Government, which for some time has quietly indicated in talks with other membrs of the United Nations Security Council that it favored an end to sanctions against Baghdad.
The French Government's view, communicated in several private conversations with senior oil executives here, is that only the United States and Britain emerged from the Persian Gulf war of 1991 as major trading partners with the oil powers in the region like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
According to this view, France, Germany, Italy and other Western allies were excluded from a bonanza of contracts for the purchases of oil, weapons and commercial construction in the region at a time when they were also deprived of Iraqi business.
One Iraqi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said privately owned companies in Iraq linked to senior officials in President Hussein's Government were also involved in the oil sales. The Government's main purpose, he said, is to obtain the hard currency needed to support the country's food rationing system, which feeds most of Iraq's 19 million people.
According to Iraqi statements, it costs anywhere from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion a year to keep the meager rations flowing. In its first three years under the trade embargo, Baghdad was able to rely on hidden Iraqi bank accounts in other countries operated by friendly investors.
Over the past year those hidden savings began to run out, forcing Iraq to come up with new sources of revenue.

U.S. Doubts Figures
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- A Middle East expert in the State Department cast doubt on industry estimates of Iraq's oil exports today and said that international sanctions continue to make a huge dent in Iraq's oil sales.
"The figure of 200,000 barrels per day is greatly exaggerated," the expert said. He estimated that Iraq was exporting "a maximum of 100,000 barrels a day and probably less."
"We recognize there are violations, but overall the international efforts are very successful," he said.
The Iraqi delegate to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, dismissed the report, saying that any border trade with Iraq or Turkey had been minimal. "It is minute, and I don't think it really amounts to anything," he said.

HEADLINE: Europeans Shrug as Taxes Go Up

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany

 BODY:
Johann Scholtz sits in his white smock, hunched over his workbench 10 hours a day, stringing viola bows, repairing the necks of cellos and, when he has time, carving the maple back and front panels of his handmade violins. He says that often during his quiet labor, he remembers that more than 30 minutes of every hour go toward paying his taxes.
"I have no idea how much I pay," the 55-year-old master violin maker said. "It's so much. Only my tax accountant really knows. And the depressing thing is, my taxes are going up again this year." 
 Mr. Scholtz, who works in this German city known for its affluence and attention to style, has plenty of company. As Americans look to the new Republican-controlled Congress to cut taxes this year, taxes are going up across most of Europe.
Although European economies are expanding at a slower pace, European countries are shying away from cutting expenses because of the political dangers of threatening the quality of life. This has left little recourse but to raise taxes, despite the damping effect on economic growth.
In Spain the value-added tax, a kind of broad-based sales tax, rose one percentage point on Jan. 1, to 16 percent. Levies on electricity, gasoline, tobacco, alcohol and stamps are also rising.
Switzerland introduced a 6.5 percent value-added tax to replace a 6.3 percent sales tax on a much smaller basket of goods. The change will cost the public $1.2 billion this year.
In Sweden, the highest income-tax bracket jumps to 56 percent, from 51 percent, affecting anyone earning more than $30,000 a year. And in Britain, excise taxes on wine and spirits, gasoline and diesel fuel are rising.
In Italy, economists predict that a ballooning budget deficit is almost certain to force higher taxes.
Even in France, where a presidential election this year has discouraged politicians from increasing taxes, critics say the country's deficit is growing so rapidly that an increase after elections is inevitable.
It is not that Europeans are happy about it. Recent studies of German taxpayer sentiment found that a growing number of Germans -- known in Europe for their honesty about tax compliance -- say they are willing to cheat because they feel they are getting less for their tax dollar.
But few are willing to stage a tax revolt that might risk big changes in their system of free medical and nursing home care, nearly free college educations and generous pension and unemployment safety nets.
"As long as you have a job and pay your taxes, you are protected and don't have to worry about your future," said Paul Breuer, a former manager of Merrill Lynch's Hamburg office, who left a year ago to open Bender Antiquariat, a rare book and manuscript dealer.
"The European knows that if he gets sick he can go to a good hospital and it won't bankrupt him," said Mr. Breuer, who added that his tax rate was approaching 60 percent. "He knows his child will get a good education. He knows if his old parent gets sick or they need someone to give them a bath or take them out for a walk, they're protected.
"To Americans, these can be financially disastrous. But we don't fear them. That is why we keep paying. That is why we say, we don't like it but the taxes are necessary."
Europeans also frequently refer to lower crime rates, cleaner streets, state-of-the-art mass transportation and less social instability in general, all of which they see as products of their willingness to pay higher taxes.
While tax revenues in the United States amount to 31.6 percent of the overall economy, the proportion paid by European taxpayers is more than 45 percent.
"There is a sort of an understanding that varies from country to country," said Richard Reid, chief economist for the Frankfurt office of the Union Bank of Switzerland. '
'If your system works correctly, there is a willingness to pay taxes as long as you see what you are getting for it. In the United States, they don't have this strong association that you get tangible benefits from the taxes you pay."
If there is a country that typifies the acceptance of higher taxes, it is Germany, where the tax burden is rising almost 10 percent this year, by far the largest increase in Western Europe.
Germany's private wealth taxes are doubling, insurance taxes are rising 25 percent and a special 1 percent income tax to pay for old-age nursing care began on Jan. 1. Perhaps most controversial, a 7.5 percent tax increase, called the solidarity surcharge, will be extracted to pay for the rebuilding of the former East Germany.
And despite the new taxes already imposed this year, the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl is debating another $6.6 billion in energy taxes next year to subsidize coal mining.
In all, analysts say the tax bill for Germans will rise by $25 billion this year, when they are just recovering from the setbacks of the worst recession in Europe since World War II.
Yet many are philosophical about such taxes, particularly the solidarity surcharge.
"These are our brothers in the east and they need our help," Mr. Scholtz said. "We have to pay to let all of Germany prosper, and you can't risk the social problems of not caring for the eastern states. We can live with it."
But despite these high rates, taxes are not about to go down. The reason is that European governments are saddled with huge budget deficits coming out of the recent recession.
"There will be hardly any tax cuts in Europe through the end of the century," said Alfred Boss, economist with the Kiel Institute, an economic research group.
The European willingness to pay high taxes, compared with the frequent tax revolts that sweep the United States, also reflects a difference in the level of risks that Europeans seem to be able to stand, versus their American counterparts -- attitudes that are seen clearly in their saving and investment behavior.
For example, while Americans readily live beyond their means, taking out large home mortgages, building up credit card debt and flocking to equities that carry a relatively high risk level, Europeans are quite different.
In general, they buy homes outright with no mortgage loans. They carry very little consumer debt and only reluctantly buy stocks, preferring the assured (though lower) rates of return offered by fixed-income securities.
The explanation is simple: most of today's American taxpayers did not witness the stock market crash of 1929 or the Depression years and have not known widespread financial calamity, whereas twice this century Europeans have seen their continent destroyed by war and felt its economic reverberations for years afterward.
"There is a perception in Europe that if you live beyond your means, that is bad," Mr. Reid said. "In the United States it is more growth mentality. Here it is control of inflation and preventing big deficits."
But such reliance on Government for cradle-to-grave care has its weaknesses, economists add. Europeans are producing fewer patents and fewer entrepreneurs than the United States.
And the "good life" in Europe may in the long run be threatened by such high taxes and such generous social benefits, economists say. For example, economists say high taxes are stifling consumer spending, leaving Europe possibly vulnerable to recession again.
The Government of Sweden, long known as the most generous social welfare state, had to calm financial markets by announcing plans to slash social spending, sending a sober warning that there are limits to the European welfare state.
"I think we are now at the threshold of pain," said Matina Miksits, a salesclerk at a book store here. "Any higher and you have to ask yourself, 'Why work?' "
Indeed, there is a rising tide of resistance to higher taxes, seen in more tax evasion. Evasion is rampant and growing in most Mediterranean countries, like Italy, Greece and Spain, economists say.
Even in Germany, public sentiment is turning toward ways to avoid taxes. The German Association of Taxpayers found in a recent survey that the attitude toward tax evasion was significantly less critical than in similar surveys in 1977 and 1984.
"Germans are well on the way to losing their reputation as the most honest taxpayers in the world," said Karl Heinz Dake, the association's president. "Two-thirds of the population sees tax evasion not as criminal behavior, but merely as clever."
But no fundamental changes are seen in the near future. Despite more audible grousing, Europeans are far from revolt.
"Look at the German railroads and you can see what our tax dollar does," Mr. Scholtz said. "Look at my career. I have no fear that I will go bankrupt. I pay my taxes and know that if I have problems, the state will help."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Piper Jaffray to Settle Suits for $70 Million

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis investment firm, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $70 million to settle class-action lawsuits arising from the plunge in value of one of its mutual funds.
Shares of the mutual fund, Piper's Institutional Government Income Portfolio, fell by 28 percent last year, largely because of investments in complex securities backed by home mortgages that were unusually vulnerable to last year's sharp rise in interest rates. The suits contended that Piper Jaffray had misrepresented the risks of the fund. 
 The settlement appears to be the largest bailout to date of mutual fund shareholders. Last summer, Paine Webber bought $268 million in troubled securities from one of its mutual funds, causing it to take a $34 million after-tax loss.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Piper Jaffray shares rose $1.625, to $12.75, their highest point since August, as investors concluded that the firm had put the issue behind it.
"After the settlement, the financial condition of the Piper Jaffray Companies is strong," Addison L. Piper, the firm's chairman, said yesterday. "It will have no effect on our day-to-day operations."
After legal costs, the settlement will compensate the 7,000 investors for 40 to 46 percent of their losses, Richard A. Lockridge, a lawyer representing the shareholders, said. The lawyers will ask the court to award them an $11 million fee, he said.
 The deal will become valid only if it is approved by Federal court in Minneapolis and if shareholders representing more than 90 percent of the investments agree to participate.
The settlement, which will cost Piper $42 million after taxes, represents a stiff penalty for the brokerage firm, which earned $25 million in 1994 and $41 million in 1993.
 The firm agreed to pay $20 million of the settlement when it is approved, most likely later this year, and pay the remainder in two notes carrying 8 percent interest. The company plans to pay $27 million next year when it receives its income tax refund incorporating the deduction allowed for the settlement and the remaining $23 million in equal installments over three years.
The proposed settlement is meant to end about a dozen lawsuits relating to the Institutional Government Income fund. Piper still faces suits seeking to redress losses on several other funds it managed, and it has also been sued by shareholders who contend that Piper management made misleading statements that artificially inflated the company's stock price.
Mr. Piper said that the potential cost of those suits would be much less than the settlement announced yesterday. He declined to say whether the firm was negotiating a settlement in any of those cases.
Mr. Lockridge, the lawyer, agreed that the claim of the shareholders of the Institutional Government Income fund was stronger than those of other Piper clients, because that fund was marketed as an especially low-risk investment, and it moreover violated its investment restrictions.
A suit continues against KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm that audited the Institutional Government Income fund.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAN: REACTION;
Giuliani Cuts Raise Issue Of City's Soul

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
In explaining his painfully austere vision of municipal life this week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said it was time New York became more like other cities, scaling back its traditionally generous services to something more like an American norm. But as New Yorkers confronted his spending plan yesterday, even those who found something attractive about those cities wondered whether the price of resemblance was too high.
City residents interviewed yesterday generally agreed with the Mayor's assertion that New York had been far too profligate for too long. But they also worried that by cutting government so deeply, Mr. Giuliani may have placed in jeopardy the city's soul, the urban largesse that has defined New York and made it the world's destination. 
 "These things that he's cutting -- the hospitals, the day care, the colleges -- have made New York special," said Vincent L. Hall Jr., the manager of the Gracie Station post office on the Upper East Side and a longtime civic worker in Bushwick, Brooklyn. "These are the reasons why New York is such a diverse place and such a great place. I know we have to cut back, but I don't want us to be the same as any other city."
Some residents, fed up with what they consider the city's declining quality of life, said they were solidly behind the Mayor's austerity measures. Christine Mundt, an account executive interviewed on a mid-Manhattan street yesterday, said the city's relatively high taxes seemed to be lost on wasteful spending, rarely directed to those who need it.
"The premium doesn't go to making the quality of life in this city any better," said Ms. Mundt. "I don't think the money goes where it's supposed to go; it doesn't go to keep the quality of life high. It's never going to go forward, to advance. It's only going backward to make up for previous deficits."
But Joannene Coppinger-Borock, a resident of Whitestone, Queens, said it was not just the museums and theaters that had given New York its singular character -- it was the accumulation of small generosities, like after-school programs so that parents can work, or day-care centers, or school bus service, that continued to make the city attractive to its middle-class residents. Most of those services would be heavily cut in the spending plan the Mayor proposed on Tuesday.
"I know he thinks after-school programs are a typical New York luxury that the taxpayers have gotten used to," said Ms. Coppinger-Borock, who is industrial coordinator for the Ridgewood Local Development Corporation and who voted for the Mayor. "But these things are the backbone of life here. Without them, working families are just going to pack up and move out."
Mr. Giuliani proposed cutting next year's budget by $1.3 billion, or 4 percent, from the current year's budget, the greatest proportional reduction in spending since 1933. Most of the cuts would be in welfare, health care, schools and sanitation.
In justifying his plans to fill a $2.7 billion budget gap, the Mayor talked at great length this week about New York's historical generosity, how it has traditionally provided far more services per capita than any other American city.
"We must confront the reality that we cannot continue spending substantially more money than other American cities," he said in an address broadcast Monday night.
But few other cities have tended to their less fortunate residents in the manner of New York, and those who were once poor and remember the city's extended hand urged the Mayor not to pull it back so far.
Jerome Charyn, the novelist and author of "Metropolis: New York as Myth, Marketplace and Magical Land" (Avon, 1987), said the immigrants who shaped the city's government in the first half of this century could not have imagined such a retreat.
"To me what's made New York City so great is that it's always been a champion of the poor," said Mr. Charyn, who grew up in the Bronx in the 1930's and 40's. "I was a kid from the street and my parents had no money at all, yet I still had good teachers and was able to go to school. It was the only way the poor had a chance, and now it's completely disappearing."
That sense of compassion -- what Mr. Charyn called "a softness, a belief in the instant of goodness" -- was a byproduct of a galloping local economy that has since slowed to a walk. Most of those interviewed yesterday said they understood that the city's lofty goals had been brought low by economic pressures, and sympathized with the Mayor's need to balance the budget.
But few seemed to share his relish in doing so. "This is an exciting opportunity to manage government more efficiently," Mr. Giuliani said on Tuesday, expressing an enthusiasm for the cutbacks that found few echoes yesterday.
But Jerry Lopez, 34, who works as a salesman for a toy store on East 116th Street in East Harlem, said his main concern was for the local economy. "The people that mostly live around here, that's what's supporting them," he said, referring to public assistance. "That's how they survive." He added, "If they don't get their money, there's no business around here."
Mr. Lopez said he thought too much of the cutting was falling on the poor. "There's a lot of people that don't have nothing, and a lot of people who have a lot," he said. "And I'm concerned about the people who have nothing."
Even those who expressed a need to attack government waste wondered about the balance in the cuts. "Maybe we haven't minded our fiscal house for too long," said Catherine Volpe, a member of Community School Board 30 in northwest Queens. "But isn't there some kind of middle ground, something that doesn't handicap the city? I don't know. I'm just worried."
Many residents said yesterday that there was at once something attractive about beginning to resemble other cities -- cleaner, more orderly cities -- and something disturbing. New York may need to slough off much of its activist governmental culture for budgetary reasons, but the psychological costs may be high, they said, particularly if the city's poor are devastated.
"I've always wondered when I'm in other large cities why the streets are so much cleaner, why people don't assume the city will just clean up after them," Ms. Volpe said. "It's probably overdue that we move in that direction, but I don't want it to be so severe that it starts to really hurt people."
Even those who agreed that the budget was bloated said Mr. Giuliani was moving much too fast, trying to overhaul an entire civic culture almost overnight. Carl Clay, director of the Black Spectrum Theater in Brooklyn, said the city might need to lose weight, but did not require the crash diet prescribed by the Mayor.
"We all know one of the basic principles of dieting is, you have to do it gradually," said Mr. Clay. "If you speed up that process, if you try to wean yourself too fast off something you've had for a long time, you will die. And that's what could happen to this city."

HEADLINE: A Default Worsens Mexico Ills

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Two weeks after the announcement of more than $50 billion in international loans to rescue the Mexican economy, a new wave of investor concern swept the markets here today as a tourism and construction conglomerate became the first big Mexican company to default on its debt since the financial crisis began.
Dragged down by a plunge of nearly 24 percent in the price of shares of the conglomerate, Grupo Sidek, values on the Mexican stock exchange plunged 123 points, or 6.41 percent. The market index fell to 1,798, its lowest level in 17 months. 
 With fears growing that even the huge-scale rescue plan might not be sufficient to pull the Mexican financial system out of its 10-week slide, annual interest rates on 28-day Mexican treasury bills shot up to 40 percent today.
The peso also fell -- to 5.965 to the dollar, its weakest since the loan package assembled by the Clinton Administration was announced on Jan. 31. The peso is now worth 16.76 cents, compared with 28.90 cents before devaluation eight weeks ago.
"What we had all hoped for is that investors would be so reassured by the existence of the $50 billion package that they wouldn't change their peso-denominated holdings into dollars," said Lawrence D. Krohn, senior economist for Latin America at UBS Securities. "That hasn't happened because there is deep anxiety about Mexico's ability to right itself quickly enough."
Mexican officials acknowledged that they were still bargaining with United States Treasury officials over terms for the $20 billion in American loans that form the cornerstone of the package. In particular, they said, the Americans had questions about the monetary policies Mexico proposed as part of a new economic-recovery plan.
Mexico has also hit some bumps in its negotiations with commercial and investment banks over the smaller loans those institutions agreed to contribute to the $50 billion, American bankers and Mexican officials said.
With Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz and Mr. Zedillo's chief of staff, Luis Tellez, expected to travel to Washington on Thursday for talks, Mexican officials said they hoped that a final loan agreement could still be reached by early next week.
But even some Mexican officials said they were worried that their Government had yet to outline the new policies. And market analysts said Grupo Sidek's failure to meet a $19.5 million debt payment today would only heighten the skepticism with which with a new plan was eventually received.
"The actual amount is not really that important," said Eduardo M. Cabrera, a Latin American analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The question is how many more corporations are going to miss their payments. What will the impact be on the banking system? Things are going to get worse before they get better."
Many Mexican companies have been squeezed badly by the 42 percent fall in the peso's value against the dollar since the Government devalued the currency on Dec. 20, and it came as little surprise that a company like Grupo Sidek would be the first to withhold debt payments.
The Sidek subsidiary that owed most of the money, a resort and real estate-development concern called Grupo Situr, has about $100 million in commercial paper maturing over the next two months and nearly $1 billion in total dollar-denominated debt. At the end of January, Duff & Phelps estimated the company's cash assets at $60 million.
In a statement released today, the company insisted that it had enough cash on hand to have met its obligations, but chose to use the money instead to finance continuing operations. It defaulted on commercial paper, the unsecured debt that companies use to cover daily expenses.
Mexican and foreign investors sent Grupo Sidek's stock price reeling, down 23.8 percent on the Mexico City exchange, and Situr's down 22.4 percent. Shares of the big Mexican bank and brokerage firm, Banacci, which is believed to own 16 percent of Sidek, fell by 14.3 percent.
Other industrial companies with large debts were also hit hard. Shares of Cemex fell 7.8 percent, while those of the steel company Hylsa dropped 10.4 percent.
Other Mexican stocks were battered by everything from confusion about Mr. Zedillo's abrupt halt of an army offensive in Chiapas state to rumors that the president of the nation's central bank, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, would resign.
Stock indexes tumbled elsewhere in Latin America today, too -- sharply in Argentina and Brazil, modestly in Chile, Venezuela and Peru.
Financial analysts attributed the selling of pesos by foreign investors, in particular, to deeper fears.
Although the markets seemed to understand that Mr. Zedillo has been busy -- the last week has brought troubles ranging from the Chiapas offensive to the governing party's biggest defeat ever in an election in the western state of Jalisco -- analysts said there was growing concern that Mexico could use up its new loans and loan guarantees without stabilizing the economy.
The Government has already drawn down $7.8 billion in credits from the International Monetary Fund, and Mexican brokers said the central bank spent heavily today to keep the peso's exchange rate from dropping below 6 to the dollar.
Mexican and American officials said their two countries' talks were focusing in part on Mexico's plan to limit the growth of its money supply, in line with the levels of its foreign-exchange reserves. One American official insisted that the talks were "moving along."
"There are going to be important conditions," the official said in a telephone interview from Washington. "There is going to be central bank transparency, and central bank policies that will prevent any recurrence of the mistakes of last year."

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAY: CUNY;
Chancellor Says Pataki Cuts Will Raise Tuition and Force Layoffs of 1,000 Professors

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The City University of New York will have to raise tuition by $1,000 a student and lay off more than 1,000 full-time professors, a quarter of the full-time force, if the state budget cuts proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki are enacted, CUNY Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds intends to tell Albany legislators at a budget hearing today.
Faculty leaders and educators say the system faces the worst financial crisis since the city's fiscal crisis 20 years ago, when the City University was forced to start charging tuition. The layoffs would be the first since 1992, when two dozen people were dismissed because of budget problems. 
 Last month, Governor Pataki's executive budget -- the first step in a long and tortuous budgetary process -- called for cutting $162 million from the CUNY budget, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget calls for an additional $40 million in cuts.
The senior, or four-year colleges, of the City University get most of their revenue from the state, while the community colleges get most of their money from the city.
Chancellor Reynolds immediately instructed the 18 City University presidents to prepare plans for the cutbacks that would be necessary if the Governor's proposal was enacted. Her testimony today, before the Senate Finance Committee and Assembly Ways and Means Committee, is based on the plans submitted by the presidents. She plans to ask the Legislature to restore funding for the schools to avoid these cuts.
When informed of Chancellor Reynolds's prepared testimony, Sandi Cooper, chairwoman of the University Faculty Senate, said: "If these cuts are made, we're going to have to find another name for this place. We couldn't call it a university. Maybe we'd call it a holding pen."
She added that the present situation is "infinitely worse" than any fiscal crisis of the past "because we don't have a state government with the moral and social will to support public higher education."
If tuition at the senior colleges -- presently $2,450 -- were raised to $3,450, it would be a 41 percent increase and the single highest one-year jump in the university's history.
Ms. Reynolds is to say that layoffs in the university's 12 senior colleges would total 928 full-time faculty and 1,500 adjuncts. Together they teach more than 10,000 class sections, or a fifth of the total, and they would be canceled.
Also, 736 non-teaching personnel would be dismissed, and a $9.6 million reduction would cut into library books and other instruictional equipment.
The City University's six community colleges would suffer a $10.6 million loss from the state on top of the proposed $28 million reduction in city funds, Chancellor Reynolds's statement declares.
The result would be the elimination of 501 full-time positions, 286 of them teachers and the rest support staff. Also, 2,574 class sections would be canceled.
The budget for adjunct professors would be cut by 16 percent, resulting in the cancellation of 1,800 class sections. Finally, 450 part-time positions in support services would be dropped.
Noting CUNY's contribution to the New York economy, Chancellor Reynolds's statement quotes Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, who recently said: "It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of CUNY in supplying New York's most important ingredient: a skilled labor force."
Chancellor Reynolds's report also expresses dismay over the projected elimination of the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge program which dates back to 1969.
The program provides intense remedial work, tutoring and counseling for promising students who are also economically and educationally disadvantaged. A similar program at the community colleges, called the College Discovery Program, also stands to be eliminated under the Governor's proposed budget.
The Chancellor's testimony appeals for the restoration of financial aid programs such as the Aid to Part Time Students, which is completely eliminated in the Governor's budget proposal; the Tuition Assistance Program, which is earmarked for a significant cut, and the Graduate Tuition Assistance Program, which is scheduled for complete elimination.
Asked if the cuts and consolidations specified in the Academic Program Planning Initiative adopted by the CUNY trustees in 1993 would lessen the impact of the cuts, Jay Hershenson, vice chancellor for university relations, said:
"It puts the university in a better position because the planning process preceded this request, but at the same time the magnitude of the proposed cuts has caused the university to seek assistance from the legislature."

HEADLINE: Serbia Has Earned No Reward

 BODY:
The five-power negotiating group on Bosnia, which includes the United States, is offering to suspend all remaining United Nations economic sanctions on Serbia. In return, it asks Belgrade to recognize the independence of Bosnia and Croatia and cut off supplies to rebel Serbian armies in both countries.
That might be a reasonable proposal if Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, had a record of honoring his commitments, or if the five-power group had a record of insisting on compliance with its deals. Neither is true. 
 The Clinton Administration, which portrays itself as a reluctant partner in Europe's pro-Serb strategy, should have rejected this latest diplomatic charade. The new humiliations it courts can only strengthen the hand of Senate critics like Bob Dole, the majority leader, who are already pushing Washington to ditch its European allies and independently lift the arms embargo on Bosnia.
The latest offer to Belgrade comes as evidence mounts that Serbia has not lived up to the last deal it made with the five powers, whose other members are France, Britain, Germany and Russia. Last year Mr. Milosevic pledged to stop supplying the Bosnian Serbs in exchange for a partial lifting of U.N. sanctions against Serbia. Recently Serbian helicopters have been brazenly flying supplies across the supposedly sealed border. Yet instead of reimposing the lifted sanctions there is an offer to suspend those that remain. The sanctions lifted last year were symbolic. Those now being discussed affect Serbia's ability to wage protracted war.
Washington's motive in going along with the five-power plan was apparently fear that Croatia would expel U.N. forces from its territory, perhaps triggering a wider war. Serbian recognition of Croatian independence, in theory, might allow the U.N. troops to stay. It is a worthy, if elusive, objective, but the price is too high.
Bribing Mr. Milosevic to make peace was never the Clinton Administration's preferred policy. Washington long and correctly argued that the world should let Bosnia defend itself by lifting the unfair arms embargo that tilts the battlefield balance toward the Serbs. Regrettably, the Administration has all but dropped its efforts on the arms embargo in the name of NATO unity.
Instead of strengthening NATO, the Administration's passivity toward Europe has weakened it. American lawmakers are becoming disenchanted with an alliance in which American dollars and troops are welcome, but American ideas are not.
Washington needs to reconsider this latest proposal to court the Serbs. Instead it should start pressing its allies to move together toward lifting the Bosnian arms embargo before the Senate forces separate American action. The time to talk about lifting more sanctions on Serbia will come when Serbia starts honoring its commitments.

Iraq's Threat: Biological Warfare

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
With Iraq's nuclear and poison-gas production capability limited by the scrutiny of U.N. inspectors, Saddam Hussein is developing the means to produce a terror weapon much harder to find: the deadly micro-organisms of biological warfare.
Thirty quarts of cultures of cholera, tuberculosis and plague bacteria were discovered in the past few months. At the Sepp Institute in Methana, in underground storage at the Ghazi Research Institute in Amiria, at Salman-Pak and Al-Hakem, the necessary fermentors, lyophilizers for freeze-drying and centrifuges for separation of bacteria are in place. 
 Hundreds of biologists are kept on Iraq's payroll awaiting orders from a woman named Rihab Rashid Taha al-Azawi. Dr. Taha, 42, trained in toxicology in Britain, is known to some Iraqis as "Dr. Germs."
Though Western intelligence agencies knew Dr. Taha to be the developer of Saddam's botulinum toxin stockpile in the 80's, she now pretends to be developing innocent vaccines. Under this cover, she regularly seeks to mislead four members of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) investigating germ warfare.
Ambassador Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, who heads the commission, is frustrated by the foot-dragging, belated admissions about sites and deliberate withholding of facts about experiments on animals that typifies the stonewalling of Dr. Taha and her toxic colleagues.
"It's like '1001 Nights,' " he told me at his U.N. office in New York before flying to Baghdad today. "We say, 'Do you have cages for monkeys?' They say, 'No, never any experiments on primates.' We say, 'What about these cages, with animal hair?' They say, 'Oh, those cages -- we planned to use them for medical research.' Their story changes every night. They admit only what we can prove."
Sources inside Iraq say that hidden equipment for the growth of anthrax, botulinum toxin and pasteurella, causative agent of the plague, includes 50-liter fermentors and sterile mixing tanks made by the Italian company Olsa and 150-liter fermentors supplied in the 80's by the Swiss company Chemak. Because anthrax spores resist re-entry heat, those are the germs of choice for use in missile warheads.
Such terror-war seems too horrible to contemplate. But Saddam readily reintroduced poison gas in the 80's, raining death on 5,000 Kurds in Halabja (and Ambassador Ekeus was one of the few diplomats to denounce that at the time). Rod Barton, the Australian who heads UNSCOM's bio-warfare section, notes that Russia only recently admitted that the 1979 outbreak of anthrax in Sverdlovsk was caused by an accident at a bio-war plant at which more than 100 workers died.
Reluctant to confirm specifics about sites, Mr. Ekeus states unequivocally: "We face our greatest problems in accounting for Iraq's past and present biological program." Dr. Taha insists her past military-financed research was purely to protect against disease, but the UNSCOM report of two months ago concluded: "the indications all point to an offensive program."
The U.N. commission thinks the Iraqis are not now producing germs for delivery, but is certain Saddam has the equipment, material and expertise on hand to begin production of biological warfare agents as soon as inspectors are thrown out. The facility in Dura now innocently producing hoof-and-mouth vaccines is set up for immediate changeover to bio-war production.
With such a capability at hand; with the will to use terror-weaponry already demonstrated by Saddam; with the means of production and delivery awaiting only oil income and a few months' secrecy -- is this the moment to suspend the world's economic sanctions on Iraq?
France, Russia and China, eager for business, think so. The U.S. and Britain think not. Germany wavers.
To encourage Iraq to let his team stay, Mr. Ekeus's April report may cite some progress in inspections. A drumbeat of stories will follow about how poor Iraqis are suffering from the denial of oil income.
Don't fall for it. If the world lets heavy money flow to Baghdad while Saddam rules, at least one weapon of mass destruction will soon be in the hands of a proven killer. He would delight in being the first to use it.

Treasuries Rise After Early Selling Is Reversed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities advanced yesterday for the second consecutive day after a batch of Government reports that first raised, than eased investor concerns about economic growth and inflation.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 15/32 , to 10027/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.55 percent, from 7.59 percent on Tuesday, but up 2 basis points from its low for the day. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. 
 Traders said early selling was prompted by Government data that showed inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was up three-tenths of 1 percent in January, and up four-tenths of 1 percent excluding volatile food and energy prices. Economists had expected an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent for both the index and the so-called core number.
But the early selling was reversed after a report by the Federal Reserve showed a smaller-than-expected increase in the operation of plants, mines and utilities. The data eased concerns that the economy's momentum would cause inflation to rise and compel the Fed to raise interest rates in March.
The report showed plant use rose to 85.5 percent, instead of the expected 85.6 percent, from 85.4 percent in December. Economists usually associate increases in plant-use rates with bottlenecks that prompt suppliers to charge higher prices.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said, "January data showed that the consumer price inflation rate is edging higher, but no more than is already built into bond market expectations."
He noted that the industrial production data showed some moderation in manufacturing growth, especially when combined with recent weakness in several industrial commodity prices. "These data, taken together with weakness in the Tuesday's retail sales report lead me to believe there is little chance that the Fed will move rates up again at its meeting next month," Mr. Hoffman said. "A move up in rates at the May Fed meeting is still probable, but even then the odds may have diminished just a little in light of these recent reports."
Traders said the market's strong rally was thwarted by comments yesterday from the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. Speaking before a meeting of the Independent Bankers Association in Hawaii, he said, "U.S growth must slow if inflation is to be avoided," adding that the country was "close to price stability, but not there yet." According to traders, the market took that to mean that the Fed was not finished raising interest rates.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it planned to sell $28.25 billion of new two-year and five-year notes next week.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's note sales, dealers were offering the notes at prices to yield 7.12 percent for a two-year note, and 7.35 percent for a five-year note.
Municipal bond yields dropped once again even as ratings on the District of Columbia's bonds were lowered to junk-bond status by Moody's Investors Service, from Baa to Ba for uninsured general obligation debt. Yesterday, Standard & Poor's lowered the District's ratings to one notch above junk, from A- to triple-B-.
The jump in prices renewed concerns that the demand for tax-exempt securities would increase, making it harder to find bonds later this year. About 32 percent fewer bonds are scheduled to be sold in the next 30 days than were scheduled last year during the same period. According to the Bond Buyer, there are $2.13 billion in bonds scheduled for sale.

HEADLINE: What Readiness to Fight Two Wars Means

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Two-War Fantasy" (editorial, Feb. 5) suggests that the United States would never face two major regional conflicts at once. In fact, twice last year President Clinton was prepared to commit troops against well-armed adversaries to protect foreign policy goals. 
 In June, North Korea was on the verge of producing enough plutonium to make up to five nuclear weapons. We were ready to seek economic sanctions against North Korea, something Pyongyang said it would consider an act of war. As a result, we were also preparing for a substantial military buildup in South Korea, where we already have 37,000 troops. Fortunately, North Korea agreed to negotiations that ultimately led to an agreement to halt its current nuclear program. The crisis ended without conflict.
United States security interests faced another threat in October, when elite Iraqi divisions suddenly started moving toward Kuwait. We feared another invasion and quickly mobilized significant ground, air and naval forces to repel Iraq. In the face of our resolve, Saddam Hussein withdrew.
In both cases deterrence worked because the United States had a ready force and was prepared to use it. But consider what might have happened if deterrence had not worked in North Korea. At the very least we would have been engaged in a tense standoff with a country that has a well-trained and forward-deployed army of 1.1 million men. At worst, we could have faced a war requiring a major commitment of force.
And what if Saddam Hussein, seeing that we were occupied in North Korea, had chosen this moment to launch a new attack against Kuwait?
The United States strategy to maintain a force that can fight two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts is designed to prevent just this type of adventurism.
You quote me as saying that the prospect of fighting two wars is "entirely implausible." The two words that you surgically lifted from my testimony to Congress distorted my point: fighting two wars is implausible precisely because we have the capability to respond to two challenges at once. If we only had the capability for one major conflict, our weakness could invite a second conflict, thereby making plausible what would otherwise be an implausible scenario.

HEADLINE: Let's Just Look at Who Wants U.S. Leadership

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Look Who Wants U.S. as a Leader" (Week in Review, Feb. 12): 
 It is not "India" or "Indonesia" or "Sri Lanka" that wants the United States to lead the world, but increasingly desperate governments that have risked their political fortunes on International Monetary Fund-styled liberalizations that are not reaping the promised economic results who now turn to the promoter of the I.M.F. to help them face their own unhappy populations. If the crisis with the Mexican regime has not taught us that, nothing will.
The people who live in India are frustrated and angry with their Government's concern for the well-being of multinational corporations, rather than for the well-being of its citizens. In the last elections in four states, the ruling party was mauled. Protests in Bangalore two years ago resulted in the departure of Cargill, one of the agribusiness companies whose policies worked in opposition to the interests of Indian farmers.
These farmers are not asking the United States to lead the world. United States leadership has resulted in the production of I.M.F.-induced economic basket cases (Eastern Europe, Mexico, Pakistan). That sort of leadership is not in the interests of working people anywhere.
Indian intellectuals are still worried that an unfettered Uncle Sam will be telling the world what to do. But what worries us is that the orders are now being given through public agencies that are not accountable to anyone.
Democracy is founded on accountability: no one voted the United States to be the world's policeman or the I.M.F. to run the world's economy. Let us first mend our own cities before we tell the rest of the world what to do.

HEADLINE: Index Shows A Slight Rise For Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
A whiff of inflation hit consumers in January just as the industrial economy was clearly starting to slow down from its breakneck 1994 pace, Government reports showed today.
Consumer prices climbed three-tenths of 1 percent, the most since summer, as housing costs accelerated, and clothing, air fares and home furnishings turned up after prolonged declines. 
 Ignoring the erratic food and energy components, the price index rose an even faster four-tenths of 1 percent. Nevertheless, economists remained calm, and securities traders paid more attention to a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in industrial production for January that confirmed a welcome letup in the economic growth.
After an initial setback, the bond market advanced and helped propel the stock market, as gauged by the Dow Jones industrial average, to a record, flirting with the 4,000 mark.
"Inflation should start ticking up modestly, but I don't see any major rise," said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank in New York. He described the economy as having begun a classic slowdown, with housing and retail sales already softening.
For months, price pressures have been building at various stages of the production process, and it has been widely assumed that at least some of this would eventually reach consumers at the end of the pipeline, despite a yearlong drive by the Federal Reserve to head off an inflationary surge.
Analysts were reassured today not only by a halving of industrial output growth from the November and December pace, but also by a negligible one-tenth of a point rise in the operating rates of both factories and American industry as a whole, suggesting that capacity is not being strained unduly.
Still, the rise in the so-called core inflation was the most for a single month since October 1992, and it remains possible, analysts said, that the Consumer Price Index will rise this year by more than the half-point that is widely projected -- to about 3 1/4 percent from 2 3/4 percent.
The Labor Department introduced some new methodology in calculating the January index, but this had no noticeable effect, officials said. The change was not directly related to the recent contention by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the index overstates inflation by as much as 1 1/2 points.
The report also showed steep price increases for all five of the metropolitan areas for which January changes were published today. These jumps, which are not adjusted for recurring seasonal patterns, were six-tenths of 1 percent for New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, eight-tenths of 1 percent for Philadelphia and nine-tenths of 1 percent for Chicago. Shelter and apparel were particularly important factors in the New York rise.
Nationally, it was the housing component, which accounts for 41 percent of the index, that had the biggest impact; it rose four-tenths of 1 percent following no change in December. Rents, utilities, maintenance and repairs, cable television and local telephone charges all climbed, and the 10.3 percent rise in postage rates -- part of household operations -- was also included here.
Apparel prices surged seven-tenths of 1 percent after falling for three straight months, reflecting earlier-than-usual discounting of cold-weather clothing, which meant smaller discounts in January, the department said.
Much of a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in transportation charges last month was from a 2.2 percent jump in airline fares after four straight declines at the end of 1994 totaling 10.8 percent.
But in an unusual action for a trade group, the Air Transport Association challenged the department's calculation, insisting in a letter to Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, that fares fell by about 8 percent, according to its quick calculation.
"You'd have a hard time convincing me that my prices are up," said David A. Swierenga, the chief economist of the association.
In response, Patrick C. Jackman, a department official who supervises the Consumer Price Index, said the difference could not represent either seasonal factors or an inadequate survey and speculated that the association was making an annual rather than a monthly comparison.
Another jump in automobile finance charges, 4 percent in January, and a 2.6 percent rise in used-car prices also lifted the price index.
Services, which make up about 57 percent of the index, jumped five-tenths of 1 percent last month, while commodities, at 43 percent, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent.
The Federal Reserve's production report showed that the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 85.5 percent of capacity last month, up one-tenth of a point, another 15-year high.
The rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in output compared with increases revised today to eight-tenths of 1 percent and nine-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, for November and December.
Output growth at factories, with a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent, slowed even more as nondurables actually posted a small decline.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Getting credit for deficit-cutting, or the onus for not doing it.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 1996 budget, disclosed last week to a chorus of sighs and worse, seems destined to be the least-read best seller since "The Bell Curve."
But before all 1,100 pages are erased from the nation's memory banks, they are surely worth one quick look. For while this budget has been dismissed as a political place marker, it is also the opening gambit in what promises to be a battle over who gets credit for cutting the deficit -- or, more likely, the onus for not cutting it. 
 The President's arithmetic offers a little something for everyone. It would consolidate hundreds of programs with weak constituencies and would reduce the Federal payroll by 170,000. The resulting savings (plus modest spending cuts in future years) would allow a small tax reduction for the middle-income Americans without increasing the deficit or clipping a penny from retirees' pension and medical benefits.
What could be wrong with that? The standard political answer is that it imitates the opposition's promises rather than trumping them. After all, Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, is proposing bigger tax cuts, bigger spending cuts and -- miracle of miracles -- a balanced budget by 2002. In the words of Robert D. Reischauer, the departing director of the Congressional Budget Office, the Administration's budget is merely "Republican lite."
Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution and former adviser to President Jimmy Carter, sees deeper flaws. For one thing, some $80 billion of the $144 billion in spending reductions would come from unspecified cuts in "discretionary" outlays. Mr. Clinton, it seems, wants frugality much the way St. Augustine wanted chastity: not now.
More important, Mr. Bosworth suggests, the President's bean counters are falling back on the sort of creative accounting that served Ronald Reagan so well. The most obvious examples are projections of faster growth of overall output and slower growth in medical costs. The differences, roughly three-tenths of 1 percent a year in the gross domestic product and 1 percent in Medicare, seem modest enough. But they go a long way toward explaining why the Clinton deficit is some $40 billion smaller than the budget office's estimate by the year 2000.
Less obvious -- and therefore more objectionable, in Mr. Bosworth's view -- is that the President's budget plays games with inflation. The Government keeps tracks of several different indicators of changing prices, among them the Consumer Price Index and the broader, but less familiar, G.D.P. deflator. Both are conceptually flawed and both are being revised. What irritates Mr. Bosworth is that the Administration has chosen to use the revisions selectively to reduce deficit projections.
In 1994 the Consumer Price Index rose a half a percentage point more than the G.D.P. deflator, a gap that the budget office assumes will widen to six-tenths of 1 percent in 2000. By contrast, the White House assumes the difference will narrow to just one-tenth of 1 percent in 2000.
What's the big deal? A lower Consumer Price Index tends to reduce the deficit because it reduces increases in entitlement spending and reduces the rate of adjustment of income tax brackets. By the same token, a higher G.D.P. deflator generates more revenue. Put them together -- as the Administration has -- and the deficit shrinks by tens of billions between now and 2000.
Such criticism may seem like carping. Mr. Clinton, after all, is the first President to reverse the trend toward rising deficits that began with Ronald Reagan, and his Administration will certainly remain ahead of the deficit curve during his four-year term. At very least, the harsh words are ironic: many Americans learned of Mr. Clinton's achievements in the first two years of his Presidency only because he has been so fiercely criticized for abandoning the goal of further reductions in the third and fourth.
What's more, it ignores the reality that Democrats have been more conservative on deficit issues than Republicans, but the Republicans have won the public relations battle as the party of fiscal responsibility. President Clinton has apparently decided to stick the opposition with the blame for cutting spending, since they are likely to get the credit for any deficit reduction.
The catch: With military, Social Security and tax increases off the table, Mr. Bosworth reckons Congress will have to find $400 billion in cuts from roughly $1 trillion in spending in order to balance the budget by 2002. If neither party will play fall guy, then the prospect of eliminating the deficit is more remote than ever. The best hope, at least from the public's perspective, is that the politics of deficit reduction change radically once the consequences of ignoring entitlement spending are more widely understood. Nobody in Washington, however, seems to be thinking that far ahead.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Despite a Rally in Stocks, Dollar's Advance Is Fitful

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished little changed yesterday, as traders focused on Mexico's financial woes and shrugged off a rally in American stocks.
In late New York trading, the dollar edged down to 1.5090 German marks, from 1.5091 marks on Tuesday, but inched up to 1.2755 Swiss francs from 1.2740 francs. The dollar also slipped against the Japanese yen, to 98.33 yen from 98.50 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5611 from $1.5623. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average surged yesterday, at one time less than 3 points shy of 4,000, after the Federal Reserve reported a downturn in United States manufacturing activity last month. Gains in American stocks tend to support the dollar.
But the positive effects of the stock market rally were offset by a turn for the worse in Mexico's troubled economy.
"We ended up trading the dollar sideways today," said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York. "There are forces pulling both ways. It's a bit of a standoff."
The peso weakened sharply, closing at 5.965 pesos to the dollar, compared with 5.845 peos on Tuesday, after a poor auction of Mexican Treasury bills showed a continued lack of foreign investor confidence in the country's financial markets.
Because of the United States' close trade and investment ties to the southern neighbor, many investors in recent months have come to view Mexico's financial crisis as trouble for the American economy. "The dollar is guilty by association in the eyes of foreign investors," said Carol Stone, senior economist for Nomura Securities in New York.
In other currency trading, the German mark advanced broadly, briefly setting a record high against the Italian lira, on prospects for an interest rate increase in Germany. Higher rates raise returns on deposits and short-term assets and tend to bring investment flows into a currency.
The IG Metall metalworkers' union has been ordering a series of three-hour strikes to support demands of pay increases of 5.5 to 6 percent. Currency dealers speculate that if German employers accede to the powerful industrial union's demands, the central bank may feel compelled to raise interest rates.
"That's being seen as bullish for the mark, since it would pull funds into Germany," said Belal Khan, senior currency dealer at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s office in New York. "The mark is being bought, and the dollar isn't the currency of choice at this time."

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Falls

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus plunged more than 50 percent in January, and analysts said today that the gap would probably continue to shrink as reconstruction after the Kobe earthquake last month drew in imports.
The trade surplus fell to $2.88 billion in January from $6.03 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. But the surplus with the United States rose to $3.19 billion, from $3.09 billion a year earlier. 
 Economists said the earthquake that struck the city of Kobe on Jan. 17 was likely to push imports higher on new demand for materials used in the reconstruction.
Japan's overall exports in yen terms shrank by 6.1 percent in January from a year earlier, mostly because of damage to Kobe's port operations, an official at the Ministry of Finance said.
Though imports were also affected by the damage to Kobe, those cargoes were able to be quickly moved through other ports like Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka, helping to minimize the effect on Japan's overall imports, the official said.
Exports rose 4.9 percent in January from a year earlier, to $27.24 billion, and imports rose 22.2 percent, to $24.36 billion.
Economists said exports were also affected by slowdowns and temporary stoppages at some factories after the earthquake because of shortages of parts.

HEADLINE: The Once And Future Brush

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
THE rendezvous site was perfect: the men's room at the Paramount Hotel on West 46th Street.
Finally, the two would meet again face to face: Philippe Starck, the French superstar designer, and Alan J. Heller, an American housewares manufacturer. 
 For two years the pair had been jousting by telephone and fax over a joint venture: the design and manufacture of a high-profile (and economically priced) toilet brush. Now it was time to review the final prototype.
"It was a product I wanted to do for 20 years," said Mr. Starck, 46, the famed designer of toothbrushes and ashtrays, restaurants, hotel interiors and furniture (some of which have adorned the presidential rooms of Elysee Palace in Paris). "I've always thought it would be the apotheosis of my career," he said.
Seriously.
"I've always said that I was always interested in the human being who uses the object," he added. "To design a toilet brush would be the most humble service I could give."
Mr. Starck designed the interiors of the Paramount, including the striking conical stainless steel sinks and jazzy multicolor ceramic tile in the men's and ladies' rooms. "My bathrooms are always an important moment, because they are a way to show respect to those who some call consumers, but I call friends," said Mr. Starck, who on occasion enjoys taking the high ground.
He said it had taken him about two years to come up with the idea that would justify putting yet another toilet brush on the market (at least a couple of dozen already exist). And, he said, it would take a special one to appeal to Americans who are "obsessed by cleanliness." The result: a sleek, totemic two-part plastic design that has a sword's handle and ends in a round tufted brush that fits neatly into its scabbard.
"It's an object that protects the hand, like the guard on a sword, but that also retains a certain elegance," Mr. Starck said.
Like many of his other designs, his toilet brush has a memorable name: Excalibur -- after King Arthur's sword, of course. And it will come in a panoply of pastel shades -- pale yellow, pink, green and gray -- but not basic bathroom white, because, Mr. Starck said, that would make it invisible. "It's an object that must be present but remain discreet," he said.
Excalibur has already made an appearance in France in the hefty 3 Suisses spring-summer 1995 mail-order catalogue, alongside Mr. Starck's small Miss Sissi table lamp and his Oye Oye portable radio and Ray Hollis ashtray.
In turning his talents on the toilet brush and holder, Mr. Starck is in the tradition of architects' and designers' rethinking ordinary objects. Remember Michael Graves's 1985 tea kettle? Or Morison Cousins's newfangled Tupperware? Or even last year's star toilet brush? That one was designed for Alessi by Stefano Giovannoni, a designer in Florence. Metropolis, a design magazine, called the zany plastic cactus-in-a-pot "a toilet brush with greatness."
Jack Markuse, Alessi's American importer, said people don't usually show off their toilet brushes. "But this one is not content to remain in that corner," he said.
Maybe that's because most people don't know what it is. "If you had a glass wall in your bathroom, I'm guessing that you would see people lifting the brush out and looking at it, the same way they sneak a look into the medicine cabinet," Mr. Markuse said.
While Alessi has sold over 100,000 of the toilet brushes worldwide since it was introduced in 1993, only 5,000 have made it into bathrooms in the United States.
While Mr. Starck was putting the finishing touches on his new design, Mr. Heller, 54, was developing the new technology necessary to produce it at a low enough price. Mr. Heller said he spent more than $100,000 developing special molds.
Mr. Heller, who has also produced plastic dinnerware by Massimo and Lella Vignelli, saw the brush as a way of "going back to my roots when I started manufacturing plastic dinnerware in Italy 20 years ago."
The Starck brush, which will make its debut at the Frankfurt Fair this weekend, is to retail for under $30 when it is available in the United States, at the end of April -- the list of stores has yet to be fixed. "I see it as a sort of Swatch of home furnishings," Mr. Heller said.
But unlike the Swatch, which was suddenly everywhere, Excalibur might prove to be a hard sell in the United States. In Europe, a brush is standard equipment next to every toilet, but in the United States, it is less likely to be on view unless it is a decorative accessory.
But not for lack of choice. From supermarkets to the MOMA Design Store, there are plenty to choose from, including ones that fit into holders shaped like dogs and cats. Gracious Home, the Upper East Side housewares store, carries about 10 different styles, including one trimmed in gold and another of bone china. Philip Choo, the visual merchandise director, says the store sells about 200 toilet brushes a month.
At Ikea, the home furnishings supermarket chain, toilet brushes are considered a major impulse purchase and are displayed accordingly: next to the cash registers.
But at ABC Carpet and Home, where you can find almost anything else you can think of, there is nary a brush in sight. "We actively don't sell them," said Loren Pack, a company spokeswoman, "even though people are always telling us we could make so much money with them."
Designer or no designer, some things may be just too humdrum to display.

A Week Without TV

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
WHAT would Americans do without television?
TV-Free America, a newly established national organization, wants Americans to switch off their sets for a week and find out for themselves. 
 The organization, which seeks to raise awareness about the harmful effects of excessive viewing on productivity and literacy, for example, and encourages Americans to watch less television, is sponsoring National TV-Turnoff Week, April 24 to 30.
And what does it suggest people do without Oprah, the Power Rangers and the N.B.A. games of the week?
"We're recommending 40 suggested substitute activities," said Henry Labalme, the codirector of the Washington organization, which is financed through grants and private donations. They include "contemplating, interacting with family, playing sports, taking part in community affairs and volunteering."
"Americans collectively watch 120 billion hours of television a year. This is an enormous productivity sink," added Mr. Labalme, 33, who is single and doesn't own a television set.
On the average, according to the A. C. Nielsen Company, preschoolers watch 30 hours of television a week. Experts in child development and behavior suggest that more than 10 hours a week canhave a detrimental effect on children's attention spans, language and communications skills and creative abilities.
Television turnoffs have been held in individual towns and counties around the country since the early 1980's. The most successful was a monthlong turnoff held in Farmington, Conn., in January 1984, when a quarter of the residents either didn't watch or watched less. Follow-up surveys indicate that most participants reduced their viewing or became more critical of what they watched.
TV-Free America's effort marks the first time the entire nation has been asked to pull the plug. The crusade has been endorsed by groups like the American Federation of Teachers, the American Medical Association, Literacy Volunteers of America, the National Parenting Association and The Weekly Reader magazine, whose Feb. 17 cover story promotes the idea. Thousands of schools, libraries, churches and community organizations will also join in an effort to encourage families and individuals to turn off their sets.
Broadcasters and, for the most part, major advertisers have turned away from the turnoff which, if successful, could become a ratings nightmare.
Winston H. Cox, the chairman and chief executive of the Showtime Cable network, was ambivalent. "I'm in favor of the broad objective here, that being children watch too much television and parents need to take a role in controlling that," Mr. Cox said. "But there is a lot of good TV out there. We tend to demean television in our country. But it is also an incredibly powerful and important information medium."
Mr. Labalme agreed. "Good programs do exist," he said recently. But, he added, "it's just that all TV watching is passive, sedentary and nonexperiential and, as Americans, we watch so much of it."
The success of the campaign may be directly tied to social, economic and age factors, its organizers said. Many single-head households, low-income families, families with young children and the elderly rely on television for entertainment, solace and companionship. Turning it off may be easier said than done.
Six months ago, for example, Andy and Marjan Shallal of Fairfax, Va., were concerned that their daughter, Laela, 6, was watching too much television. They decided to put their set in a closet for two weeks.
"Initially, she thought it was fun," recalled Mr. Shallal, a bookstore owner who, with his wife and daughter, is coordinating the local turnoff effort. "By that afternoon, she was asking us to get the TV out of the closet."
On the second day, he said, she became more aggressive, accusing her parents of child abuse. "For two weeks," he said, "there was hell to pay."
But by the third week, Laela was reading more, doing artwork and playing with her sister, Nina, 2. The television is still in the closet.
"I miss it, maybe a little bit," said Laela, in a phone interview. "But I think it's good to turn off the TV for a while. It makes your brain small."
"I think parents are in denial about the effects of TV," said Benjamin Lev, a kindergarten teacher at Roseland Elementary School in Santa Rosa, Calif., and an organizer of this year's Sonoma County TV Turnoff, which will coincide with the national turnoff. "Studies have found that parents routinely underestimate the amount of TV their children watch by 50 percent."
Steve Bennett, the coauthor with his wife, Ruth, of "365 TV-Free Activities You Can Do With Your Child (Bob Adams Inc., 1991), attributes people's hesitation to go without television to a kind of fear of the unfamiliar.
"Over the last 30 years, we've forgotten how to play," said Mr. Bennett, who wrote the book after seeing the number of hours his son, Noah, who was then 2, spent watching television. "It's a sad statement when I hear people say, 'What will we do without TV?' We are raising kids with an imagination impairment."
Mitch Greenwood, the principal at Flynn Park Elementary School in University City, Mo., said viewing was also creating problems in the classroom.
"We're seeing all the karate kicks from kids mimicking the Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers," he said. "They expect teachers to do all the wonderful exciting things they see on television."
TV-Free America, which hopes to make the national turnoffs annual, acknowledges that a one-week blackout is unlikely to result in major shifts in viewing.
"Some will go back to watching as much as before, but a lot won't," Mr. Labalme predicted. "We've found that individuals and families who participated ended up looking at TV in a different way."

HEADLINE: ROWLAND'S SPENDING PLAN: TAXES;
Keeping Vow, in Deed Not Magnitude

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 15

 BODY:
In the modest tax cut proposals announced during his budget presentation to the General Assembly today, Gov. John G. Rowland fell short of the dramatic oratory of his gubernatorial campaign. A big reason the cuts didn't approach the revolutionary levels some residents were expecting is Connecticut's economy, which has still not come back to life.
Politically, Mr. Rowland is already compared regularly with other Republican governors in the Northeast, from Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey to George E. Pataki in New York to William F. Weld in Massachusetts, all of whom have promised or succeeded in pushing through cuts in taxes and spending. 
 But those states either felt less pain in the recession, or have rebounded more quickly than Connecticut, making it easier for governors to follow through with more dramatic budget cuts. Slower growth means that tax collections here are going up slowly, if at all, making tax cuts harder to pay for and spending cuts more painful.
"Connecticut never had the benefit of getting its recovery off the ground," said Don Klepper-Smith, the corporate economist at Southern New England Telecommunications. "If we need anything it's a recovery with legs."
The numbers tell much of the story. New Jersey, for example, has regained 51.5 percent of the jobs it lost in the recession as of December, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Massachusetts has regained 41.6. Even New York, which was hit as hard in the recession as any place, has recovered 21.8 percent of its lost jobs.
Connecticut, by contrast, after two years of paltry recovery, has brought back only 7.1 percent of the 156,000 jobs that were lost from 1989 to 1992.
The weakness is also evident when Connecticut is compared with the nation as a whole. In 1994, the United States economy grew at a rate of about 4 percent, sparking fears of inflation and a raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. In Connecticut, growth did not exceed 1 percent, which means the state was hit with the full braking effect of higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve without having first enjoyed any acceleration.
And even before the income-tax cuts promised in Mr. Rowland's budget, state budget officials were warning that collections were coming in below the amounts projected last year. Economists, while expecting some modest growth and job creation in 1995, also say there will probably be continued erosion in two of the state's economic pillars -- insurance and military contracting, which led the downturn in the first place.
All of that leads to two major implications.
Since tax collections and economic growth are so weak, Mr. Rowland was under greater pressure than his Republican gubernatorial colleagues to pay for his tax cuts with equivalent spending cuts. And economists say that in a weak economy, if spending cuts do in fact cancel out tax cuts, the bounce from putting more money in consumer's pockets is just about nil.
There may be an element of inherent cautiousness on Mr. Rowland's part as well. His state's budget is essentially on sound footing, with no large budget gap expected this year, even with a weak economy. Mr. Pataki's first budget in New York, by contrast, is an exercise in finding the fiscally possible in a budget full of holes.
"One of the challenges with a slow recovery in Connecticut is that you have to lean all the harder on the spending cuts," said Nicholas S. Perna, the chief economist at Shawmut National Corporation, a bank based in Hartford. On the other hand, he added, "Economics 101 teaches that if you cut taxes and offset that by cutting spending, you don't get any immediate bang for the buck -- it's in one pocket and out the other."
Mr. Rowland's proposals also represent more of a continuation, than a sharp break, with the pattern of tax legislation established by former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
Mr. Weicker, who authored and pushed through an income tax in his first year in office in 1991, justified the move by saying it would pay for cuts in corporate taxes that would, in turn, stimulate the economy and create jobs.
Today, Mr. Rowland, who has promised to eliminate the income tax over five years, kept his promise to begin whittling away at Mr. Weicker's tax, while cautioning that business taxes and costs were just as much of a priority.
His budget would reduce resident's tax payments by a maximum of $157 in the first year, or about $3 a week, for a family filing jointly and earning more than $94,000 a year. People earning less would get a smaller tax break, though, it would be a larger reduction in percentage terms.
The largest promised tax cuts in the budget would come for business, though they are mostly still in the future. Mr. Rowland said he wanted to accelerate a corporate-tax reduction plan passed under Mr. Weicker, speeding up by a full percentage point a year the rate at which the corporate tax rate would fall.
The tax would decline from the current 10.5 percent rate to 8 percent by 1999. He also proposed cutting the tax on hospitals' gross receipts from 11 percent to 8 percent by 1999.
Mr. Perna, the Shawmut economist, said the great achievement of the Rowland budget may be in cutting where pragmatism allows.
"You can't give away what you don't have," he said.

Need Options to Cuts? Find Real Labor Savings

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
IF you don't like my budget ideas, let me hear yours, says Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
O.K., here's one: Solve the case of the disappearing labor savings. If he did, maybe Mr. Giuliani wouldn't have to cut so much from health and welfare programs for the poor, slated to account for more than 40 percent of his budget reductions. 
 The Mayor talks tough about the unions and his Labor Commissioner, Randy Levine, wrested real concessions from the sanitation and custodians' unions. But now, the Mayor is asking for only $600 million in labor savings, which gradually shrivels from $600 million to $200 million in three years.
The Mayor, who's already reduced the work force by about 14,000, says there's more attrition to come. But shrinking the work force may not save money in the long run, given New York's propensity for rehiring the minute the economy smiles. And sometimes when it doesn't. A graph charting the size of the city work force since 1975 looks like a bad electrocardiogram.
In fact, only "recurring" productivity savings, like reducing the number of firefighters on a truck, can have a lasting impact. Cutting the city's contribution to union pension funds -- said to be under consideration at City Hall -- would indeed save money. But that kind of saving can't help for long.
IF he is as committed to reforming government as he claims, the Mayor could come up with significantly more than $600 million in real, recurring savings. The possibilities are no mystery. The Citizens Budget Commission, the business-supported nonprofit group, submitted ideas to the administration just two months ago at the budget director's request. Maybe this time will be different, suggests Raymond D. Horton, the group's ever-optimistic president. "You have a fiscal crisis, a determined Mayor, a resourceful labor relations director, and a divided set of Civil Service unions," he said.
The Budget Commission's ideas will be duly considered, said a noncommittal Mr. Levine. Here are some of the Commission's proposals, along with suggestions others have made:
End release time.
The city pays about 200 employees full city salaries to work for their unions full time. It's a tradition that goes back to the 1950's, when the new unions were trying to establish themselves. They have.
Increase the workweek of civilian workers.
Now most work 35 hours a week. If they worked 37 1/2 hours, as state workers do, or 40-hour weeks, as Federal employees do, the city could reduce overtime and night differential pay.
Reduce the time police officers spend on administrative duties.
If officers assigned to enforcement jobs spent 11 instead of 21 days on administrative and clerical duties, the department could, the Budget Commission contends, add the equivalent of 1,400 full-time officers to street patrol.
This only saves money if the city reduces police hiring. It would have to renegotiate the agreement with the State Legislature requiring that the city have 38,310 officers in its three police forces. Mr. Giuliani opposes a renegotiation.
Reduce paid sabbaticals for teachers.
It costs the city about $20 million a year to pay for teacher sabbaticals. After seven years, teachers can get 60 percent of their full salaries while on sabbatical, and 70 percent after 14 years.
Eliminate double time and Fresh Kills pay in the Sanitation Department.
Workers get double pay for garbage collections on Sundays, and for hauling refuse to the Fresh Kills landfill.
Restructure health insurance.
City workers do not contribute to their health care. Adding a co-payment of $300 a person or $550 for a family could save $200 million a year for the city, which proposed this last year.
Eliminate built-in overtime for firefighters and vary firehouse staffing.
Each firefighter is guaranteed 96 hours of overtime a year because of an arbitration decision. The city could renegotiate that, and could also save money by having neighborhood firehouses share equipment during slow periods.
Revamp police and fire pensions.
Police officers and firefighters can get tax-free disability pensions if they say they injured themselves on the job, even if the injury was slight and they continue to work. Those with heart ailments can get disability pensions on the presumption that the condition is work-related. The Legislature would have to revise these laws.
Those are just a few proposals, and there are others. Saving $1 billion in labor costs would not, in an ideal world, be that difficult. But it is. Most of these ideas are yellow with age, too impolitic to succeed. Then again, Mr. Giuliani, agile enough to endorse the liberal Mario M. Cuomo in the fall, and embrace the conservative ideology of the new Republican Governor come winter, seems to excel at being impolitic.

HEADLINE: When Government Goes on Autopilot

BYLINE: By Peter Schrag; Peter Schrag is editorial page editor of The Sacramento Bee.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Americans have looked longingly at California for all sorts of reasons: for the climate, for the natural beauty, even, at one time, for our unmatched system of higher education. But as far as can be determined, of late no American has lusted for our contorted government structure, our declining public services or our penchant for fiscal gridlock. So why is the new Congress rushing so resolutely to copy the mess California has created for itself?
At the core of California's mess is a constitutional provision (one of two in the nation, and unique among the major states) that requires a two-thirds majority in each house of the Legislature to approve the state budget, any appropriation and any tax increase. 
 The balanced budget amendment steaming through Congress would require only a three-fifths supermajority for Congress to pass an unbalanced budget, but its effects would surely be similar.
If the states ratified the amendment, Congress could approve balanced budgets by majority vote, but since no one has proposed a politically acceptable way that can be done, the operative provision is the three-fifths majority, which, as in California, would give the most determined (and often most irresponsible) political minority in each house the power to hold the budget hostage to extract concessions from the majority.
In California, the supermajority requirement has often made it harder, not easier, to eliminate dubious spending practices. In 11 of the last 16 years, California has spent more than it has taken in. During the past several years of recession, the Legislature and Governor, unable to muster the necessary two-thirds vote for stringent budget medicine, have repeatedly resorted to fiscal gimmicks and outside borrowing. As a result, the state's credit rating plunged from AAA in the late 1980's to A, one of the lowest in the nation.
 And sometimes it brings government to a halt. In two of the past five years, the Legislature ran a month or more into the new fiscal year before it managed to get a budget approved. In 1992, the delay forced the state to issue i.o.u.'s to government employees and contractors.
One would expect such delays to generate a certain amount of public consternation, but since supermajority requirements make it hard to determine which party or group of politicians is ultimately responsible, the voters have no way to know which rascals to throw out. Which, of course, is one reason why they always want to throw out all of them.
But that's only one of California's cautionary tales. The larger one comes from our passion for constitutional quick fixes and our efforts to run government on autopilot.
And while even the new Republican Congress couldn't go as far as we have, its flirtation with term limits and its seeming determination to put entitlements like Social Security permanently beyond the budget process -- and to put other limits on the choices of the voters and the budgetary discretion of their representatives -- point it very much in California's misguided direction.
Part of California's story ought to be familiar. Since 1978, California has been engaged in an orgy of constitutional reform: each time the system fails, appears to enter gridlock or generates voter frustration, we pass another initiative.
Consider these: the Proposition 13 property tax limitation measure in 1978, itself in part the result of the Legislature's failure to muster a supermajority in the mid-70's for much-needed property tax reform; a prohibition on unfunded mandates (largely ignored in practice) in 1979; spending limits for state and local government also in 1979; a measure requiring the state to spend at least 40 percent of its general-fund budget on schools in 1988; term limits and limits on legislative spending and staffs in 1990, plus scores of secondary modifications and reforms.
All that reforming has produced a Rube Goldberg machine of truly baroque proportions in which fiscal authority is divided so uncertainly between state and local governments and among scores of agencies that it's beyond even the most devoted citizen to understand.
And as reform is piled on reform and major programs are put beyond budgetary discretion, it becomes increasingly hard for state and local officials to set priorities and deal with the issues that they were presumably elected to address.
This in turn has led to scores of dubious fiscal expedients -- escalating permit fees, special-assessment districts and other devices, many of them leading to further distortions of priorities -- to get around local and state tax and spending limits. In some ways, even Orange County's bankruptcy resulted indirectly from the shortage of reasonable fiscal options.
A constitutional revision commission is now trying to figure out how to disentangle the mess into which California has voted itself.
How does all this bear on what Congress is doing? Congress, after all, is proposing to restore authority to the states, not centralize it, as many of California's reforms have inadvertently done. But Congress's autopilot solutions are just as mechanistic as those we've pursued, and just as inimical to legislative discretion and accountability.
The great irony of Proposition 13 and its successors in California is that initiatives that were first hailed as great victories of citizen action in recapturing control of government have inadvertently moved authority from local to state government and produced further alienation and frustration.
In 1990, for example, California became the first major state to enact legislative term limits -- three two-year terms for members of the Assembly and two four-year terms for the Senate. This year, term limits began kicking in, leading to a new class of inexperienced Republican Assembly members. The initial result was six weeks of gridlock in a narrowly divided Assembly whose control the Republicans had thought they had won. Now that that issue is temporarily resolved with the Democratic legislative coup that led to the re-election of Willie Brown as Speaker, the Assembly faces the prospect of what appears to be a long round of recalls, special elections and indefinite instability.
Perhaps none of those outcomes is inherent in term limits. No one could have foreseen the narrow margin between Democrats and Republicans in the Assembly. But it was easy to foresee that the members of a Legislature limited to three terms -- a sort of glorified bus station waiting room, where one-third of the members are always just arriving and one-third are always packing to leave -- would be chronically short on experience and even shorter on loyalty to the institution. This winter, it was the experienced Democrats who picked clean the Republican rubes just off the bus. Although all those slickers will soon be gone, a house of bumblers is hardly a cheering prospect. Beware the law of unintended consequences. California has a Constitution full of them.

HEADLINE: Gulf Nations Balk at Proposal for Mideast Development Bank

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A proposal championed by the Clinton Administration and Israel to create a regional Middle East Development Bank appears to have been dealt a major blow by Arab countries, with officials saying they will neither finance such a bank nor take part in it.
The unusually forceful position from the diplomatically timid Persian Gulf countries appears to be part of an Arab retreat from further normalization with Israel. 
 The bank proposal was a key part of the American approach to the Middle East peace effort, intended to integrate Israel into regional Arab economies through joint developmental projects.
The idea was resisted for months by several Arab countries that had been expected to be donors to the bank, mostly the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is led by Saudi Arabia and whose members are Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
It was supported by others, mostly Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization, along with Israel, all of which expected the bank to be a source of additional financing for their economies.
Now, officials and columnists in the gulf countries are going further in their resistance, arguing in statements and editorial commentary that wider economic cooperation with Israel will have to wait until full peace has been established.
In a weekend news conference timed to coincide with a visit by the American Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, to the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad bin Humayd al-Tayir, the United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Financial and Industrial Affairs, said, "The Arab world is not in need of an institution or a development bank in which Israel participates."
Mr. Tayir added, "Before talking or thinking of establishing a common Middle East market, some balance in security and economic interests between the Arabs and Israel must be established, and the Arab world's interests must be assured in political, social and economic areas against plans to dominate us and impose facts upon us."
On Monday, a Saudi official who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in a telephone interview, "Our position has been stated repeatedly in the meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is that any talk of regional cooperation with Israel is premature until Israeli troops leave Arab lands in the West Bank, Gaza, Syria and Lebanon."
Writing in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat on Monday, Abdelrahman al-Rashid, an influential Saudi political columnist, argued that Arab gulf countries feel the bank project "is another financial tax imposed upon them which they cannot accept, and even if they accepted it, they will not be able to fulfill it because of their difficult financial circumstances."
Similar objections were raised during a major Middle East economic conference in October in Casablanca, Morocco, where the idea of the bank first surfaced, along with other projects for regional economic cooperation that would involve Arab countries, Israel and Turkey.
The development reflects palpable cooling of an earlier enthusiasm after Israel signed peace treaties with the P.L.O. and Jordan last year. Then several Arab gulf countries, including Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, lifted an economic boycott against companies doing business with Israel and allowed officials to meet with their Israeli counterparts in several Arab and world capitals.
But on Saturday, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani, the Foreign Minister of Qatar, which was one of the first gulf countries to hold public talks with Israel on economic and political cooperation, told Qatar television that his country would not "rush to establish ties to Israel." He denied there were plans to export natural gas to Israel.
Israeli officials had said several months ago that they were in the final stages of negotiating a deal to import natural gas from Qatar.
The Qatari Foreign Minister also denied in an interview that there were plans to open representational offices in Israel. "Such a step can only be taken at the appropriate time," he said.
After the Morocco meeting, the United States said it was scaling down the project, which was first proposed with a initial capital of $10 billion. But Washington insisted that the idea continued to enjoy support among several Arab countries, including those in the Gulf region, and that it would be pursued.

HEADLINE: Razors, Soap, Cornflakes: Pirating Spreads in China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Inside a bare, dimly lit concrete building on the outskirts of town, five workers at the Huaxing Razor Blade Factory sit hunched over noisy machines that spit ordinary razor blades into a row of blue kerosene cans.
Upstairs, lounging in an oversized black leather chair, Yin Jiande, the factory manager, snorts at accusations by the Gillette Company that he had made more than 50 million counterfeit copies of razor blades produced by Gillette's joint venture here and sold them in look-alike packaging. 
 "If they say we can't do it anymore, O.K., we won't do it anymore," said Mr. Yin, who promised to stop last year when he was caught copying Gillette's packaging, only to continue copying it until he was caught a second time and finally stopped.
"No one told us about this law," he said, alluding to a 1993 rule that bans the copying of a competitor's wares or packaging.
Factory managers like Mr. Yin are at the core of a fight that has pushed the United States and China to the brink of a trade war over intellectual property rights, including copyrights and trademarks. A final round of talks began Wednesday in Beijing.
Both countries have mixed heated accusations with stern promises to stand tough, and it is unclear if either will soften in time to reach a last-minute accord before Feb. 26, when trade sanctions threatened by both countries are set to begin.
Yet whether or not peace is made in Beijing, the struggle over piracy is unlikely to stop anytime soon in factories in the back alleys of Shanghai, and in hundreds of small towns in southern China, where counterfeit versions of everything from Lux soap to Kellogg's cornflakes to Shell Oil lubricants are being churned out.
American trade negotiators like to cite pirated compact disks and computer software as the kind of items that could easily be controlled. But the counterfeiting of ordinary consumer goods has become so widespread that restraining it appears to be far beyond Beijing's grasp.
Counterfeiting in China ballooned in the last two years as factory managers like Mr. Yin operated in an environment of speedy economic growth coupled with a weak legal system, seeing quick profits and little risk of punishment. The infringement of trademarks -- the symbols and design that identify a product -- now involves billions of dollars worth of goods produced in China, trademark lawyers estimate.
Counterfeit goods in a developing country are nothing new, and items like fake Rolex watches and Gucci bags are sold on the streets of New York City. But the recent growth of consumer piracy in China has been so fast and the volume so large that Western businessmen say they are alarmed by how big a bite is being taken out of their bottom line.
After Gillette discovered that Huaxing Razor was pirating the packaging and perhaps the contents of Gillette's Flying Eagle brand razor, it presented evidence to the local authorities, who raided the premises. But the action led only to broken promises from the factory and to legal action so minimal that it virtually invited more counterfeiting.
At the Huaxing factory, a modest operation with 100 workers who are paid $50 to $90 a month, Mr. Yin expresses nonchalance about his dispute with Gillette, apparently out of confidence that local officials will continue to go easy on him.
"I'm friends with most leaders in the district government," said Mr. Yin, a boyish-looking man of 40 who wears a black leather coat with a fur collar. Although he said he was paid a salary of less than $200 a month, the sleek black Audi and the Mitsubishi pickup truck parked outside his office suggested a broader income.
"The cars belong to the factory," he said.
Although Huaxing did stop counterfeiting after a second raid and fine, it left Gillette without a penny of compensation from lost sales estimated at more than $1 million. As in other parts of China, the economic police in Shanghai may often have little incentive to penalize factories that generate local tax revenue and are run by acquaintances.
Xing Dongsheng, a deputy section chief at the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce, which is responsible for enforcing trademark violations, insisted that the Gillette case was an example of good government work because fines were collected, twice, and handed over to the central Government. He denied that any favoritism had been shown to Mr. Yin.
"The key question is whether the local government is enforcing the law," said Mr. Xing, dressed in the blue military-style uniform that investigators wear when they check on stores in Shanghai. "Our Government is determined to take action, and last year we held one conference after another to discuss the problem."
When not attending meetings, or conducting spot-checks, Mr. Xing said he relied on companies like Gillette to bring claims forward and to present hard evidence.
"You can't say that just because something is selling cheaply that it is counterfeit, he said. "You need evidence. The United States should not ask us to prosecute every case. No one can prosecute every case."
Tony Au Yeung, general manager of Gillette (Shanghai) Ltd., the joint venture, estimates that counterfeiters now sell Gillette look-alikes worth more than $10 million, or roughly one-third of the annual sales at his Shanghai operation. Du Pont, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, S. C. Johnson and McDonald's are among the dozens of other companies that are fighting trademark infringements.
In downtown Shanghai, a mere hundred yards from a McDonald's outlet on Huai Hai Road, another fast-food restaurant uses a sign with golden arches on a red background in a way that looks like a McDonald's "M" but with a leg partly missing, making it an "N," for Nancy's Expres. A lawyer for McDonald's said legal action was being considered.
Legal action in China is rarely easy, but trademark cases are now being handled regularly in courts and by administrative means. Under pressure from American negotiators, China agreed in 1992 to expand its legal framework for intellectual property rights and has set up special courts and assigned more investigators, especially in large cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou.
"I think the central Government recognizes that this is really a problem," Mr. Au Yeung said of Gillette. "But because the local authorities are so unwilling, it is difficult to do anything about it."
Gillette opened its joint venture with the Shanghai Razor Blade Factory in 1992, and produces both the Chinese Flying Eagle brand as well as Gillette's Atra and Sensor brands. Gillette owns 70 percent and has management control.
In late 1993, Mr. Au Yeung learned from his Chinese business partner that the Huaxing factory was making an imitation of the Flying Eagle single-edged razor and selling it for 1.3 cents each, or 20 percent less than the joint venture's price. He persuaded local investigators to raid the factory in January 1994.
Mr. Yin, the factory manager, insisted that his razors, sold under the brand name Sea Gull, were different from Gillette's. But he acknowledged that packaging he began using more than a year ago was the same color and design as the joint venture, down to the white bird with wings spread wide.
"It was a coincidence," Mr. Yin said.
The district authorities decided that the packaging, but not the razors, violated Gillette's trademark, though Mr. Au Yeung said he thought the razors were copied, too.
Five months later, after the authorities fined Huaxing $3,500, an amount that Mr. Au Yeung considers paltry, he learned that the factory was still using the same packaging. But the district authorities would not do anything about it, saying they had already done their job.
Undeterred, Mr. Au Yeung went up a rung in the city bureaucracy, appealing to the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce. Their investigators led a second raid, in August 1994, which led to a second fine, $3,300, in December.
Asked why he kept using the same packages after the first raid, Mr. Yin, the factory manager, said he did not want to throw away packaging that had already been printed. "We didn't want to waste it," he said.
In the eight months before Huaxing was stopped, Mr. Au Yeung estimates, the factory sold more than $1 million worth of imitations, most of it in exports to Southeast Asia. "That's revenue that we should have gotten," he said.
Mr. Au Yeung said he thought the fines on Huaxing were so small they could simply be considered the cost of doing business, even in a factory like Huaxing, where Mr. Yin said annual profit was $120,000 in 1994, before taxes.
Mr. Xing of the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce said there was a formula for fines: a maximum of 50 percent of the value of the counterfeit goods, or five times the profits derived from them.
But he conceded that the total fines of $6,800 in the Gillette case were less than 1 percent of the $1 million worth of pirated goods. The Government has to consider other factors, Mr. Xing said, such as putting people out of work.
"If a factory only makes $100,000 a year, we can't fine them $1 million," Mr. Xing reasoned. "One million dollars -- that is a very small amount for a big American company, but to a small Chinese factory, it could put them into bankruptcy."
Joseph T. Simone, a lawyer at Johnson Stokes & Master in Hong Kong, who has represented several American companies in trademark disputes in China, argued that the situation would not improve until stiffer penalties were enforced.
"If nobody's going to jail and fines are negligible, you're not going to get in front of the problem," Mr. Simone said. "And you just invite more piracy."
Although a factory like Huaxing stopped counterfeiting after it was caught red-handed twice, Mr. Simone said its example showed other factory managers that they could counterfeit other products with impunity and the worst that would happen was a minimal fine.
"In most countries, if you have 10 pirates, you can go after one, expect seven to stop, and then figure out how to get the remaining two," Mr. Simone said. "But in China, when you go after one, the other nine see exactly what you're doing. Not only do they keep pirating, but you invite 10 more to join in."

HEADLINE: For Law Firms, the Shakeout in the Business World Has Finally Hit

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
It has finally happened: Law firms are going through the same wrenching changes that their corporate clients have endured. Big firms are getting bigger, small firms are finding niches, medium-sized firms are feeling squeezed.
And the legal world is reacting to the recent demise of Shea & Gould, a blue-chip law firm if ever there was one, with the same shocked horror that corporate America felt when it saw the seemingly invincible International Business Machines Corporation run into financial and marketing troubles. 
 "The crashing of Shea & Gould has sensitized all law firms to the importance of managing, planning, monitoring partners, acting like a business," said Joel A. Rose, a Cherry Hill, N.J., management consultant and chairman of the Large Law Firm Committee of the American Bar Association's Law Practice Management Section.
The shakeout has already begun. Shea & Gould, which at its peak seemed the epitome of legal prestige and opulence, was not the only firm to dissolve amid partner acrimony. Other firms, including the New York-based Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith and Bower & Gardner, also expanded too quickly or changed too slowly, and imploded. Other firms then picked their carcasses. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, for one, picked up nearly 60 Lord, Day lawyers and now has more than 750 lawyers.
Legal experts predict more of the same as the larger firms rethink collegial structures that worked when 25 lawyers were scrunched together but that cannot accommodate hundreds of lawyers dispersed around the world.
"Big general-practice firms will merge with big Wall Street firms, and we'll all go the way of the accounting firms," said Eugene Anderson, one of the founders of Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, P.C., a 240-lawyer firm based in New York. "We'll have a Big 6 or Big 8, with offices in every major city, handling huge cases for huge clients. And we'll have 100,000 tiny firms, offering personal service to tiny clients and handling the bulk of the tort cases."
This will mean lots of obstacles for lawyers with ambitions to become partners. It will be harder for individuals to stand out in the huge merged firms. And small firms rarely have the same partnership opportunities.
But more is changing than just firm size:
* Morgan, Lewis, once firmly ensconced in Philadelphia, has distributed partners and associates fairly equally among its Philadelphia, New York and Washington offices. "This structure gives us a better chance of hanging on to the star performers in the regional offices," said the firm's Washington-based chairman, John Quarles.
* Anderson, Kill, where each lawyer is a partner, is rethinking its one-man, one-vote structure. "We will continue to give all our lawyers access to financial information, but it doesn't work for everyone to vote on every issue now that we're big," Mr. Anderson said.
* Bickel & Brewer, the Dallas-based law firm, has abandoned the billable hour. It now charges clients a flat fee based on what their cases are expected to yield, and a percentage of any money above that amount. "The billable hour puts incentives in the wrong place," William A. Brewer 3d, a co-founder, said.
The changes are being driven as much by outside forces as by introspection. The costs of doing business -- like office rents, salaries, and computer hardware and software -- have skyrocketed. And the fabric of relationships between lawyers and clients, and among lawyers themselves, is unraveling.
Clients no longer believe in one-stop shopping, but are parceling out their business to numerous firms. Well-known firms are being forced to participate in what lawyers call beauty contests -- sessions in which several firms vie for a client's business. But even getting invited to compete is hard these days.
Omer S. J. Williams, managing partner of the New York firm Thacher Proffitt & Wood, said, "We now have a full-time marketing person whose job is to get us on panels, to arrange seminars, to basically get our name known."
Divorces between young lawyers and old firms are becoming common. Sometimes lawyers leave for better pay; often, they are forced out. Robert W. Gordon, a professor at Stanford Law School, said that 20 years ago a talented associate had a 50-50 chance to make partner. By 10 years ago, that was down to 10 percent. Today, he said, only 1 in 15 or 20 will get the brass ring.
"Partners are expensive, and there isn't enough work to promote everybody," Mr. Gordon said.
Associates who do make it to partner hold their seniors in little awe. Mr. Rose tells of one law firm that has been forced to rethink its longstanding policy of providing retiring partners with one-and-a-half times their average earnings in the prior four years, as well as their capital interests in the firm.
"The younger and midlevel partners insisted that this drain on their own revenues end," Mr. Rose said.
Few firms are ignoring the upheaval around them. Instead, they are looking for ways to appease associates without hurting senior partners, to control growth rather than be controlled by it. Many no longer pay partners strictly on seniority, but have incentive systems that reward the partners who bring in the most business.
The big firms are also bowing to the era of specialization. Morgan, Lewis, for one, is reorganizing its litigation section into a group of practice specialists. "Clients no longer believe that any good trial lawyer can try any case," Mr. Quarles said.
Already, some specialties have turned into hot areas. For example, several firms are adding practices in environmental law and white-collar crime. And if they do not have the expertise on staff, they hire it in. The New York firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson has home-grown its new environmental-law specialty. But it hired its white-collar crime specialists from Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon.
Other law firms are looking for ways to specialize without adding lawyers to their permanent staffs. Increasingly, they are subcontracting parts of a big case to smaller specialty firms or bringing in lawyers from legal temporary agencies to handle bursts of business.
Even tiny firms are slowly embracing that concept. When David M. Perlmutter formed his own New York firm three years ago, he quickly realized he needed a bigger library and more legal expertise than he and his two partners could realistically afford. So he arranged with Rogers & Wells, a larger firm in his office building, to use its library and some of its lawyers on an as-needed basis. He shares legal fees accordingly.
Mr. Perlmutter says it is a classic win-win situation. "I can take on more complex cases," he said. "And Rogers & Wells gets access to my clients, with personnel they can spare at that time."
Computers may yet prove the leveling force among different-sized firms. But so far, they have been a mixed blessing for the profession.
On the plus side, technology has enabled law firms to generate standardized documents and build easily accessible electronic libraries of their own cases and public-domain precedents. It even lets them take advantage of cheap labor: Bickel & Brewer, for example, often hires lawyers in India, where fees are a fraction of those here, to enter documents into its data base.
But the technology itself does not come cheap. "Putting a P.C. on everyone's desk, tying it into an enormous client-service network, these are huge costs," said David W. Maher, a partner in the Chicago firm Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, and chairman of the Extra Large Law Firm Committee of the American Bar Association's Law Practice Management Section.
Lawyers generally must eat those costs. When a manufacturer automates, it can usually keep most of the savings for itself. When lawyers gain efficiency through technology, clients insist that they pass the savings on in the form of fewer billable hours. So, in a sense, computerization has reduced, not enhanced, law firm income.
At the same time, firm revenues have been increasingly squeezed. Many corporate clients have general counsels who themselves once worked for law firms and can easily recognize where fat is built into fees.
"Clients are definitely asking for more itemized bills," said Arthur Fleischer Jr., chairman of Fried, Frank.
Indeed, many clients are insisting that outside firms dispense with the open-ended billable-hour system altogether and stay within a given budget for a case. Firms are struggling for ways to respond.
"Clients say they hate hourly billing, but even they can't think of a good alternative," said Mr. Anderson of Anderson, Kill.
But all the Sturm und Drang, draining as it may be, has yielded some trends to gladden legal hearts.
A young lawyer's life may soon become more livable. Much of the drudge work has devolved to computers. Some firms, hoping to keep costs down and talent rosters up, are allowing some partners to take reduced earnings in exchange for reduced workloads. And communications technology can cut down on obligatory travel. "We can now have lawyers in three cities working on a document with as much efficiency as if they were sitting together," said Mr. Quarles of Morgan, Lewis.
Still, some of the more endearing of the old ways may yet resurface.
"Awarding jobs to the most specialized or lowest-bidding firm, one that doesn't know your company, isn't always a great idea," Professor Gordon said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the bigger corporations try to re-establish long-term relationships with legal advisers."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls On Fears in Peso Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday to a 16-week low against the German mark and dropped sharply against the Japanese yen on fears that United States financial institutions could be hurt if President Clinton's $50 billion rescue package for Mexico did not restore confidence in that country's battered economy.
There was also continued concern that Germany might raise interest rates as its economy picked up steam, making its currency more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. 
 Trading followed a recent pattern, with the dollar suffering from "peso contagion" as investors shunned North American currencies in favor of havens like the mark, the Swiss franc and, to a lesser extent, the yen.
The dollar, which closed on Wednesday in New York at 1.5089 marks, fell to 1.4880 marks, its lowest level since Oct. 25, before ending the day yesterday at 1.4902. Against the yen it fell to 97.42 late yesterday from 98.33 on Wednesday.
The mark also benefited from a flight out of the perennially weak Italian lira, as well as from the French franc and the British pound. The move was initiated after a board member of the German central bank had warned that a threatened strike by the huge metal workers' union, I. G. Metall, could lead to an inflationary wage settlement that would send interest rates higher.
The franc was also hurt by political uncertainty as the French presidential election neared. The pound is suffering from Prime Minister John Major's weak political standing and growing talk of rising inflation in London financial markets.
As the dollar dropped against major currencies, the news was bad, too, for the Mexican peso. The peso took a further fall against the dollar, closing at 6.075 to the dollar in New York yesterday, from 5.965 on Wednesday. Ten days ago, the peso traded just under 5.30 to the dollar.
The dollar's latest troubles stem from a lengthening list of doubts about the effectiveness of the American-organized rescue package for Mexico and the willingness of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon to impose the austerity measures he has promised in return for international help. "Confidence is weakening," said Geoffrey Bell, president of a New York investment advisory firm. "The Mexican bailout may not be working."
In addition, traders say that the Mexican Government is drawing down some of its dollar swap lines to support the peso, but that many of these dollars are flowing into Europe and the Far East, increasing the supply of dollars on those markets and helping to depress their value. "There was always a danger the provision of public capital would serve as a cover for private capital to leave the country," said Ravi Bulchandani of Morgan Stanley.
Another source of pressure on the dollar is the knowledge that Mexicans' appetite for United States goods will sharply diminish this year. That may widen the United States' trade deficit, adding even more dollars to those that must be absorbed by currency markets.
While currency traders remained nervous about the Mexican rescue package, the stock exchange in Mexico City staged a late rally yesterday afternoon. Optimism returned as Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz opened talks in Washington with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin aimed at overcoming obstacles to the promised $20 billion American contribution to the rescue package.
The Mexico City stock market's key index had fallen 3.6 percent in early trading, but recovered in the final minutes to close at 1,831.50, up 33.50 points, or 1.86 percent.
There should "soon be major announcements from Washington about an agreement on the loan conditions," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, chief of Latin American equity research at Bear, Stearns in New York. "This will finally eliminate the residual fear that this loan package is in trouble. It is not."
Other Latin American stock markets also suffered yesterday from the uncertainty over Mexico as some foreign investors began moving their money elsewhere. The Merval index in Buenos Aires dropped 6.96 percent to close at its lowest level in two years. Chile's Selective index was down 2.93 percent. In Sao Paulo, the Bovespa index fell 6.70 percent.

HEADLINE: Democratic Governors Oppose Plan Shifting Welfare to States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Democratic governors said today that they opposed a bill devised by House Republicans to overhaul the nation's welfare programs. They asserted that it would undermine state efforts to help poor people.
House Democrats said they would draft their own alternative, different from the Republican bill and from one proposed last year by President Clinton. 
 Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, and Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, denounced the House Republicans' bill, which is generally supported by Republican governors.
Mr. Carper said, "The bill will undercut my own efforts to reform the welfare system in Delaware."
It would, he said, reduce the amount of Federal money provided to the states for cash assistance and for the protection of children who have been abused or neglected.
The Republican bill would eliminate a longstanding Federal requirement that states put up money of their own to match Federal welfare payments. Mr. Carnahan said this change was "not particularly good policy."
The governors also complained that the Republican bill would leave states exposed to severe fiscal hardship in a recession, and they said it would impose new mandates on the states to achieve conservative policy goals.
The Republicans' welfare bill, a keystone of their legislative agenda, would pare social welfare programs established over the last 60 years in favor of block grants that the states could spend as they wished to aid the poor.
The bill was approved by a House subcommittee on Wednesday. Under its provisions, the main cash assistance program would no longer be an entitlement available to everyone who met certain eligibility criteria. The Republican bill would prohibit the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to unmarried mothers under the age of 18.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the cash assistance program had roots in the Social Security Act of 1935. Of the Republican bill, he said: "This is not welfare reform. It is an attack on Social Security. I don't believe that either this Congress or this nation will support it. The answer to our problems is not to turn children out into the street."
On a related subject, the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, Richard Rominger, told Congress today that the Administration opposed the House Republicans' effort to replace the food stamp program, the school lunch program and other nutrition programs with a new block grant to the states. The Administration has made no such categorical statement opposing a block grant for the main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, though it has objected to many details of that proposal.
Republican members of Congress said they were not impressed by the arguments of the Democratic governors. Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee, said Democrats on the panel had repeatedly suggested that governors could not be trusted to take care of their poor citizens.
"Listen to the inconsistency of this," Mr. Shaw said. "We have battled the Democrats for three days, trying to put much of this program down there at the state level, and the Democrats have fought us. If you look at their amendments, you'll see that they are trying to put straitjackets on the states. Then they march in a couple of governors who say that we're trying to manage them and putting too many strings on it. It's nuts."
Representative Mac Collins, Republican of Georgia, said it served the political interests of Democrats to keep poor people dependent on the Government.
"This is politics," Mr. Collins said. "We have a welfare system that has made a portion of our population dependent on the Federal Government, and that dependency has been very rewarding to the Democratic Party for quite some time. But it got so costly to the taxpayer that on Nov. 8 the politically incorrect working people of this country rose up and said, 'Enough is enough,' and they voted for change."
Democrats said the suggestion that they had purposely encouraged dependency was absurd. Representative Harold E. Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, said the Republicans were waging a "campaign of hate" against children.
Representative John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, said the Republicans were seeking "a cultural revolution to take back the morality that we have in this country, so it becomes unacceptable again to have kids out of wedlock."
"You are looking at 30 to 40 years of a system of Government programs that have helped create a moral decline in this country," Mr. Ensign said. "It is not going to turn around in one, two, three years. This has to take a complete cultural change."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
For Couples in Politics, Power (and Immunity)

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Since the earliest days of the Republic, prominent senators and representatives have found Government jobs for their friends.
Nowadays, it is not just cronies who get posts in the executive branch but sometimes the lawmakers' spouses. And that has led to situations for which no protocol exists. 
 Consider two incidents this month.
Two weeks ago, an inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration said his agency had improperly destroyed documents that might have embarrassed Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the minority leader. The Senator's wife, Linda Hall Daschle, is the agency's Deputy Administrator. She said she knew nothing about the documents.
Then, on Tuesday, a Federal judge here rejected the Clinton Administration's settlement of its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation and rebuked the Justice Department for having been too lenient. The chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, played golf with President Clinton on Martha's Vineyard last summer while negotiations were under way. The Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division is Anne K. Bingaman, the wife of Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico.
At a time when the political crossfire is so intense that Washington sometimes resembles a verbal Sarajevo, one might have thought that these incidents would have sparked a barrage of criticism from Republicans about nepotism.
But the Daschles and Bingamans have been immunized from political attack on this ground, as have other Democratic lawmakers with spouses in the Clinton Administration like Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, whose wife, Ruth, is president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, whose husband, James, is a Deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture.
The main reason is that the wives of Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas, the two most-visible Republicans in the Senate and candidates for the party's 1996 Presidential nomination, had top jobs in the Bush Administration. Elizabeth Hanford Dole was Secretary of Labor. Wendy Lee Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The qualifications of the spouses are not at issue. Mrs. Bingaman, Mrs. Harkin, Mr. Schroeder and Mrs. Dole had distinguished careers as lawyers before going into the Government. Mrs. Gramm has a doctorate in economics. Mrs. Daschle had worked in the aviation industry in various capacities for 20 years.
Still, it is doubtful that any of them would have gotten their Federal appointments had it not been for their spouses' political influence.
Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a student of the mores of Washington, put the matter this way: "Anne Bingaman is a fine person and a fine lawyer. But it is certainly clear that she was not the most distinguished antitrust lawyer in the United States. She was not even the most distinguished one in Washington. She was not even the most distinguished one among those who wanted the job. But obviously she wanted it, and her husband could deliver it for her."
This kind of arrangement is probably inevitable in these times of two-career couples. For many spouses, especially if they are lawyers, not much is left of a career in Washington if they cannot work in the Government and cannot lobby Congress. And when their spouse is, say, a senator and their party wins control of the White House, it is not surprising that they want jobs in the Government and that some arms get twisted on their behalf.
Dennis F. Thompson, who runs an ethical studies program at Harvard, observed that since most elected officials are men, rigid rules against their spouses holding Government jobs would discriminate against women. "That in itself is unethical," he said. "It is not so bad if the one who gets the job is eminently qualified but not the most qualified."
Businesses, law firms and newsrooms began coping with the situation years ago, and guidelines for proper conduct are now more or less understood. But politics somehow lagged behind.
So such questions arise as how much influence can a lawmaker properly apply to get a spouse a job. Or which spouse should withdraw from cases and in which circumstances. Or what kind of political favors can the one in the executive branch be expected to perform for colleagues of the spouse in Congress.
"These are delicate questions, but it is not beyond our intelligence to deal with them," said Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. "New norms, some protocols, some guidelines -- all of these will develop the way they develop in any part of society as it undergoes change."

HEADLINE: Congress Drafts Bill on Financial Overseers for Washington, Based on New York Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In the face of the severe municipal budget crisis here, Federal lawmakers are drafting legislation that would create for the District of Columbia the kind of financial oversight board that guided New York City out of bankruptcy in the 1970's.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's delegate to Congress, said today that the downgrading this week of the city's bond rating coupled with a $631 million budget deficit, made a powerful argument for establishing a temporary independent body to improve the fiscal condition of the city. 
 "The financial and management oversight board that I envision would be small in size but not in scope because of the dimensions of the problem," she said at a news conference, adding that the board would have full authority over all aspects of the city's budget and financial planning.
Mrs. Norton, a Democrat, said that the legislation was being developed as a bipartisan effort, led by the chairmen of the two House subcommittees that oversee the District's affairs, James T. Walsh, Republican of upstate New York, and Thomas M. Davis 3d, Republican of Virginia, and through consultations with city officials, the White House and outside experts in urban fiscal policy.
She also said she favored introducing legislation as soon as next week. But Mr. Davis said that while the creation of an oversight board was likely, it was only one option available to lawmakers. And he added that no legislation would be proposed until after Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and other city officials testify before a joint meeting of the subcommittees on Wednesday on the District's financial situation, which has been eroding for years.
"Walsh's and my position is to let things play out before we weigh in," Mr. Davis said in an interview. "We have a number of options available to us. But have we begun drafting something? Yes. It would be naive for us not to put pen to paper with this burgeoning crisis."
Whatever action Congress takes is certain to reduce the authority of Mr. Barry, who won election last fall campaigning as the only candidate capable of drawing the city out of its fiscal mess.
Today Mr. Barry scorned the notion of an oversight board, saying it was unjustified because the deficit had grown to its present size under a previous administration and he should not be held responsible.
He also asserted that any solution that failed to generate new revenue would be "a waste of time."
"Eleanor told me about this plan this morning," Mr. Barry said in an interview, "and that's exactly what I told her: Any plan that does not bring in revenue is not going to work. It's a waste of time."
As he has on other occasions, Mr. Barry defended his own deficit-reduction plan announced two weeks ago, even though Federal lawmakers have virtually ignored it while waiting for the results of an analysis of the city's finances by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.
On Wednesday Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of the district's general obligation bonds to junk status, and on Tuesday the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its rating to one level above junk-bond status. Officials at both companies cited not only the city's budget problem but the lack of a sound rescue plan.
As part of his proposal to reduce the deficit and a projected $91 million cash shortfall in the current fiscal year, Mr. Barry had proposed that Congress assume the District's Medicaid costs of $267 million. He said he would save another $70 million by imposing a 10 percent wage cut on city workers.
While Mrs. Norton provided few details of the board she is proposing, she described its broad powers, which are designed only to deal with the short-term issues of balancing the budget. Specifically, she said, the board would be authorized to take over many of the responsibilities that now belong to the Mayor, including devising spending plans, creating access to financial markets and correcting city government inefficiencies. The board could also audit the city's books.
But long-term issues, like altering the city's relationship with Congress under Home Rule, the 21-year-old law that gave the District government limited autonomy, would not be addressed by the oversight board. Those questions would be addressed after the current crisis had passed.
Mr. Walsh, a former president of the Syracuse City Council, said that if Congress was going to create an oversight board, he favored one similar to the Municipal Assistance Corporation developed 20 years ago for New York City. At the time, New York City's debt exceeded $7 billion, and private lenders were no longer willing to give the city credit.
By assuming control over all fiscal matters, the new corporation and a second agency later created to give the state control of the city budget, helped to restructure New York's debt and to balance the budget within six years.
But Mr. Davis cautioned that any proposed plan "that looks like a D.C. bailout," could be a tough sell in the Republican-controlled House. He pointed out that the last Congress -- controlled by Democrats and generally more sympathetic to the city's leaders -- passed the annual District appropriation by only three votes.
"And Newt Gingrich," he said of the new Speaker of the House, "was one of them."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Mixed Day In Trading of Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices of short- and intermediate-term Treasury issues rose yesterday after a Federal Reserve official raised hopes among bond traders that the central bank would not raise interest rates again soon.
But the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell, dropping 3/32 of a point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.57 percent, from 7.55 percent on Wednesday. 
 Treasury notes and bills rose after Robert P. Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said Fed officials hoped the central bank had raised rates enough to keep inflation in check.
Peter Hirsch, head trader at Salomon Brothers, said that "the market's taking a lot of this to mean that the Fed's kind of done" raising interest rates. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
The remarks by Mr. Forrestal touched off "lots of buying" of Treasuries, Mr. Hirsch said.
At the same time, turmoil in the currency markets, where the dollar plunged to its lowest level against the German mark in nearly four years, prompted investors to sell long-term bonds amid concerns that the weaker dollar would spur inflation by driving up the cost of imported goods.
Mr. Forrestal is a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the arm of the Fed that determines interest rate policy.
Yields of Treasury notes and bills fell even as bond yields rose. The yield for the two-year note fell 7 basis points, to 7.01 percent, its lowest yield since November. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Investors are betting that the Fed's final interest rate increase for now "either just happened, or is within three months of happening," said Mark Taborsky, who manages $130 million in bonds at Abacus Financial Group in Chicago.
The Fed last raised the Federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks on Feb. 1, the seventh increase in a year.
Economic reports yesterday suggested that the rate increases had caused the economy to slow enough to subdue inflation.
The Commerce Department, for example, said housing starts fell much more than expected last month: 9.8 percent instead of 2.7 percent. The larger-than-expected drop suggests higher mortgage rates are starting to lead to a slowdown in the housing market.
Meanwhile, the American Home Products Corporation doubled the size of its two-part note offering, to $2 billion.
The five-year notes of American Home Products were priced at $998.74 per $1,000 bond to yield 7.73 percent, or 44 basis points more than the when-issued five-year Treasury note. The 10-year notes were priced at $998.05 per $1,000 bond to yield 7.928 percent, or 54 basis points more than the 10-year note.
At these levels, analysts said, the bonds, which are rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, would offer a lower yield than similarly rated bonds.

HEADLINE: Democrats Challenge Tax Cut Plan As More Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A day after Gov. John G. Rowland released his budget, top Democrats today began their attack, saying that Mr. Rowland wants to finance his proposed tax cuts by delaying payments on state bonds.
"How can a Republican borrow money to do a tax cut?" Thomas D. Ritter, the top Democrat in the State Legislature, said. "It's like taking out a mortgage on a house to take a trip to Hawaii." 
 It was the first salvo in what is likely to be a long and contentious battle for Mr. Rowland, as he tries to push his budget through a Legislature in which Democrats control the House of Representatives and Republicans the Senate. And it began a debate on whether Mr. Rowland's budget is as revolutionary as he claims.
On Wednesday, in his address to the General Assembly, Mr. Rowland hailed his budget as a "complete revision and revitalization" of government. He said it would lower spending from the previous year's budget for the first time in 35 years, that as many as 2,500 state employees would be laid off and that the income tax and the corporate tax would be reduced.
But Democratic legislators, union leaders, women's groups and hospitals questioned the viability of the budget. And in the coming weeks, the number of groups lobbying against Mr. Rowland's proposal is sure to multiply.
At a news conference this morning, Mr. Ritter, the Speaker of the House; Moira K. Lyons, the House majority leader, and William A. DiBella, the Senate minority leader, tried to link Mr. Rowland's income tax cut -- which they referred to as "tax relief lite" because it was smaller than expected -- to his proposal to delay paying off bonds that were issued in 1991 to cover a deficit.
Under Mr. Rowland's plan, the state would not meet the 1996 deadline for retiring the remaining $328.1 million in Economic Recovery Notes, the five-year bonds used to balance the budget in 1991. Instead, Mr. Rowland has recommended refinancing the debt and putting off the final payment until 1999. This postponement would add another $28 million in interest, Democrats said.
Lorraine M. Aronson, Mr. Rowland's deputy budget chief, said the refinancing was no more related to the tax reduction than any other cut in the budget. The decision to extend payment on the bonds, she said, was made because it was too large a payment to handle in one year.
But Mr. Ritter, a state representative from Hartford, and other Democrats said that the refinancing of the bonds was just one of several examples of how the tax cut was not financed by spending cuts, as Mr. Rowland claims. And they questioned whether the sacrifices required from such steps were a reasonable compromise to achieve an income tax cut that was worth no more than $2 a week per taxpayer.
In the campaign, Mr. Rowland had pledged to veto any budget that did not cut the income tax to 3 percent, from 4.5 percent. What he offered Tuesday was a one-third reduction for only 20 percent of income-tax filers, the lowest wage earners. The remainder would only be able to take a one-third deduction on the first $6,000 of earned income for individuals and $12,000 for joint filers.

HEADLINE: Dow Inches to Record, But Falls Short of 4,000

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average, which came within two points of the 4,000 mark on Wednesday, failed again to break through it yesterday. But the Dow still closed at another record high, reaching 3,987.52, up 1.35 points.
Despite the slight gain in the Dow, declining stocks far outnumbered advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, with 886 winning stocks and 1,334 losers. 
 Unlike its performance during Wednesday's session, when the Dow crossed over 3,995 at least six times before pulling back, the Dow was at its highest point at the close yesterday. It had been off by as much as 21 points during the day.
Other leading indexes were mixed. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index also closed at another record high of 485.22, up 0.68 point.
But the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.32 points, to 793.31, and far from its record high of 803.93 last March 18.
The prolonged crisis in the Mexican financial markets, which caused volatility in the currency market, weighed on stocks and bonds.
On Wednesday a large tourism conglomerate, Grupo Sidek, alarmed international investors by defaulting on $19.5 million in debt and prompting fears that the Clinton Administration's $50 billion rescue package was too little, too late. There were fears in the currency market that American financial institutions could be hurt if Mexico's economy remained unstable, and that helped pull down the dollar against the German mark and the Japanese yen.
That Mexico could keep the stock market from rising underscores the argument of some analysts that investors lack conviction in the market's prospects.
Up to now traders have been interpreting recent economic data as favorable to stocks, and bidding up the Dow on the beliefs that the economy will grow at a slower pace and the Federal Reserve will not need to raise interest rates much more to keep inflation in check. But some analysts said the financial markets could be in for a rude surprise.
"The market wants to believe that the soft landing is here and now, and the Fed doesn't have to tighten," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. "I am on the other side of that."
Yesterday, technology stocks rallied. Hewlett-Packard rose 10 1/2, to 115 7/8, after reporting a rise of 64 percent in first-quarter profit. Another technology stock, Veritas Software, a developer of computer software, reached a 52-week high of 24 1/2, before closing at 24 3/8, up 4 5/8.
Microtouch Systems, a supplier of touch-screen systems for computers, rose 3 1/8, to 31 1/4, after reporting that fourth-quarter net income rose to 24 cents a share from 10 cents.
The declining stocks yesterday included Lin Broadcasting, which fell 10 1/4, to 130 1/4, after Morgan Stanley valued Lin's shares at $105, rather than the $155 a share that Lin is seeking. AT&T, which acquired a 52 percent stake in Lin when AT&T acquired McCaw Cellular Communications last fall, is considering buying the remaining stake in Lin.
The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was far above normal, with 362.2 million shares changing hands, about 9 percent higher than the daily average of 332 million shares this year.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.08 point, to 263.27, and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.67 points, to 447.68.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Realizing that the world does not sing in perfect harmony, YAR marches to each culture's drum.

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
WHILE the global marketplace has become almost a cliche these days, a less-noted parallel trend is the growth of multicultural marketing geared to individual cultures. And one New York-based agency is finding success as it devotes its attention to developing campaigns for clients in many languages to reach ethnic groups in the United States and consumers in foreign countries.
The agency, YAR Communications, now creates print and broadcast ads in Polish, Chinese, Ukrainian, Spanish, Greek and dozens of other languages. It follows the school of thought that people in any market will respond best to communications from advertisers with cultural authenticity -- an authenticity that goes beyond language to encompass core values and traditions. The other main school of thought in global advertising reasons quite differently: It maintains that one message universal enough to be understood in any language is the most powerful. 
 Yuri Radzievsky, president of YAR and its co-founder with his wife, Anna, said: "Understanding the culture comes before understanding the language. Our advertising is developed from within the culture that says to consumers, 'We really understand you.' "
This approach has afforded YAR a prominence in the realm of agencies that specialize in foreign-language campaigns. Today YAR has billings of close to $120 million, 130 employees who together speak 30 languages and clients like Merrill Lynch, Citibank and the Discovery Channel.
YAR's more intimate approach to global advertising can be seen in the ads it created for the AT&T Corporation for use in Poland and Russia. The ads use different visual and verbal cues to signal consumers in a tone that Mr. Radzievsky and his staff believe is appropriate to each culture. In Poland the ads are laden with sentiment and poetry, and in Russia a similar ad contains more sarcasm and music.
Sandra Shellenberger, a district advertising manager for AT&T, said that she and her colleagues backed this approach to the hilt. "You've got to develop the concept in the culture," she added. "Translating English ads into Polish or Russian just doesn't work."
The Radzievskys fled to the United States from the former Soviet Union in 1973, where they had worked in television, and started an agency called Euramerica two years later. Their aim from the start was to adopt advertising materials to the culture of their audiences, rather than merely translate ads originally created in English.
Euramerica was sold to Ogilvy & Mather in 1981 and sold again to Macmillan in 1989, after which Mr. Radzievsky left the company. Soon afterward, the couple established YAR, a name that represents their initials; Mrs. Radzievsky is executive vice president.
Over the years, the Radzievskys have discovered they have to sell each ad campaign twice. "First we have to explain it to the client, who does not understand the language of the ad," Mr. Radzievsky said. "Then we have to sell it to the audience."
For Merrill Lynch, YAR created print ads for Russian readers who were unfamiliar with the concept of individual investing. In one of its cultural-based campaigns, it redesigned the brokerage firm's stylistic bull logo -- the American version reminded Russians more of food than finance -- and used the slogan "Your Personal Interpreter of the Free Economy Language" to impress them with Merrill Lynch's expertise.
Ads for Citibank in Mandarin and Cantonese, featuring expressions with which viewers could identify, were run on Chinese-language TV stations in New York and California. For Mack Trucks, the bulldog logo could not be used in China because dogs are considered an inferior species there. YAR substituted a symbol of a horse, which the agency's Chinese experts realized would also give a sense of the trucks' horsepower.
Perhaps it was only fitting that Mr. Radzievsky, who became a citizen of the United States in 1978, opened an office of his agency last year in Moscow, his hometown in what is now the independent nation of Russia. "Now we can provide our bank of knowledge there, too," he said.

HEADLINE: McCall Warns of Deficit Ahead

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 16

 BODY:
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall warned today that Gov. George E. Pataki's budget and tax proposals could lead to large deficits in the coming years.
Among other things, Mr. McCall, a Democrat, said the Republican Governor had "back-loaded" the first phase of his four-year income tax plan so that about $180 million of its $720 million value would be pushed into next year. 
 "What has been presented is only a small down payment on a large multi-year tax reduction program," Mr. McCall said.
The eventual value of the tax-cut plan balloons to $6.8 billion after four years.
Mr. McCall said the state would be faced with a potential deficit of $2.8 billion already built into the 1996-97 state fiscal year.
"As a result, the spending cuts needed next year may be proportionally larger than those included this year," the Comptroller said.
In his first budget proposal, a $32.4 billion plan for the 1995-96 state fiscal year that begins April 1, Governor Pataki has already called for some sharp spending cuts. He wants more than $1.2 billion trimmed from Medicaid and would cut some welfare benefits up to 25 percent.
There was no immediate comment from Governor Pataki on the Comptroller's report.
Mr. Pataki has not denied that the cost of his tax-cut plan increases greatly in future years, but he has argued the cuts will stimulate the economy so much that everything will more than balance.
Mr. McCall's warning came as he issued the first of several planned reports on the Governor's budget, a move by the Comptroller to become more involved in the budgeting.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Falls by Daily Limit On Decline in New Housing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Lumber futures plunged their daily trading limit yesterday after the Government reported that housing construction had dropped to its lowest level in a year.
On other commodity markets, cotton futures surged to 14-year highs while energy futures advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities fell 0.14 point, to 234.22. 
 The Commerce Department said housing starts plunged 9.8 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million. The weakness was seen in every region. Analysts attributed the decline to rising interest rates and predicted that the slide would continue in the coming months.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber for March delivery fell the $10 limit, settling at $318.30 for 1,000 board feet.
January's decline in housing starts was the largest since a 21 percent plunge in January 1994, when winter storms curtailed construction. But this January, weather conditions were more favorable over much of the country.
"There was no question that the market was not looking for a 10 percent drop," said Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. "When people saw those figures, they said, 'Just get me out; those numbers look horrible.' "
Elsewhere, cotton futures soared to 14-year highs after a prominent cotton merchant, William Dunavant of the Dunavant Commodity Corporation, predicted that United States supplies would run out in August.
Cotton for March delivery rose 0.99 cent, to 95.95 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange; the actively traded May contract soared 1.94 cents, to 95.23 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Nynex, Ending Monopoly, Would Let Cable Business Offer Home Phone Service

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., Feb. 16

 BODY:
In a move that would end its monopoly on local telephone service in the metropolitan area, Nynex said today that it would cooperate with the Cablevision Systems Corporation's efforts to enter the residential phone market.
If approved by state regulators, the agreement would create the nation's first head-to-head battle for telephone customers between a telephone giant and a major cable television provider. 
 Regulators and investment analysts say the agreement, the first between a cable operator and one of the seven regional Bell operating companies, is a breakthrough in efforts to spur competition in the residential phone business. They say it could not only lead to lower rates for customers, but it could compel other telephone companies to follow Nynex's lead.
"When you have an agreement between two such major players in the market, it's a breakthrough for competition," said Lisa Rosenblum, deputy chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission.
Officials of Cablevision Lightpath, a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems, said that after tests are completed this year, they could start offering telephone service to residential customers next year. Yonkers -- where Cablevision has been experimenting with a number of upgraded services to its customers -- would probably be the first place where phone service would be offered, they said.
"What this means for us is that we now can proceed with more confidence down the path we want: to offer residential customers and small businesses a choice and value in local telephone service," said Joseph Cece, president of Cablevision Lightpath. The agreement is subject to the approval of the Public Service Commission, which has been seeking to increase competition in the telephone business and other industries it regulates.
Last year, Time Warner Inc., another major cable company, announced plans to offer phone service to its customers in Rochester through a similar arrangement with Frontier Corporation, an independent telephone company. But the pact between Nynex and Cablevision is much more significant because the market in which the two companies would compete is so much larger.
While Nynex has 7.5 million business and residential customers throughout the state, Cablevision, based in Woodbury, L.I., has about one million subscribers, concentrated on Long Island and in New York City.
W. John Aronsohn, a consumer communications analyst with the Yankee Group of Boston, said the agreement announced today was a harbinger of immense changes in the telecommunications industry. For as phone companies are looking to carry cable television transmissions over their wires, so are cable providers seeking to do battle over the dial tone.
"We're on the cusp of a major groundswell of cable operators entering the competitive telephone business," he said.
Mr. Aronsohn said there were advantages to both companies in forging the agreement. For Cablevision, he said, the pact is a matter of practicality: its phones must be connected to a large network to provide customers with reliable service that reaches everywhere.
For Nynex, the agreement has more political advantages: The company, Mr. Aronsohn said, wants to show Federal regulators that it encourages competition, in hopes the Government will relax some of the restrictions on the aspects of the phone business in which the regional Bells are permitted to operate.
"Nynex wants to get into the long-distance business, and in order to do it, they need to show good faith to the F.C.C. that they are willing to work with other companies that are trying to get into the local phone business," Mr. Aronsohn said, referring to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the long-distance business.
Jack Goldberg, vice president for network interconnection marketing and sales for Nynex, said the company wanted to remove the obstacles for other companies seeking to enter its business so that the Government would do the same for Nynex.
"We are deliberately and pro-actively eliminating the technological and economic barriers that prevent others from becoming full local telephone service providers so that sooner rather than later we can be a full-service provider," Mr. Goldberg said.
Under the agreement, the companies would pay each other for calls ending in each other's networks, although Cablevision officials say that the way the payments would be structured is under review by the Public Service Commission. And in what regulators and analysts regard as a crucial provision, Nynex would allow customers to keep the telephone numbers assigned them by Nynex, even if they switched local service to Cablevision.
Mr. Aronsohn said that the agreement carried possible pitfalls for both companies. Because Cablevision holds a virtual monopoly on cable service on Long Island, where a majority of its New York customers live, "the risk for Nynex is losing a significant portion of their local franchise," he said.
Cablevision, on the other hand, might encounter resistance from its own customers, who might not trust the company with their telephone service.
"Cable operators historically have a bad reputation for service," Mr. Aronsohn said. "Cable customers who are used to having trouble getting through to a customer representative may be reluctant to entrust a service to their cable operator as vital as the telephone."

HEADLINE: Homes and Jobless Data Indicate a Slowdown

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Construction starts on new homes fell in January and new unemployment claims jumped last week, the Government said today, sure signs that rising interest rates are slowing the economy down.
The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments dropped 9.8 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.38 million a year. 
 It was the biggest decline in building activity since a 21 percent drop in January 1994, and it was accompanied by an 8.6 decline in applications for building permits, pointing to further weakness for housing in coming months.
Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment pay jumped by 20,000 last week, to 338,000, the biggest weekly rise since mid-1994 and the highest level in a month.
Analysts said seven interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the last year were clearly showing up as corporations and consumers faced stiffer borrowing charges.
"The economy is going over the edge of the table now to a lower growth rate as a result of the cumulative impact of these interest-rate rises," Robert R. Davis, an economist at the Savings and Community Bankers Association of America, said.
Housing traditionally is the most interest-rate sensitive sector of the economy. The fact that building has fallen sharply in every region of the country and permit applications have fallen in three of the last four months show the January plunge was "not a fluke," Mr. Davis added.
It was the second consecutive month that starts declined, though December building was down only a revised six-tenths of 1 percent instead of the previously reported 1 percent fall.
Michael Carliner, economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said builders had grown more cautious and the industry already anticipated a significant drop in construction from 1994 levels.
Part of the January decline in activity "reflects the fact that the cost of carrying inventory is up, and the inventory itself is up," Mr. Carliner said, referring to the growing supply of finished but unsold homes on the market.
The drop in January building occurred entirely in single-family homes: starts fell 12.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.07 million units.
It was the lowest level for the important single-family-home category in nearly two years.
The Labor Department said that the 338,000 new jobless claims were the most since 339,000 claims were filed during the week ended Jan. 14. But the four-week moving average of weekly jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week, dropping to 326,750 from the previous week's average of 327,000.

HEADLINE: 3 Hotels for the World's Crossroads;
Dollars, Not Design, Will Decide the Choice for Times Sq.

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
To some, it may look like the ninth circle of hell, but for others, Times Square is money. And dollars, not design, are likely to be the deciding factor in the competition to build a new hotel on Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets.
Designs for three proposals were submitted yesterday to the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the agencies responsible for the redevelopment of 42d Street. In April, the project is scheduled to be awarded to the developer who can persuade these agencies that his is the most attractive financial package. Even so, the competition's three contenders are worth considering on the basis of design. Assuming that one actually gets built, it's a building, not a bank account, that we will have to look at. 
 The 57,500-square-foot project site, which was acquired last October with $35 million in city money, extends about halfway east along 42d Street, toward Seventh Avenue, in addition to the Eighth Avenue parcel between 42d and 43d Streets. The design guidelines call for a mix of retail and entertainment along the 42d Street extension.
All three finalists -- Arquitectonica, Michael Graves, Zaha Hadid -- are distinguished architects, all have yet to complete a building in New York City, and any one could be counted on to raise the city's sagging architectural profile. And for this project, each architect has the advantage of working with an unofficial collaborator, Robert A. M. Stern, the architect primarily responsible for drafting the design guidelines for the redevelopment of 42d Street. If nothing else, the hotel competition demonstrates that the guidelines have succeeded in their goal of discouraging architectural uniformity. Variety is the spice of Times Square, and the three architects have created a savory range of designs.
Michael Graves's plan, designed for the development of Marriott International and Triarc Equities, is appealingly democratic. Most of the hotel's 945 rooms would be run as a Courtyard Inn, Marriott's low-cost chain, a plan that would certainly honor the spirit of Times Square as a popular tourist attraction. Appealing, too, is the idea of hiring an architect of Mr. Graves's stature to design a low-cost venture.
The hotel part of the plan is a classical skyscraper, sheathed in a soft palette of colored brick: pink, ochre, blue and green. Rising 470 feet in a series of gentle setbacks, Mr. Graves's midtown campanile is a laid-back landmark, dignified but unassertive. A large square illuminated clock is the tower's most flamboyant feature.
Things get livelier at the street level, starting with a big red apple at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 42d Street. Housing a subway entrance at its base, a cafe upstairs, the giant fruit recalls a similar proposal put forward some years back by Robert Venturi as a symbolic Times Square centerpiece. And Mr. Graves's design for the 42d Street part of the site is also Venturian in its pop sensibility. A parade of signs and billboards marches along the street, creating a facade for shops and for what is perhaps the plan's most ambitious feature, a 2,000-seat theater.
Mr. Graves's is the most traditional of the schemes, not only because his tower is classical in spirit, but also because the plan replicates the traditional Broadway pattern of subordinating buildings to signs.
Yet to continue the tradition of masking buildings with signs is to miss one of the major opportunities offered by the design guidelines: the chance to create architecture that is in itself a sign. The other two proposals accomplish this in strikingly different ways.
The most visionary of the three proposals is undoubtedly that prepared by the London-based architect Zaha Hadid for the development team of Milstein Properties and Weiler Arnow Management. The developers have taken a breathtaking risk by hiring Ms. Hadid, an architect who, though immensely gifted, has thus far built little.
Beyond that, this team has grasped a critical challenge facing developers in Times Square. The retail and entertainment uses envisioned for 42d Street are mostly geared toward consumption. What is usually overlooked is the opportunity to make Times Square an entertainment production center as well. Ms. Hadid's plan meets this challenge by incorporating HBO production studios into the 42d Street extension. Stores would be housed on the extension's ground floor.
For the hotel, to be managed by Hilton, Ms. Hadid has come up with a dazzlingly original concept. Her 48-story, glass-sheathed tower would become, in effect, a vertical street. Public rooms -- cocktail lounges, health clubs, restaurants -- would be threaded through the entire height of the tower, interspersed with blocks of hotel rooms. The building's different uses would be expressed architecturally by the shaping of the exterior into a powerful composition of angular, crystalline forms.
Signs, too, would be scattered over the surface of the tower's height. Ms. Hadid envisions that most of the signs will consist of images projected onto the tower's glass surfaces. But this concept raises a major problem with her design. Ms. Hadid is an exceedingly meticulous architect. And the beauty of her design depends to a large extent on an idea for signage that may be difficult to realize technically, and hard to sell to commercial advertisers. Even if these problems were solved, the result is likely to have an esthetic uniformity that the design guidelines were expressly devised to overcome. In short, the level of this project's architectural sophistication is extraordinarily high. Too high, perhaps, for gaudy, bawdy 42d Street.
Two decades ago, the architecture critic Peter Blake half-jokingly suggested that the best way cities could deal with urban problems was to turn all or part of them over to the people at Disney. Since then, those who value urban diversity have had good reason to fear the conversion of cities into theme park versions of themselves. But when a plan comes along that's as good as the one submitted by the Disney Development Company, in a joint venture with the Tishman Urban Development Corporation, one wants to send out for mouse ears.
Arquitectonica, the Miami firm primarily responsible for the design, has already demonstrated considerable talent for creating popular, snazzy buildings without sacrificing its reputation for serious architecture. In New York, Arcquitectonica offers a jazz version of the apocalypse: a stylized architectural image of a comet crashing at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
The comet, or meteor shape, as the architects call it, is a 10-story building with a jagged roof line, covered with glass mosaics depicting the Statue of Liberty, the Guggenheim Museum and other New York landmarks. Contained behind this tourist's scrapbook are 50 time-share apartments.
The tower rising above is a glass slab split into two sides by a slim, illuminated curve. Shooting light up into the sky at night, the curve will resemble a comet's streaking tail. There's no impact crater here, just shopping and entertainment. A 400-foot commercial complex, designed by D'Agostino, Izzo, Quirk, Architects, stretches along 42d Street, heavily encrusted with signs.
The entire design is remarkably intelligent in the way it fits the pieces together. The changes in scale, function and esthetic approach; the transition from the abstract forms of the tower to the figurative images of the signs: these elements adhere strictly to the design guidelines, but kiss them with inspiration. Forty-second Street, in its present form, already looks like a meteor has struck, but this design is an explosion of life.

HEADLINE: New York's Health and Economy Will Feel Home-Care Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposes to slash the New York Medicaid budget by $1.2 billion. His proposals would eviscerate the long-term home care system by eliminating or seriously limiting many programs that provide community-based care. 
 The home care agencies of New York City provide home attendant services to more than 65,000 clients yearly and employ an equal number of full- and part-time home attendants. Singled out by the Governor for the budget ax, these services may be lost despite their vital importance as an interrelated part of the health care delivery system.
For many years New York State policy has limited nursing home space and has encouraged nursing facilities to take only patients with high-skill needs. Many patients who would be placed in nursing homes in other states -- including those with Alzheimer's disease and other chronic illnesses requiring long-term care -- are in the home attendant program here.
About 6,000 of these patients in the city require 24-hour home care. Under the Governor's proposal these patients would have to be institutionalized -- or manage with 100 hours or less of personal care a month.
The cuts in personal care -- coupled with elimination of the assisted living program, adult day care in nursing homes, the long-term home health care program and housekeeping for the home-bound elderly and disabled -- inevitably would increase the number of patients in need of nursing home beds. But the Governor has also called for a moratorium on new nursing home beds. Where are these sick people to go?
Either the result will be high hospital costs, as patients are hospitalized more frequently and for longer periods, or acutely and chronically ill poor people will suffer. The proposed budget creates the potential for a health care crisis in New York of unprecedented proportions.
Half of the home attendant program is financed by the Federal Government, and the people who work as home attendants -- nearly all New York residents -- paid $28 million in state taxes and $15 million in city taxes in 1994.
Ninety percent of the budgets of the agencies that provide these services go to wages and benefits for home attendants. These wages are pumped into the city's poor and working-class neighborhoods, where desirable jobs with good wages and health benefits are critically needed.
Moreover, last year, 1,000 people on welfare became productively employed as home attendants. Where does the Governor think the welfare clients he wants to put to work will find jobs if he eliminates these?
Costs can be controlled while providing safe, cost-effective health care to all who need it. Home attendant agencies are working with city officials on programs that have saved tens of millions. Much more can be done, and the saving proposed by the Governor can probably be met or exceeded without harming patients.

If only all greetings were as generous as the one at this show of West African stories. The audience is greeted with a funga, a traditional welcome dance, in which Tambu, a musician, plays drums and creates an irresistible warm mood. When the six dancing actors then come across the stage in their earth-colored African costumes, the collective mood flies higher. 
 The exuberance continues through the telling of four tales and several story-songs from the Ivory Coast. Children will be mesmerized (drums work wonders) and humored, as will adults.
The first tale, "How Man and Woman Were Made," is conveyed through two characters, Moon and Toad. They bicker like siblings and grow vicious (Moon kills Toad, but this is actually a funny moment). In all this rivalry, a man and a woman are created. In the second tale, "Talk," objects and animals speak to a befuddled farmer ("Leave me alone," a yam says), but he wises up by realizing that everything -- a stone, a dog, the yam -- is sacred.
The story-songs are brief messengers of music. In "Toumou," an actor becomes a caterpillar by wrapping himself in green cloth. Then he sings an African song and afterward children in the audience are beckoned onto the stage to prance around. At the end of the show, the actors do a lamba, a celebratory dance in which they show off their skills.
The company has wisely chosen humorous tales with bold characters that teach moral lessons about tolerance and getting along with people. Children learn through the characters' actions and dialogue how certain behaviors can be boorish; one chief, for example, is awfully officious and children see through him very quickly.
Tickets to the 70-minute program are $8 for adults and $6 for students and children. Performances are Saturdays and Sundays at 3 P.M.; there will be special holiday performances on Wednesday and Thursday at 11 A.M.

The Birdie is the 8-foot-tall, hypersensitive Big Bird, who has disappeared because he mistakenly thought his friends had forgotten his birthday.
Big Bird's friends -- Elmo, Cookie Monster, Ernie, Bert, Oscar, Prairie Dawn and others -- try to find him in six short Broadway-style numbers. In a scene with the inimitable Bert and Ernie, Bert is "naked," as he says, in a tub and Ernie sings "Rubber Duckie" (which the audience sings, too). Then the lights go out and everyone with a Big Bird flashlight, which cost $5, flashes it.
To thicken the feathery plot after Big Bird is found, a Muppet named P. T. Barnswallow schemes to turn him into a caged bird in a vaudeville show. In another scene, a scary moment occurs when the Count polkas against a backdrop of spooky trees. At the end, a surprise party for Big Bird features a gigantic cake.
The show is 90 minutes, about half an hour too long for toddlers. The people in the audience get to clap, tug on their ears, flap their arms and jump in their seats. During a "13-minute" intermission, you can chase after your children and spend money on extras like balloons ($3), the flashlights and cotton candy ($5). The annual program used to be held in Madison Square Garden's arena, but is now in the Paramount, where the stairs in the tiered seating area are troublesome for parents with children who like to wander. The Muppets rarely ventured past the most expensive seating around the stage, ignoring about two-thirds of the audience, but the children had a great time anyway.
The Paramount entrance is at Seventh Avenue and 32d Street. Tickets are $11.50 to $19.50; performances this weekend are tonight at 7 and tomorrow and Sunday at 10:30 A.M. and 2 and 5 P.M. Performance schedule: Wednesdays through Sundays in the morning, early and late afternoon.
 
'How to Buy Your Own Bike'
 Brooklyn Children's Museum

 Recommended ages: 8 to 15
 Sunday
They're thinking about bicycles in Brooklyn. How to raise the money to buy them, that is. Byron Perry teaches children the art of being an entrepreneur, even without start-up capital. His series of lectures are called Kids Inc., and they're about running your own business.
"The bicycle is a metaphor," Mr. Perry explained. "I'm really talking about how to have goals and achieve them." Most children would agree that the goal of buying a bicycle is an excellent place to start, nevertheless.
Children are naturally ambitious, Mr. Perry said, especially when it comes to money. Last time he taught this class, there were junior entrepreneurs in the audience who shared their experiences, which Mr. Perry encourages (there is also a question-and-answer period).
Mr. Perry tells the story of one boy who bought candy and hired his cousin to sell it to classmates, neighbors and family at a higher price. But the boy dismissed the cousin because he ignored work rules. (First lesson: Don't hire kin.)
"Children have to be creative to enhance their income," Mr. Perry added. "There are many ways beside selling lemonade: like making arts and crafts and selling them at shows; doing odd jobs for neighbors." Children feel independent and comfortable if they have economic clout.
The 45-minute workshop, at 1:30 and 3 P.M., is free with admission to the museum, suggested at $3.

Sally Field in Three Nights and Seven Decades

 BODY:
Sally Field continues to do remarkably well by television. She got started 30 years ago as "Gidget" and followed that closely with "The Flying Nun," which she might understandably want to forget. Then in 1977 her Emmy-winning performance in the drama "Sybil" paved the way for a film career that would earn two Oscars, in 1979 for "Norma Rae" and in 1984 for "Places in the Heart." Sunday she returns to television in the kind of bravura role coveted by actresses everywhere.
"A Woman of Independent Means," a six-hour, three-part mini-series based on a 1978 novel by Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey, follows for some seven decades the story of Bess Alcott, from her Dallas marriage to her fourth-grade sweetheart to the birth of three children to the fussings with grandchildren. It's a panoramic portrait, crammed with moments of joy and tragedy, all arranged around Bess's getting to the point where she is "finally beginning to understand nothing is given to us for keeps." 
 But there is continuity, and that theme is amplified in devices like a wedding ring that keeps being passed from mother to daughter or a song like "You Tell Me Your Dream, I'll Tell You Mine," which becomes a standard at family occasions. Robert Greenwald, the director, conveys the passage of time not by a clutter of "three years later" graphics but by changes in fashion and the appearance of new products like cars and cameras. In fact, each two-hour segment is shot in different camera styles, beginning with old-fashioned dolly shots and ending with hand-held techniques.
To some extent, Bess is less a woman of independent means than a woman of privilege. Raised in a well-to-do Texas family, she inherits her mother's considerable fortune at an early age. There are setbacks, but someone always seems to be around to make sure that Bess's stocks and bonds lose none of their value. In fact, by the final installment, spirited Bess gets just a wee bit tiresome with her knowing-what's-best-for-you antics. Viewers might be forgiven wanting to know less about Bess and more about her patient, self-effacing maid.
Make no mistake: this is Ms. Field's party, and she makes the most of it, especially in some wrenching scenes of heartbreaking loss. This actress can be powerful. The rest of the cast largely labors in roles that are decidedly supporting, though an unusually subdued Ron Silver gives Mr. Fineman, Bess's special friend, a most effective turn. Only the remarkable Brenda Fricker ("My Left Foot") manages to steal scenes from Ms. Field with a matriarchal impunity that is stunning. Even a star can't have everything. JOHN J. O'CONNOR
 
FREEDOM TO HATE
Tomorrow, WLIW, 5 A.M.
(Channel 21 in New York)
The main interest of this somewhat scattered report about anti-Semitism in Russia lies in the interviews with heads of hate groups that are now cultivating the country's old tradition of Jew-bashing and its current political and economic turmoil. The spokesmen focused on here, like leaders of Pamyat, the right-wing party that has done unsettlingly well in elections, seem slightly mad and more than slightly clownish. But as the program suggests, history warns against discounting the horrors that clowns and madmen can inflict. WALTER GOODMAN

HEADLINE: Babbitt Likens Move to Kill Science Agencies to 'Book Burning'

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said tonight that a Republican-backed proposal to abolish the United States Geological Survey and two other science agencies in the Interior Department was tantamount to "book burning."
"In 17th-century Portugal, after a major earthquake devastated that country, the political leaders responded by burning a few more heretics at the stake," Mr. Babbitt said in remarks prepared for the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which opened here this evening. "Today, the response to California earthquakes is to burn the United States Geological Survey." 
 In a "crude and misguided attack," Mr. Babbitt said, the Republicans' Contract With America also proposed to eliminate the National Biological Service and the United States Bureau of Mines.
Asked for a response, Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, said: "Mr. Babbitt has always been a little odd. How closing down some bureaucratic agency constitutes book burning is only a conclusion that the good Mr. Babbitt can reach. I am baffled by Babbitt."
The main reason for seeking to eliminate the three science agencies is reportedly to cut the budget deficit by an estimated $3.3 billion over five years. Some Republicans have also declared war on what they see as a bloated Federal bureaucracy.
Mr. Babbitt said the attack on science was motivated by politicians who wanted to prevent "overregulation of our natural resources" under statutes like the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act."
"While I may disagree with their goals, the content and form of regulatory policy is always a proper subject for political debate," he said. "Let's have at it. But proclaiming that good science should take the fall for political differences amounts to a declaration that there should be no science except that science which produces politically correct answers."
Mr. Babbitt acknowledged that Federal science agencies were sometimes biased toward the attitudes of politically appointed regulators who supervised them. Such criticisms should be "taken seriously," he said.
In defending the use of science to protect natural resources, Mr. Babbitt described a comprehensive forest plan developed recently for the Pacific Northwest. It abandons the old policy of exploiting 10 acres of land for every 1 that is preserved, he said, in favor of providing biological diversity and sustainable economic activity over the entire landscape.
Mr. Babbitt stressed that the three agencies under attack were limited to analyzing data to provide information on natural resources and development. "They don't regulate, they don't enforce and they don't take actions against people or businesses," he said. "What they do is insulate science from the regulators and the politicians."

HEADLINE: Governor Rowland Meets Reality

 BODY:
Connecticut's new Governor, John Rowland, has yielded to fiscal reality and toned down his promise of instant tax relief for all. His budget offers instead a quick cut -- on borrowed money -- for people with low and mid-level incomes.
He made no mention of his principal campaign pledge, to repeal the state income tax altogether, though his spokesman says repeal is still the goal. Perhaps in time the Governor will yield the rest of the way and leave that sensible tax in place. The alternative is a return to dependence on sales taxes, a far less dependable source of revenue. 
 Economic recovery from the recession has been slower in Connecticut than elsewhere in the Northeast, in large part because the state was too heavily dependent on defense contracts, already shrinking when the recession hit. Limited economic expansion means limited revenue growth, which leaves little scope for tax cuts beyond those that can be paid for by reasonable cuts from a budget of roughly $9.5 billion -- or by costly borrowing. Indeed, fiscal responsibility lost out to politics in Governor Rowland's proposal to keep the budget balanced with borrowed money while he cuts taxes. The Governor boasts that his plan cuts spending for the first time in decades -- symbolically significant, perhaps, but in dollar terms only $80 million. This is a two-year plan, and in the second year spending rises again, by twice that amount.
The political balance in Connecticut is the same as in New York; a Republican is now Governor, but control of the Legislature is split. Thus there is no certainty that Mr. Rowland can prevail. The heavy cuts he wants in welfare programs are particularly onerous. Some aid to local governments would be cut and compressed into block grants instead of specifically earmarked as aid payments, but this may hurt less than feared because he would also eliminate some state mandates. One smart innovation is an incentive -- more aid -- for communities that pool social services regionally.
The limited income tax reduction that Governor Rowland proposes would at least make the tax mildly progressive -- 4.5 percent at the top, 3 percent lower down. That's the right way to go. Repeal is the wrong way.

HEADLINE: Pressure Rises For N.A.A.C.P. To Oust Chief

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
With critics of William F. Gibson claiming that nearly half the board members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have turned against him, the group's former executive director, Benjamin L. Hooks, has added his voice to those who would like to see Dr. Gibson step down as chairman.
Mr. Hooks termed Dr. Gibson an "inept leader" who allowed the debt of the civil rights organization to soar. His comments, the first time he has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with Dr. Gibson's leadership, come at a time when the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization is $ 4.5 million in debt, faces an audit of its top officers' spending and is being torn apart by internal bickering. 
 Dr. Gibson is up for re-election as chairman of the 64-member board when it meets on Saturday in New York. He is being challenged by Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of the slain civil rights figure Medgar Evers.
Today, with both sides stepping up the pressure in the re-election battle, the organization was hit by a new lawsuit, this one by a former female employee of the organization who accused six current or former N.A.A.C.P. officials, including Dr. Gibson, of sexual harassment and sexual discrimination.
Stephanie Rones, a former lawyer in the N.A.A.C.P.'s legal department, claimed in a $ 2.8 million suit filed in District of Columbia Superior Court that she was passed over for promotions, that she was subjected to advances that ultimately led to sexual relations with an official in the organization and that she was unfairly dismissed.
Mr. Hooks, who retired as executive director in 1993, said Dr. Gibson allowed the debt of the civil rights organization to balloon during the 15-month tenure of Benjamin Chavis, Mr. Hook's successor.
Moreover, Mr. Hooks contended that Dr. Gibson presided over disastrous financial losses stemming from management of a Hollywood awards program sponsored by the N.A.A.C.P. The program, known as the Image Awards, was run by some of Dr. Gibson's closest associates on the board.
As a result, Mr. Hooks said, Dr. Gibson should be replaced even if charges of financial impropriety that have been leveled against the chairman prove unfounded.
"As far as I am concerned, if a chairman gets hold of the Image Awards and loses that much money, hires a Chavis and gives him no supervision and we go into that much debt, and has allowed all this to fester, you don't have to say that he has a defect in his moral character," Mr. Hooks said.
The lawsuit filed today is certain to add to the problems that have plagued the organization in recent months. No search has yet been started for a new executive director to replace Mr. Chavis, who was dismissed last August after being accused of financial mismanagement and sexual harassment.
Roger Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University and the nephew of Roy Wilkins, a former executive director of the organization. said, "My view is that if the board re-elects Gibson, then it is pretty close to sounding the death knell of the N.A.A.C.P."
Dr. Gibson's position on as chairman was dealt another blow this evening when it was announced that two candidates who oppose him were elected to the board as a result of balloting by the N.A.A.C.P. branches. The two were Julian Bond, a former board member, and Jesse Turner Jr., the son of the group's former treasuer.
Also re-elected to the board was Hazel Dukes, the former head of New York Off Track Betting Corp., whose term on the board had expired.
Ms. Dukes also filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in New York today asking that the election for board chairman not take place until an accounting firm retained to audit the spending of top N.A.A.C.P. officials is allowed to present at least a preliminary report to the board. A judge has scheduled a hearing on the matter Friday morning.
In October, the board voted to have an outside company conduct the audit, but the work had been delayed until recently because of lack of funds to pay for the work and, Dr. Gibson's critics charge, because he sought to limit the audit's scope.
This week Dr. Gibson's supporters said that since the company had been at work for such a short period, it would be allowed only to present a status report to the board and not provide any details concerning spending by top officials, including Dr. Gibson.
Dr. Gibson has been under fire since last August, when the columnist Carl Rowan said the organization's chairman had charged nearly $ 500,000 in airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, meals and other items on an American Express card provided by the N.A.A.C.P. since 1986.
In the same period Dr. Gibson also received nearly $ 300,000 in expense checks, according to Mr. Rowan. Inspection of some of the canceled checks indicate they were for "board travel and office expenses"
Mr. Hooks and other former N.A.A.C.P. officials said the checks to Dr. Gibson constituted a stipend that averaged about $ 3,000 a month. Although paying a monthly stipend to the organization's chairman has been a common practice, former officials said previous chairmen received far less than Dr. Gibson, and provided detailed accounting of how the money was spent.
Dr. Gibson has fought back. Today he announced that the organization had signed an agreement with Don Cornelius, the television producer, to put on the Image Awards show. The contract with Mr. Cornelius, a former producer of the show "Show Train," is being cited by Dr. Gibson's supporters as an example of his ability to raise money.
The chairman also sent a letter to all board members denying the charges that have been leveled against him and urging the board to support him.
But Dr. Gibson's effort was strained again today when Ms. Rones named him in her lawsuit. She also named Mr. Chavis; Earl Shinhoster, the acting executive director; Fred Rasheed, the acting deputy; Dennis C. Hayes, the group's general counsel, and Lewis Meyers, a former deputy director with whom Ms. Rones maintained that she had had a one-time sexual liaison.
In a telephone interview today, Mr. Myers said he knew nothing of the lawsuit but found the charges "scurrilous and defamatory." He denied having any sexual relationship with Ms. Rones and said he would be talking to a lawyer to explore the possibility of filing a countersuit charging her with libel.
The other officials named in the suit could not be reached for comment. But some current and former officials dismissed the accusations of Ms. Rones, saying that they thought her relationship with Mr. Myers was consentual and that she had expressed a desire last May to leave the organization to establish an institute on race and gender.
And the officials, including some who have been critical of the current leadership, questioned the timing of the lawsuit just days before the board meeting in New York.
Ms. Rones, a 37-year-old Georgetown Law School graduate who had worked for the Washington City Council before joining the N.A.A.C.P., charges that a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation existed in the organization's Baltimore headquarters. Inequalities there, her lawsuit contends, ranged from gross imbalances in pay between male and female employees to the creation of "an atmosphere in the workplace where it was considered permissible to take sexual advantage of women employees."
In an interview today, Ms. Rones said she had been considering leaving the organization at the time of her termination because she hoped to work on women's issues among blacks. "I was thinking of starting a separate organization, and I had talked to a couple of people about that."
Ms. Rones's lawsuit maintains that her job was terminated because of her outspokenness on women's issues and that at least one other staff member, Ann Taylor, of the N.A.A.C.P.'s economic development department, was also dismissed because of her views on women's rights.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 18, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about efforts to replace William F. Gibson as chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People misstated the name of a television program formerly produced by Don Cornelius, whom Mr. Gibson signed up to produce an awards ceremony. The program was "Soul Train," not "Show Train."

HEADLINE: Slash Welfare Benefits -- for Bureaucrats

BYLINE: By Steven Craig and James Taranto; Steven Craig, associate professor of economics at the University of Houston, conducted the 1992 study "A Report Card on State Spending" for City Journal. James Taranto is senior editor of the magazine.

 BODY:
Coming on top of Gov. George Pataki's proposed cuts in welfare and Medicaid, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's new budget, which calls for even more, has drawn predictable cries of outrage from advocates for the poor. With the state and city facing budget gaps in the billions of dollars, the Governor and Mayor have little choice. But even if they did, these cuts would be overdue.
Spending on aid to the poor, which accounts for more than a quarter of all government outlays in the state, is vastly disproportionate to that in other states. And the evidence shows that Albany and the city are spending neither wisely nor effectively. 
 In 1992, we published a study in City Journal showing that in 1989 Albany and local governments spent $1,401 for every man, woman and child in the state on four categories of low-income assistance: welfare (including Medicaid), housing, public hospitals and other health programs. This amount was well over twice the average spent by governments in the other 47 contiguous states and one-quarter more than the second-highest-spending state, Massachusetts, which has since embarked on aggressive welfare cuts.
In the welfare and Medicaid category alone, New York spent $795 for each resident, almost two and a half times the national average of $327. (More recent data show that although the gap between New York and other states has narrowed slightly, the study's basic findings still hold.)
Of course a state's expenditures vary in accordance with its economy, poverty rate and the amount of Federal aid it receives. But the 1992 study accounted for such differences in welfare and Medicaid spending. It was able to determine how much of New York's welfare spending was driven by forces beyond the control of Albany or City Hall: not just Federal aid and poverty but also demographic factors (like the percentage of female-headed households and college graduates) and economic conditions (like average income and cost of living). After all these adjustments, New York's state and local governments still spent $152 more for each resident on welfare and Medicaid than those of the average state. Add it all up, and that's $2.7 billion in welfare and Medicaid spending that we can explain only as a result of conscious policy choices in New York.
This extraordinarily high spending wouldn't be hard to justify if New York could boast of great strides in alleviating poverty and underclass pathologies. Sadly, no one has plausibly made such a claim.
More surprising, preliminary data for 1993 suggest that there's less to New York's generosity than meets the eye -- that its high spending is driven by inefficiency as much as compassion. New York's administrative costs for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main state-administered cash welfare program, are $1,285 for each recipient family each year, the highest in the nation. (The average state spending is $593.) Yet New York's average A.F.D.C. benefit -- the money that goes directly to poor families -- is lower than that in six other states, including California, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
These three states spend as much on administrative costs in a year as they do on one month's worth of benefits; in New York, a year's administrative costs equal two and a half months of benefits. Just cutting overhead to the equivalent of one month's benefits would save almost $335 million a year.
These administrative costs don't vanish into thin air: they pay the salaries of thousands of bureaucrats statewide. Therein lies a hint of why welfare politics in New York is so contentious. New York's welfare state supports not only the poor but also a vast cadre of administrators, advocates, social workers and executives of nonprofit organizations that are paid by the government to provide social services.
 Private social-service organizations alone employ 288,500 people statewide, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of such jobs grew rapidly even during the recession of the early 1990's, not because of a surge in charitable impulses but because private-sector contracting became the most politically expedient way to expand the welfare state.
Such cynicism notwithstanding, it is indisputable that New Yorkers have big hearts and deep misgivings about cutting help to the poor. But they can no longer afford a huge, inefficient welfare state. We must spend less, and we must spend it smarter.

Jones 2d ruled in Louisiana that the tobacco industry could be sued for punitive damages on accusations of addicting smokers. [Page 1.]
 
Reformulated gasoline is drawing consumer protests. The fuel is intended to cut smog and emissions of some carcinogens, but it costs more, and some drivers do not like its fumes. [37.]
 
Kevin D. Mitnick, accused of a computer crime spree, waived his right to a bond hearing; he will continue to be held in jail. [37.]
 
The United States trade deficit was the largest in seven years last year at more than $108 billion; deficits with Japan and China set records. The Clinton Administration conceded that the numbers looked disturbing, but said they reflected economic strength. [37.]
 
 
Companies
 
NBC, in a stunning reversal of its campaign against the Fox television network, agreed to cease its effort to deny Fox broadcast licenses in seven cities. In exchange, NBC said it had reached a potentially lucrative agreement with Fox's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, to have two NBC-owned cable channels distributed on Mr. Murdoch's Star Television system in Asia. [1.]
 
Motorola shares plunged $6.375, or 9.9 percent, in heavy trading after the company stunned Wall Street with the news that inventories of cellular phones were bulging. [37.]
 
A Pulitzer prize-winning editorial page editor is leaving The Philadelphia Daily News to take a similar post at The Star-Ledger in Newark. The editor, Rich Aregood, cited business pressures to cut editorial resources as the reason for his departure. [39.]
 
A $625 million transaction would create Italy's largest bank. Banca di Roma, Italy's second-largest bank, said it it would acquire control of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura. [39.]
 
Williams-Sonoma's stock tumbled $3 after analysts cut their earnings estimates for the company, whose holiday sales boom had made it the envy of the retail industry. The cost of handling the additional sales was $5 million more than expected. [39.]
 
London Fog's owners have been meeting with creditors of the troubled coat manufacturer to hammer out a restructuring plan to keep the company from filing for bankruptcy protection. [39.]
 
 
Markets
 
Stocks fell sharply on a "double-witching" day with traders' anxiety heightened by concern over Mexico's crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.98 points to 3,953.54. [37.]
 
Treasury prices showed little change after tracking the dollar through a holiday-shortened session. [47.]
 
The dollar plunged against most major currencies for a second straight day, hit by the strong German mark and worries over Mexico's financial stability. The dollar fell a full pfennig to 1.4802 marks, the lowest point in almost two-and-a-half years. [48.]
 
Gasoline prices rose, sending crude oil up on signs the Government will not allow states to stop selling clean-burning fuel. [48.]

HEADLINE: Ex-Mayor Returns From Prison Undaunted

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Fourteen years ago, a spirited young mayor named Gerald McCann began transforming the desolate waterfront in this working-class city into a blend of high-rise offices, condominiums and retail outlets. Today Mr. McCann's personal transformation took a significant turn, as he returned to his hometown after serving more than two years in Federal prison, where his aggressive win-at-all-costs approach to economic development ultimately landed him.
 Expressing an unswerving devotion to Jersey City and unbridled optimism about his own future, Mr. McCann, a 44-year-old Democrat, said he plans to become an integral part of the city's future -- perhaps even mayor again. "I would like to be the Mayor again," he said in an interview just 12 hours before his release from a Manhattan halfway house where he spent the last four months. "But that doesn't mean I currently have plans to run." . 
 Whether inspired by the recent political resurrection of Mayor Marion Barry in Washington, or simply committed to returning to the life he once knew, Mr. McCann is wasting little time reclaiming support among the 240,000 residents in this Hudson County city. (If he doesn't run for mayor, he might need backing anyway -- he also talked about running for the state legislature or Congress.)
 Right after his release today, he sat down to lunch with the president of the Hudson County Chamber of Commerce, Peter Murphy. And in the past two days, Mr. McCann says he has spoken by telephone with two congressmen from New Jersey and received notes and telephone calls from constituents wishing him well. "A lot of people are loyal to me, and that's something the Federal Government couldn't take away," says the former Mayor, who still proclaims his innocence. "Winning again would be the best revenge."
 However, some people -- including those in the state attorney general's office -- say that Mr. McCann can't seek office again because of the nature of the crimes he committed. Mr. McCann says his legal advisers disagree.
 Michael Chertoff, the former United States District Attorney who prosecuted Mr. McCann, expressed another kind of doubt about Mr. McCann's political future. "I believe the public is looking for integrity in elected politicians, and I trust that the people of Jersey City or any other jurisdiction will exercise their judgment accordingly," said Mr. Chertoff, who is now in private practice in Newark.
 In February 1992, three months after he was convicted of defrauding a now-defunct Florida savings and loan, a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling forced Mr. McCann from office.
 In the special election that followed, city residents took a sharp and surprising turn by electing Bret Schundler, a young, conservative Republican. Mr. Schundler's success, in a city where only 6 percent of the voters registered as Republicans, catapulted him onto the national stage. The fact that Mr. Schundler spends so much time carrying the Republican banner around the country rankles people like Eugene Napolitano, a construction worker who has spent all of his 54 years in Jersey City.
 Complaining that people "need an appointment" to see Mr. Schundler, he said: "Anybody could walk in and talk to McCann. People still like him for that."
 Indeed, as one of five children and the only one to attend college, Mr. McCann easily connected with Jersey City's working-class voters. In 1977, he won a seat on the City Council, and four years later, at age 31, he became Mayor.
 As he set about helping to transform the city's economy from manufacturing to services -- courting companies and pursuing Federal grants, Mr. McCann's brash and abrasive style sometimes offended others. For example, when the Colgate-Palmolive Company announced that it was closing its Jersey City operations, Mr. McCann won no points with workers who were displaced by the move. Instead of commiserating, he said the Colgate move was good for Jersey City because it would free valuable land for redevelopment.
 Soon, a joke made its way around town, recalls Robert Sacks, president of the Hudson County Taxpayers Association. "You know, cowboys shot from the hip in the old days," Mr. Sacks says. "Well, everyone in the community said that Gerry shot from the lip."
 Those loose lips helped sink Mr. McCann's re-election bid in 1985, but by then the groundwork for economic growth in the city was in place.
 Since 1980, some six million square feet of offices, 1,800 residences and a 1.2 million-square-foot shopping mall have been built in the waterfront redevelopment district. According to the Hudson County Improvement Authority, from 1982 until 1990, the number of jobs in the city increased by 17.3 percent. Over the same period, manufacturing jobs dropped by 38 percent, but the number of retail jobs increased by 27 percent, hotel jobs increased by 46 percent and in financial services the number of jobs jumped by 80 percent.
 "None of it would have happened without Gerry McCann," said Charles Simburg, chief executive officer of the Harborside Financial Center, a two million-square-foot office building developed during the late 80's. "He was Jersey City's greatest salesman."
 Before he regained the mayor's office in 1989, Mr. McCann tried to become a private developer and businessman. After failed bids to develop a sports arena in Scranton, Pa., and to buy a savings and loan in Jersey City, he entered a partnership to develop a marina at the Liberty State Park.
 In 1986, Mr. McCann's partner in the venture, a unit of Boca Raton-based Southern Floridabanc Savings and Loan, sent him $300,000 to develop a proposal for the marina. However, the government produced witnesses and documents showing that in little over a year Mr. McCann spent most of the money on lavish items, including rare coins and a leased Mercedes Benz. A proposal for the project was never submitted. As he did during his trial, Mr. McCann still contends that the money he spent was a pre-approved salary for his services.
 On the morning of Sept. 30, 1992, before he left for prison, Mr. McCann, who had separated from his wife, picked up his oldest daughter, Tara, 16. Driving her to school that day, he recalls, "was the worst of all the feelings I've had over this whole thing," he says. "My children were so upset. I worried how it was going to affect them."
 For the next three years Mr. McCann must visit his probation officer, remain drug free, receive permission to travel outside the state, and pay the government $170,000 to replace the assets of the failed savings and loan. He is working as an accountant and mortgage financier at DMS Financial Services, a small Jersey City company.
Mr. McCann was forced to sell his condominium, so he lives with his parents in the city's Greenville section. And once again, he is dating his wife. "The moment you get out" of prison, he said, "you forget all about it. It instantly becomes a blank spot. Like it never was there."

HEADLINE: LUMP-SUM GRANTS FOR NUTRITION AID PROPOSED BY G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
House Republicans today unveiled a bill that would scrap the national school lunch program and a separate Federal program that feeds pregnant women and preschool children, in favor of lump-sum grants to the states. But senior Republicans are balking at Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to do the same with food stamps.
The bill, drafted by Republican members of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, would give states vast new discretion to design their own food programs in place of the school lunch program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. 
 Under the bill, to be considered by the committee next week, children from low-income families would no longer be entitled to school meals subsidized by the Federal Government, and there would be no uniform national standards for the nutritional content of such meals. Further, there is no guarantee that the lump-sum payments, or block grants, would increase in hard times, when more people apply for food assistance of all kinds.
The changes, which go far beyond those once proposed by President Ronald Reagan, are described in draft legislation obtained today from Republican members of Congress.
Republicans said the new proposals would reduce the paperwork burden on local officials and permit them to feed more people at lower cost. But the proposals have stirred furious opposition from educators, from groups that combat hunger and from farmers who fear they would lose income.
Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, said, "School-based nutrition programs should be dropped from the welfare reform block grant." Robert J. Fersh, president of the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit anti-hunger group, said: "A block grant cannot keep up with the real needs of real people. It's almost impossible to devise a formula that responds to changing circumstances like population growth, recession, migration, unemployment and natural disasters."
The National Farmers Union said that spending on milk and other commodities would fall significantly if Congress approved the bill.
The proposals are part of an ambitious Republican effort to pare social welfare programs established during the last 60 years. The first step came when a House Ways and Means subcommittee voted on Wednesday to replace the main cash-assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, with a block grant, which states could use in any way they wanted to help poor people.
The Republican campaign manifesto, the Contract With America, also proposed to eliminate the individual entitlement to food stamps and replace it with a nutrition block grant. That proposal has found few supporters in either party.
Republicans on the Ways and Means subcommittee said repeatedly this week that there was no reason to worry about the end of the A.F.D.C. cash-assistance program because welfare recipients could still get food stamps. Now the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, and the chairman of its nutrition subcommittee, Bill Emerson of Missouri, are suggesting that the Federal Government should preserve food stamps as the ultimate safety net for low-income people.
In an interview last month, the chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, who is a former school superintendent, expressed grave doubts about creating a block grant for child nutrition programs. He said the Federal Government had a responsibility to insure proper use of Federal money for national purposes like child nutrition. But he came under intense pressure from Mr. Gingrich to fulfill his part of the Republican contract.
Under the plan unveiled today, the school lunch and breakfast programs would be consolidated into one block grant. WIC and other nutrition programs would be combined in another block grant.
States would be required to use at least 80 percent of the block-grant money for low-income people, particularly children, pregnant women and new mothers. Each state could define low income as it wanted, but the threshold could not be more than 85 percent above the poverty level. Under Census Bureau guidelines, a family of three was classified as poor if it had less than $11,817 of cash income last year.
Under the Republican proposal, legal immigrants would remain eligible for the food and nutrition programs, contrary to earlier plans in the party's contract.
The school lunch program, established in 1946 after the Government found evidence of malnutrition among military recruits, now serves more than 25 million children a day. Ten million are so poor they qualify for free meals. WIC serves 6.5 million women and children a month.
In September 1981, the Reagan Administration touched off a furor when it proposed nutrition standards that would have allowed schools to count ketchup and pickle relish as vegetables. Mr. Reagan withdrew the proposals three weeks later. The House Republican bill this year says simply that states must set "minimum nutritional requirements" based on the most recent research available.
An aide to Mr. Goodling said: "We trust the states. No school will serve hot dogs and potato chips every day."
The Republican bill would repeal the National School Lunch Act of 1946 and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and establish the two new block grants.
Money for the school lunch program and the school breakfast program would be combined in a new "school-based nutrition block grant," set at $6.5 billion in 1996. The amount could increase by a maximum of 4.5 percent a year, somewhat less than needed to keep pace with expected increases in food prices and the number of eligible children.
Initially, each state would get a portion of the block grant equal to its proportional share of current Federal spending on the school lunch and breakfast programs. But the formula would gradually change over five years to reward states that increased the number of meals served in schools.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who was head of the Food and Nutrition Service in the Carter Administration, said that formula "would shift large amounts of money from poor states to affluent states because it takes no account of whether a meal is served to a poor child or a middle-class child." At present, poor children get free meals, and the Federal subsidy, $1.90 for each lunch, is six times that for a child from a middle-income family.
The second block grant would be established to replace WIC and other programs that provide food to homeless children, to school-age children in the summer and to preschool children with working parents. The Republicans would earmark $4.5 billion for that grant next year.
States would have to file annual reports with data showing how they used the Federal money under both block grants.
Richard Rominger, the Acting Secretary of Agriculture, said, "The Administration opposes block grants for the nation's nutrition programs." By any measure, he said, these programs have contributed to significant gains in public health and nutrition.

The Dow Jones industrial average, which came tantalizingly close to 4,000 on Wednesday, went into sharp reverse yesterday, falling 33.98 points to close at 3,953.54.
 The Dow fell past not only its Thursday record of 3,987.52, but even past its Jan. 31, 1994, peak of 3,978.36. Even so, for the week, the Dow finished ahead by 14.47 points. 
 Traders cautioned that yesterday's performance was distorted by the expiration of two kinds of stock options, which prompts the huge volume and volatility known as the "double witching hour."
 In quarterly options expirations, traders are under enormous pressure to buy or sell in a use-it-or-lose-it clamor that typically flares at the beginning or end of the session.
 Such buying or selling pressure is often tied to options designed to mimic the action of the 30 blue-chip stocks of the Dow or stocks in the Standard & Poor's 100.
 But apart from such technical concerns, there were plenty of other reasons for traders to sell.
 The crisis in Mexico is being identified by a growing number of currency, bond and stock traders as a North American crisis that drags down the United States and Canada, as well, and leads foreigners to dump dollars.
 Lower values for a currency make foreigners uneasy about buying stocks or bonds priced in that currency. For example, the Dow has risen 3.11 percent this year in dollars, but because of the currency's weakness, its rise is only 0.85 percent when converted to Japanese yen, and it actually has a loss of 0.85 percent in German marks.
 Regardless of the state of the United States economy, possible deep recessions that may be imminent in Canada and Mexico are sure to hurt stock and bond prices in the United States, some analysts say.
 As the stock and bond markets were closing yesterday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz of Mexico were negotiating the details of the $20 billion federally backed portion of the Clinton Administration's $50 billion rescue package for Mexico. The balance comes from the International Monetary Fund and others.
 The Rubin-Ortiz talks seem likely to continue through the weekend, with the possibility of some joint announcements before trading opens on Tuesday. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday. The economic uncertainty over a three-day weekend is itself a damper on the market.
 "Nobody wants to be long on stocks over a weekend like this," said Todd Clark, managing director of equity trading at Mabon Securities. "It's like trader folklore."
 Hence the dash to sell in the last moments of trading yesterday. The Dow plunged nearly 26 points in the last 25 minutes.
 The other leading indexes also fell yesterday. The broader Standard & Poor's 500, which also set a record this week of 485.22 points, fell below its Feb. 2, 1994, record of 482, closing at 481.97, down 3.25 points.
 The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index closed at 786.97, down 6.34 points, even further away from its March 18, 1994, record of 803.93.
 Motorola, the most active stock at 19.7 million shares, also had the most striking fall, plunging 6 3/8, to 57 7/8, after the company said in the morning that unsold cellular telephones were piling up in its warehouses and that sales were slowing. Cellular telephones have largely accounted for Motorola's strong profits in recent years.
 White River, an investment adviser company, posted one of the day's stronger gains after it reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.27 a share after a loss of $1.45 in the comparable period a year earlier. The share price rose 3 3/8, to 33 1/8.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal with 354.6 million shares changing hands, about 6 percent more than this year's daily average of 333 million shares.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.44 points, to 261.83, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 913 to 1,240. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.08 point, to 447.60.
 In Tokyo, stocks closed higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 239.92 points, or 1.35 percent, to 18,020.51. But for the week, the Nikkei was down 270.84 points, or 1.5 percent.

HEADLINE: New Gas Arouses Grass-Roots Ire

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
When customers buy gasoline at the C-Store station in Louisville, Ky., they are asked to sign a petition opposing a cleaner-burning fuel that was introduced this year to reduce pollution in many smog-infested urban areas.
 "People are upset," Bob Fagin, who owns three gas stations in Louisville, said this week. "We've had hundreds sign. Customers are complaining about the price and the possibility that it's a health hazard." 
 The protests are not limited to Kentucky. Many drivers in other states are also complaining about the new fuel, known as reformulated gasoline. For one thing, it often costs 5 to 15 cents a gallon more than conventional gasoline. There are concerns that fuel economy may suffer. Some people say its fumes make them sick.
 The outcry over the new fuel has become so loud that all of Pennsylvania other than the Philadelphia region has withdrawn from the program. So have nine counties in New York, including the Albany and Buffalo areas. The Governor of Wisconsin has asked the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to allow the most heavily populated area of that state to escape the requirement until at least April. Politicians in New Jersey and several other states are being pressured by grass-roots protests aimed at curbing use of the new fuel.
 The reformulated gasoline -- intended to cut smog by a fifth and sharply reduce emissions of some toxic cancer-causing substances -- burns more thoroughly, evaporates more slowly and smells differently from the gasoline in use elsewhere.
 The new fuel uses oxygenates, or molecules that contain oxygen, aiding combustion and reducing pollution. It is not the same as oxygenated gasolines that have been used in winter months in some areas, including the New York City region. The reformulated gasoline is similiar to the winter fuel in its use of oxygenates, but the reformulated gasoline also uses less of some toxic substances like benzene.
 As of Jan. 1, it has been required in most of the Boston-New York-Washington megalopolis, extending south to Richmond and north to coastal Maine. It is also imposed in the Chicago region, including eastern Wisconsin and northwestern Indiana; the Louisville and Cincinnati areas in Kentucky; the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth urban areas, and the Los Angeles and San Diego regions.
 Some places within those boundaries, as well as other areas of the country, have a choice as to whether to use the costly new fuel as part of their efforts to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1990. Use of the fuel is mandated in some other regions with high pollution levels.
 The complaints against reformulated gasoline have taken the form of thousands of phone calls to hot lines set up by state environmental agencies, hundreds of call-ins to local radio talk shows and dozens of petition drives at gas stations.
 The grass-roots protest has caught the Environmental Protection Agency and most clean-air groups by surprise. In the past, they say, consumers have generally been willing to pay a little extra and accept modest inconveniences to help improve the environment.
 "My sense is that a lot of this has been caught up in the overall climate of anti-Washington, anti-big government," said Deborah Shprentz, an expert on the issue at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a prominent environmental group.
 The protest against reformulated gasoline comes as people in states from Maine to Texas to California are up in arms over other requirements of the Clean Air Act, including tougher vehicle inspections.
 The oil industry is worried about the backlash because it has spent about $14 billion in recent years to upgrade its refineries and distribution systems to produce reformulated gasoline, which is now sold to about 30 percent of the nation's motorists. The National Petroleum Council estimates that the extra cost of making and distributing the fuel is about 5.4 cents a gallon.
 Apart from the higher cost, a wave of health complaints in the Milwaukee area led Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin to ask the E.P.A. to suspend use of the new fuel until April so that its health effects could be studied further.
 In response, the E.P.A. Administrator, Carol M. Browner, deferred a decision, saying she would send experts to Milwaukee for a public meeting on Monday to discuss the issues. In a letter sent Thursday, Ms. Browner said that several previous health studies did not find "the types of reactions that people in Milwaukee have been experiencing."
 She added, "Nevertheless, I appreciate that some people may be sensitive to certain fuels or additives."
 Elsewhere, protests have been prompted by the higher prices for the new gasoline. "People are mad down here because of the price," said Donald Satterly, executive director of the Kentucky Gas Dealers Association, which has found that some motorists are driving to outlying rural areas where gasoline is less expensive. His group plans to present its petitions to Gov. Brereton C. Jones, who so far has supported the use of reformulated gasoline.
 Pressure from station owners and drivers is also a reason that former Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, who stepped down this year, allowed 28 counties to pull out of the program. The controversy has been fanned by fears that an additive in the new gasoline -- methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE -- may pose a health risk.
 Barry Grossman, who works at an employment agency in Plainsboro, N.J., has formed a protest group called Oxy Busters, which he says has gathered 10,000 signatures for a petition he hopes to present to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. He says he has received phone calls from hundreds of drivers complaining of headaches and nausea.
 Environmental and health groups are now responding with publicity campaigns defending the clean-air efforts, including the introduction of reformulated gasoline.
 "There has not been much said about why these programs have been put in and what the benefits are," said A. Blakeman Early, environmental consultant for the American Lung Association.
 Reformulated gasoline is the latest and most far-reaching of efforts -- begun in 1974 with the introduction of unleaded fuel -- to reduce the health-damaging consequences of burning gasoline. In 1988, oil companies began adding oxygenates to fuel sold in some particularly smoggy areas, to improve combustion and thereby cut emissions.
 The first major nationwide step was taken in November 1992 when 36 metropolitan areas in 15 states were required to begin using oxygenated gasoline in the winter. MTBE has been used along the East Coast to bolster the oxygen content of gasoline because it was cheaper than adding ethanol, a corn byproduct produced in the Midwest farm belt.
 Animal studies from the 1980's found no significant adverse effects from oxygenated gasoline that includes MTBE. But after it was introduced in Alaska and New Jersey in 1992, complaints about dizziness and nausea led to further research.
 The E.P.A., after reviewing the research, concluded that MTBE did not pose a serious health hazard and that it provided an overall benefit by reducing levels of carbon monoxide.
 "MTBE may cause certain side effects, such as nausea and headaches, for a limited number of people," said Richard Stapleton, a spokesman for the New York regional office of the E.P.A. "For the vast majority of people it does not even pose an irritant threat."
 In the New York City region, both New York and Connecticut will continue selling oxygenated fuels through April 30, at which point they plan to switch to reformulated gasoline in most areas. In New Jersey, Governor Whitman wants to switch from the oxygenated fuel, which uses a slightly higher level of MTBE's, on March 1. From then on, gas stations in the state would sell the reformulated gasoline.

HEADLINE: In the Middle: New York on $38,000 a Year -- A special report.;
Free From Want, but Just Getting By

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
Brenda, Amancio, Michelle and Amelia Irizarry are a family of four living in the Bronx, and at first glance, their lives seem to mirror the middle-class ideal.
Brenda heads the parents' association at the local middle school. Her husband, Amancio, bustles off to work early each morning. Their younger daughter, Amelia, 13, accents her jeans with Nikes and Timberland boots. Their older daughter, Michelle, 20, attends college and hopes to become a social worker. 
 But the Irizarrys have no savings. They rent an apartment, because they cannot afford to buy a home. The family has never taken a vacation trip together, or owned a new car. They go out to dinner at most once a year.
Sometimes Mrs. Irizarry wonders what would happen if there were an accident or death, and her family had to survive on even less.
The Irizarrys live on $38,000 a year, an income that places them in the financial middle of a city where the gap between rich and poor is among the widest in the nation. The median family income in New York, adjusted for inflation, is $41,600, based on 1990 census figures. But to be in the middle in New York City, as the Irizarrys' life attests, is not necessarily to have either the security or the comforts so often associated with being middle class.
"I think that the median in New York is probably at the low end of what you'd call the middle class," said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, who directs the Program for Applied Research at Queens College of the City University of New York.
Often it is the extraordinarily wealthy and the destitute who seem to define New York City. But the Irizarrys of Bainbridge Avenue are more typical, and for them life is neither glamorous nor miserable. But it does contain a kind of quiet drama nonetheless, with the modest triumphs and heartbreaks that define so many families who are on the cusp of hard times and of making it.
Mr. and Mrs. Irizarry have enjoyed a measure of success. They are better off than their parents were. But they have been unable to improve their fortunes beyond a modicum of comfort they achieved several years ago. In fact, they began slipping back after Mr. Irizarry was laid off by a company to which he had devoted much of his life.
Everyone in the Irizarry family works. Mrs. Irizarry, 41, brings in the most money, as an assistant teacher at a nearby day care center. Mr. Irizarry, 52, holds two jobs, stocking goods in a school kitchen by day and cleaning classrooms in another school by night. Michelle spends her evenings doing telephone surveys for a company in New Rochelle. And even Amelia sometimes sweeps floors at her middle school to earn pocket change.
Their household in the northwest Bronx, held together by the industry of the parents, is buoyed by the youthful dreams of the children. And the only real suspense for the Irizarrys is whether their daughters will realize their bittersweet aspirations to rise above their parents' lot.
"I don't want to live like this the rest of my life," Michelle said. "I feel sorry for my mother. I mean, they have morals and are trying to make it. But unless they hit the Lotto, this is how it's going to be the rest of their lives. And that's sad, to think that's it. This is as good as it's going to get."
 
The Parents
Constant Struggle For a Simple Life
 It was Sunday, and at last Amancio Irizarry had a day to rest. He turned on the TV in the kitchen, and prepared to fry codfish fritters and cook a pot of vegetable soup.
Mr. Irizarry looks younger than 52, with his burnished bronze skin and shock of white hair. As his wife, Brenda, headed out the door to the market, he boasted playfully about the lunch he was preparing and reminded her to pick up some bread.
They have been married 21 years. And though Mrs. Irizarry's dark brown hair is flecked with gray, she still has the laugh of a schoolgirl.
Mrs. Irizarry grew up poor, in the Walt Whitman housing project in Brooklyn. As an adult, she lived in relative comfort for a time when she and her husband made more than $50,000 a year. And during a two-year period when her husband was unemployed, she struggled to keep her family afloat.
"I know I'm not low income," Mrs. Irizarry said. "And I guess we have a car and that puts me ahead of someone who doesn't. But if I consider myself middle class it would be the lower bracket, because the lifestyle we have is very simple."
Mrs. Irizarry drove the family's 1984 Ford LTD, as every weekend, to Edwards Super Food Store. She perused the aisles, checking sale stickers and chuckling softly when she passed the fillet of sole ($9.49 a pound). "Not this week," she laughed, as she headed toward the chicken.
When she is not teaching at the Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center in the Bronx and doing volunteer work in her neighborhood, Mrs. Irizarry is often out hunting for bargains, trying to balance the desires and needs of a household that includes two young daughters.
She makes $21,000 a year, and her husband makes $17,000.
The family has a tight budget for predictable expenses: $675.85 a month for rent, $60 for electricity, $100 for the phone, $400 for groceries. They sometimes rely on their four credit cards, and are unable to save any money at all. So they have learned to cut corners, turning leftover steak into beef-fried rice, spending no more than $10 on any one Christmas gift.
Mrs. Irizarry's job provides health insurance. And the family pays only a $300 annual deductible -- giving them one less expense to worry about from month to month.
But there are always unexpected setbacks -- like Amelia's braces, which cost $3,400, or the burial of Mr. Irizarry's father, which cost $4,000.
Mrs. Irizarry said she has never had grandiose dreams. But she has had to modify even modest aspirations. Not so long ago, for instance, she and her husband considered buying a home. But they decided that a down payment and monthly mortgage were beyond their means. And Mrs. Irizarry's dream of finishing college is permanently on hold. They can barely afford to send Michelle to Kingsborough Community College, where the $2,100 in yearly tuition is low compared with private schools. Once the City University of New York was free. Now, Michelle gets $50 in state financial aid, which is little more than "a tease," Mrs. Irizarry said. Michelle had to take out a loan this school year, and Mrs. Irizarry once resorted to putting the tuition on her credit card.
"We didn't have a college fund for Michelle," she said. "You see commercials on television saying to start when the baby is born. But because of the unforeseen things that happen in life, it's impossible to save money."
 
The Home
Fewer Luxuries, Smaller Comforts
 The Irizarry's five-room apartment is filled with pets and small comforts. There are two unnamed finches roosting in the kitchen, and two family dogs, Polo and Champ. A VCR and stereo sit in the simply furnished living room, and Michelle has her own compact disk player.
Such conveniences have become more affordable and thus ubiquitous in American homes, but the larger luxuries, like a house and college education, have become harder to attain, making it difficult for many middle-class families to achieve the American dream. It often takes two people to make an income comparable to that brought home by one person a generation ago.
The median price for a home in the New York metropolitan area more than doubled between 1980 and 1990, to $168,600 from $69,600, according to the National Association of Realtors. The median family income in New York City rose only 20 percent during the same period.
The Irizarrys are "better off than their immigrant parents," John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center, said. "They're certainly solid in the middle as far as the numbers tell us, but they probably are not going to move much higher in the income distribution. And the question is, do their kids have a shot?"
One night recently, Mrs. Irizarry reflected on the economic ups and downs of her husband's life. During 15 years with Stewart Sandwiches, he worked his way up from driver to route supervisor. By the time he was laid off, he was making $30,000 a year. Now, after two years of searching for work, he has ended up mopping floors and stocking shelves.
"I think my husband deserved better, especially for a man of his experience and his capabilities," said Mrs. Irizarry. "But you do what you have to. He's no longer a supervisor. He's a food helper and a maintenance worker. And I don't think there's any disgrace in that. He's out there trying to make an honest living. The only thing I regret is he has to work so hard."
Mr. Irizarry is a proud man. Asked what he pines for, he says he has all that he ever wanted.
"I got my wife, I got my kids," he said. "I don't need no Porsche, no Lexus. I'm not into being a millionaire. I'm comfortable where I'm at. But If I can get it, I'll take it, like anybody else."
Still, when pressed, he admits there are a few pleasures he would not mind. He is a Vietnam veteran and would love to see Arlington National Cemetery. He'd like to go back to Puerto Rico and visit his birthplace for the first time in more than 20 years.
"I'd love to take a vacation and leave everything behind," he said. "I'd love to have a house."
Perhaps most of all, he wishes that his wife did not have to work outside the home. "I'd rather have her be at home," he said.
Still, he is doing better than his parents. When his family moved to New York City from Puerto Rico in 1952, his father found work in a hotel kitchen, and his mother worked as a seamstress. Together they brought home $58 a week.
"I have much more," he said. "We were dirt-poor and we only thought about survival day by day. That's why my motto is 'one day at a time.' "
He finds the good in most things. The family's apartment, where they have lived nearly 13 years, could use new wiring and better plumbing. The neighbors sometimes get a little rowdy. But he says he will not leave it, or New York City.
"I'm not moving," he said. "I sleep O.K. here."
 
The Children
Daughters Share Bittersweet Hopes
 When Amelia entered the sixth grade at Middle School 80, other children teased her because of what she wore, and the memory still stings. "They'll look at your sneakers, look at your face, and they'll remember your sneakers," said Amelia, now an eighth grader. "Some people don't tease you, but they make sure they make you jealous of what they've got. They know they're getting on your nerves. And they like it."
Amelia has felt her parents' financial struggles sharply. When her father was unemployed, she said, "every time the family had a conversation, it was always about money."
Last Christmas, she decided she wanted a part-time job. Now she sometimes earns $50 a week, helping her father sweep classrooms and doing chores for her grandfather on Saturdays.
Working is just one of the ways she tries to be a big girl; she also protects her mother. "I really don't talk to her about things I want," Amelia said. "She knows she can't get it for me. And I don't want to make her feel bad."
Michelle often thinks about all she does not have when she strolls down Fifth Avenue.
"Sometimes I'll see a Mercedes," she said. "And I always wonder, how it must feel to be that person's child."
She is not ashamed to admit that she is materialistic -- and impatient. "You want so much, but it takes so long to get it, and you feel like it's never going to happen."
When Michelle was attending the High School of Fashion Industries in Manhattan, she said, many of her friends' families were better off than hers. "I was at a point where I didn't want to bring people to my house," she said. "I go to other people's houses and see what they have, and it kind of burns me."
But Michelle has ambitions; she is determined to become a social worker and live in a beautiful apartment in Manhattan.
Her mother also has dreams -- of going back to college and finishing her degree, or perhaps buying a mobile home when she and her husband retire.
But if none of that happens, she said, reality is not so bad.
"There's an old movie, 'It's a Wonderful Life,' " she said. "I look at my life like that. The movie makes a point. That sometimes what you do have is a lot greater than what you don't."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened Last Year

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
The United States last year posted its largest overall trade deficit in seven years, more than $108 billion in goods and services, and set record deficits with Japan and China, the two countries that confront Washington with its most persistent trade problems.
 The Clinton Administration said that while the numbers looked disturbing -- the deficit widened 42 percent, or $32.4 billion -- they also reflected the underlying strength of the American economy. The fast-paced expansion in the United States sucked in a tremendous volume of imported computers, electrical machinery and clothing. That probably helped contain inflation at a time when American factories were running at nearly full speed. 
Most economists expect the trade gap to narrow this year, as the American economy slows and the economic recoveries in Japan and Europe accelerate. But there are worries that Mexico, while a smaller trading partner than Europe or Japan, will start contributing to the trade deficit next year because of its peso woes.
 The trade gap did close significantly in December, to $7.3 billion for the month from $10 billion in November.
 Still the figures underscore the challenges facing President Clinton as he presses his argument that an expansion of free trade, especially in Asia, will benefit American companies and workers. The numbers also seem likely to fuel criticism on Capitol Hill that two years of intensive trade talks with Tokyo -- talks that American officials say have given them a case of "Japan fatigue" -- have failed to affect the most politically sensitive figure in the relationship, the merchandise trade deficit with Japan.
 That statistic, which excludes trade in services, topped $65 billion last year, a historic high.
 Worldwide, the United States' merchandise trade deficit also set a record, at $166.3 billion, an increase of more than 25 percent from 1993. Exports of goods were a record $502.8 billion, up 10 percent, while imports climbed 13.5 percent, to $669.1 billion, according to the Commerce Department.
 Today's accounting of the nation's performance in international markets also provided further evidence that China is now posing trade quandaries for the United States of nearly Japan-like proportions. Providing American consumers with a growing supply of low-cost goods, China ran a surplus with the United States last year of $29.5 billion. That was an increase of nearly 30 percent from the previous year's figure.
 In many ways, the deficit with China is more troublesome than the one with Japan because it is growing so much faster, and because the gap between America's exports and imports is proportionately much larger. Trade problems with China could soon dwarf the two decades of economic confrontation with Japan.
 "There is a profound sense in which the China deficit is worse than the Japan deficit," C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, said today. "To even the accounts with Japan, our exports there have to grow twice as fast as our imports. In the case of China, they would have to grow four times as fast as imports. That is almost inconceivable."
 A reversal of that magnitude is particularly difficult to imagine given the wide range of trade barriers in China, some of which are the subject of tense negotiations that have been under way in Beijing since Wednesday.
 The talks are a last-minute attempt to avoid the imposition of $1 billion in trade sanctions next weekend as punishment for China's continued pirating of American software, compact disks and movies. But part of the talks center on Chinese restrictions that allow the importing of fewer than a dozen American movies each year -- cutting off a major American product. And the pirating of goods has spread to cars, Kellogg's cereals and razor blades, among other consumer items, costing American companies untold millions in lost sales.
 If today's figures had come out several years ago, when the United States' economy was in the doldrums and Japan's was booming, it undoubtedly would have caused a political uproar. But on Capitol Hill today, they were barely noticed. That nonchalance reflects a low American unemployment rate and the sense that few jobs are being lost to foreign trade.
 The change in attitude is particularly clear in the talk of American auto makers, who have always been the most vocal in calling for action against Japan. "They don't pose the threat they used to," Peter Pestillo, an executive vice president of Ford, said today. "I don't think the situation is worsening."
 While Detroit is satisfied that it can easily sell as many cars as it churns out, the numbers show that Japanese auto makers are continuing to increase sales to Americans. Measured by value, nearly $24 billion worth of new cars were imported from Japan last year, up from $21.5 billion in 1993. Exports of vehicles to Japan climbed to $1.7 billion last year from $982 million the year before.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Track Dollar, Falling a Bit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices showed little change yesterday after tracking the dollar through a shortened session.
 Bonds and the dollar "synchronized a little bit today," said Gerald Thunelius, who manages $1.5 billion in bonds at the Dreyfus Corporation "As the dollar strengthened, the bond market also strengthened." 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond slipped 5/32 of a percentage point, while its yield edged up to 7.58 percent, from 7.57 percent on Thursday.
 The Public Securities Association, the public debt industry's main trade group, recommended trading stop at 2 P.M. Markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.
 Bond prices slipped early in the session as the dollar weakened against major currencies on concern that fallout from the Mexican financial crisis would affect all North American markets, traders said. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated securities less attractive to international investors.
 "The dollar is tainted and is guilty by association with two other weak North American currencies," the Mexico peso and the Canadian dollar, said Tom Carpenter, chief economist at ASB Capital Management, a Washington firm with $6 billion in bonds. The Canadian dollar has fallen to about 71 United States cents from about 75 cents in September.
 Since Dec. 20, when Mexico devalued the peso to address a trade imbalance, the currency has lost more than 40 percent of its value in dollar terms.
 Yesterday, the dollar dropped one pfennig, to 1.4802 marks, after trading as low as 1.4770 marks, its lowest level against the German currency since October 1992.
 Despite the bond market's weakness yesterday, traders said it did not signal an end to a rally that has lowered yields from 8.16 percent on Nov. 7 on mounting confidence the Federal Reserve's seven interest rate increases since Feb. 4 of last year would be enough to subdue inflation. Yields on the 30-year bond, a sensitive barometer of inflation expectations, fell to 7.55 percent this week, the lowest since September.
 "The most important thing that's going on in the market is that people have taken the Fed out" of their projections, said Terrence Piggott, head trader at Daiwa Securities America. Instead of expecting a series of rapid rate increases, traders now expect the Fed will act "maybe once a quarter," he said.
 One sign that traders and investors grew more confident this week that the Fed had almost raised rates enough came from the yield spread between the note and the bond. The spread, up one basis point from yesterday at 55 basis points, had widened from 38 basis points last Friday. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the United States trade deficit narrowed more than expected in December, to $7.3 billion, even though it widened for the year.
 A reduction in imports could suggest brisk economic growth is slowing, reducing the risk that inflation will accelerate, some analysts said. "The U.S. economy is going to slow and start to pare this deficit," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Company International.
 Meanwhile, the University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment fell to 97.1, from 97.6 in January.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Takes Tumble Again On Concerns Over Mexico

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar plunged against most major currencies for the second day yesterday, hit by the strong German mark and worries over Mexico's financial stability.
 The dollar was beaten to lows against the mark not seen in almost two and a half years, falling a full pfennig, to 1.4802 marks. At the same time, it slipped to 97.4 yen, from 97.42 on Thursday. 
 Early in the day the dollar had had some rebound, leading to widespread speculation that there had been discreet central bank intervention to support it.
 "There might have been an official connection to the dollar's rise, but it was never confirmed," said Craig Larimer, head of international market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets.
 Some dealers attributed the dollar's early rebound to buying interest among large investment funds, and to an improved American trade picture. The Commerce Department reported that an expansion in exports pared the large trade deficit to $7.34 billion in December from $10.04 billion the previous month.
 America's large trade deficit has been of concern to foreign investors. A narrowing of the trade gap helps shore up the dollar by reducing the need for foreign capital.
 But the glowing trade report provided only a brief luster to the tarnished dollar because of lingering expectations that Mexico's peso devaluation will slow United States exports in coming months. Mexico accounts for roughly 10 percent of America's total exports, and trade makes up about 15 percent of gross domestic product.
 While questions over the unfinished loan package to Mexico continued to burden the dollar, a stronger peso helped stem the dollar's losses. The new Mexican peso ended sharply higher at 5.70 to the dollar, compared with 6.10 Thursday.
 "The market has calmed down for now," one trader said. "But if Mexico heats up, the dollar will sell off again."
 Once the dollar veered back toward its lows, dealers said a flood of buying interest from institutional to retail concerns seeking value helped to prop it up.
 Another day of losses in stocks and bonds also hindered the dollar's chances for advancement. "The market is watching stocks and bonds," a major bank dealer said. If those two markets sell off, we could see the dollar test new lows."
 The German mark also continued its advance against other European currencies, especially the Italian lira, British pound, French franc and Portuguese escudo.
 By late yesterday, the dollar had settled again near its lows. The pound gained on the dollar to $1.5820, from $1.5780 late Thursday. Against Canada's dollar, it slipped to $1.4028, from $1.4124 Thursday. In late New York trading the dollar had dropped to 1.2520 Swiss francs, from 1.2588 Swiss francs Thursday, and to 5.1520 French francs, from 5.1755 francs.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
For Mr. Buffett's Stocks, The Business Is the Key

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
DO you study the stock market? Do you puzzle over interest rates? Do you plumb the depths of modern portfolio theory?
 No doubt you hope to profit from your hard work. Well, here's some disturbing news. Warren E. Buffett, the investing phenomenon whose Omaha holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, was trading at yesterday's close at an eye-popping $23,450 a share, does none of these things. 
 Mr. Buffett has said, "As far as I am concerned, the stock market doesn't exist." He has said, "If Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan were to whisper to me what his monetary policy was going to be over the next two years, I wouldn't change a thing." He has even said, "Lethargy bordering on sloth remains the cornerstone of our investment style."
 What Mr. Buffett does with his time is look long and hard at the companies, the businesses, behind the stocks. Experts spend much time debating if he still hews to the "value," or bargain-hunting, approach of his mentor, Benjamin Graham. But for Mr. Buffett, whose company has had compounded average annual returns of 23.2 percent from 1965 through 1993, that issue is off the point. "The nine most important words ever written about investing," he has said, are Graham's adage, "Investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike."
 But what does that phrase mean? Drooling investors want to know.
 "The Warren Buffett Way," a best seller written by Robert G. Hagstrom Jr., a Philadelphia money manager, and published by John Wiley & Sons, describes well how Mr. Buffett grades businesses. The highest marks, Mr. Hagstrom writes, go to managers who put shareholders first when allocating capital.
 Managers with good rates of return should plow cash back into their companies to get more good returns, Mr. Buffett believes. But if returns are average or worse, reinvestment makes no sense. Even though companies may hope that their luck will turn or that an acquisition will make the difference, he says, most underperformers should return extra cash to shareholders, who can then seek higher returns elsewhere. Managers who do so, through increased dividends or stock buybacks, tend to be low on ego and high on shareholder interests, he believes.
 Berkshire Hathaway has invested in many such enterprises. A hallmark of its holdings are companies that have done stock buybacks, reducing the shares outstanding and raising their value. Capital Cities/ABC, in which Berkshire has a $1.7 billion stake, bought back nearly 2 million of its 18 million outstanding shares between 1988 and 1992. Other Berkshire holdings that are big on buybacks are the Washington Post Company, Geico and the PNC Bank.
 Mr. Buffett also likes businesses that are shielded from competition and can earn higher profits. And these ventures include more than just his well-known brand holdings, like Coca-Cola and Gillette.
 Geico, for instance, has carved out an insurance franchise with a simple idea. It finds a group of statistically safe drivers -- like government employees -- and sells them auto insurance by mail. Using the mails cuts out agent commissions and makes low-priced policies possible, while the chosen pool of drivers keeps costly claims down. No insurer does exactly what Geico does, and Mr. Buffett knows it. The company is his third-largest holding.
 Then come low costs. Berkshire, with 11 employees and no legal or press offices, keeps overhead at less than 1 percent of operating earnings. If it was 10 percent, Mr. Buffett has said, returns would drop nine percentage points.
 Mr. Buffett's holdings are equally parsimonious. Even when Geico became the nation's seventh-largest insurer, Mr. Hagstrom says, its chief executive still shared a secretary with two other managers. And it "warmed my heart," Mr. Buffett said, to learn that executives at the H. H. Brown Shoe Company, another Berkshire holding, get a base salary of just $7,800 a year. The rest comes from profits -- if there are any.
 Mr. Buffett asks other business questions. Can the industry's earnings grow without great outlays? Are the managers impressive? And, of course, is the stock cheap?
 And is the business understandable? Despite high regard for Microsoft, Mr. Buffett avoids its stock because the field puzzles him. Ignorance, he says, increases danger.
 This belief is a departure from the common wisdom about stock diversification. Owning many different stocks -- good, bad and mediocre -- depresses the returns a more selective portfolio would achieve, he believes, and makes it impossible to understand all that you own. Thus, in 1987, his $2 billion portfolio had just three companies. Today, nearly $15 billion is spread among just 10.
 Mr. Buffett is not the only investor to recognize that the business behind a stock is the important factor in the long term. But he is rare in remaining deaf to the roars on Wall Street. He has no stock-quote machine in his office, and he describes the market as a slough of fear and greed untethered to corporate realities. As Mr. Hagstrom writes: "When Buffett invests, he sees a business. Most investors see only a stock price."

HEADLINE: Robert Clancy, 80, Institute's Founder

 BODY:
Robert Clancy, an educator who was director of the Henry George School of Social Science from 1946 to 1970 and founder of the Henry George Institute, died on Feb. 9 in Jackson Heights Hospital in Queens. He was 80 and lived in Jackson Heights.
 The cause was colon cancer, said George L. Collins, the executive director of the Manhattan school. 
 Founded in 1932, the school teaches the economic and social philosophy of the 19th-century economist and philosopher Henry George, who saw land speculation as the scourge of the time and the cause of poverty and inequality.
 George argued that society, not the landowner, was responsible for the increase in land value, and that the increase should be taxed and thereby returned to society. He saw such a levy as the only tax necessary and, thus, was an early proponent of a single tax. George twice ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City in the late 1800's.
 Mr. Clancy expanded the school's role in adult education and through establishment of the institute set up a worldwide network of correspondence courses in subjects related to George's social and economic concepts. Students from more than 200 countries enrolled in courses.
 In 1952 he wrote a biography of the founder of the school, "A Seed Was Sown: The Life of Oscar Geiger." He was co-founder and chairman emeritus of the Council of Georgist Organizations, an international association of Georgist schools.
 He is survived by a sister, Norma Hempe of Massapequa, L.I.

HEADLINE: ON TENNIS;
The Business Decision Could Hurt the Business

BYLINE: By Robin Finn 

 BODY:
If the WTA Tour divined that it would save face, and local sponsors, by refusing a $10 million-plus offer from Tampax to become the new title sponsor of women's professional tennis, its hierarchy ought to think again.
 What the tour's chief executive officer, Anne Person Worcester, had considered a safe business decision, albeit a distinctly nonfeminist message about just how unenlightened the marketplace remains, appears to have backfired. "Now we're hearing that women are planning to boycott our tournaments because they're ticked off that we walked away from the Tampax deal," an unhappy tour executive said yesterday. 
 And perhaps that will hurt worse than any comedians' one-liners and male hecklers combined.
 But the WTA Tour, which began sponsorship negotiations last October with Tambrands Inc. after being turned down by Diet Coke and Diner's Club, is not retracting its position.
 "I stand by the decision," said Worcester, who insisted the rejection of Tampax as title sponsor for 1996-98 was grounded in economic reality, not backward thinking.
 "Women's tennis is at a critical juncture, and we approached 1995 with a single-mission statement, to increase our popularity and enhance our health and image on a global basis," said Worcester. "But our research told us we unfortunately would not be able to do that had we accepted this sponsor. We're a conservative sport with a high-profile sponsorship, and we've got to represent ourselves in 22 countries, not just this one."
 A spokesman for Tambrands, Bruce Garren, said the sponsorship negotiations had been preliminary at best. "We were in the very early stages when they told us they'd decided to take a different direction," said Garren, who noted that his company has previously been a sponsor for United States women's swimming and for track and field events as far afield as Russia.
 Worcester said a marketing survey conducted by her office revealed a 75 percent negative backlash from tennis officials, tournament directors, broadcasters, and marketing experts, all of whom thought that Tampax was an inappropriate and potentially damaging global sponsor. The disapproval was particularly strong in Asia, she said, where the tour holds 10 events.
 Martina Navratilova, president of the Tour's Players Association, recalled being asked to film a tampon commercial in Japan. "One stipulation from the manufacturer was that the woman in the advertisement not be Asian," said Navratilova.
 "I have mixed emotions about all of this," said Navratilova, for whom marketplace viability has long been a sore subject because of her being routinely blackballed because of her homosexuality. "On the one hand, you'd like to take a strong stand for a product whose integrity is unquestioned, not to mention that, unlike tobacco, it's a product we actually use. But even in the best of times, accepting and promoting this sponsorship would be iffy, and these are not the best of times."
 Navratilova said she was convinced that the presence of Tampax would have an adverse impact on local event sponsorships from which the tour derives its $35 million in yearly prize money. While various banks, car dealerships, and other local businesses seemed unconcerned about the presence of Virginia Slims cigarettes, the Philip Morris product synonymous with the birth of the circuit, feminine hygiene products were supposedly taboo.
 Advantage International, the agency that brought the Tampax deal to the WTA Tour, said Navratilova's opinion was a perfect example of the negative spin placed on the prospective deal by its competing agency, the International Management Group.
 "Anybody who talked to us last felt the deal was a positive step, and anybody who talked to I.M.G. last felt just the opposite," said Harlan Stone, an executive vice president at Advantage. "Martina had told us in November that she felt good about the deal; she said she didn't eat cheese, she didn't smoke, and she didn't drink soda, but finally, with Tampax, the tour had a sponsor whose product actually helped players perform 365 days a year."
 Instead of accepting a cutting-edge sponsor, the WTA Tour took what it assumed would be the path of least resistance, dismissed Advantage, and hired I.M.G., the same behemoth that last September attempted a hostile takeover of the tour and complicated the tour's sponsorship negotiations with Diner's Club, as its exclusive marketing agent. Where Tambrands guaranteed a $3 million investment even if public outcry wound up causing the deal to be squelched, I.M.G. has reportedly guaranteed $4 million if it fails to deliver a sponsor.
 "I.M.G. has put X millions on the table, and if they come back to us without a sponsor for 1996, they'll be obligated to write us a check," said Worcester, who reiterated that the decision not to take the Tambrands deal had nothing to do with I.M.G.'s proposal.
 I.M.G. seems to have the ear of everyone in the women's tennis business except its own clients, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati, whose continuing absence is one of the reasons selling the sponsorship has been so difficult.
 "We don't have anything up our sleeve, and believe me, I wish we had a sponsor waiting in the wings," said Bob Kain, I.M.G.'s senior executive vice president. "But we have a real stake in women's tennis, and we want to see the sport thrive even if we have to go into the red at first to do it."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Fiscal Plan Puts Health Care Jobs at Risk

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
By calling for huge cuts in Medicaid and social service programs, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to reduce city spending by $1.3 billion is likely to lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the health care industry, the segment of the New York City economy that has been the strongest source of job growth for more than a decade.
In an interview, David R. Rubenstein, assistant director of the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget, estimated that Medicaid cuts alone would lead to job reductions of 10,000 to 30,000 at hospitals, nursing homes, mental health clinics and other medical centers, and remove $1 billion a year in wages. 
 Since 295,000 people now work in New York City health care jobs, the loss could trim up to 10 percent of the industry's work force. But since health care has been adding about 10,000 jobs a year, Mr. Rubenstein said, the Medicaid cuts might mean a temporary halt in the industry's growth.
Still, the proposed Medicaid cuts would be combined with a sharp reduction in direct city spending in the Department of Social Services, which contracts out foster care and other services to hundreds of private organizations, which themselves employ thousands of workers. Under the Giuliani plan, its budget would be reduced by over $100 million beginning in the fiscal year that begins next July.
In announcing his financial blueprint, Mr. Giuliani said it would lead to a more vibrant economy -- and ultimately job growth -- as banks, advertising firms and other businesses gain confidence in the city's fiscal stability and expand. Hospitals, clinics and social service agencies, he and his advisers said, will be expected to do more with less government support.
"Health care needs may grow, but we can't supply them in the same expensive way," Mr. Rubenstein said. "The Mayor is saying that the choice is not there to continually tax to raise spending."
But the plan has provoked vehement opposition from union leaders and hospital executives, who say it will decimate an industry whose growth is vital to the economy as well as the social fabric of the nation's largest city.
"It's going to be catastrophic," said Dennis Rivera, president of Chapter 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, which has 117,000 members in New York state. He estimated that the Mayor's proposal, combined with a plan by Gov. George E. Pataki for even deeper Medicaid cuts, would lead to 100,000 health care job cuts in the state, 80,000 of them in New York City.
If the Governor's budget is adopted and all the elements of Mr. Giuliani's proposals are accepted, the city's health care industry could lose an estimated $5.4 billion. The city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates 11 public hospitals, would stand to lose more than $1 billion of its $3.4 billion budget.
Experts say it is impossible to predict how the burden of caring for poor people would be shifted, particularly at a time when AIDS, widespread drug abuse and an aging population continue to create demands for medical care and social services. Although many health care and social service workers say there are ways to improve efficiency, they maintain that the Mayor's plan would cut deep into the bone.
"This could almost force us to close up the shop," said Humberto L. Martinez, a psychiatrist and director of the South Bronx Mental Health Council, which provides counseling to over 1,600 patients a year suffering from drug addiction, alcoholism or mental illness. The proposed cutbacks would be a double blow to his organization, since 90 percent of its patients receive Medicaid reimbursements that would be cut, and it has several contracts with the city's Department of Mental Health, which would lose 4 percent of its $91.3 budget under the Mayor's plan.
Economists say the spillover of job loss in health care and social services is difficult to predict. At City Hall, Mr. Rubenstein said the ripples would be "minimal" compared to cutbacks in other, higher wage industries, where lost jobs mean deep reductions in consumer spending and income taxes.
Still, many experts say medical care and social services have a special role in New York City, because hospitals, mental health clinics and social service centers provide outposts of economic activity in poor neighborhoods.
And wherever they are situated, health and social service centers have provided entry-level employment to thousands of New Yorkers, replacing the garment makers and other manufacturers who had traditionally served as the point of entry into the city's workforce.
"The sad irony is that many of our employees are now going to go on Medicaid and welfare themselves," said Thomas O'Brien, executive director of the Family Care Services of Brooklyn and Queens, which employs 1,800 home care workers who aid sick and elderly Medicaid recipients in their homes.
Many experts outside City Hall applaud the effort to hold down Medicaid costs, saying that health care and social service organizations have grown inefficient, in part because of the relative largess of Medicaid subsidies to New York patients. They maintain that the cuts proposed by the Mayor and the Governor reflect the national campaign to contain medical costs.
"At a time when most of the economy is being forced to become more efficient, these not-for-profit medical and social service folks will have to do the same thing," said Emmanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University. Health and social service industries "should have prepared for radical changes, but they didn't," he added.
As Mayor Giuliani has said repeatedly since announcing his plan for Medicaid cuts, the average reimbursement of patients in the state is higher than in any other state.
Still, whatever the potential long-term benefits of his cuts, there is little dispute over the potential short-term impact on jobs.
"The Mayor is saying that one of the major engines of growth of the last decade is about to konk out," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
He said New York City health care employment had grown by 102,500 since 1980, to 295,300 at the end of last year. The most rapid growth has been since 1988, when overall employment in the city has sunk by 30,000 jobs, and when health care jobs grew by just over 50,000.
Social services, although a smaller sector of the city economy, has grown more rapidly. Since 1980, the number of social service jobs has soared to 148,000 from 66,000, according to Federal figures.
Mayor Giuliani's advisers offer little hope that other industries will pick up the slack. Indeed, in announcing his cuts, the Mayor released a grim economic analysis that concluded that job growth in the city would be far less vigorous than elsewhere in the country.
As a result, even as the mayor predicts that his spending cuts will revitalize the economy, his financial plan forecasts that job growth in the city will not exceed 1 percent a year in each of the next four years, a pace less than half that of the nation.

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
The corruption that pervades Indian society in THE GANJA COAST (Fawcett Columbine, $22.50) beggars the imagination -- unless you come prepared by "Season of the Monsoon," Paul Mann's powerful earlier novel about the decay of civil order and moral spine in Bombay. "Corruption is our biggest employer," according to one cynical civil servant. "It is the only part of the economy that works."
George Sansi, the half-Indian, half-English hero of this bold, seductive series, has resigned in disgust from the Bombay police to go into private law practice. But a veiled threat from his former boss sends Sansi undercover to Goa, a sybaritic haven for foreign hippies that is about to become an international free port. For all his experience in human degradation, Sansi is aghast to find the local cops up to their eyes in dope dealing, land grabbing and an exotic new racket involving fresh corpses. 
 "Sometimes India was too much and the coddled Western mind recoiled," writes Mr. Mann, who is English by birth, but who does not himself recoil. On the contrary, he sets astoundingly vivid scenes of a decadent city in the throes of life, the better to draw sharp, grim portraits of characters flirting with bizarre forms of death.
Specimens of New York's flawed humanity -- a low-down crowd that takes in two-bit politicians, mob flunkies, burned-out cops and various bums from the outer boroughs -- always get a fair hearing in Ken Gross's gritty crime novels. But in FULL BLOWN RAGE (Forge/Tom Doherty, $21), this magnanimous author has to do some fancy tap-dancing to find a redeeming quality in Eric Miller, who is running around the city deliberately passing on the AIDS virus.
This atypical serial killer was infected at the medical laboratory where he works, so you have to admit that he has a beef with the world. That's still not enough to sustain his warped but basically monochromatic character. As the author himself acknowledges, "The only truly distinctive thing about Eric Miller was his rage."
The suicide of a young female victim brings a police detective named Maggie Van Zandt into the case. This new protagonist is not as jaded as Jack Mann (the hard-bitten detective who keeps another procedural series by Mr. Gross in fighting shape), giving her a less jaundiced perspective and the possibility of a longer career on the force.
But for now, Maggie is still learning the ropes, and her case doesn't give the author much room to do what he does best: mining the humor and the pathos and, in some cases, the honor of underworld characters the rest of society has written off as pretty much beneath contempt.
Has anyone ever been able to read "Gulliver's Travels" without labeling his friends and foes as Yahoos, Houyhnhnms, Lilliputians or Brobdingnagians? Brian Herrick, the victim in Bartholomew Gill's witty literary mystery THE DEATH OF AN ARDENT BIBLIOPHILE (Morrow, $20), was not one to resist that temptation. The curator of Marsh's Library in Dublin and an idolater of Jonathan Swift, Herrick affected the writer's cutting tongue as well as his golden curls and 18th-century dress. "The moment he called me his 'gentle and reasonable Houyhnhnm,' " an archivist notes, "I should have known that the man was deranged."
Herrick made a point of emulating his hero's foibles as well as his intellect; but one seriously doubts that the Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral sat around naked in his conservatory, swilling whisky and casting exotic physical specimens in amateur porn videos. Before someone slipped a lethal poison into his Glenfinnan, the rogue librarian was even pilfering Swift's manuscripts for his own collection.
As he did in "The Death of a Joyce Scholar," another clever puzzle mystery for the brainy detective Peter McGarr, Mr. Gill knows how to have fun with books and bibliophiles. And unlike the abominable Herrick, the author finds cunning ways to work Swiftian literary themes without parroting, parodying or otherwise robbing the master satirist of his robust style.
Outcasts, outlaws and other dysfunctional types have a friend in Laurie R. King, whose first mystery, "A Grave Talent," took a sympathetic view of a child murderer. TO PLAY THE FOOL (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $21) extends this compassion to the bands of aimless wanderers who congregate in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
Kate Martinelli, the scrappy cop who keeps this new series honest and interesting, can't pick up a coherent clue from these people to the killing and cremation of a homeless man, known as John, and his dog, known as Theophilus. But she has a hunch that a beloved local character who calls himself Brother Erasmus knows more than he's saying -- and that is enigmatic enough, since he speaks only in biblical and literary quotations.
Through dogged police work and with some research assistance from accommodating souls at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Kate learns that the charismatic Erasmus is involved in a modern-day "fools movement" of people who cultivate their lunacy for subversive purposes.
Although Kate, her lover and her partner tend to talk in the same flat idiom, eccentric characters like Brother Erasmus and a philosophical bag lady named Beatrice express themselves in a much richer language. If these be fools, then pass out the caps and bells to the rest of us.
Self-serving political factions have weakened the stability of the state, perfidious advisers plot to undermine the nation's leader, and the barbarians are howling at the gate. No, it's not present-day Washington but ancient Egypt in the fifth year of the reign of Tutankhamen. Lynda S. Robinson, who made spirited work of re-creating Theban court life in her first mystery, "Murder in the Place of Anubis," makes history live and breathe again in MURDER AT THE GOD'S GATE (Walker, $19.95) by exposing the ruthless rivalries among the boy Pharaoh's priests, courtiers and relatives.
Lord Meren, "the Eyes and Ears of Pharaoh," gets his first inkling that some treachery is afoot when one of his spies, a priest at the Temple of Amun, is shoved from the colossal statue of Tut that the young pup has presumptuously placed on the threshold of this sacred place. Because "the secrets of the temple are as hidden as the underworld," Meren must conduct his investigation in stealth. But when someone silences another priest by slipping a handful of cobras among his writing implements, the court detective suspects a conspiracy against the King himself.
Ms. Robinson is an archeologist by training and a storyteller by inclination. Using her scholarship to penetrate the inner precincts of court and temple, she has written a complex and exciting narrative that reflects the twisted machinations of politicians -- royal and otherwise.

HEADLINE: TOUGH TEXAN;
Phil Gramm

BYLINE: By Richard L. Berke; Richard L. Berke is the national political correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
YOU'RE GONNA BE AMAZED," boasts Senator Phil Gramm as the lights dim and he proceeds to demonstrate to a roomful of potential supporters on a recent Saturday in Columbia, S.C., how -- step by step -- he will win the Republican nomination for President of the United States.
The show, featuring colorful graphics flashing across a screen, might well be called Gramm the Invincible. It is meant to scare rivals into thinking they have no chance to catch up in fund raising and organization, and to convince Republicans that they had better join the juggernaut. 
 The barrage of figures is daunting, as intended: A green sack of money with a dollar sign pops on the screen as Gramm details precisely how he will raise $44,706,512 for the nomination. Then come the names of every person Gramm says he has met in the last four years. There are 164,454, including 62,359 in Iowa, site of the first caucuses a year from now, broken down by date, time and place. Punch in the names Jack and Patti Barnette of Marietta, Ga., on a computer and up flashes their photograph and a file that includes even their car phone number.
When Gramm declares his candidacy this week, he will be the first major contender to do so formally. But already, he argues gleefully if not presumptuously, the field is down to himself and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, because the logistical demands are so overwhelming that "there are probably not more than two campaigns that can do this."
It is an impressive, unapologetically raw display of political might that he takes around the country. And it leaves no doubt how a two-term Senator from Texas who is known as more bully than charmer, who looks more like a round-faced, stoop-shouldered Muppet than a stately public servant, has propelled himself into the top tier of Republican contenders, at least at this early stage. His motto is simple: "There's only one speed on my motor -- and that's all out."
But the qualities that make Gramm seem unstoppable have long aroused suspicion among his colleagues, Republican and Democratic, that could ultimately unhinge his quest to win over Republican primary voters. His unvarnished hustle and zest for savaging rivals is awe-inspiring to some; to others it is off-putting. He is a clear-headed man of ideas, but not of compassion. He has an undignified stridency that can make Bob Dole seem gentlemanly.
"Dole is in many ways more restrained, more measured," says former Senator Warren B. Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire who worked closely with the Texan on the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing bill in the 1980's and supports Dole. "He has a certain calmness that you don't find in Phil particularly. If you want to go one afternoon and relax, don't go with Phil Gramm."
From the earliest days of his political career, Gramm, 52, has been in a hurry -- and always in attack mode. In 1986, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was so outraged by Gramm depicting him as weak on the military that he scolded Gramm: "You're one year in the Senate, fella, you don't do that to another Senator."
The message didn't sink in. A year later, during the Supreme Court confirmation battle over Robert Bork, Gramm savagely cut off two opposing Democrats, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Joseph Biden of Delaware. Referring to accusations that they cheated as students, he snapped, "The American people know what the people who cheated in college think." Last summer, Gramm tore into Roger C. Altman, then the deputy treasury secretary, at Whitewater hearings, saying, "You didn't tell the truth."
This is a man who once sent a longtime foe, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat from Waco, a card that proclaimed, "I feel so sorry for your many problems, but you deserve them."
Braggadocio comes easily to Gramm. True to his professorial roots, he tends to lecture rather than talk. Gramm has perfected the art -- widely known on Capitol Hill as "Gramm-standing" -- of opposing a project for his state on the grounds of cost, then, after the project was approved over his objections, calling a news conference to take the credit.
Gramm delights in playing the bad boy. "One of the problems today is we have a President who wants desperately to be loved," he says. He once assured a dinner audience that he did have a heart, though. "I keep it in a quart jar on my desk."
The image that Gramm will stop at nothing to win is steeped in more than his mordant oratory. He has hired R. J. (Duke) Bodisch, a handgun-toting Texas police officer turned political consultant, to conduct campaign research. Gramm says Bodisch's assignment, for now, is to computerize clippings. But Bodisch says his role is to "look under rocks and see if anything's there" on Gramm's Republican rivals.
In the world of Presidential politics, where there is a premium on opportunism, arrogance and hunger for power and publicity, Gramm has those traits in abundance. But is it too much? Is he too calculating, too consumed, too ruthless -- too, well, mean to be elected President? John B. Connally, a former Texas Governor, learned that outspending his rivals in the 1980 primaries did not buy him the voters' affection. His $12 million netted only one delegate.
But maybe the public will again yearn for a no-nonsense leader. Maybe Gramm epitomizes a new political climate, in which the take-no-prisoners rhetoric of a Rush Limbaugh -- or a Phil Gramm -- are popular. "He's mean. But I like mean," Carmen McNew says after hearing Gramm speak at a cocktail reception for Louisiana Republicans in Baton Rouge.
Richard Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, dismisses the notion that personality matters. "Since when has meanness or niceness been one of the qualifications?" he asks. "Do I want him to be the godfather to my children? That's not how you evaluate a Presidential candidate."
Even harsh critics like Representative Jim Chapman, a Democrat from Sulphur Springs, Tex., speak admiringly of Gramm's political shrewdness. It will get him the Republican nomination, he predicts, but not the White House because "under the microscope and scrutiny that a serious Presidential contender gets, the meanness will ultimately come through."
PHIL GRAMM IS MORE complicated than the rabidly partisan, classic good ol' boy who looked oddly out of place during the State of the Union: Like a boisterous frat boy, he leapt from his seat to lead the hoots and hollers when President Clinton appropriated Republican language about shrinking Government.
Gramm failed the third, seventh and ninth grades yet became an economist with a Ph.D. and a Senator recognized as one of the brightest. Up north, his deep Southern drawl makes him sound like Gramm the cracker, unsophisticated, yet he is partial to Gilbert and Sullivan. His snarling facade masks a man who loves dogs, who in the divorce settlement with his first wife kept their two Saint Bernards.
Though he can be intimidating, Gramm has a disarming ability of serving up complicated proposals in a folksy manner. His trademark is the story of Dicky Flatt, a print-shop owner from Mexia, Tex., who struggles for a living and "never quite gets the ink off the end of his fingers." Before lawmakers vote for a program, he says, they should ask if "it's worth taking money away from Dicky Flatt."
Gramm, notably, is consistent in his beliefs. Two decades ago, in his first, failed Senate bid, Gramm sounded the identical themes about "the threats of uncontrollable Government" that he sounds today. He thinks he can beat Dole by presenting himself to the hard-right Republicans who vote in primaries as the only candidate who was "conservative before conservative was cool." Gramm tries to out-conservative Dole at every turn. Unlike Dole, he opposes welfare even for legal immigrants and favors a limit on additional benefits for welfare mothers who have more children. And Gramm parted company with Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to oppose Clinton's initial plan to support the peso, saying there were financial risks not addressed. He also takes a hard line against abortion and other social issues, though some religious conservatives worry that he is more committed to economic matters.
A sense of purpose, and great sense of himself, has allowed Gramm to be an influential, sometimes blaring, voice on issues that were not in the purview of his committees, as with his early ridicule of Clinton's health care proposal. When other Republicans were counseling compromise, he said the plan would pass over "my cold, dead political body."
Gramm says his ability to see things starkly comes from his mother, Florence, an 81-year-old retired practical nurse who has two other sons from a first marriage. She now lives just over the Georgia border in Phenix City, Ala. Don White, one of Gramm's half brothers, says her philosophy was: "Take a stand. Don't weasel. Everything was basically black and white. A guy was either honest or a crook."
As appealing as it may be compared with a President known for his waffling, Gramm's unwavering posture contributes to a perception that he is unduly rigid. Given his belief that the Gramm way is always the right way, he often is controlling and demanding.
"I certainly remember in the '84 campaign getting calls at 2 or 3 in the morning to the point that we moved our phone from my wife's side of the bed to my side," says John Weaver, a consultant on several Gramm campaigns.
On occasion, Gramm's power plays backfire. At last summer's Texas Republican Convention, he tried to have his handpicked candidate, Representative Joe Barton, installed as the state chairman. While both Barton and his opponent, Tom Pauken, were backed by religious conservatives, the rank-and-file resented the interference and chose Pauken, who says, "We don't want to be told from the top who ought to run the party."
Often, it seems, Gramm cannot help but meddle. Sitting back in his office surrounded by trophy footballs, R. C. Slocum, the Aggies football coach at Texas A & M University, allows how the Senator calls him after every game to register his critique. "He'll say, 'You know, coach, you know we weren't very good today on the offensive line,' " Slocum says. "He's got a real honest quality about him. That may not be a good trait for a politician, but where I come from they take a little pride in toughness."
WILLIAM PHILIP GRAMM'S feelings of superiority were apparent during his early years growing up in Columbus, Ga., where another future Republican rebel, Newt Gingrich, also attended high school. Gramm's half brother, Don White remembers that when the Senator was in grade school, he played the colonel in an Army of neighborhood kids. "The youngest kid, little Henry, went to my mother in tears, saying, 'I'm the only sergeant, and they're all colonels or captains.' So my mother said, 'I'll talk to the colonel,' " White recalls.
Young Gramm had a solution: He promoted Henry to lieutenant -- and himself to major general.
Gramm's independence arose from necessity. His father, Kenneth, a career Army sergeant who had been stationed at nearby Fort Benning, became partly paralyzed soon after Gramm was born because of a stroke and heart condition. He died when Gramm was 14. With her husband in and out of veterans hospitals, Florence Gramm worked double shifts to support the family, leaving White, five years older, to write checks, buy groceries and sign Gramm's report card.
Resisting both authority and schoolwork, Gramm preferred to cavort with friends. After Gramm took his mother's Plymouth on a joyride when he was 16, she dispatched him to the Georgia Military Academy.
He underwent a transformation there. "In the America I grew up in," he says in his stock campaign speech, "mothers' dreams don't die easily." He got degrees in economics at the University of Georgia. In 1963, when he was a 21-year-old bank teller by day and student by night, Gramm married a fellow student, Sherry Kinney. They divorced in 1969, two years after arriving at Texas A & M. Asked about the divorce, he clams up, saying, "It's personal." But, eager to stanch any notion that his past could haunt his ambitions, he adds, "I am certain she will support me for President."
Despite Gramm's compelling personal story, there are contradictions in it. For instance, Gramm succeeded in large part by the grace of Federal assistance but is now an outspoken critic of Government social programs. He defends himself, saying, "I've never said Government was all bad."
Then there is the draft. Gramm received deferments from serving in Vietnam. "As a 26-year-old Ph.D. in economics I could have quit my job at A & M and joined the Army," he said. "I would have probably ended up working in some library somewhere or maybe teaching at West Point or working in the Pentagon. But I thought what I was doing at Texas A & M was important." In fact, his first deferment was granted when Gramm was still in Georgia. That did not stop Gramm from vigorously campaigning on behalf of a fellow Republican against Chet Edwards in 1990, declaring that Edwards "didn't serve in the military and I don't know where he will run next." Gramm tells audiences that his father and brothers served. But there will be the inevitable comparisons with Dole, a hero of World War II.
TO UNDERSTAND WHY PHIL Gramm thinks he will be President is to understand his history of going after the impossible so relentlessly that, sooner or later, he gets what he wants. A case in point is how he courted his second wife, Wendy Lee Gramm, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with whom Gramm has two college-age sons. They met in 1969, when she was at a conference in Manhattan, interviewing for a job as an economics professor at Texas A & M, where he was already teaching. He sat quietly watching the interview and then ushered her out. "He gets my coat," she recalls, "he holds it on and he says in a very thick Southern accent, 'As a single member of the faculty, I'd be very interested in having you come to Texas A & M.' And I turn around and say, 'Oh, yuck!' " She got the job; the Gramms were married six weeks after she arrived at College Station. "He was very persistent," she says.
Charles Maurice, an A & M economics professor, recalls: "I thought he was pushing a little too hard at the time. This was a sophisticated girl. It's hard for you to imagine Phil being charming, but, doggone, he can be."
Gramm has always been in a hurry. He threw himself so single-mindedly into his work and his research that he was appointed A & M's youngest full professor at age 30.
Having conquered academics, Gramm tried politics -- and set his sights high. Then a conservative Democrat, he took on Senator Lloyd Bentsen in the 1976 primary. Democrats were aghast that Gramm did not wait his turn. But it was a pattern that would mark his career. Gramm went after Bentsen for running for the Senate while toying with a Presidential bid, saying he "so shamelessly put his own self-interest above those of his state and nation." (There is no talk from Gramm these days about the propriety of running for the Senate and President simultaneously, as Gramm plans to do in 1996.)
Gramm lost miserably, but he never stopped running. Two years later, he was elected to the House, where he quickly made a name for himself with proposals to balance the budget that would become his rallying cry. Gramm quit his seat in early 1983 after the Democrats ousted him from the Budget Committee, branding him a traitor for secretly scheming with Reagan Administration officials on a substitute budget plan. He ran for re-election eight weeks later, as a Republican, and won decisively.
The next year, he leaped at the opportunity to run for the seat held by Senator John Tower, who was retiring. He defeated his Democratic rival, Lloyd Doggett, after relentlessly attacking him for accepting a donation from a male strip show sponsored by gay men in San Antonio.
Unlike Jack Kemp, Dick Cheney and Dan Quayle, who spent years thinking about running for President but ultimately lacked the stomach for it, the race has been practically inevitable for Gramm. He has out-organized other contenders in states where Republican parties have held nonbinding straw polls. Gramm's biggest coup so far was getting elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 1990 to 1994. The post enabled him to travel the country on behalf of candidates, building contacts, and adding his name to the committee's statewide polls.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky had challenged Gramm for the Senatorial committee, accusing him of using it to further his Presidential aspirations. That is just what Gramm did; and he is unapologetic.
While there is little affection for Gramm among his colleagues, there is grudging respect. "I guess he proved me wrong," McConnell now says. "He was able to lead us back to the majority in the Senate and to promote himself for the Presidency."
HOLDING HIS HAND aloft to a volunteer driver after a campaign stop, Gramm concedes that sometimes the vaunted campaign machine can break down. "My little finger hurts all the time from shaking hands," he says. "I have to be very careful so I don't grimace."
Wendy Gramm may help soften her husband's image. Affable and engaging, she was not, however, featured prominently in the earliest campaigns out of fear among some advisers that her Korean-American descent might turn off voters.
But Gramm is undeterred. As his small chartered King Air prop plane jerked violently through tornado weather over South Carolina recently, the politician turned ashen, suggesting that he knew more about flying than the pilot. "Look at the altimeter!" he says, jabbing his finger toward the pilot. "They don't know how to fly these things."
The plane came to a bumpy landing and the pilot turned to apologize to Gramm. But the Senator was already opening the plane door, anxious to jump into the driving rain. Once again he was due to present his formula for victory to another group of Republicans, this time in Greenville.
The candidate who vows to outsmart, outpace and outspend his rivals did not want to be late.

HEADLINE: Stretching Your Money in Mexico

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR; SYLVIA NASAR is an economics reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
IF the Mexican peso stays near its current level it will cost a mere 19 cents on Presidents' Day vs. 29 cents last Thanksgiving.
Great news for potential travelers north of the border, you think. But while the cheaper peso boosts Americans' purchasing power dramatically in theory, actually reaping the benefits will require some planning, a bit of extra legwork and a willingness to go somewhere other than the large beach resorts. 
 The basic rule of thumb is that to get a bargain -- a 35 percent discount, in effect -- you have to pay in pesos. And many parts of a trip from the United States to Mexico automatically come with a dollar price tag: a round-trip ticket from your hometown (though some carriers have lowered fares because they can buy cheap fuel in pesos), a room at a big resort hotel, an all-inclusive package tour that wraps up meals, hotel and transportation, a stay at most spas with an international clientele.
"It all really depends on the kind of trip you're taking," says Kirk Whisler, publisher of Mexico Events and Destinations, a travel quarterly with a circulation of 100,000 in the United States and Canada. It is based in Escondido, Calif.
Outside the glitzy international resorts like Ixtapa or Cancun, anyone who has visited Mexico can tell you, most merchants, restaurateurs and innkeepers who cater to tourists' needs, even in Mexico City, charge in pesos.
So the key is to plan your trip to pay for the minimum (your air fare to and from Mexico) in dollars and the maximum (just about everything else from in-country flights to three-course dinners to dangly silver earrings) in pesos.
Here are some tips for seizing the peso's low moment:
 
Avoid prepaid packages. You won't get many breaks if you buy a package in the United States that includes air fare, hotel, ground transportation and meals, convenient as one-stop shopping may be. Tour operators haven't trimmed their dollar prices yet. And you'll only get a break on meals and purchases if you buy a package that includes just air fare and hotel.
"Package prices haven't gone down yet," said Richard A. Ellis, senior vice president of marketing for Lib/Go, parent company of Liberty Travel and Gogo Tours, America's biggest tour operator. "The business is being driven more by perception that it's cheaper than by reality."
He added, "But we'd expect many of our most popular packages to go down about 15 to 20 percent this summer."
Dolores Avelos, a spokeswoman for Camino Real Hotels and Resorts, a chain of 20 hotels clustered in Mexico's most popular beach resorts said, "We've always quoted the prices of our rooms and packages in dollars and we haven't changed the prices in dollars."
 
Pay in Pesos. Book the bulk of your nights at hotels and travel within Mexico and pay in pesos, including flights on Mexicana and Aeromexico. Doing so will save you $25 to $50 a night in a typical hotel in Mexico City, or $30 to $55 on round-trip flights from Mexico City to popular destinations like Oaxaca, Guadalajara or Merida. The fares to these places now range from $55 to $82.
Bud Mertens, a Californian retiree who flew to Guadalajara first, then Mexico City and is thinking about visiting some of the colonial cities next, is adopting this model.
"I've been to the beach resorts, but this time I wanted a more cultural experience. So when the news of the devaluation came it helped prompt the trip," he said.
Finding rooms and flights shouldn't be too taxing. Travel agents can be found at the airport or in the lobby of any large hotel. And you probably won't have to worry about finding a room. Mexico's economic crisis has hit leisure and business travel by Mexicans very hard and empty hotels and restaurants abound.
If, for the sake of convenience, you want to book a night or two in a hotel in Mexico City from home, doing so should cost about $75 to $125 a night.
 
Skip the hot spots. Travel experts call the top resorts -- Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Cozumel, Ixtapa -- dollar destinations for a reason. Half of all American travelers wind up there, prices are comparable to Miami's, and everything is so geared to dollars that Americans rarely have to change money into pesos.
Big resorts are also the places that will draw the biggest increase in travelers from the United States and elsewhere -- bookings are already up 18 percent this season, according to Mexican tourism officials -- and where peso prices of everything from cab rides to embroidered blouses will catch up the fastest. If you're wedded to the idea of staying at a big resort, consider Acapulco, which has increasingly become a destination for Mexican travelers.
 
Head for the hinterlands. Colonial cities within a few hours' drive of Mexico City -- San Miguel de Allende, Cuernavaca, Taxco, for example -- or a short plane ride -- Guadalajara, Merida or Oaxaca in the south -- are packed with small independent hotels, excellent restaurants and bountiful shopping opportunities. What makes them a bargain is that they are geared primarily to Mexicans. Except for a scattering of the big international chain hotels, they are cheaper than Mexico City, you pay in pesos and prices aren't apt to shoot up immediately to compensate for the cheaper currency.
"If they go to these places, Americans will get bargains," says Raul Feliz Ortiz, an economist at El Colegio de Mexico.
Take Cuernavaca, an airy Spanish town in the mountains an hour's drive from Mexico City and much favored by the capital's professional elite. The price of lodging at the luxury Las Mananitas Hotel ranges from 460 pesos (about $85 as of mid-February) for a standard double to 635 pesos ($123) for a midsized suite. At the Hacienda de Cortes, another small, independent hotel, the price of a double room is 314 pesos ($58).
Also consider San Miguel de Allende, three hours from Mexico City, a cobblestoned city with a church on every corner, often described as one of the prettiest in Mexico. The upscale Hotel de Sierra Nevada offers a standard double for 535 pesos a night ($99, $31 cheaper than if you booked the same room from the United States). And room prices at the simple Hotel Sautto, favored by art students, are even more modest, 90 pesos ($17) a night.
In most colonial cities, says Mr. Whisler of Mexico Events and Destinations, visitors should generally expect to pay $40 to $50 a night for a hotel room, on average, and $5 to $10 for a meal at such destinations. Many of the colonial cities specialize in one set of wares or another. In Oaxaca it's textiles, in Puebla pottery and, of course, in Taxco silver.
 
Use your credit card. Better restaurants and hotels and even Fonart shops, the state-run crafts stores, let you charge. Anything you charge goes on your card in pesos. Charging saves you the trouble of worrying about whether you're converting at the best rate. Of course, you're only getting the best rate that obtains when the card company records the transaction, which might be better or worse than the rate on the day of your purchase.
 
Change your money at the airport or at an A.T.M. Stop in at a Casa de Cambio right at the airport as you clear customs. You'll do far better than at your hotel or at home. A.T.M.'s, which can be hard to find, have good rates too.
 
Travel sooner, not later. Inflation could eat away at the savings, if you wait too far beyond the summer.
Prices in Mexico rose a full 5 percent in the month after the devaluation, suggesting that the Government's 19 percent inflation target for 1995 may prove too optimistic. Economists who have studied past devaluations in Latin America say that, on average, roughly half of the effects are offset within a year by higher domestic prices.
The good news is that the price increases tourists face may turn out to be more modest, says Mr. Feliz Ortiz. Many restaurants have agreed to abide by the Government's price freeze, he points out. More important, given the big drop in travel by Mexican vacationers and businessmen, most restaurants and hotels are eager to attract foreign travelers.
Even in Mexico City, recent travelers say, the overwhelming majority of hotels, restaurants, shops and taxis haven't raised prices much if at all. And, in smaller cities and towns, according to Mr. Cerda of La Mananitas, prices haven't yet budged. So, unless Mexico slides into hyperinflation, in which case all bets are off, the bargains could last well into the summer season and even until next winter.

HEADLINE: JAZZ VIEW;
A Small Club's Role as Arbiter of Hipness

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous 

 BODY:
FOR DECADES, THE VILLAGE Vanguard, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this week by giving itself a party, has been an important outpost in a continuing American cultural experiment. Unrepentantly partisan, it has glorified the homegrown and avoided pretension in its mission to frame the humor, poetry and music of what is sometimes called the street, defined as anything American, anything separate from the academy. And the party, which runs Tuesday through Sunday, explains where the club has been: Allen Ginsberg, Shirley Horn, Bobby Short, Dick Gregory, Pete Seeger and Professor Irwin Corey are all showing up to pay tribute and to perform.
That list -- and the staggering lineup of performers over the years, from Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen to John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk -- also suggests that the Vanguard, small, underground and unprepossesing, has been a witness to and participant in a startling transformation: the elevation of its esthetic from the marginal and hip to the mainstream. The Vanguard has been a shrine for what is good about this century, and the century has caught up with it. 
 Much of the credit belongs to the elfin Max Gordon, who started the club in 1935. Gordon ran what he called a "joint." But he was the consummate talent scout. And he was open-minded, mixing poetry readings with cabaret, jazz with folk music and comedy with everything. (Gordon himself could be funny; once, when two men with baguettes were holding mock military maneuvers in front of the club's door, he suggested that someone ask them if they needed butter.) The Vanguard was one of a handful of clubs in the Village that had a relationship to jazz, and one of an even smaller minority that had an eclectic booking policy. It was the prototypical Village bohemian club.
When Gordon opened the club's doors at 178 Seventh Avenue South, bohemia and the Village actually meant something, holding a special place in the intellectual history of the city and in the imagination of the country. Patrons usually came from the neighborhood, attracted by the spectacle as well as by the nonexistent cover charge. Gordon knew what people wanted to hear, and audiences also knew to trust his taste. Putting on special shows like Lenny Bruce and Roy Eldridge, or Professor Irwin Corey, Sylvia Syms and the Clarence Williams Trio, the Vanguard drew an audience of cognoscenti who were defining the culture of the city. New York was king, jazz was its music, and sophisticated humor and politics were the oil that ran its machinery.
In 1957, Gordon changed the booking policy, limiting it to jazz. Rock-and-roll was becoming the dominant popular music, but Gordon kept the Vanguard on the jazz path. It was home (and recording studio) to the likes of John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Gerry Mulligan, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley and Charles Mingus. All across the city, clubs folded, but the Vanguard thrived because of Gordon's exceptional sense of talent.
A list of just a few of the albums recorded at the club suggest why it is without equal. The saxophonist Sonny Rollins recorded "A Night at the Village Vanguard" there; the pianist Bill Evans, "Sunday at the Village Vanguard"; John Coltrane recorded several albums there, including "Live at the Village Vanguard," and the saxophonist Dexter Gordon celebrated his return from exile in Europe by recording "Homecoming, Live at the Vanguard." All these albums either influenced the course of jazz or had a significant impact on the careers of the artists.
The Vanguard was, and remains, the club that musicians who can fill concert halls come to to feel again an intimate connection with an audience. Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Wynton Marsalis, Dexter Gordon, Harry Connick Jr. and more have all spent weeks there when they could easily have opted for the concert hall.
Part of the attraction is the space itself. It's an odd room, shaped like a pie wedge. It has bad sight lines; the drummer usally sits behind a column, and nowhere in the club can one see the entire band. But it is the best-sounding club in the city, the Carnegie Hall of jazz clubs.
One of the great pleasures of the place is to wander around, to experiment with the sound; it's an exercise in sensuality, and regulars have their favorite spots. Back by the air conditioner the sound is as clear as a snow-fed mountain stream. Toward the bar it becomes thicker, richer. And to understand what really goes on during a set, one can sit in the last seat on the right-hand banquette, next to the drummer. It is there that one hears exactly what the musicians hear, every hiss and shudder, the drums responding to the feints of a horn player, all the rhythmic workings, the shades and colors -- everything that makes small group jazz thrilling.
The closeness to the musicians does more than allow audiences to understand the music; it also returns the music to a more democratic place. Musicians have to pass through the audience on their way back to their dressing room, formerly the club's legendary kitchen, often talking to patrons and shaking hands as they go. (The dressing room hasn't been used as a kitchen since sandwiches and hamburgers were prepared there until sometime in the late 1950's or early 1960s; like much of the Vanguard's history, specifics are obscured in the haze of cigarettes and liquor). The process of moving from the band stand to the audience makes the musicians approachable and real, in a way that's rarely seen in popular music. It's open and friendly as opposed to elitist and standoffish.
Home of debate and camaraderie, the kitchen itself is a place worthy of a doctoral dissertation. For years, musicians would come to listen to their peers and occasionally sit in on a third set late at night. The bandstand is a great lectern, but between sets -- or before or after them -- musicians congregated in the kitchen to discuss music, make plans, spread the news and joke around. Jazz musicians are usually busy, traveling constantly, and they rarely have a chance to talk shop with one another. The Vanguard's kitchen has always served as a meeting ground.
Entering the kitchen meant entering territory controlled by musicians; it was a nerve center of musicians' culture: funny, literate, a place of wisdom. To feel comfortable in it, one has to know the musicians. And it was the place that Thelonious Monk practiced the dance steps he used on stage.
Neither recessions nor changing tastes in jazz have affected the Vanguard's success, and the club seems to be doing better now than it did in the last decade. When Mr. Gordon died in 1989, the club was taken over by his wife, Lorraine, who has preserved her husband's vision while keeping the club afloat financially. Mrs. Gordon has not only regularly booked established musicians like Bobby Hutcherson, Charles McPherson, Cecil Taylor and Tommy Flanagan; she's also given top young musicians like Jacky Terrasson and Terence Blanchard their first weeklong engagements in an important club and provided a stage for jazz-related, avant-garde performers like the guitarist Bill Frisell and the clarinetist Don Byron.
She has also sustained her husband's adventurousness; for the last two years, for example, she has brought in a rhythm section of Kenny Barron, Buster Williams and Ben Riley for three weeks while changing the featured soloist with the band every week. Not all the adventures have been successful, but there are few club owners in New York as eager to experiment as she is.
And despite her openness to innovation, Mrs. Gordon has kept the club the most consistent jazz spot in New York. (She has also kept it uncorrupted, minimizing dependency on record-company handouts and turning down potentially lucrative licensing deals to set up Village Vanguards all over the world.) Such steadfastness has made the club a kind of shrine, and on any given night of the week one is likely to see tourists from farflung places, suffering various degrees of jet lag and sobriety, but all clearly happy to experience something that can only be experienced in one place, the Village Vanguard.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Back-Country Greenwich;
Winding Roads and Deep Pockets

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE farmers and shoemakers who settled the lonely northern reaches of Greenwich in the 18th and early 19th centuries would be astounded to see what has become of their neighborhood.
Renowned as one of America's most prestigious addresses, the back country of this Connecticut Gold Coast community is not for everyone who is rich. Families of highly placed executives who traditionally shun publicity gravitate to its silent woods and quiet, winding roads, while celebrities tend to prefer the waterfront and a livelier atmosphere. 
 As a recent example, the television and sports personalities Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford recently moved from the back country to a waterfront location.
The legendary great estates are investments that hold their value in recessions and appreciate when times are good. But other back-country homes are equally resilient, whether they are antique farmhouses expanded into handsome residences, large homes on the minimum four-acre lots, or modest houses in the Banksville section on the New York State border.
The term great estates is reserved for exceptional homes on the shore, in the mid-country and the back country. The latter covers an area bounded by the Merritt Parkway to the south, Westchester County to the west and north, and Stamford to the east.
Among the most famous of the back country's 13 great estates is Dunnellen Hall, currently owned by Leona and Harry Helmsley. Completed in 1918, it was built for Daniel Grey Reid, a New York financier, as a gift for his daughter, Rhea, and her husband, Henry J. Topping, son of the president of Republic Steel.
Situated at one time on 208 acres, the 28-room Elizabethan mansion had additional accommodations for 23 servants. The lake was stocked with perch and black bass, and there was an eight-car garage, stables, pool, tennis court, greenhouse, a working farm and specimen gardens.
It was used to advantage by the Toppings' sons, who entertained lavishly and enjoyed the company of movie stars. Don and Henry Jr. each married the actress Arlene Judge, at different times of course; Don was also married to Sonja Henie, and Henry Jr. was wed to Lana Turner.
It usually takes a year or more for estates to be sold because the market is obviously limited and the owners can afford to wait for the right buyer. The Nuckols Estate, for example, on 14 acres, is for sale at $18 million, the highest current price on the market.
"It is seldom shown," said Linda Hodge, vice president of Preferred Properties of Greenwich, a company that specializes in marketing high-priced homes. "The price reflects the value of scarce prime land close to New York," she said.
THERE are no restaurants or shops except in Banksville, where a tannery once served a shoemaking cottage industry. But the Uptown Deli and Finch's serve breakfast and lunch to people who work on the estates, and an IGA market, dry cleaner, pharmacy and hardware store are patronized by area residents.
There is also a general store on Round Hill Road opposite the firehouse. The firehouse, which is home base for about 20 volunteer firefighters, and its equipment are maintained by a $5,000 annual stipend from the town and major contributions from the wealthy residents it serves.
An open house fund-raiser is held there each October when children are given rides on the fire engines.
Brad Hvolbeck, owner of Prudential Hvolbeck Real Estate, sold a 3,800-square-foot house on one acre in Banksville this year for $525,000.
Almost half of back-country children attend private schools, two of which are located in the area. The Whitby Montessori School enrolls children from 1 year old through the eighth grade, with annual tuition ranging from $7,250 to $11,250. The Convent of the Sacred Heart accepts children of all faiths from age 3 through 12th grade. Tuition is $6,000 to $13,900.
The only public school in the area is Parkway Elementary School, where the curriculum includes art, music, science, physical education and a computer lab, all in separately equipped rooms.
CHILDREN maintain their own word-processing files and write stories that are published in the school newspaper or adapted into dance, drama, art or choral music. Almost 300 pupils in kindergarten through the fifth grade are bused for 15 to 40 minutes each way depending on where they live.
"They are not only from wealthy homes," said Dr. Sandra Mond, the principal, "but from families of stable grooms and housekeepers who live on the estates."
The Convent of the Sacred Heart is in the main house of what was once Overlook Farm, built in 1916. It is typical of several conversions of back-country estates in recent years. Together with zoning laws that allow homes to be built on 2-acre lots provided that 40 percent of the total property is dedicated to open space, conversions signal a significant departure from the otherwise rigidly enforced four-acre minimum single family zoning.
In the 70's the American Can Company bought Knob Hill Farm, built in 1916, retaining the main house as a guest house for its new corporate headquarters on the 154-acre King Street parcel.
Faircroft, completed on King Street in 1905 by James Rich Steers, whose construction company built Pennsylvania Station, was owned briefly by Clare Boothe Luce and expanded considerably in the 60's for AVCO Corporation headquarters.
It had a succession of office tenants over the years but has been vacant for two years partly because town zoning allows only 150 employees in the 90,000-square-foot building.
One of the subdivided estates is Conyers Farm, comprising 60 lots on 1,300 acres along North Street. Four homes are on the market through Mr. Hvolbeck. A colonial on 12 acres is listed at $3.35 million, and $8.2 million is the price of a Scottish-style castle, also on 12 acres. Building lots start at $1.2 million.
Conyers Manor -- once on the property, but demolished in the mid-80's -- was built in 1904 by Edmund Cogswell Converse. His farm was a highly profitable enterprise employing dozens of local people in its dairy, produce farm, stables, garages, orchards and stone quarries. The manor was subsequently demolished.
In 1981, the estate of Lewis Rosenstiel, the late chairman of Schenley's, sold the property to Peter Brandt who redeveloped the property into deed-restricted lots of a minimum of 10 acres, some of which have been purchased as horse farms.
Local zoning permits one horse for every half acre. Residents belong to a private association and have sole use of a luxurious clubhouse. In June, July and September there are Sunday afternoon polo matches that are open to the public for $20 a car.
Also under development on King Street, by John and Michael Fareri, is Chieftains, owned through two generations by the Gimbel department store family. It was built in 1911 and occupied until 1925 by Alfred Whitney Church, heir to the Borden milk fortune.
The 15,000-square-foot main house with its 65- by 40-foot living room will be retained as a single-family dwelling on three-plus acres; it is priced at $2.5 million and needs repairs. Several outbuildings will be remodeled as homes and 23 single-family homes will be constructed on the 97-acre tract, where 60 acres will be set aside for open space.
Sales are expected to begin in June; prices range from $975,000 for 2,300 square feet to $1.25 million for 3,600 square feet.
Last June a great estate was actually saved rather than subdivided when the estate of Herbert Mayer sold Old Mill Farm on 78 acres for $9.25 million to an undisclosed owner who registered the sale in the name of two trustees. The estate had a four-lot subdivision approved by the town in the event that it could not find a buyer for the entire property.
FAIRVIEW, Stanwich and Tamarack, three of Greenwich's seven private country clubs, are in the back country, offering golf, tennis, swimming pools and dining rooms. Initiation fees range from $10,000 to $15,000. Bruce Golf Course is public, operated by the town for seasonal memberships of $40 and greens fees of $12.50. Guests of residents may play for $25 a day.
Anyone who owns or has access to a horse may pay $90 a year to join the Riding and Trails Association, which maintains more than 150 miles of trails and must deal diplomatically with the occasional new resident who does not appreciate the time-honored custom of allowing horses to cross his or her property.
The golf course and the country clubs are part of some 5,453 acres of the back country preserved as open space and owned variously by the town, by land trusts, the Audubon Society, schools, the state or householders who dedicate land to conservation.
While public gatherings are rare, one event that draws even the most reclusive of residents is the Christmas Fair held in December in the Round Hill Community House.
"It started as a meeting place for people who worked on the estates," said Cindy Lalor, executive vice president of the 200-member, all-women Round Hill Community Guild. "Now the dominant tone is one of down-to-earth Yankee willingness to pitch in and work for the community, and be careful about money."

HEADLINE: For Suburban Homes, Modest Recovery

SERIES: Next week: The market in New York City

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
A RECOVERY that was reserved in most areas and robust in some reigned over the residential real estate market in the New York suburbs last year. Home sales surged in much of Connecticut and Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties and parts of Northern New Jersey -- but fell short of their mid-1980's peaks. Sale prices, in most places, were flat or rose only slightly, barely bouncing off the bottoms hit during the recession in the early 90's.
The increase in sales was sparked, largely, according to real estate brokers and housing analysts, by a slowly receding wave of young, first-time home-buyers, many of whom had been priced out of the market in the 80's. 
 Buyers were also spurred by rapidly rising interest rates -- which climbed last year more than two percentage points, or about $200 a month, for many $150,000 mortgages.
The lack of substantial appreciation, brokers believe, was linked, at least in part, to the large number of homes on the market.
"It wasn't like there was a lot of demand and no property available," said Charles M. Staro, executive vice president of the New York State Association of Realtors. "As long as you have the inventory, demand won't push up prices. It's when you have demand and you don't have the inventory that you get a bidding up in prices like in 1987."
The regional outlook for 1995, according to many brokers, lenders and housing analysts, is for home prices to rise slightly, in tandem with inflation; many economists are projecting that the Consumer Price Index will rise 3 to 3.5 percent this year after rising each of the past two years by 2.7 percent.
The price gains, however, are expected to come not so much from increased sales or consumer demand but thanks to higher interest rates, which have slowed construction of new housing and will help shrink inventories. There may be an increase in trade-up sales in 1995 -- and a decline in the starter home market -- which could lead to rising median sale prices in some surveys of the suburbs.
The overall number of homes sold in the suburbs in 1995 is expected to decline slightly from 1994 levels or remain about the same if the economy slows down, as many believe it will. The Federal Reserve Board's six interest rate increases in the last 12 months appear to have made borrowing expensive enough to discourage many potential home buyers, even if rates rise no further this year.
Some in the real estate industry also believe, perhaps optimistically, that mortgage rates could start to decline later this year in response to a weaker economy and subsiding fears of inflation.
"The market will be strong, but not as strong as the last two years," said Peter L. Mosca, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Realtors.
In 1994, sales of single-family homes were strongest on Long Island and in Westchester and Fairfield Counties; the number of homes sold in those areas rose 19 to 22 percent last year compared with 1993, despite an unusually cold winter in the first quarter that kept many home shoppers at home.
Many of the buyers that emerged in the spring and summer were baby boomers fleeing the urban frictions and public schools of New York City. Some of these new suburbanites have moved to affluent communities because they have children or are expecting to in the near future. Others, though, were simply tired of the bright lights of the big city.
"I wanted a backyard," said Joseph C. Maya, a 32-year-old lawyer who last November bought a $380,000 split-level home on one acre in Westport, Conn.
Mr. Maya and his wife, Susan, 28, a merchandiser for London Fog, had been living in a one-bedroom apartment at 87th Street and Lexington Avenue in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan.
"It was unbelievable," Mr. Maya said. "When we were looking, we were just blown away by how fast homes were going."
Mrs. Maya noted that they had originally singled out five other homes in the area to buy. "By the time we wanted to put in an offer, they weren't available," she said.
Home sales, however, were also strong in less expensive areas, like Bridgeport, Conn., where they rose by 13 percent, and in Hudson County, N.J., where they rose by 11.5 percent.
Real estate brokers and bankers attributed the increases in these areas to the continuing availability of relatively inexpensive homes, rising rents and a greater willingness among lenders to make loans to low-and moderate-income borrowers.
Mortgage rates, at least during the first half of the year, were also near 20-year lows, which helped make buying a home even more affordable.
"Prices have reached the low ebb," said Thomas E. Hylinski, senior vice president for residential lending at People's Bank in Bridgeport. "At the present, the ability to purchase a condominium unit or a single-family home at reasonable price and, in 1994, at very good interest rates, made it very affordable and comparable with renting."
"In 1994, people came to the conclusion that prices are not going down any more, and they are safe from any further depreciation in value," he added. "In the previous few years, people were afraid that prices would continue to go down."
Though pockets of strong appreciation -- 4 percent or more -- occurred throughout the region, with the exception of Suffolk County, on Long Island, the greatest increases were in Monmouth and Hudson Counties in New Jersey.
In a computer analysis of home-sale price trends in most of the New York suburbs, Case Shiller Weiss of Cambridge, Mass., found that the largest one-year increases for a typical single-family home, excluding condominiums and co-ops, occurred in ZIP codes in five New Jersey communities: Rumson, 11 percent; Long Branch, 10 percent; Jersey City, 10 percent; Eatontown, 8 percent and Holmdel, 8 percent. Further out, sale prices increases in the Princeton, N.J., zipcodes ranged from zero to 4 percent. (Increases of at least 4 percent also occurred in several other towns in Northern New Jersey, in Fairfield and Westchester Counties and along the North Shore of Long Island in Nassau County in places like Manhasset and Port Washington.)
Much of the strength in Monmouth County is attributed to a highly desirable quality of life of the area: It's bucolic in many places yet close to the Jersey Shore and Manhattan and the mansion-filled communities like Rumson are also more affordable than comparable communities like Greenwich, Conn. The area is also linked to Wall Street via high-speed commuter ferry in Highlands, N.J.
As for Jersey City, Jeff Kaplowitz, a vice president of Bardack Realty in Jersey City, noted that a 10 percent increase in sale prices may sound like a miniboom; in fact, he said, it represents less than a third of the estimated 35 percent that homes lost in value between 1988 and 1991. He added that it appeared that many of the areas that soared in value in the mid-80's and then plunged during the recession have the most to gain back in the 1990's.
"We are starting to inch ourselves back up," he said. "Will these increase keep up? Yes, but probably not by minimal amounts."
The greatest declines found in the study, however, also took place in New Jersey. In Paterson, the sale price of the typical home fell 4 or 5 percent, depending on the ZIP code, and in Bogota it dropped 5 percent. (Sale prices in some communities along the South Shore of Long Island, like Bay Shore, Brookhaven, Center Moriches, Mastic Beach and Lindenhurst, fell by at least 3 percent. In the Hamptons, prices depreciations in the Sag Harbor, Southhampton, Water Mill, Westhampton and Westhampton Beach zip codes all ranged from zero to 2 percent.)
"It's the old story -- location," Mr. Kaplowitz said. "Jersey City sits right on the PATH train and we have a symbiotic relationship with Manhattan. Paterson, on the other hand, is faurther away. They're not getting the bedroom community crowd and the back-office crowd."
The Case Shiller Weiss study compared sale price differences in pairs of similar homes in the same area that were resold at least once in 1993 and 1994.
The methodology is considered to be more reliable than calculating an area's median home sale price, which can be easily skewed but is, nonetheless, how home sale price data is often formulated.
Mr. Staro noted that one reason median sale price figures have been so negative in recent years was that a disproportionate number of sales were starter homes bought by first-time buyers, which has gradually pulled down the median sales prices in many areas. In previous years, he added, the median sale price may have been biased upward, toward more expensive properties, particularly in wealthier areas.
For the most part, though, there are few large disparities between median sale prices in 1994 as collected by local real estate boards and data computed by Case Shiller Weiss for the Times.
In Westchester, for example, the median price, according to the New York State Association of Realtors, fell 0.6 percent to $356,080 from $358,267. On Long Island, the median sale price fell 1.9 percent, to $177,383 from $180,739; the figures included sales from the Borough of Queens. In Rockland County, median sale prices increased 3.5 percent to $193,078 from $186,535.
Elsewhere, median sale prices dropped from 1 to 5 percent in much of Northern New Jersey, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors. Exceptions occurred in Bergen County, which increased 8.9 percent to $197,800 from $191,700, and in Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, in the rural northwest corner of the state, where price increases ranged from 2.8 to 3.8 percent.
In Connecticut, the median price of a home in Fairfield County fell 5.6 percent to $176,000 from $186,500, according to The Commercial Record, a newspaper in Hartford that publishes real estate data. Similar declines in median sale prices occurred in most of the rest of the state.
The declines in Fairfield County represented one of the few places where results from the Case Shiller Weiss survey differed substantially from the median sale prices. The variation can likely be attributed, in large part, to the abundance of low-end homes, particularly in Bridgeport, that sold in the county last year and pulled down the median sales price.
On a more regional basis, the Federal National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, and the the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., Freddie Mac, produce a home price index using a method similar to Case Shiller Weiss. The 1994 index shows that home prices in the mid-Atlantic -- New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- decreased last year by 0.5 percent and in New England, including Connecticut, by 1.1 percent. Over the last five years, prices in the mid-Atlantic region rose 3.2 percent and, in New England, fell by 9.8 percent.
Nationally, prices rose 3.6 percent last year and by 13.6 percent over the last five years, according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's two largest underwriters of mortgages.
"The West is expected to be the strongest area of the country, with the Northeast the weakest," said David Berson, an economist with Fannie Mae.
Price appreciation is an important statistic for home buyers and sellers, even more so than sales volume, which is closely followed by brokers and lawyers, who earn fees and commissions from transactions.
Changes in price, after all, measure the performance of a home as an investment. Generally speaking, when the annual appreciation of a house fails to keep up with inflation, a home often underperforms other types of investments -- even taking into consideration tax benefits, like deductible mortgage interest, and the high percentage of leverage inherent in most home loans, which, of course, can multiply losses as well as gains. In some cases, particularly where rents are low, a consistent lack of appreciation may even make renting and investing any savings in housing costs a better deal.
Few home owners or buyers seem to be checking home prices like the stock market, in sharp contrast to the 70's and 80's when double-digit increases -- as much as 30 percent in some years -- produced extraordinary returns and made many Americans wealthy.
"People should be looking at a home purchase for the service the housing provides and comparing the payments to what it costs to rent, factoring in the tax benefits and the psychic benefits," said David G. Hensley, a vice president and economist with Salomon Brothers in Manhattan.
"I wouldn't factor in substantial appreciation to that arithmetic, but I wouldn't expect the value of most homes to erode, either," he said. "Maybe they will keep up with the consumer price index some years -- and maybe not some years."
Mr. Mosca added that the market seemed to be resting in a period of relative normalcy following the boom of the 80's and the bust of the early 90's with price increases and interest rates at moderate levels.
 
 
 
HOW THE MAPS WERE PREPARED
 Data for these maps was based on a survey of 29,456 homes in the metropolitan area -- an average of 44 homes in each of 675 residential ZIP codes. Each home had been sold at least twice over the last 10 years. Half were resold in 1993; the rest were resold in 1994.
The yearly change is produced by comparing prices of homes that have been sold at least twice in the same area. If, for example, a home had sold in January 1980 for $100,000 and was resold in January 1990 for $200,000, the amount that it had appreciated from 1989 to 1990 would be derived by comparing the sale in 1980 and resale January 1989 of another home in the same area, excluding unusually high and low priced homes. The difference between the two resale prices would show the appreciation or depreciation.
To determine the price changes of homes in a specific location, the price differences between numerous pairs of homes in that area are combined using advanced statistical methods.
The statistical method used is the Case-Shiller Index, developed in the late 1980's by Karl E. Case and Robert E. Shiller, professors of economics at Wellesley and Yale, respectively.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Employees Vote to Remain;
General Motors Decides To Stay in G.M. Building

 BODY:
By now, a lot of New Yorkers are ready to scream, "Enough, already!" to the seemingly endless barrage of building name changes: Pan Am to Met Life, Burlington House to Alliance Capital Building, Helmsley Palace to plain old Palace, and so on. So those New Yorkers will be delighted to learn that 767 Fifth Avenue will, for the foreseeable future, remain the General Motors Building.
Against all expectations, the huge automobile company has signed a new lease for some 110,000 square feet in the building at 58th Street. But there's a catch: They are keeping only about 20,000 square feet of the space they have now. 
 Timing, it seems, is everything.
An executive at the Edward S. Gordon real estate firm who works closely with G.M. says that G.M. had talked of moving to Westchester, but had abandoned that scenario when the city offered some tax breaks to stay. But by this time the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges had already signed up for most of the space G.M. had been expected to vacate.
So G.M. scouted around for comparable space. It found it, on two of the floors that Kidder, Peabody was vacating at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, the former Exxon building at 50th Street. The Gordon executive, who refused to allow his name to be used, says G.M. was very close to signing a lease when word got out that Foote Cone & Belding, the advertising agency, was leaving 126,000 square feet of G.M. Building space to go to the Mobil Building, at 150 East 42d Street. Suddenly, G.M. could stay put if it wanted to.
The company insists it made its final decision in true democratic fashion.
"From an economic standpoint, the two deals were a wash, so we put it to an employee vote," said Toni Simonetti, a G.M. spokeswoman. The approximately 190 G.M. employees who work at 757 Fifth voted to stay where they were.
There's still a question mark surrounding the street-level showroom. G.M.'s lease on that expired on Jan. 15 and the company, thinking it was moving away, cleared out. For a time the Smithsonian Institution was planning to lease the space for a museum store, but that deal is on hold. Now G.M. has reopened talks, and may yet return its cars to the showroom.

HEADLINE: Two Who Cherish Symphony Orchestras

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
IN these days of MTV and rock music magazines, symphony orchestras remain curiously anonymous -- the object, it seems, of little curiosity. Yet for those who see behind the scenes, an orchestra -- for all its black-clad sameness at performances -- teems with color and personality.
Few people know this better than Stephen and Elaine Stamas, who between them have connections to much of the classical music played in the Northeast. Mr. Stamas is chairman of the board of the New York Philharmonic, a position he also holds at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont. Mrs. Stamas is an active board member of Hoff-Barthelson Music School here, and her brother, Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas, a Boston neurosurgeon, is president of the board of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. 
 The couple, who have lived in the Edgemont section of Scarsdale since 1962, have seen Kurt Masur dance a flamenco, have partied all night with Leonard Bernstein and have toured Russia with Zubin Mehta as Communism was crumbling. The magisterial Mr. Masur did "the most elegant, light-footed dance" in an impromptu performance in Madrid, when he was invited on stage by a flamenco dancer, Mrs. Stamas said. The couple have traveled to Europe, Asia and South America with the Philharmonic on yearly tours sponsored by Citibank.
Mr. Stamas, a tall man with a gentle smile, has held one of the music world's most demanding volunteer jobs for 10 years. He wears leadership gracefully, speaking of his work with the Philharmonic and of his former role as president of the board of overseers at Harvard University, his alma mater, as though everyone has such commitments. Mr. Stamas is also on the board of Rockefeller University and is a vice chairman of Lincoln Center. Mrs. Stamas is also a board member of Colby College in Maine, her alma mater, where she helped to establish a still-active singing group, the Colbyettes. Now retired as a vice president for public affairs of the Exxon Corporation, Mr. Stamas says he plays a limited role in Windcrest Partners, a private investment company in Manhattan.
One recent morning, as students flowed into Hoff-Barthelson to audition for the school's yearly Baroque Festival, which will take place from March 25 to April 2 in Hastings-on-Hudson and Scarsdale, the couple sat in a practice room here and talked about their life in music. Their connection with the school goes back 25 years, Mrs. Stamas said, to when it was housed on a hill in Edgemont. Both of the couple's children, Heidi and Ted, who are now in their 30's, studied the piano here. The Stamases, who will celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary in April, have an unusual punch line to their "how we met" story. "My father delivered him," said Mrs. Stamas, a trim blond woman, referring to her father's practice of medicine outside of Boston, where she grew up. Their families were acquainted -- both were of Greek heritage -- and Elaine and Stephen met as college students. Although both loved music, there was little to predict the role it would play in their marriage.
While his wife plays the piano and sings alto in the Westchester Choral Society, Mr. Stamas calls himself "the family member who listens," the one who can't carry a tune. He remembers hearing radio concerts by the New York Philharmonic as a child, and later going to hear the Boston Symphony play in Cambridge, although "my real love was the Boston Red Sox and Ted Williams," he said. It was during his 26 years at Exxon that Mr. Stamas became a champion of music and the arts. Under his leadership, Exxon began its sponsorship of what would become "Great Performances" as well as "Live From Lincoln Center." Exxon was also an early sponsor of the "MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour" and for 18 years sponsored radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic.
Mr. Stamas retired from the company in 1986, well before the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. But there were also difficult moments in the 1970's, when gasoline shortages led to long lines at service stations. Mr. Stamas recalled feeling "waves of disapproval" across Central Park, at an Exxon-sponsored concert in the park during that time.
 Exxon, which is now based near Dallas, supported the Philharmonic radio broadcasts until 1988. The orchestra has not yet found another sponsor for the broadcasts, which Mr. Stamas said now would cost "a couple of million" dollars a year. "One of my frustrations is that orchestras are going off radio because of the economics," he said. "It's a great irony that we have so many more technical capabilities with cable and satellite, but today's orchestras can't raise the money or get the air time."
He became president of the Philharmonic in late 1984 and chairman in 1989 and calls himself the orchestra's "chief day-to-day volunteer." He said the Philharmonic's $30 million budget was balanced again after a $2.4 million deficit in the 1991-92 season, and that the orchestra was also on firm artistic ground under the leadership of Mr. Masur and Deborah Borda, the group's executive director, both of whom he helped select. Now, he said, he is concerned about "ticket prices rising too fast" and excluding many interested people who can't afford them. "The burden falls on fund-raising" to balance the books, he said, an effort in which he and his wife take part. "I couldn't do the New York Philharmonic without Elaine," Mr. Stamas said. "She is a full partner. She knows the musicians and their families better than I do."
A measure of the couple's popularity is that when Hoff-Barthelson held its 50th anniversary gala at Manhattanville College in Purchase last October, 13 Philharmonic players -- many of them principals -- contributed their services for a concert. Eighty-four thousand dollars was raised that night for the school, a Hoff-Barthelson spokeswoman said.
The Stamases say they are not party people, but life in the symphonic stratosphere can get hectic. During one recent week, for example, the couple gave a dinner for Citibank officials and Philharmonic patrons, attended a private dinner at the Masurs and went to several concerts. Thursday nights during the season are reserved for Philharmonic concerts, when the Stamases visit the musicians beforehand and keep a watchful eye on the goings on at Avery Fisher Hall.
"You want to be there and demonstrate support," Mr. Stamas said. Whether on tour or at home, Mr. Stamas said, "We like to see the people around us admire our orchestra."

HEADLINE: A Japanese Gambler Hits the Jackpot With Softbank

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN he was trying to start his software distribution business in the early 1980's, Masayoshi Son rented a huge booth at a Japanese consumer electronics trade show and offered software companies free space to display their products. The booth was mobbed, but the retailers that attended the show dealt directly with the software manufacturers, bypassing Mr. Son, the middleman.
"I probably made back one-twentieth of the cost of the booth," Mr. Son told the Harvard Business Review a few years ago. "After that, many people were laughing at me. They said, That guy's really dumb. He's a nice guy, but dumb." 
 No one calls Mr. Son dumb now. They call him the Bill Gates of Japan. The 37-year-old entrepreneur has built his Tokyo-based company, the Softbank Corporation, into the leading distributor of software and a major publisher of computer magazines here, parlaying it all into a $1.5 billion personal fortune.
Last week, Mr. Son took another gamble on a trade show. Instead of renting a booth, his company agreed to pay $800 million for a business that operates 17 computer shows, including the giant Comdex, which last November had 2,200 booths.
The price raised eyebrows, with some analysts thinking Mr. Son, like so many Japanese businessmen before him, had paid too much for a trophy asset. But Mr. Son discounts that. "As one of the industry players," he says. "I know how important Comdex is."
Mr. Son plans to make himself a key player in the "infrastructure" of the personal computer business, not only in Japan but in America, which he views as the center of the global PC industry. The purchase of the Comdex business from the Interface Group and of the Ziff-Davis trade-show business, for $202 million, last fall are part of that plan.
"A year ago we had five employees in America," says Mr. Son. "Now we have 700, and by the end of the year we will have 1,200." Having made an unsuccessful bid to buy all of Ziff-Davis Publishing last year, Mr. Son allows that he eventually wants to enter the computer magazine business in the United States.
MR. SON is hailed as a rare example of an entrepreneur in Japan, which has had few of the start-ups like Apple and Microsoft that have been responsible for the success of the American computer industry.
For all the adulation, Softbank did not create something new as Apple or Microsoft did. It prospered by distributing products made by others, often American companies. "Bill Gates is a much bigger figure than I am," says Mr. Son, referring to the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, whom he knows well.
Still, the story of Mr. Son's rise from humble origins has become a legend here.
He was born in a small town on Japan's southern island of Kyushu. His grandparents had come from Korea and his parents were squatters. To try to avoid the discrimination that Koreans are subject to in Japan, Mr. Son's family adopted a Japanese last name, Yasumoto.
At age 16, he moved to the United States, enrolling as a sophomore at a California high school and beginning to use his real name. Later, while studying economics at the University of California at Berkeley, Mr. Son, with the help of some professors, invented an electronic translator that he sold to Sharp Corporation for about $1 million. He made another million by importing used video game machines from Japan, on credit, and installing them in dormitories and restaurants.
Mr. Son returned to Japan and decided to go into software distribution. Softbank, founded in 1981, has grown rapidly. In the fiscal year ending next month, the company expects revenues of about $900 million, up 40 percent from the previous year. Net profits are expected to double to $20 million.
Mr. Son took his company public on the over-the-counter market last summer. The stock, which peaked above 25,000 yen ($250) in October, has fallen steadily since then, in part because price wars are cutting software profit margins. The stock closed Friday at 15,000 yen, down 1,300 yen since the Comdex acquisition was announced Monday. Even so, Mr. Son's 70 percent stake in his company is worth $1.5 billion.
COMPUTER industry executives say Mr. Son is the consummate salesman. He is also doggedly passionate about his work. "I've never seen such an aggressive person before," says Takatoshi Matsumoto, who heads the Japanese arm of Cisco Systems, a maker of networking equipment based in San Jose, Calif. "He never gives up."
From 1983 through 1986, Mr. Son had to relinquish the presidency of the company when he was hospitalized with hepatitis. With a phone, fax and computer in his room, he says, he continued to give advice, returning to the helm after he recovered.
Mr. Son has entered into lucrative partnerships with American companies. Softbank owns about 20 percent of Novell Japan, the Japanese arm of the American leader in networking software. Mr. Son helped convince Fujitsu, Toshiba, NEC, Sony and Canon to invest in Novell Japan as well and to distribute the company's products.
He helped organize an even larger group of Japanese companies, including his own, to invest in Nihon Cisco Systems.
Mr. Son has had setbacks. A joint venture with Ross Perot's Perot Systems to provide systems integration in Japan was quietly disbanded because, he says, the market was not ready. A plan to distribute software on compact disks was shelved after retailers complained that Softbank would be competing with them. Last year, Mr. Son boldly predicted that a joint venture with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation to provide video on demand would gain 10 million customers by the year 2000. Mr. Son now concedes it will take 10 to 15 years to reach that level.
As with Mr. Gates, Mr. Son's success has provoked some envy within the Japanese computer industry. For his part, Mr. Son is reluctant to state the company's market share in the software distribution business -- it is thought to be about 50 percent -- because, he says, it is so large.
As for Comdex, Mr. Son dismissed criticisms that the show has grown too unwieldy and has passed its prime. Exhibit space of next November's show is already 90 percent booked and the business can be expanded by holding Comdex shows in Europe and Asia.
Mr. Son drives a Porsche but says his life style has remained simple. Other than an occasional game of golf (he shot a par 72 once last year), he spends most of his time on work. Married, with two daughters, Mr. Son became a Japanese citizen a few years ago because, he says, it made it easier to get through the immigration lines at Narita Airport. At first, the Japanese Government refused to accept his application, he recalls, because Son was not a Japanese name. Now it is a name recognized throughout Japan.

HEADLINE: How Washington Inc. Makes a Sale

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is 24 hours before a trade mission of two dozen top corporate executives and government officials departs for India, and inside the Commerce Department's sleek new "Advocacy Center," teams of trade specialists are wrestling with the biggest of the last-minute crises: Are India's top leaders ready to make the final concessions needed to close a billion-dollar deal that will allow a consortium of American firms, including Enron, General Electric and Bechtel, to build a giant new power plant just south of Bombay?
For 18 months, the Indian power-plant deal has floated near the top of the list of 100 or so big infrastructure projects around the world that the United States Government desperately wants American firms to win. It is the first of eight big power generation projects in India, and if the American consortium could close this one, it would create a precedent likely to give other American companies an advantage in billions of dollars of follow-on deals. 
 In years past, American officials would have offered some modest help, but only as a sideshow to bigger foreign policy concerns, from containing Communist influence in South Asia to keeping India and Pakistan from accelerating their nuclear arms race. But that was another era in American foreign policy, before the Commerce Department built what Jeffrey E. Garten, the undersecretary of commerce for international trade, calls "our economic war room."
From that Washington war room, the negotiators for the Enron Corporation, the lead bidder in the American consortium, have been shadowed and assisted by a startling array of Government agencies. In a carefully-planned assault, the State and Energy Departments pressed the firms' case. The American ambassador to India, Frank G. Wisner, constantly cajoled Indian officials. The Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, brought in delegations of other executives -- including some last week -- to make the point that more American investment is in the wings if the conditions are right.
To sweeten the pot, the Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation put together $400 million in financing. And working just behind the scenes, as it often does these days, was the Central Intelligence Agency, assessing the risks of the project and scoping out the the competitive strategies of Britain and other countries that want a big chunk of the Indian market.
The big push by Washington Inc. paid off last month when the Indian government awarded the power plant project to the American consortium.
After years of false starts, Washington is finally taking a solid crack at a sport long familiar to the Japanese and the Europeans: Commercial diplomacy. Not since the days when the American Navy was sent to open up trading ports in Japan and China -- a less subtle form of government advocacy for business -- has the United States made such a concerted effort to win deals for American companies.
"I for one was tired of seeing President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl travel the world representing their country's industry while we stood back and did nothing," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said recently. "Our attitude was "Good luck, let us know how it turned out."
Yet Washington's new approach has also generated new questions and policy conflicts for the Government. Should the United States be helping cigarette makers and nuclear power firms conquer foreign markets? Should it be sending trade missions to sell power equipment to China -- one such delegation arrived there yesterday -- while simultaneously threatening $1 billion in sanctions if China fails to adhere to copyright and patent conventions? And what are the limits to employing America's huge intelligence apparatus to bolster American business interests abroad?
Still, it is clear that economic imperatives have changed the dynamics of American foreign policy for good. The State Department, for example, now trains every American ambassador how to promote American businesses abroad. "There is a recognition now that promoting private investment and trade abroad is a primary interest of our policy," said Joan Spero, the former American Express executive who now serves as undersecretary of State for economic affairs. "That is a big conceptual change."
In Washington, of course, there is no instinct stronger than bureaucratic self-preservation, and that explains the movement as well. Arguing that you help create jobs is a favorite maneuver to avoid the budget knife. Senator Jesse Helms, the volatile Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hates foreign aid -- but he loves the profit-making O.P.I.C., which, along with the Export-Import Bank, has become a hot new instrument for exercising American influence in developing economies.
For the White House, aggressive advocacy of business interests is also a way to answer critics who argue that free trade is nice on paper, but a disaster in the global marketplace, where relationships, power politics and influence-peddling often determine who gets the deal. "The world's free trade rules don't work yet," said Mr. Garten, architect of the Administration's plan to focus on major "emerging markets" like China, Brazil and Indonesia. "Countries still award contracts for highly political reasons. And we are saying we can't wait for trade rules to unfold."
IT is Mr. Garten, perhaps the Administration's most articulate champion of the new age of foreign economic policy, who transformed a cramped room of a few bureaucrats charged with export promotion into the situation room for trade wars. But the headlines usually go to his boss, Mr. Brown, who never seems to travel anywhere without issuing a press release about the billions in contracts he is bringing home.
The Commerce Secretary's detractors say that many of the deals are cooked long before he lands. His boosters -- and there are many in business community -- argue that his Cabinet-level influence has helped sway foreign governments.
"The Commerce Department today is the most effective and proactive it has been in my business career," said Robert Eaton, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, which has worked with American officials for two years in a so-far unsuccessful effort gain China's approval for a joint venture to build minivans there. "And one reason is that Ron Brown is not bashful in asking for the order."
But it is Secretary Brown's same penchant for aggressive dealmaking that prompted the Justice Department last week, after months of allegations, to announce that it was beginning a deeper investigation of Mr. Brown's murky transactions with a number of business partners before and just after he became Commerce Secretary, including why he was paid $400,000 for his stake in a nearly worthless company in which he invested no money. Mr. Brown is always enthusiastic about talking about his export successes, but he declined an interview last week unless the reporter agreed not to make on-the-record inquiries about the business dealings now under investigation.
ETHICS questions aside, there is no doubt that under Mr. Brown the Commerce Department has radically changed the way it operates. For decades the department has represented American business interests abroad with the foreign commercial service and endless export programs, but it was always an effort short on staff, funds and political savvy.
It was during the Bush Administration that Washington slowly awakened to the reality that foreign governments were devoting far more resources to commercial competition abroad than Washington. Some of the numbers are stark: In Indonesia, one of the biggest of the emerging markets, Japan provides $2 billion a year in foreign aid, 20 times the American figure.
Searching for a way to respond, Congress created the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee in 1992 to fashion a unified command among 19 or so agencies that often fly in different directions.
"It was a terrific idea and piece of legislation," said Kenneth Brody, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs & Company, who is now chairman of the Export-Import Bank. "But when I asked what was going on to implement it, I was told pretty much nothing."
Now that committee and its spin-offs meet almost weekly, constantly revising a list of major projects around the world that have caught the attention of corporate executives, ambassadors, the C.I.A., or other agencies, and assessing American chances to win the business.
Often, as in the case of the Enron-led consortium's 695-megawatt project 120 miles south of Bombay, that means arm-twisting in foreign capitals to change the way nations do business. India will need a huge amount of power-generation in the next decade, and its officials realized that this would require a massive opening of the country's strictly-controlled market to allowing private capital to flow in.
Eventually, after a series of trips by American officials, India's leaders overcame objections from domestic industry and protectionists in its own Government, agreeing to issue guarantees that would protect the American investment. "This is the ball game these days -- complicated deals, endless details, lots of frustration, and big money," Mr. Garten said. "That's the future of foreign policy."
From the time it took office, the Clinton Administration made clear that the future of the C.I.A. -- to say nothing of the justification for much of its budget today -- lay in turning its resources to detailed, focused gathering of economic intelligence. Today, that is happening every day, with mixed success.
For years the agency has helped America's trade negotiators, providing day-to-day assessments -- sometimes right, sometimes wildly off-base -- about the strategies of countries sitting across the table. But in the last 18 months Mr. Garten and others have worked closely with the agency to focus its attentions on the Big Emerging Markets -- "BEMs" in Commerce-speak -- and the race to win contracts for the power plants and hospitals, the airplanes and the airports that will keep those countries booming.
"The agency has transformed itself tremendously," said Mr. Brody, "It is now able to provide very wide-ranging information, from the broad to the very specific."
STILL reeling from the Aldrich Ames scandal and trying to justify its role in the post-Cold War world, the intelligence community wants to redeem itself by showing economic sophistication. In his last report to the Senate before resigning last month as the C.I.A.'s director, R. James Woolsey described its economic mission in unusually specific terms, saying it is now assessing "whether nations are skirting the rules of international trade by using their intelligence services for industrial espionage, or exerting pressure to win contracts for their firms at the expense of American business and American jobs."
"This does not mean we are conducting economic espionage -- we are not in the business of spying for private firms," he said. "But it does mean that we bring these corrupt foreign practices to the attention of the White House and the State and Commerce Department, who then seek redress -- often successfully."
The most stark example, Government officials say, came last Spring, as Raytheon Corporation battled with Thomson CSF, a giant French electronics firm, for the right to lead a $1.4 billion project in the Amazon. It was a high-tech exporter's dream: The winner would set up a complex surveillance system, using radar, satellite imagery and computers to measure the health of the rainforest, catch illegal mining operations and detect drug trafficking. The lobbying was so intense that when Mr. Brown went to Brazil with a delegation of business executives he kept tripping over a French minister, making the opposing pitch.
As the competition reached a fever pitch, the C.I.A. came in with reports that the French were offering large bribes to Brazilian officials with influence over the decision. "This was really brazen under-the-table stuff, and we had to counter it," one senior government official familiar with the deal said. American officials made it clear to Brazil's leadership that they knew what was going on, and -- based partly on data the agency gathered -- matched France's financing terms.
President Clinton wrote a letter backing the American bid. The pressure worked. "This blew away the French," said one American official who was eager to cite the case as an example of the C.I.A.'s utility in the economic sphere.
That is not always the outcome, especially in places like China, where bribery is the norm, and American firms are caught between losing the business and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. One senior Administration official says he favors changing policy so that the United States would routinely leak evidence of bribery to the press, hoping to embarrass the offending Government. But that would also tip off American competitors, and drive the effort to influence contracts further underground.
AT least publicly, the agency has yet to talk about the limits of its growing economic mission. But it is bound to become a bigger issue in coming years, as tension rises with allies who are also competitors for billions in contracts. That tension is already evidence in Tokyo, where Japanese officials regularly -- though never on-the-record -- grumble about the activities of the C.I.A. station inside the American embassy, all the while denying that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the country's biggest trading houses perform the same roles.
At times, all the pressure in the world will not always work, as Chrysler has learned. For several years now it has been looking to expand its presence in China, beyond the production of its famed "Beijing Jeep," a car so popular that illicit factories are now producing cheap knockoffs.
The next big project for Chrysler is a chance to build minivans in Guangdong Province, the heart of China's southern industrial area. For the Chinese, though, the minivan project is not only a deal, it is potent political weapon. When Washington declared earlier this month that it would slap a billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods unless Beijing reached an accord to end the piracy of American compact disks, movies and software, the Chinese response was quick: Try it, and kiss your car project goodbye. And they have a real alternative: Mercedes-Benz, which is eager to become a force in the world's largest untapped car market.
Chrysler's deal nearly came to fruition last August, when Mr. Brown visited China following President Clinton's decision to de-link human rights concerns from the annual renewal of China's "most favored nation" trade benefits. It was a good trip -- save for complaints that Mr. Brown was insufficiently tough on human rights issues -- and he emerged with a commitment to expand China's purchases of McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
Meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, Mr. Brown raised the Chrysler deal explicitly. The Chinese seemed ready.
With Chrysler's Mr. Eaton along on the trip, Mr. Brown upped the ante, saying the deal should be closed before the Secretary's entourage left town. For a while that looked likely. But at the last minute the Chinese told Chrysler it would have to meet a series of new conditions: Better financing terms, and no language in the agreement that would limit China's right to export minivans to third countries, where it would compete with other Chrysler cars.
More disturbing to Chrysler, though, was China's demand that it must be free to copy the manufacturing technology broadly. Mr. Eaton, fearing his minivans would be copied and sold en masse, much like Microsoft's operating systems and Kenny G's compact disks, packed up and went home. Government help or not, it could be a long time before he's driving a Chinese minivan around Beijing.
 
 
 
LENDING A HAND
Some of the deals the Commerce Department helped broker.
 
Mission Energy and General Electric, Indonesia -- $2.6 billion
The two companies won a major contract to build a power generation plant last November. Commerce orchestrated American Government's efforts, worked with Indonesian Government to eliminate red tape, met with senior government ministers, and pushed for $500 million in Export-Import Bank financing.
 
McDonnell Douglas, China -- $1.6 billion
China chose McDonnell Douglas last November over rival aircraft makers to supply 20 commercial jets, seating about 110 passengers each. The company and China also enterred a joint venture to make 20 more planes. Commerce officials met with high-ranking Chinese ministers to push American bid.
 
Raytheon, Brazil -- $1.4 billion
Brazil agreed last July to purchase surveillance system for the Amazon Basin from Raytheon, beating out France's Thomson. The satellites, aircraft electronics and computers will track environmental threats like fires in the rain forest and illegal mining. Commerce lobbied Brazilian Government, cleared red tape and enlisted help of CIA.
 
General Railway Signal, Taiwan -- $65 million
Taipei bought railway signaling equipment from the Rochester, N.Y., company last May, which will be used in the Taiwanese city's new mass transit system. American officials pushed for the sale with Government ministers.
 
Teradyne, South Korea -- initial contract: $5.5 million
Teradyne, a small Boston company, had trouble trying to sell its semiconductor test equipment to Hyundai, a major South Korean conglomerate. The problem: Hyundai bought nearly all its chip test equipment from an entrenched Japanese supplier. But after Commerce officials met with senior Korean executives, Hyundai purchased $5.5 million worth of test equipment from Teradyne last July.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Refined Risk: A Bond Deal Offers 18.5%

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WOULD you lend money to a company that had gone broke twice before? What if the man running the company was being sued -- by his son -- for fraud?
Last week, Wall Street answered with a resounding "Yes." The Transamerican Refining Corporation raised $300 million by selling junk bonds with promised yields of 16.5 percent to 18.5 percent -- plus a bonus of stock in the company. "These interest rates have not been seen since the leveraged buyout frenzy of the late 1980's," said Max Holmes, Salomon Brothers' director of corporate bond research. 
 You can't get rates like that without risk, and this deal has plenty. Start with the borrower. Trans american is run by John R. Stanley, whose modus operandi is to borrow lots of money for a highly leveraged play in a very cyclical industry. If it works, great. If not, hello bankruptcy court. Twice before, in the 1970's and 1980's, Transamerican suffered that fate. The second one was brought on in part by troubles with an oil refinery the company built in Louisiana. Now the plans are to rebuild that refinery -- which was mothballed for a decade -- and equip it with the technology needed to process low-quality crude oil.
The second bankruptcy was a bit contentious, with the banks at one point trying to get Mr. Stanley kicked out of the company, although they later backed down. Now Mr. Stanley's son, William, alleges that during that bankruptcy a company he owned cut a deal that enabled it to profit greatly at the expense of Transamerican, and then sent most of the profits back to Dad. Transamerican is suing William for libel, slander and a variety of other things; William is suing to get the part ownership of Transamerican that he says his father promised in return for what Transamerican delicately calls the "Alleged Payments." It's a fine mess, one whose resolution could have a big impact on the company and its new bondholders.
The senior Mr. Stanley won't talk about his dispute with his son, but he is eager to talk about the refinery. It will be, he promises, a huge success, processing low-quality sour crude oil that will be in surplus while demand for refined products is soaring. Margins will more than triple from the levels expected this year. Long before these bonds have to be paid back, in 2002, Trans american Refining will have gone public or sold out to another company.
For that to happen, not only will the refinery have to work -- and avoid big cost overruns -- but margins for the entire industry will have to rise far above their current depressed levels and then stay there. Wall Street's doubtful view of that prospect can be seen from the depressed state of such refining stocks as Valero and Diamond Shamrock. Big money will be made in those stocks -- without the added risks of this deal -- even with much smaller margin increases than Mr. Stanley is forecasting.
Mr. Stanley's agreement to pay rates as high as 18.5 percent can be viewed as a sign of confidence, or of a willingness to gamble with other people's money. He says he isn't worried: "If I lose $200 million or $300 million, it won't affect the way I live."
Perhaps lower interest rates would have been available if failure seemed more daunting to Mr. Stanley. But if his career proves anything, it is that sometimes an entrepreneur can do well even when his creditors don't.

THE ECONOMY
 
A 4,000 Dow: Close, but No Banana Split
In the scheme of things, it makes not the slightest difference whether an arbitrary market gauge known as the Dow Jones industrial average stands at 3,999 or 4,000. The homeless, and the rich man's champagne, will be just as cold. But the folks with the pin-striped calculators care deeply about round numbers, and they were all atwitter last week when the Dow, after hemming and hawing for a year, neared the big Four-O-O-O. It came close just over a year ago, setting a record 3,978. But then came all those Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the debates over whether they were not enough or too much. But last week the tea leaves looked just right -- steadying rates, solid profits, safely slow economic growth -- and the Dow charged to a new record. Two in a row, actually -- but still short of 4,000 -- before thinking better of it on Friday and slipping 33 points. 

New York, N.Y., a Regular Town
Is New York just another city? In economic terms, it should be treated as such, Mayor Giuliani argued last week, in announcing huge spending cuts that will hit hard in education and social services. It can't keep being more generous than other cities, he insisted. If you enter "New York" and the numbers on a spreadsheet, that surely computes. But critics of his harsh cuts were quick to stress the city's specialness, its age-old generosity -- it's the home, remember, of that ultimate welcome mat, the Statue of Liberty. . . . And if New York's just another city, Mr. Giuliani is just another mayor.
 
Washington in Debt
And here's the tale of another city that hasn't balanced its books. Washington faces a $722 million deficit, so last week Moody's ruled that the city's bonds are no better than junk bonds -- which will make borrowing more costly. Mayor Marion Barry, in typical political fashion, blamed his predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, but when Mrs. Kelly in turn blamed her predecessor, the trail led right back to Mr. Barry, who was Mayor for 12 years before his drug troubles.
 
Darth Vader of the Internet?
People who don't have the vaguest idea how the Internet works surely marvel at the computer whizzes who could put it together -- a web that can send mountains of data winging across the land. But such awe neglects a minor point: if humans can create this beast, humans can tear it apart. That became all too clear last week with the arrest of a hacker who, by all accounts, had his way with whatever computer he felt like breaking into -- stealing, for instance, at least 20,000 credit card numbers. He was caught at least partly through the efforts of another computer expert, Tsutomu Shimomura, who refused to be out-hacked.
 
The End of a Free Ride
It was nice while it lasted. For travelers, one welcome freebie has been having a travel agent sort through the maze of air fares, snatching that perfect discount off the computer screen. It cost you nothing -- agents got commissions from the airlines. But screws are tightening everywhere, and this sweet deal seems to be next. Big airlines are putting limits on commissions, so last week two big travel agencies -- American Express and Carlson-Wagonlit -- said they'd start charging customers for some services. Some small agents have done this, but these are the first big ones -- together, they've got nearly 6,000 agencies worldwide.
 
Baseball's Cash Calf
Major League Baseball needs all the help it can get. It sent Medium League players off to spring training in Major uniforms last week -- in hopes that fans would pay to watch them try to chew and spit like the best of them. And it even sets its sights all the way down to the Little League -- no, not putting 12-year-olds in the big leagues (not yet, anyway), but charging a licensing fee if kids want to put words like Yankees or Dodgers on their uniforms. Has to be major money in that.
 
Class Action Against Tobacco
Tobacco companies, often sued, haven't paid a cent. That may change, and change big. Last week a judge said smokers and ex-smokers, 100 million of them, could be part of a single class action, the biggest ever.
 
COMPANIES
 
Forever Microsoft
Microsoft clearly runs most of the world. The only debates: How much of the world? And should anything be done? That latter debate is the life's work of all sorts of lawyers and Federal officials these days. The Justice Department spent years in hot antitrust pursuit, and in July reached a settlement said to rein in the software giant. Then last week a Federal judge got in the act, striking down a "too tame" settlement. The Justice Department appealed, and Microsoft, once the agency's foe, joined the appeal -- a sign, surely, that it had gotten a good deal.
 
All the News That's Profit?
What is a newspaper, anyway? A business devoted to profit or an enterprise devoted to excellence? It's both, of course, though at times those competing pressures can make a paper look like a seesaw bent out of shape. This conflict was in stark relief last week when Geneva Overholser, considered a top-notch editor, resigned from The Des Moines Register, owned by the vast Gannett empire. She'd made no secret of her chafing under what was seen as Gannett's aggressive push for profits, and her resignation was a splash of reality to journalists everywhere.
 
Women's Tennis, Poor but Proud
Some sponsorships would clearly be inappropriate -- you wouldn't want the Beef Industry Council to back, say, the Vegetarian Roller Derby. But beyond that lies a vast gray area. For 22 years, women's tennis had no problem with Virginia Slims. But when that link was ended last year, the tour had no sponsor. It almost had one in Tambrands, but turned down that $10 million deal last week. Why? A question of image, it seems. Cigarettes were O.K., but Tampax, apparently, is not a product the tennis pros wanted to be associated with.
 
Executive Pay, Unlimited
Remember that attempt to rein in executive pay by limiting a company's tax deduction for salaries over $1 million? According to a new study, it isn't working too well. A Towers Perrin survey says that, yes, companies want to be in official compliance -- because they want to look good to shareholders. They care far less about any lost deduction. And, said David Simmons of Towers Perrin, the rule "has loopholes as big as the Grand Canyon." In other words, it's fairly easy to be in technical compliance (shareholders like that), but the real impact seems to be on how executives are paid, not how much.
 
Stardust on Your Pillow?
Architects must love a chance to design a building for 42d Street -- anything, as they say, goes. Anything did indeed go last week, as three ideas were submitted for a hotel to be built on 42d and Eighth. One, designed by a Miami firm called Arquitectonica, evokes a comet crashing into the city. Hmmm.
 
INTENATIONAL
 
A Shoe Drops in Mexico
It was the inevitable next act in the Mexican economy's scary drama. Big Mexican companies, like those anywhere, must perform a delicate juggling act as they borrow money to keep all the balls in the air. But the recent crisis has sent all calculations topsy-turvy; when yesterday's debt payments come due in today's vastly different world, the numbers just don't add up. They clearly didn't last week for a tourism and construction conglomerate called Grupo Sidek, which defaulted on its debt -- the first big Mexican company to do so since things got messy. The markets must have had the illusion that this wouldn't happen, though, for stocks fell to a 17-month low and the peso took another beating.
 
An Island Called America
Washington now pays nearly a third of the tab for United Nations peacekeeping duties, but a bill approved by the House last week could trim that, even wipe it out. Under the bill -- which now lacks the votes to survive a Clinton veto -- if an American mission gets a United Nations nod, the cost of that mission is deducted from Washington's contribution. This, critics say, would bankrupt that global peacekeeping force. So, suppose Washington feels some compelling need to invade, say, Haiti. America would surely be more at peace with itself if the United Nations said it seemed like a good idea, but what would be the chance of that if the United Nations crippled itself by doing so?

Park Panel At Center of War Over Waterfront

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Years of political struggle over the proposed Hudson River Park are reaching a crucial juncture -- and the fledgling agency trying to develop the park has itself turned into a central battleground.
The threatened demise of the Hudson River Park Conservancy could jeopardize plans to create a 4.5-mile waterfront park stretching from 59th Street to the Battery. Without the conservancy, the project would be relegated to a variety of city and state park, economic development and transportation departments. 
 Last month the Pataki Administration began moves to force out the conservancy's president, Tom Fox. A much broader threat is posed by the Pataki's campaign pledge to shrink public authorities. Longtime conservancy critics, led by Marcy Benstock of the Clean Air Campaign, are calling on the governor to abolish it outright. An environmentalist who has fought development along the waterfront for more than two decades, she believes that the conservancy's plan, which is on the verge of being released, is overly commercialized.
Renewed debate over the park comes amid a swirl of legal, fiscal and political challenges. Ruling on a suit from Ms. Benstock's coalition, a State Supreme Court judge last month praised the conservancy's efforts but ordered it to halt any further decisions until it drafts an environmental impact statement.
"This year holds both the potential for terrific steps toward making the park a reality -- and unfortunately also the potential for all the progress we have made falling apart," said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried.
Also approaching this year is the deadline for resolving the refinancing of $80 million that the Federal government paid the city and state for the right-of-way for Westway, a project abandoned in the 1980's. The state can get the debt cancelled by agreeing to preserve the right-of-way within the park, with restrictions on its use.
Mr. Pataki has already started to trim agencies like the conservancy. Enormous city and state budget gaps have also placed agencies under growing pressure. Mr. Fox temporarily escaped the ax because he reports to a semi-independent board. But he says he will resign if Mr. Pataki asks.
"If the conservancy were dissolved, that would set back the park substantially -- it could take forever to get reorganized," said Mr. Gottfried. He is trying to revise a bill that would regulate the park's development.
Virtually every West Side community leader wants the park. Yet after years of argument, there is still no consensus on exactly what it should contain, who should develop it or how.
Those divisions were reflected were reflected in the community opposition to Herman's now-discarded plans to open a megastore at the Chelsea piers. Some people want open space and passive recreation; others favor organized sports, like basketball courts, and a mix of commercial and tourist property like marinas and restaurants. Some want the conservancy to continue; others want the project developed by regular city and state parks agencies.
Old alliances have split. Mr. Fox once battled Westway with Ms. Benstock, and Mr. Gottfried's bill was spurned by some liberal Democrat colleagues, like Assemblywoman Deborah Glick. Community Boards 1 and 4 endorsed his bill last year, but Board 2 opposed it.
"This would become one of the world's largest urban waterfront parks, with enormous recreational and maritime activity, creating jobs and attracting tourists and other economic benefits," said Michael J. Del Giudice, the conservancy's chairman. "But the next months are clearly a crossroads for its future." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH BRONX;
Mapping the Lower Bronx: It's South, but South of What?

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
In a city of countless boundaries of all kinds, none may be more notorious and elusive than the line dividing the South Bronx from the rest of the borough.
Most people say it is the Cross-Bronx Expressway or Fordham Road; others place it as far north as Mosholu Parkway. But everyone agrees that pinpointing the South Bronx's northern boundary has little to do with geography -- Mosholu Parkway, in fact, is in the northern Bronx -- but has everything to do with money, race, ethnicity and image. 
 A label born of the borough's devastation in the late 1960's and 1970's, the "South Bronx" grew as social ills spread north. The movie "Fort Apache, the Bronx" was filmed there; Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan visited to witness what had become the world's symbol of urban ruin.
"The term 'the South Bronx' did not exist before the 60's," said Borough President Fernando Ferrer. "It was mostly an invention, a shorthand way to describe physically decaying neighborhoods, rising crime and rising poverty."
But in recent years, as thousands of new homes have been built as part of the South Bronx's much-chronicled rebirth, many say the term has lost its meaning and denies the rich diversity of neighborhoods in the area. Others, especially residents, say that in the borough's redefined geopolitics, "South Bronx" has started to acquire a positive ring.
Ken Fogarty, a mathematics professor at Bronx Community College, is chairman of Community Board 5, whose northern boundary, Fordham Road, has generally been regarded as separating the South Bronx from the northern part of the borough since the early 1980's.
But as nonwhites have moved into neighborhoods north of his district, Mr. Fogarty said, some people have come to feel that the South Bronx's northern edge has shifted north.
"If you think of the South Bronx as the nonwhite area of the borough," he said, "the South Bronx is really south of Mosholu Parkway. In places like Kingsbridge, the dominant group is now Hispanic."
Yolanda Rivera, executive director of Banana Kelly, a major developer in the South Bronx, grew up in Hunts Point and subscribes to the "shift" theory.
"Maybe it was Fordham Road until the late 80's," she said of the boundary. "But it is now what we used to consider the north Bronx. As deterioration in housing occurred and people started moving up north to get stable housing, problems -- disinvestment, people selling their homes, absentee owners -- affected the housing there."
The term South Bronx carries so many negative connotations that many residents, when asked to identify a northern line, say bitterly that there is no such thing. "To me, the Bronx is the Bronx," said Rita Kessler, district manager of Community Board 7, which includes the area traversed by Mosholu Parkway.
Only about 30 blocks south of the Westchester County line, Mosholu is miles from what was once considered just the southern Bronx.
"Below 149th Street was considered south," said John McNamara, 82, a founder of the Bronx Historical Society, who grew up in Melrose, just north of 149th Street, "but no one referred to it as the South Bronx. People referred to neighborhoods: Port Morris, Mott Haven."
When the Cross-Bronx Expressway was built, in the 1960's, it cut a swath along 175th Street, destroying neighborhoods and causing what many consider the precipitous fall of much of the borough.
But despite the expressway's powerful physical presence, it did not prevent the ravages of social and economic change from coursing north.
By the early 1980's, Fordham Road had become the South Bronx's northern boundary. The area below Fordham Road lost 40 percent of its population between 1970 and 1980, and thousands of buildings were set on fire, many by landlords who could not find renters.
The decline has been followed by more than decade of urban renewal. "From a government standpoint, the South Bronx is usually the first six community boards below Fordham Road," said John Dudley, 40, the district manager of Community Board 3, who grew up in Morrisania. "But now it serves only to stigmatize a region of the borough that is now undergoing a renaissance.
"We don't call Riverdale the northwest Bronx," he added. "It meant something to say Riverdale. It should mean something when we say Morrisania or Crotona." NORIMITSU ONISHI

The Good Times? Long Gone for Stores at 'the Junction'

SERIES: Shoptalk: An occasional look at commercial districts around New York.

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
Known to some simply as "the junction," the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues used to be nearly synonymous with shopping in Brooklyn. For decades the area has served as a transportation hub for commuters as well as a hospitable home for new immigrants.
The shops are still here -- the mix today includes nine fast-food chains, four clothing outlets, two hair braiders and a thrift shop -- but the customers have dwindled. 
 The malaise may simply be an outgrowth of a continuing recession, but it is also possible that some of the current residents are reluctant to give their business to the newer shopkeepers, who don't live in the neighborhood as their predecessors generally did, said Barbara Sheeran, a former president of Junction College Development Corporation, a local merchants' group.
The area underwent a change in the mid-70's, when Caribbean immigrants began replacing the second-generation Irish, Italian and Jewish families who both lived and worked in the neighborhood. While today, there are few vacant storefronts, a daylong visit reveals that shopkeepers are depressed and discouraged.
"Business is so-so," says Al Vega, the manager of Raymond's Meat Market. He points to the empty space in front of his counter and says sarcastically, "You can see the line." As he bags two pounds of chicken feet for a young woman, he complains that business has been lagging for the three years, "and it's not getting better."
At Leading Lady Lingerie nearby, a clerk welcomes a customer. "Come in, darling. What do you need?"
"An 18-hour, all-in-one girdle -- for my daughter," says the heavyset woman. But those girdles are no longer made, and the woman leaves. The shop is empty. The clerk sighs.
A florist, staffed by Haitians but owned by the Chinese grocer next door, fares no better, even on the eve of Valentine's Day. "Very slow. Very slow," says a clerk. "People don't buy flowers anymore." A man enters, smiling, thinking of his sweetheart, and asks for "two half-dozen roses." Sixty dollars, he is told. He stares at the clerk, as if waiting for the punch line. It never comes, the smile fades, and he leaves empty-handed.
The scene is replayed at store after store: customers asking for a price, hesitating, and leaving without opening their pocketbooks. Perhaps it is telling that the one place with a steady stream of buyers is a corner liquor store, where the attraction is instant lottery tickets.
An elderly man with a fleck of orange food on his chin has just won $100 playing Dice. He waves a fresh wad of tickets and mutters, "Maybe I'll win another hundred." A few teen-agers courteously choose their games: Pot of Gold. Loose Change. 1,000 a Week for Life. "Nicest bunch of kids, right?" the owner says. "They're all drug dealers."
The store owner, who says he is fearful of having his name published, relies on the local drug sellers, especially the leader of the group. "At night, if he sees kids hanging out here, he just tells them to beat it," the shopkeeper said. "You say, 'That's amazing.' But after a while, it just becomes a part of life." SARAH JAY

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Ultrashort but Long on Choices

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
BECAUSE ultrashort-term bond funds occupy a niche squarely between money-market funds and short-term bond funds, you might think they are fairly simple investments.
Not so. 
 Some ultrashort funds own only Treasury securities; some own junk bonds, too. Ultrashort usually means less than a year, but it can mean several years. Some invest abroad; others stick to the United States. Some pay dividends; others don't.
While nearly all the share prices of the 15 ultrashort funds fell last year, their high incomes propped up their total returns. The ultrashorts gained 3.1 percent, on average, according to Lipper Analytical Services, compared with losses in short-term government and high-quality corporate bond funds.
Ultrashorts were a way for the fund industry to appeal to bank customers, by offering an investment whose price did not vary much but whose yield was higher than that on certificates of deposit.
As yields fell in 1992 and 1993, the funds became more popular. The number of funds nearly doubled from 1990 through 1994.
And after a year like 1994, when prices tumbled, "you'd expect strong growth from mutual fund investors" who are looking for less downside risk in their bond funds, said Jeffrey R. Kelley, editorial manager of Morningstar Mutual Funds.
Like money market funds, the share prices of ultrashorts are mostly stable. Of course, you forfeit any gains from share price movements. As a group, the funds returned 30.1 percent for the five years ended 1994, compared with 36.0 percent for short-term bond funds, Lipper said. This makes most ultrashorts better choices for those more concerned with income than with long-term gains.
Yet the funds can respond quickly to rising interest rates because they own short-term paper. The group typically owns a mix of Treasury, government agency securities, corporates and investment-grade commercial paper with an average weighted maturity of 90 days to a year.
That's why the ultrashorts held up so well last year. Their 3.1 percent gain compares with losses of 1.65 percent in short-term government funds and 0.4 percent in short-term high-quality corporate funds.
Yields were pretty good, too. The ultrashorts yielded 3.95 percent, on average, last year. That compares with 3.59 percent for money market funds and 5.21 percent for short-term government funds, Lipper said.
But share prices of ultrashorts are not fixed at $1 like money market funds. They vary with the value of their holdings like any other type of bond fund.
In fact, while the hefty yields were enough to create positive total returns, the share prices of most ultrashorts fell last year.
Strong Advantage, by far the largest fund in the group, began 1994 with a share price of $10.19 and closed the year at $9.98. Hotchkiss & Wiley Short-Term Investment Grade lost 1.85 percent of its principal, and Neuberger & Berman Ultra Short Bond Fund lost 1.66 percent.
Only two funds managed to increase their share prices in 1994. Eaton Vance Government Short-Term Treasury gained 3.49 percent using an accounting technique that lets the fund accumulate earnings instead of paying dividends to shareholders. And Permanent Portfolio Treasury's price rose 2.3 percent using a similar tactic.
In fact, Neuberger's price has dropped almost steadily since its 1986 inception.
As a result, "it's important for people not to confuse ultrashorts with money market funds," Mr. Kelley said.
The risk-reward equation that applies to any bond fund also applies to ultrashorts.
The Hotchkiss fund, last year's best performer among all taxable bond funds, with a total return of 4.4 percent, earned its top billing partly by holding short-term corporate issues as well as derivative securities designed to profit from rising interest rates.
Strong owns lower-credit paper -- 18 percent is in junk issues -- so its good performance came mostly from higher income. It yielded 5.52 percent in 1994.
By contrast, Neuberger & Berman Ultra Short Bond mandates a minimum credit quality of A but averages AAA, said its manager, Theresa Havell. And Permanent Portfolio owns mostly short-term Treasury notes, virtually eliminating credit risk.
Does it pay to skim the higher yields off an ultrashort that owns junk?
Bond prices typically move because of shifts in interest rates. But in a real "flight to quality" that causes a credit crunch like there was in 1990 "there won't be a market even for the shortest junk," Mr. Kelley said.
What about overseas investments? Pacifica Asset Preservation buys foreign issues; Neuberger & Berman won't.
And some funds have longer average weighted maturities then one year. Strong can go as high as six years; Neuberger, two. The moral: don't judge ultrashort funds by their yields because their risk levels range all over the lot. Check a fund's total return. And read its prospectus to find out where it can invest and its shareholder report to see where it does invest, Mr. Kelley said.

Putting The Heat On 85th St.

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
"They come from all over and from all walks of life -- from a banker or a broker to the unemployed," said the 19th Police Precinct commander, George J. Kelly. One arrived in a BMW, another in a taxicab. They are men seeking streetwalkers, and on the Upper East Side that means their destination is 85th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
Since October, however, the police have been cracking down on both the prostitutes and their customers. So far, decoy female officers have arrested 90 men for soliciting sex for pay on the "stroll," as streetwalkers call their promenade. About a dozen prostitutes have also been arrested. 
 "One fellow was fresh from his honeymoon," Captain Kelly said. Another tried to talk his way out of arrest, saying it was all a misunderstanding and he was simply buying a carton of milk for his pregnant wife.
The scene also draws criminals. One man was found with a loaded illegal pistol, another with drugs.
Prostitution is an old neighborhood feature, said Kathy Jolowicz, a local historian. Decades ago, she said, "86th Street used to be the Great White Way of Yorkville," in its heyday as a center for Middle European immigration. It had dance halls, theaters, restaurants and "two hotels that were known places" for women for hire. "They just stood there and never bothered anybody -- some were European and they looked quite nice, actually."
But the Great White Way dimmed, prostitution became tainted with illicit drugs and the hotels closed. In the early 1980's, police raids finally pushed the prostitutes off 86th -- and around the block onto 85th.
As a young sergeant more than 20 years ago, Captain Kelly witnessed the prostitution on 86th Street. Upon returning to the neighborhood as commander last year, he said, "It was something I was determined to take a bite out of." The crackdown was expedited by a new policy allowing precincts to conduct decoy operations without waiting for permission from headquarters.
While civil liberties advocates have protested, the cleanup has many supporters. "On a peak night, you would get 15 to 20 women working the street -- it was making the neighborhood look bad," said Charles Angoy, a bouncer at the Country Club night spot. "Now, you can see it's very quiet."
Some prostitution persists. "What are you up to tonight?" a woman said, huddled in the doorway of a Gap store. When a passer-by did not respond, she moved on, saying, "I got to go make some money." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: Two Fathers in China

BYLINE: By Bao Pu; Bao Pu, a computer analyst in New York, is a member of the executive committee of Human Rights in China.

 BODY:
China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, is 90 years old and ailing, and the nation seems about to fall once again into political uncertainty. As Mr. Deng's daughter Deng Rong travels around the United States publicizing her new biography of him, she may try to set the tone of his obituaries, glorifying him as a heroic figure responsible for China's economic reforms.
Whatever she thinks of her father, I will remember what he did to mine. My father, Bao Tong, has been imprisoned in China for nearly six years because back in 1989, he and Zhao Ziyang, then the Communist Party chief, represented in the Government a sympathetic view and a more humane approach to the students demonstrating in Beijing. 
 Their ideas on political reform represented a threat to the old guard in the government. When Mr. Deng decided in the spring of 1989 to oust Mr. Zhao and imprison Bao Tong, he created convenient scapegoats for the unrest then roiling the country, and he satisfied the complaints of the hard-liners about the reforms. Inside the Chinese Government today, the idea of respect for individual lives stays imprisoned, just as my father does.
Mr. Deng's rule has been characterized by a total disregard for the rights of individuals and lack of respect for the rule of law. The crushing of the peaceful 1989 student demonstrations centered on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, despite the constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of speech and assembly, was only one instance.
The regime continues to uphold a discredited ideology and enforce political order with coercion, while the new-found economic freedom has brought with it an overwhelming wave of acquisitiveness. Since prospects are best for people with connections, those with political power, like Deng Rong and her siblings, are among the richest.
Is the economic boom due to the brilliance of the Chinese leadership or to Deng Xiaoping? Until 15 years ago this Government managed the economy and controlled individual lives in unprecedented depth and detail. This policy led the nation into numerous economic catastrophes.
The subsequent economic reforms have been so successful partly because the past policies were so dreadful. The present boom is largely due to the release of the suppressed natural economic energy of the people. Mr. Deng may get credit for initiating economic reforms, but it is the Chinese people with their new-found freedom who have improved their own lives.
Even before his death, Mr. Deng is being praised like an emperor of dynasties past. But it is not fair to use his contributions to the economy to acquit him of responsibility for the killing and jailing of innocent people.

HEADLINE: Habitats/113 West 87th Street and 112 West 88th Street;
For 2 Brownstones, a Long Night's Journey Into Day

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
TO Mig Boyle, the two back-to-back bombed-out shells hovering shakily over two particularly elegant side streets of the Upper West Side were persistent reminders of decay, and an inevitable invitation to vagrancy and vandalism.
For more than 15 years Ms. Boyle and her neighbors struggled to save the houses -- at 113 West 87th Street and 112 West 88th Street. But until two brave individuals showed up and took on the city bureaucracy, it seemed a frustrating and futile exercise. 
 "We painted a trompe l'oeil scene on the front-door window," said Ms. Boyle, president of the West 87th Street Development Corporation since its formation in 1977. "Did you see it? A little girl with long black hair and a gray cat peeping out from lace curtains."
"Vagrants were sleeping down in the entryway at 113 West 87th Street," she said, "so we dumped yards of soil there and put in a park -- it's gotten pretty shaggy now -- to inhibit the homeless from sleeping there." A blue wooden police barrier was placed across the areaway.
But the problems persisted, she said: "It was early winter when we put in the evergreens -- and right after we planted them, somebody copped one of the firs to use as a Christmas tree."
NO one knows exactly how long the two four-story brownstone houses between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues had been vacant. Residents guess since the early 50's. But the buildings were certainly vacant in 1962, when the original West Side Urban Renewal Plan was drawn up to encompass the blocks from 87th to 97th Streets between Amsterdam Avenue and Central Park West. The plan, most recently amended in 1988, always called for the restoration of the two abandoned houses, which had been seized by New York City for nonpayment of back taxes sometime before the urban renewal plan was prepared.
Progress was made: In 1983, the City Planning Commission held public hearings on their fate, and the Board of Estimate set a price for the two vacant buildings: $560,000.
In 1977, the neighborhood group had been designated as sponsor, giving it the right to develop the properties. But in the mid-to late 1980's, after the price had been set, no one wanted to buy them. In the bottom of the real-estate market, the price seemed absurd for two shells; the city had declared the buildings unfit for habitation 11 years earlier.
In May 1991, real-estate brokers in the neighborhood made an attempt to "pre-sell" custom town houses on the site for $1.4 million. There were no takers.
"The city wouldn't even let us in the buildings for the longest time," said Jeannette Bernstein, an agent for Vandenberg Real Estate, the Upper West Side firm that finally put a deal together. "When we finally got in, we could see why they were reluctant. There was a floor beam actually hanging down at eye level. It wasn't attached. It was very scary. And pigeons had built nests on the top floor."
Ms. Bernstein knows the block well. She recently sold a building in fine shape at 173-175 West 88th for $810,000 and knew what her customers for other neighborhood buildings thought of the two eyesores: "I kept seeing the buildings in my dreams, jumping out and scaring people off, just ruining the whole block."
Two years ago, she found two men who were interested in buying and living in the two brownstones.
"It should have been easy," said Dexter Guerrieri, Vandenberg's president, "but it turned into a nightmare."
THE two men submitted an offer to buy the buildings for less than the $560,000 asked by the city. The city refused to negotiate. The agents met with the West 87th Street Development Corporation. The development corporation asked for $70,000, an amount later reduced to $50,000, to buy its development rights. As part of the deal, the corporation would also retain a share in the ownership until the project was completed, when the title would revert in its entirely to the two applicants.
The city also required the buyer to pay the broker's fee -- usually paid by the seller -- which in this case totaled $25,200.
The men paid for an appraisal of the properties; the appraisal came in at $372,000. Along with appraisal, the men submitted their offer to the city: $370,000 in cash -- no mortgage. The men pledged that both houses would be restored to two-family use, and enclosed financial worth statements. Eventually, the city dropped the price from $560,000 to $420,000.
At the same time, the men continued negotiating with Ms. Boyle and the other board members of the development corporation, which was also investigating the would-be buyers. The group said it would approve the deal -- as the sponsoring group, it had the power to reject any deal -- only if the buyers planned to live in the houses and agreed to work with them in a joint venture that would be dissolved once the buyers restored the properties. The city also said it would not go ahead without the written support of the local community board.
If that wasn't enough red tape, the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development required that the two men had to finish their work in two years or forfeit everything: the houses, the money they had put in, everything. The men also were required to agree to pay an additional $400,000 if they did not finish in two years. One of the prospective buyers backed out. "He couldn't take all the aggravation," Ms. Bernstein said.
Another set of buyers, Gail and Stevan Kovacs, joined the remaining buyer, Tibold Lebovich, in the purchase. Both buyers are said to be "in the jewelry industry," and both declined to be interviewed.
By September 1993, the construction estimates required by the city and the neighborhood groups had been prepared. The buyers were getting ready for what they hoped would be their final appearance before the West 87th Street Development Corporation, when another competing set of buyers turned up. The neighborhood group decided to stick with the original would-be purchasers. Closings were scheduled and rescheduled.
The closing took place on Jan. 5, 1995. The city received its $420,000 asking price; the development corporation got $25,000 from the two new owners, and is to get $25,000 more when the work is done. There were more than 100 pages of closing documents.
THE development corporation will share the title until the work is finished, Ms. Boyle said, "They own it now; we'll turn over our share to them at the end of construction."
To Ms. Boyle, the biggest hurdle was getting the properties "wrested from the ownership of the city."
Asked about the delays and various stipulations placed upon the buyers, Mara Neville, a spokeswoman for H.P.D., termed the sale "an unusual situation" and said that this way of selling the buildings to individuals, as well as a community development group, at market rate, was "not our usual strategy."
Matthew E. Shafit, H.P.D.'s assistant commissioner for legal affairs, called the buildings "stragglers from an older project." Mr. Shafit said the two stipulations -- that the buildings would revert to the city and that the two men would forfeit the $400,000 "enforcement mortgage" if construction were not completed in two years -- were important to get the buildings renovated.
He said that both were needed and that in his experience they did not deter prospective buyers.
Ms. Boyle said the buyers were "great people."
"I know Tibor the best because he's going to be my neighbor," she said. "He jokes about borrowing cups of sugar. He insists he'll be in by next Christmas.
"He promises he won't make a lot of noise with the construction," she said. "But I told him it'll be the best noise I've heard. I've swept the sidewalk there and cleaned up the mess -- I've done the things people do when they care about their neighborhood -- and frankly, it'll be a great blessing to have him there."

HEADLINE: 'Smirnoff White Whiskey -- No Smell, No Taste'

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
OF all the captains of industry in the United States, past or present, John Gilbert Martin was one of the most unlikely, and most unforgettable.
He bore no resemblance to the politically correct archetype of the American businessman, the research-oriented profit-driven three-piece suit. 
 His image was that of a friendly English lord of the manor who looked most at home in rumpled tweeds or a hunting jacket. It was an image John Martin came by honestly. He was born in England, the son of upper-class parents -- his father was an executive of a car manufacturing company there -- and did not set foot in the United States until he graduated from Cambridge University in 1927.
Mr. Martin was the man who converted Heublein Inc., a small family-owned Hartford business, into an international giant by making Smirnoff vodka an international drink. Now Heublein, is cutting its Hartford roots, having announced it will close its manufacturing plant there.
The decision to shut the old plant -- in favor of the company's more modern distilling and bottling operations in Michigan and California -- is one more blow, in jobs and taxes, to the economy of a poor city once renowned as a rich manufacturing center.
The only solace for Hartford is that Heublein also announced that its research center, where new products are developed and existing ones are tested for quality control, will remain in the city.
John Martin died on May 29, 1986, at the age of 80. The research center was opened on Oct. 13 that year, as the John G. Martin Technical Center, dedicated to the man "who believed in products and ideas when few others did." And, as people who knew him have observed, had a great time along the way.
"John Martin started new selling techniques," said Robert M. Furek, president and chief executive of Heublein. "He didn't go by the book. He just did it. And it was fun to him. It was work, but it was also fun." Martin moved to Hartford because he wanted to see a bit of the world and the city was the home of a small business in making and importing liquors that had been started by his mother's grandfather and was known by her family name, Heublein.
The company was virtually out of business when Martin arrived. It was the Prohibition era, and the manufacture or import of liquor was against the law in the United States. Heublein was barely surviving on one product it almost incidentally manufactured, a sauce for meat known as A-1.
Martin went to work as a salesman, and then stayed on. When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, Martin was vice president. By the late 1930's, with World War II impending in Europe, threatening to cut off liquor imports here, Martin was the president of Heublein, which was still a small company.
Then came Smirnoff.
Martin had learned that in the town of Bethel, about 50 miles from Hartford, a man named Rudolph Kunett was manufacturing vodka on a very small basis. Kunett had fled Russia during the revolution there two decades before. He brought to Connecticut a great quantity of rubles and a patent to make Smirnoff, the only vodka served at the Imperial Russian Court. Unfortunately, the rubles were worthless on the world market and the Imperial Russian Court did not provide much cachet because it no longer existed.
Nevertheless, Kunett had set up a small vodka plant in Bethel and was trying to build an American market. He was enjoying a notable lack of success. Americans did not drink vodka. Most had never even heard of it. Martin offered Kunett a deal. He would buy Kunett's equipment for $14,000, give him a job and a royalty of 5 percent on each bottle of Smirnoff sold for 10 years. Kunett took the offer and Martin set out to see if he could sell Smirnoff, the vodka of the czars, in an age when there were no czars.
Smirnoff vodka is basically a mixture of pure grain alcohol and water filtered through charcoal. It requires no aging and production and sales started in Hartford in 1939 even before Heublein had any caps for the vodka bottles. Instead, caps labeled "whiskey" were used.
One of the first out-of-state sales was to a distributor in Columbia, S.C., who bought 10 cases. A short time later, the distributor ordered 50 more cases, then 500 cases. And Martin went to Columbia to check on the marketing phenomena. He later recalled, with more than a bit of delight, what he had found.
"We had a salesman down there and he had put up a great streamer: 'Smirnoff White Whiskey -- No Smell, No Taste,' " The Hartford Times quoted Martin as saying in a 1964 article. "It was strictly illegal, of course, but it was going great. People were mixing it with milk and orange juice and whatnot."
Martin visited Hollywood occasionally to see an actress, Jane Weeks, who would become his wife. They had a mutual friend, Jack Morgan, who ran a restaurant, the Cock-'n-Bull, and one day Martin and Morgan concocted a drink. It was made of Smirnoff vodka and ginger beer and served in a copper mug. They called it the "Moscow Mule."
Soon after, the United States was at war. Martin served in the United States Army, in North Africa and France, and was eventually discharged as a lieutenant colonel. Then he went back to the more pleasant job of trying to peddle an almost unknown commodity. He would go into bars with one of the first Polaroid cameras and entice the bartenders to let him take a picture of them serving Smirnoff. But it wasn't until 1950 that the Russian name became front page news.
It was early in the cold war with Russia, and New York bartenders, in a parade down Fifth Avenue, carried a huge banner: "Down with the Moscow Mule -- We Don't Need Smirnoff Vodka." The Daily News put the poster on the front page. Martin later recalled that Heublein employees rushed in to see what he was going to do about the bad publicity. "Do! It was great," Martin said. "All the people who saw the sign were rushing into the bars to buy the drink."
Martin began a campaign to get people to drink the vodka with not only ginger beer but practically anything else, including iced tea and beef bouillon. It was all promoted by exotic high-gloss magazine ads showing Smirnoff with celebrities or in strange and wondrous places. Smirnoff, thanks in part to the campaign, eventually became the world's best-selling vodka, and it still is.
While he was still president of Heublein, until 1961, or as chairman, until 1966, Martin was expanding into new fields. He foresaw the market for foods with lower levels of cholesterol and bred Charolais, the leaner French white cattle, on ranches he bought in Florida and Arkansas. A decade before the oil crisis of 1973, he had created a company in Tulsa, Okla., that bought up oil wells after major petroleum companies had depleted them. "About 40 percent of the oil is still in the land and we take that," he said at the time. "It's the so-called dregs but it's very profitable."
He was candid about his business ventures. He was also enthusiastic about the life style he could afford after he had turned Heublein into a very profitable venture. He lived as a rich man, and reveled in it.
Johnny Cake Farm in Burlington was a good example. The farm, on a plateau of Johnny Cake Mountain, totaled 500 acres where he raised thousands of pheasants, partridges and quail for sale to restaurants and steamship lines and where he enjoyed taking friends hunting. To lend a bit of atmosphere, he had imported a gamekeeper from Scotland who would sometimes don his kilts and play the bagpipes as he led little hunting parties into the field.
If anyone wanted to go after something a bit more exotic, another Martin hunting ground was a fenced preserve near his winter home in Naples, Fla., where guests could go after wild boar.
In a city as traditional as Hartford, Martin stood out among the reserved insurance executives and industrialists. And he also knew that his style of management could not last.
"I've always been sort of a buccaneer in business," he said in 1964, "but today when a company gets to be a certain size you've got to have trained people running it at several levels. It's all so dammed complicated now."
Business is even more complicated today, and Heublein is almost a classic example. Its headquarters have been moved to the town of Farmington. It is no longer an independent company. In 1982, it was merged with R. J. Reynolds Industries Inc. Five years later, it became a division of Grand Metropolitan PLC of London. And after June 30 of this year it will no longer make vodka in Hartford, the city where one of the big business success stories of this century started.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
You're More Conservative? No, I Am.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A year before the first Presidential primary, the early maneuvering for the Republican nomination is not over which potential candidate is a conservative but who is most conservative.
In Congress, Republicans (and even some Democrats) are tackling issues, such as banning racial preference in employment, that were taboo only three months ago. And Democrats, notably President Clinton, are avoiding issues, like the environment, that were once reliable vote-getters. 
 If nearly everyone these days is talking like a conservative -- or not talking at all, then where are the moderates, much less the liberals, who have bordered on extinction since the 1992 Presidential campaign?
While many moderates -- loosely defined as positioned slightly to the left of center on social and economic matters -- were swept out of Congress last November, some survive. And, with the slim Republican majorities in the House and Senate, they could become a pivotal bloc as the party debates more contentious elements of its agenda.
In one possible portent, 24 House Republicans joined Democrats last week in opposing a reprise of the Star Wars missile defense.
But mostly moderates are lying low, assuming that the more rough-hewn planks in the conservative platform will be smoothed down to an acceptable gloss by the Senate. Others in the political middle are uncertain whether conservatives are, indeed, divining the mood of America -- particularly when voters maintain in surveys that they are no less moderate than they were a decade ago.
 
Keeping Heads Down
 Party moderates, said former Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr. of Maryland, a moderate Republican who served from 1969 to 1987, are "keeping their heads lower than they would have otherwise. Events have shaken their confidence. They don't have the courage to speak out."
It is as if, three decades later, politicians are taking heart in the words of Barry Goldwater, then an Arizona Senator, who refused to placate moderate-to-liberal Rockefeller Republicans.
"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice," he declared, accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. "And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." (The twist is, now that Mr. Goldwater's philosophy is in vogue, he has taken to moderating his own position, speaking against what he says are radical elements of his party.)
The few politicians who are speaking out are far more to the left, like Representative Barney Frank, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. And they are not getting much attention. Moderates who are getting any notice at all are outside the capital and beyond the reach of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, like Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey.
Some moderate Republicans say they are holding their fire and, perhaps, their noses and voting for Mr. Gingrich's manifesto, the Contract With America, in the name of partisan solidarity. "It's avoiding needless conflict," said Senator James Jeffords of Vermont, the only Republican Senator who supported Mr. Clinton's health care proposal. "We're not going out of our way to draw out differences."
But others who have been known as middle-of-the-roaders are shifting. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican who is the new chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, has always opposed a balanced budget amendment. In the era of Gingrich ascendant, though, she has slightly revised her view, calling it "a bad idea whose time may have come." And, she has said she would not undercut Senator Bob Dole, the Majority Leader, if passage is dependent on her vote.
To prove his conservative bonafides, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Presidential contender, has called for abolishing the Education Department, which he once headed. He has scoured his record, searching for examples of his conservatism, from his support for a moment of silence in schools to his closing of Tennessee's offices in Washington.
Only one Republican Presidential prospect, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, is presenting himself as an unabashed moderate while his rivals try to outflank one another on the right. Driving the re-positioning of other moderates is the prominence of the conservative freshmen in Congress and their mentor, Mr. Gingrich.
 
'Scared to Death'
 "Right now, moderates are scared to death," said Cliff Zukin, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey. "But politics is an arena where society's problems are solved. If some people hide, there's a distortion."
That was what happened, Mr. Zukin maintains, after Ronald Reagan's 1980 landslide, when politicians were led to believe -- wrongly, in Mr. Zukin's view -- that Americans wanted such solutions as deregulation and tax cuts.
Likening the Democratic leadership then and now, he said: "Tip O'Neill was silent. He did not say, 'This is not the meaning of the election.' "
What makes the cohesion among House Republicans particularly striking is that traditionally the minority party in Congress musters more unity in opposing the majority's initiatives. The Republican united front has not been purely coincidental. After more than a dozen Republican House members strayed on a vote involving the President's efforts to aid the Mexican economy, Mr. Gingrich warned several against bucking him again.
Some House members hope privately that the Senate, where there is less enthusiasm for Mr. Gingrich's agenda and where individual members have more ability to gum up the works, might dilute parts of the more hard-edged legislation passed by the House.
"People are voting for things to get the agenda moving," said Representative Doug Bereuter, a moderate Republican from Nebraska. "But they also realize that there will be substantial changes in it if it ever comes back to us in the form of a conference report. That frees up people to be a little less upset with minor elements of the particular bill on the floor at the time."
Inevitably, moderates will begin reasserting themselves, if, perhaps, with somewhat less moderation than before. They were already stirring last week.
Two dozen conservative Democrats, banding together to express their disaffection with the House Democratic leadership, warned that the Republican agenda may be too extreme. The Coalition, as the new group is called, promises to be a "force that will have to be reckoned with."
And, it may turn out that the moderates have been overreacting. Despite last November's election results, polls suggest that there may not be a groundswell for conservative remedies.
In a decade of surveys of American adults by The New York Times and CBS News, there have been no appreciable changes in how people identified their ideology, although how they define philosophical labels may have changed.
In 1984, 19 percent described themselves as liberal, 43 percent as moderate and 30 percent conservative. In 1994, 19 percent identified themselves as liberal, 41 percent as moderate and 34 percent as conservative.

Spring, Minus Bats and Mits

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
BASEBALL'S silent spring has barely begun and the scribes are pitching the end of the Jeffersonian Ideal, the hole in the national psyche and the wrenching vision of peanut vendors on welfare. Don't catch that junk.
Actually, we need a rest from baseball. And what baseball seems to need now is a long rain delay, a chance for some serious emotional and economic deflation. As Ken Burns inadvertently showed us last year, the game's relation to contemporary American life is more romance than reality. We are only losing a male soap opera in a time when there are plenty. O.J., anyone? 
 The baseball we think we are losing is that phantom franchise where fathers played catch with sons (yes, Little League games do still go on, but even the Bonds and the Griffeys rarely saw each other in summertime) and where groups of skilled artisans basically unencumbered by true collective action (as in basketball, hockey, soccer, football) performed seasonal rites that concluded with the World Series, probably invented by muscular Christians to offset pagan harvest festivals.
The opening of the baseball season was a spring planting festival back in the time when the 16 true stations of the pastime were mostly cities of the original 13 colonies. Ever since the Dodgers led the land rush west, baseball as harbinger of hope became a vain Rust Belt conceit. Where oranges grow in winter, hope is merely cute.
And baseball has not been our pastime for some time past. In the glory days of our imperialism, when we were a creditor nation (we were the New World Yankees then, the big bat, add a pennant every year, played in Europe when it was the House that Marshall Built), there was a comfort in a national game that seemed to invoke our bucolic, innocent past (yeah, sure, Ty Cobb, the "Black Sox" scandal, repressive labor practices, no blacks until 1947).
But once we started striking out overseas, the game we needed to lift our spirits was the blustery, contained violence of football. The current movement toward basketball and, some say, hockey has to do with becoming a full-service nation for overseas customers.
Yes, there will be anxiety and a sense of loss, particularly among the emotionally unstable who need continuity. (Ask Alan Dershowitz about the deprived-of-baseball defense). But life happens, and we need to face it; start by remembering that the record Cal Ripken Jr. may lose the chance to break (Lou Gehrig's 2,130 games in a row) might have been out of Cal's reach if the Iron Horse hadn't been stricken while still a star, just shy of his 38th birthday, by a fatal disease.
 
Replacement Fans
 Need a break? Go watch Court TV, now that trials are covered exactly the way baseball seasons are covered. (Will Carl Douglas lose his spot in the starting rotation? Does the prosecution team have the legs for the homestretch drive to a decision?) Even Rotisserie League players may find solace in this replacement real-life drama. Years ago, they gave up the daydream of being players for the daydream of playing owners.Now they can take the '90's leap to the daydream of being agents and lawyers for players and owners.
Replacement pitchers and catchers began reporting last week as 27 of the 28 clubs (Baltimore excepted) opened their spring training camps. Eventually real major league baseball will return, a prodigal sport even more lovable because it came back to us, because we missed it so and because while it was gone we may have found new -- non-metaphorical -- ways to while away the innings, to stand up to a fastball, to get from first to home.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Proposes Changes in Zoning To Aid Superstores

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed sweeping zoning changes yesterday that would open New York City's underused manufacturing areas to the cavernous discount retailers and warehouse stores that have shaped the consumer landscape of America's suburbs and small towns for years.
With a dearth of office tower construction and little hope that manufacturing in New York will rebound, the proposed changes would make attracting large retailers a major focus of the city's economic development strategy over the next decade, particularly outside of Manhattan. 
 Under the Mayor's proposal, superstores as large as 200,000 square feet -- roughly the size of five football fields -- could move into light and medium industrial zones without having to obtain a special permit, a slow, costly process that officials say has kept the nation's largest retailers out of the city. The city's current regulations restrict most stores to 10,000 square feet in those areas, which have about 10 percent of the city's land.
The proposed changes would accelerate the arrival of large retailers that began a few years ago, as stores like Kmart, Home Depot, Pathmark and Bed, Bath and Beyond moved into commercial areas, where, in most cases, they are now allowed. Mr. Giuliani's plans would go further, opening areas like SoHo, western Harlem, Long Island City in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklynto the stores, where they are not now allowed.
"You all know that New York City is the largest consumer market in the United States and that all types of retailers are eager to invest in New York City," the Mayor said yesterday as he announced the proposal in Union Square Park in Manhattan, in front of a 240,000-square-foot Bradlees store that opened last fall. "But the city has erected many, many unnecessary barriers to retail investment. In just makes no sense at all."
Mr. Giuliani and Joseph B. Rose, the director of the Department of City Planning, said New Yorkers spend $3 billion a year driving to the suburbs to shop in the sorts of stores the city hopes to attract. They said that making it easier for the superstores to open within the city limits would keep millions of dollars in the city, raise tax revenues and create thousands of new jobs.
Encouraging still more and larger superstores -- with their huge signs, sprawling parking lots and wide aisles that are so familiar in the suburbs -- could transform the city, its neighborhoods and the sometimes idiosyncratic way that New Yorkers shop.
For that reason, the Mayor's proposal, which requires the approval of the City Planning Commission and the City Council, could prove contentious in the months ahead.
Opponents of the zoning changes said yesterday that the superstores would undermine the special urban character of the city and, with their high volume and lower prices, destroy small merchants in the city's many neighborhood shopping districts.
"The community will disappear," said Alfredo A. Rodriguez, the owner of two small supermarkets in East Harlem, who has been involved in a fight against the opening of a Pathmark supermarket in the neighborhood. "If they take away 20 or 30 percent of your business, you can't survive."
For Mr. Giuliani, a Republican who had broad support among small-business owners during his campaign, the proposal is politically sensitive. To that end, the Mayor took care yesterday to package the zoning changes with other proposals, some old and some new, intended to help existing small businesses.
In addition to reductions in business taxes and eliminating the city's sales tax on clothing under $100 that the Mayor has already proposed, the proposals include easing zoning restrictions on expansions and eliminating tax incentives for new businesses that many small merchants have complained create an unlevel playing field.
"We're sensitive to all of those concerns," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, "but overall the fact is that developments like this create more small business rather than contract small business."
The effort to revise the city's zoning laws began several years ago amid a realization that there was little prospect of a resurgence in manufacturing jobs, which have declined steadily since World War II.
In 1974, the last time zoning regulations for industrial areas were revised, the city restricted large retailers and other businesses from locating in manufacturing zones unless they obtained a special variance, in an effort to preserve tracts for industrial development.
Even under the current restrictions, many larger retailers eager to venture into the city's vast pool of shoppers have sought the special permits required to open, including Kmart, which has applied to build a 123,000-square-foot store in Long Island City, at the site of an old Ronzoni pasta plant.
Under Mayor David N. Dinkins, in 1993 the Planning Department proposed allowing stores up to 100,000 square feet to move into the manufacturing zones. Under Mr. Giuliani, the department has proposed doubling the limit, reflecting, officials said, that the prototype superstores have grown larger in just the last few years.
While the superstores are allowed to open in some commercial areas, the largest retailers -- such as Wal-Mart, the Price Club or Pathmark -- require large parcels of land, often 10 acres or more, that are scarce in most parts of the city.
Mr. Rose, whose department prepared the proposal and has studied the impact of large retailers in neighborhoods, said that the fear of the giants was "a red herring." He said that with so many New Yorkers driving to the suburbs to shop, the new stores would retain shoppers locally and create new business for smaller businesses.
"We're not talking about taking away from small stores and transferring it to large stores," Mr. Rose said. "We're talking about getting back to New York City jobs, spending, tax dollars, and providing New York City consumers the kind of choice they are already traveling outside of the city limits to get."
The proposed changes face a series of hurdles that could take years to overcome and provoke controversy at each step. Even before going to the City Planning Commission and the City Council, the administration must first conduct an environmental impact study mandated by the state.
Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for the Council, said yesterday that the Council would carefully scrutinize the proposal to insure that small businesses are not adversely affected. But some Council members and elected officials, hearing the anxiety of small merchants, have already promised to fight the changes.
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, said the Mayor's effort should instead be focused on encouraging the retail development already happening in places like Union Square, where Mr. Giuliani chose to announce his plan yesterday. She said the effort to open up manufacturing zones could draw new and existing retailers -- and their shoppers -- from such areas.
"They will put many existing commercial areas at a grave competitive disadvantage," Ms. Messinger said of the superstores.

HEADLINE: Mistake or Modern Marvel? Denver Airport Set to Open

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 16

 BODY:
It has been hailed as a technological marvel and derided as a civic booster's overpriced field of dreams. Whatever it is, the new Denver International Airport is set finally to begin operating on Feb. 28 -- a year and a half behind schedule and at a cost of $4.2 billion, about 50 percent more than the original estimate.
The first passenger flight, United 1062, will depart for Kansas City at 6 A.M. to inaugurate the architecturally striking terminal, which juts up from an otherwise empty prairie 23 miles east of Denver. 
 That departure will also mark the opening of the first major commercial airport built in the United States since the Dallas-Fort Worth field was completed 20 years ago.
Among the luminaries expected at an opening ceremony is Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, who as Mayor of Denver a decade ago first proposed building the airport. The current Mayor, Wellington Webb, will preside at the ceremony.
Stapleton International Airport, the field that has served Denver since the barnstorming days of 1929 but that city officials have declared hopelessly outdated and congested, will cease operation a few hours before Flight 1062 lifts off.
The terminal, hangars and runways, a 10-minute ride from downtown and easily capable of being expanded and modernized, in the view of the new airport's detractors, will be sold for conversion to office and residential development.
"This time we're really going to open D.I.A.," said Stephanie Foote, chief of staff for Mayor Webb, alluding to four previous opening dates that had to be aborted because of construction problems.
"We've finally ironed out all of the bugs," Ms. Foote promised. "We've now got everything itemized and prioritized, right down to the paper in the restrooms."
The delays were forced mainly by embarrassing problems with the baggage handling system, designed to be the most advanced in aviation history. In early tests of the $193 million system, which features computer-controlled baggage carts dashing on little tracks, some suitcases were crushed and ripped open and others ended up at the wrong plane gates or bag carousels.
Airport engineers say the system now works. But just in case, a conventional baggage system has been installed as a backup, at a cost of $50 million.
The airport was supposed to open in the fall of 1993. City officials had predicted that the 43,000-acre facility, with five 12,000-foot runways and a multipeaked terminal that resembles the snow-capped Rocky Mountains on the western horizon, would not only offer the easiest, safest and most efficient air travel anywhere but also give Denver a strong economic lift after years of recession.
They are still making that prediction.
"The boost always comes with big new airports, and Denver won't be an exception," said Dan Melfi, an airport spokesman. "People will be able to get in and out easier, and D.I.A. also will be a magnet for office parks and manufacturing facilities on the outskirts."
Some aviation experts have doubts. They question whether passenger traffic through Denver, the world's eighth busiest air hub, will ever increase enough to justify the final price of the new airport, whose cost was initially set at $2.9 billion.
They note that airlines have raised fares to help pay higher rents, landing fees and other costs at the new airport. They also contend that the old airport, whose narrowly spaced runways were often tied up by snowstorms, could have been reconfigured and modernized at less cost.
In fact, they point out, the new airport has fewer gates (87) than the old (111), though it can easily be expanded.
"There isn't any doubt that Denver International is one of the world's great airports, the most modern and efficient of all at this point," said Paul Dempsey, the director of the Transportation Law Program at Denver University.
"But in retrospect," he said, "the city made a rush to judgment. It should have looked more closely at whether to dump Stapleton. Just over 32 million passengers fly in and out of Denver every year, and there really isn't much outlook for a big increase in that figure any time soon, especially if fares keep going up. Another recession might even cause the figure to drop."
The critics also note, with special concern, that several agencies are investigating allegations about the airport's construction and the manner in which it was financed with bonds.
The agencies include the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation, the United States Attorney in Denver, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the General Accounting Office and the Denver District Attorney.
Airport officials say they know of no wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: New Chief Tells Freehanded Uruguay It's Time to Take Its Medicine

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay

 BODY:
Uruguay has long enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in Latin America, buttressed by a social security system that allows people to retire years earlier than in other countries.
But if the President-elect, Julio Maria Sanguinetti, has his way, those days will soon be over. 
 Mr. Sanguinetti, who takes office on March 1, said in an interview that his first priority would be reforming the social security system, which has become a drain on the budget.
"Our demographics are changing, people are living longer, and we simply cannot afford to maintain the social benefits program as it now exists," said Mr. Sanguinetti, who was President from 1985 to 1990 and was returned to office in a close election in November.
"I fully expect there to be opposition to our reforms, but sometimes the medicine seems worse than the illness, but in the long term it heals the patient," Mr. Sanguinetti said.
The basic problem is the high ratio of people who depend on or work for the state. About 1.1 million of Uruguay's 3.1 million people are registered workers, while 700,000 people no longer in the work force receive pensions. Uruguay has more than one retired person for every two workers, and about 37 percent of the state budget goes to the bankrupt social security system.
Economists and rival political parties agree that reform of the system, which is financed by payroll deductions, cannot be delayed.
A study by the Inter-American Development Bank said that even if Uruguay's gross domestic product grows at a projected 1.7 percent and inflation at 10 percent for the rest of the decade, failure to reform the social security system will mean the deficit will reach 5 percent.
But reaching an agreement on exactly how to reform the system may be Mr. Sanguinetti's greatest challenge, especially since the legislature is divided almost evenly among three parties.
Mr. Sanguinetti said that while he would not "take away any benefits that people currently enjoy, the system will be reformed for future pensioners." He plans to propose a mixed system of minimal coverage by the state and private voluntary individual savings.
Uruguayans have grown accustomed to the system, which allows men to retire at 60 and women at 55. The Government provides disabled workers 70 percent of their salaries and free medical care.
Some Uruguayans are collecting pensions today under laws overturned in the late 1970's, which, for example, allowed a woman with a child to retire after 10 years of work, regardless of her age, or a single woman whose father died to receive a pension for life without working, even if she married.
Highly organized retirement associations have vowed to use referendums to block changes to the social security program.
Complicating matters is the factionalized political system, which was further entangled by the split of votes among Uruguay's three major parties in the last election. The vote ended more than a century of two-party rule.
Since no party has a majority in the legislature, Mr. Sanguinetti, of the centrist Colorado Party, must negotiate alliances with the unseated rightist National Party and the leftist newcomer, the Progressive Front coalition. These alliances will include concessions, particularly in filling Cabinet and commission posts.
President Luis Alberto Lacalle failed to pass welfare and other economic reforms because he lacked the political skills to negotiate and needlessly alienated Congress. Mr. Sanguinetti was one of the Mr. Lacalle's staunchest opponents in Congress, and supporters of the departing leader say he may seek revenge by blocking reform.
While bitter infighting and party rivalry are a way of life, rival party leaders have hinted that they are willing to work with Mr. Sanguinetti, particularly on social security.
"This is a period of fundamental change in Uruguay's history, and whether we are successful will depend on whether the parties realize we are at this turning point," said Danilo Arbillo, director of the weekly political newspaper Busqueda. "But I am hopeful that the parties will recognize the gravity of the situation."
Alberto Volonte, who was the National Party presidential candidate, said in an interview that his faction had reached an agreement in principle to work with Mr. Sanguinetti, but only in exchange for three Cabinet positions.
Tabare Vasquez, the Progressive Front's presidential candidate, said the left was willing to listen to Mr. Sanguinetti's proposals but that "we don't want anything in return for our cooperation."
"These parties have to realize that the problems Uruguay is facing were created by the two parties that ran this country for decades," he added.

HEADLINE: Al Gore, One Vice President Who Is Eluding the Shadows

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO and TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Two years ago, when Al Gore said he wanted to reinvent Government, people listened politely. Or snickered. Or fell asleep. When he took his first foreign trip -- to Poland in April 1993 -- it was assumed that he was trying, like Vice Presidents before him, to fill up his time.
There's not so much snickering now. 
 Mr. Gore's partisans say he is finally coming into his own. But it may be simply that in an Administration plagued by disorganization and indecision, inexperienced aides in some top jobs and power vacuums in key agencies, Mr. Gore's brand of steady dullness seems increasingly appealing, if effective mainly on the margins.
Over the past two years, the man once pegged only as a highly intelligent, eco-techno-nerd who talked too much in meetings has emerged also as the President's most trusted official adviser and his ultimate trouble-shooter, the one most likely to seize opportunities, put out fires and enforce decisions.
Disillusioned by Mr. Clinton, Democrats who once doubted Mr. Gore's ability to sizzle in a national campaign now whisper conspiratorially about his Presidential prospects.
Filling gaps aggravated by Mr. Clinton's uneven management, especially of foreign policy, Mr. Gore has been able to reach selectively into important areas of foreign and domestic affairs. He performs tasks that in other Administrations were the singular preserve of the Secretary of State (like persuading Ukraine's President to dismantle his country's nuclear weapons), or of the White House budget director (like ordering Cabinet officers to shrink their departments).
His range runs from the sublime to the ridiculous. He can sit by the hospital bed of an ailing Boris N. Yeltsin explaining how NATO policy had been misunderstood, or he can cut through red tape to declare a drug-sniffing pig in an Oregon police force a dog so it could qualify for Federal drug-enforcement money.
"In meetings, when a lot of people talk, you'll see the President looking around the room," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. "When Gore talks, the President is absolutely riveted."
But if Mr. Gore is so good, why is the White House in such trouble? Where was the Vice President when Bosnia flared up, when health care flamed out and the nomination process broke down? Mr. Gore's relentless campaigning on behalf of Democrats last fall did not stop the Republican landslide -- even in his home state of Tennessee, where both Democratic Senate candidates lost.
Blame doesn't stick to him, in part because as Vice President, he is not the day-to-day commander of anything and so does not have ultimate responsibility. Mr. Gore also has the luxury of picking his targets, and he does that so carefully that he does not get involved in issues he cannot control.
He studiously stayed away from the health care fight. And although he argued passionately for more American intervention in Bosnia, he was never held responsible for the policy shifts and failures.
Now, with the Administration scrambling to respond to the blunt message of the midterm elections that big government is bad, the streamlining campaign that Mr. Gore started with little fanfare in 1993 has sailed to the top of Mr. Clinton's neo-centrist agenda. And Mr. Gore is more than ever the President's public hand-holder now that Hillary Rodham Clinton, in political purdah since the health care fiasco last year, wields her influence mostly in private.
For most of American history, Presidents suffered their No. 2's or used them as partisan attack dogs; even strong ones like Walter Mondale and George Bush, never approached Mr. Gore's prominence.
But Mr. Gore's relationship with Mr. Clinton is a delicate walk along a thin line between doing your best for your President and doing your best for yourself, especially when you have your own Presidential aspirations somewhere down the road.
And Mr. Gore is acutely sensitive to the political reality that the higher he rises and the better he looks, the worse his boss may seem by comparison.
Asked in a recent interview where he thinks he fits in Vice-Presidential history, Mr. Gore reverts to modesty. "I don't know how to compare myself with others," he said. "The President is terrific about asking me to share in this, that and the other. And I'm grateful for that."
But Mr. Gore doesn't quarrel with the notion that he is, in Secretary of State Warren Christopher's words, "the most influential Vice President in history."
 
His Role
A Vice President As a Loyal Ally
 "We achieved what I call Gestalt," Mr. Gore once said of his relationship with Mr. Clinton.
In their two years in office, their intimacy has deepened, and White House aides say the President has become so dependent on his No. 2 that he does not make any decision of significance without him.
"I cannot imagine the President making a major decision before talking it through with the Vice President," the Presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos said.
Sometimes, Mr. Clinton has held up big decisions just to get Mr. Gore's say. In December, when Mr. Gore was in Moscow and the President's advisers were reviewing their first round of budget cuts in the wake of the disastrous midterm elections and pondering whether to propose tax breaks for the middle class, Mr. Clinton held off until Mr. Gore returned. All the players had to come back for a second meeting so Mr. Gore could hear the proposals firsthand.
When Mr. Clinton was unsure whether to eliminate the Department of Energy as part of the streamlining of the Government, Mr. Gore pushed him into a decision.
"What if we go and take the Department of Energy sign off the Forrestal building and slap on Department of Defense, and a year later a reporter comes by and sees the same people in the same jobs doing the same thing, and asks, 'What did we accomplish?' " Elaine C. Kamarck, Mr. Gore's chief aide on streamlining Government, paraphrases him as saying. The President decided to keep the agency.
Since November, a White House eager to find an organizing rationale after the Republicans' election victory has eagerly embraced Mr. Gore's campaign for a leaner Government. Under Mr. Gore's supervision, his advisers say, the program has helped shrink the Federal work force by more than 100,000. Program cuts and reorganizations intended to save $65 billion over five years have been enacted, and Mr. Gore is to announce measures this spring aimed at saving another $52 billion. But Republicans deride the Gore initiative as too little too late, and it may not improve the Democrats standing much in 1996.
And Mr. Gore's political touch has not always been so sure. Despite his long experience in the House and Senate, where he was somewhat of a loner, he has been unable to spare Mr. Clinton some of his worst defeats on Capitol Hill.
Now, he's taken on the latest challenge to the White House: the nomination of his fellow Tennessean, Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. as Surgeon General.
Mr. Gore, who has known Dr. Foster casually for years, interviewed him about a week before his appointment was announced. He voiced support for the nomination, apparently no more alert than anyone else in the Administration of the political pitfalls inherent in Dr. Foster's record as an obstetrician who performed abortions during his long career.
But as the quintessential trouble-shooter, Mr. Gore was called by the White House late last Sunday afternoon and asked to help. He cleared his schedule the next day so that he could go to Nashville to help salvage the nomination.
 
His Accomplishments
Building Power In Foreign Affairs
 Early in the Clinton Administration, Mr. Gore got a reputation in the State Department as a player who had to be reckoned with.
 "I don't do funerals," senior officials quoted him as saying.
 Mr. Gore insists that he never considered the Vice-Presidential duty of grieving deceased foreign leaders beneath him. "I never said that," he said. "That's an apocryphal story. I'm not too proud to go to funerals. I don't remember a time when they've asked me to go to a funeral and I've said, 'Sorry, that's not something I do.' "
But what Mr. Gore does best is fill vacuums.
Mr. Clinton's lack of passion for foreign policy combined with Mr. Christopher's willingness to cede vast swaths of his authority to other agencies have given Mr. Gore the chance to do diplomacy.
"The world is a safer place because of Al Gore," Mr. Stephanpoulos said.
Mr. Gore has established a critical link with Russia outside normal diplomatic channels. Since Mr. Yeltsin is not considered the most reliable of partners, and since he and Mr. Clinton do not have much of a personal relationship anyway, Mr. Gore has developed a close relationship with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, successfully transforming a modest space-and-energy commission with Russia into the ultimate back channel.
The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which now involves six Cabinet members, has become a way to get the Administration's views through to Moscow and establish a relationship with the man who could someday be President.
 It was Mr. Gore who clinched a deal on oil development in the Caspian Sea with Mr. Chernomyrdin before the United States-Russia summit meeting in Washington last fall. "Let's do it for our Presidents," an Administration official paraphrased Mr. Gore as writing his Russian colleague.
Mr. Gore also used his contacts to negotiate an ultra-secret deal with Russia and Kazakhstan to bring more than half a ton of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakhstan to the United States last year.
And when Mr. Christopher met with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev in Geneva last month, they barely discussed the contentious issue of Mr. Yeltsin's unfulfilled pledge to disclose Russia's arms deals with Iran. That was the responsibility of Gore-Chernomyrdin, Mr. Christopher's aides said.
 Mr. Gore has replicated his accomplishment in Russia with South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. And a Gore Commission with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak is already at work, even though it will not be created officially until Mr. Gore makes a five-nation swing of the Middle East next month.
The effect of such discreet diplomacy is that Mr. Gore sometimes is filling the traditional operational roles of the President, the Secretary of State and the national security adviser, a characterization Mr. Gore denies.
"No, no, no, I don't agree with that," he said. "I come off the bench to fill in where they ask me to. This President has a very big foreign policy and there is enough work to go around."
As for Mr. Christopher, he insists that he does not feel threatened by the Vice President. After all, it was Mr. Christopher who urged Mr. Clinton after a series of foreign policy setbacks in the fall of 1993 to give Mr. Gore a more active role.
But if a Vice President is ready and willing to conduct foreign policy, then why would a government want to deal with a mere Secretary of State?
 "No Secretary of State can do it all," Mr. Christopher said. "It would be foolish if he thought he could. One reason I'm so confident is that the Vice President is thoroughly reliable."
Sometimes, however, Mr. Gore gets carried away in his role as the Scarlet Pimpernel of American diplomacy.
During a visit to Moscow in December 1993, he demanded that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund lend more money to Russia, saying that he did not care if his statements provoked a "diplomatic incident." They did. The protests that followed caused Mr. Gore to soften his criticism.
In late 1993, Mr. Gore decided to spice up a speech in Mexico City that he thought "lacked a center," one of his aides said, by calling for a hemispheric summit meeting. Although he had consulted with the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, who got the go-ahead from the President, the announcement stunned the Latins and blind-sided most of the State Department.
 Although Mr. Clinton seeks Mr. Gore's advice on foreign policy, the Vice President does not always prevail and sometimes retreats. Throughout the first year and a half of the Administration, Mr. Gore argued passionately for punitive air strikes to force the Serbs in Bosnia into making peace.
When Mr. Clinton would waver at crucial moments, Mr. Gore would stiffen his spine by delivering lengthy soliloquies about morality and the right of the Bosnians to defend themselves. But in the end, the Vice President went all wobbly, concurring with the dominant view in December that the punitive strategy had outlived its usefulness and should be abandoned.
 
His Future
A Delicate Spot In Party Politics
 In the conventional wisdom of Washington, if Mr. Gore is a winner, there must be a loser. Not so, Mr. Gore insists, though he stumbles a bit on the answer.
"No, absolutely not, and, uh, uh, well, I don't perceive any problem of that variety," he said. "Everything I do is according to one simple game plan: how can I best help President Clinton be the best President he can possibly be."
But when Mr. Gore's aides describe how he works, they often end up, however unintentionally, praising the very qualities of discipline and focus that Mr. Clinton's critics complain the President lacks.
"He will set aside large blocks of time and will sit down and think these things through," said Mr. Gore's chief of staff, Jack Quinn. "He doesn't do anything off the cuff. He never shoots from the hip. He is thoughtful, he is prepared, he is careful."
Despite polling data that show Mr. Gore with a far more favorable ratio of approval to disapproval ratings than the President, Mr. Gore is determined not to be seen as upstaging Mr. Clinton. When the House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently asked Mr. Gore to address the Republican caucus, even as the Democrats wanted him to address theirs, Mr. Gore's staff suggested that he combine the two. But Mr. Gore immediately rejected the idea as tantamount to addressing a joint session of Congress, a privilege reserved for the President.
Mr. Gore has said that under no circumstances would he accept the Democratic nomination in 1996, although party leaders say with equal certainty that he would be the best hope in the unlikely event that Mr. Clinton dropped out.
"As the campaign season begins, clearly part of my role will be how can I best insure that Bill Clinton is re-elected," Mr. Gore said. That will involve all the fund-raising and speech-making duties traditional for running mates, and while Mr. Gore is far less stiff in public than he once was, even his closest friends in the White House acknowledge that he lacks Mr. Clinton's instinctive flashes of poetry and command of a crowd.
"Clinton is a natural in a way that Gore will never be," said an adviser who is close to both men. On the other hand, Gore has all the will and determination and discipline that would serve him very well as President."
For now, Mr. Gore said, "I greatly enjoy what I'm doing." What he does not say is that in the year 2000, he will be turning just 52 years old.

HEADLINE: In a Charged Climate, German Union Takes Strike Vote Tomorrow

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 18

 BODY:
After weeks of ineffectual talks with German employers, the country's powerful electrical and metal workers' union, IG Metall, has called a strike vote for Monday that could lead to work stoppages in southern Germany as early as Friday.
The struggle between IG Metall, which has 2.6 million members, and Gesamtmetall, an employers' federation representing almost 8,000 businesses, is an annual event. But this year, the war of words over pay increases and shorter working hours has taken on larger proportions. 
 For the first time since 1992, German industry is not struggling through a recession. Profits are strong, as is the demand for exports, making it harder for employers to say that they would be hurt by substantial increases.
Over the last two years, the metal and electrical workers accepted wage settlements that resulted in a loss of real buying power, giving them strong arguments that they deserve at least modest increases in their standard of living.
Yet Germany is saddled with some of the highest labor costs in Europe and inflexible labor laws, making production costs higher than in almost any other industrial nation. Business leaders say that if they give in to excessive labor demands, their competitiveness with emerging industries like those in Southeast Asia, as well as with established industries in the United States, could be severely hurt.
"This year, the unions have more bargaining power than in previous years, but employers seem still ready to put up a fight," said Gunther Thurman, a vice president for economic and market analysis at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt.
IG Metall has called a strike vote for Monday by 730,000 workers in its southern district in Bavaria. Approval for a strike is almost assured, economists here say.
Bavaria was apparently chosen as the initial target because it is home to big industrial companies like BMW, Siemens and Audi whose factories are operating at full or nearly full capacity and would not have the cushion of high inventories during a long strike.
The spillover effect of a strike could cripple most of the auto industry, since Audi supplies many parts to its parent company, Volkswagen, which has plants in central and northern Germany. Volkswagen has announced that it is prepared to slow down production if it cannot get the parts delivered.
More than two months ago, IG Metall announced that it wanted a 6 percent wage increase for its members. So far, Gesamtmetall has frustrated the union by refusing to make a counterproposal.
Before any pay increases can be discussed, the employers say the unions must be willing to discuss ways to cut costs, including eliminating an agreement reached last year to reduce the workweek by an hour, to 35 hours. Employers say the shorter week will increase their costs by 2.8 percent. The union has rejected negotiations on the shorter week, which would take effect Oct. 1.
Both sides feel vulnerable since they are losing members. The union, considered the most powerful in Germany, lost 250,000 members in 1993 and possibly as many last year. The employers' group has also lost 400 members since 1993.
Some analysts expect the talks to turn more serious before the strike vote, because a big strike would hurt both sides.
"There is a lot of noise," said Holger Fahrinkrug, senior economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. "But we have a lot of time before we face a strike."

HEADLINE: Holocaust Survivors' Emphasis Is on Life

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Fifty years after their liberation from death camps, more than 3,000 Holocaust survivors gathered here this weekend for a commemoration. But Saul I. Nitzberg, a survivor of Auschwitz, was not among them today.
He skipped the event's first day to attend a relative's wedding. "Our family is very closely knit," said Dr. Nitzberg, 72, of Hollywood, Fla. 
 That Dr. Nitzberg's priorities revolve around life, not remembrances, befits this anniversary of the end of World War II. By now, survivors of the Holocaust have met many times in similar large gatherings. They have told their stories in oral histories taped and stored.
So as they age into their 70's, their reunions decimated by the passage of time, many of those who remain say they do not want to dwell on pain. They say they came to the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel here to celebrate (although many are reluctant to use that word) accomplishments and what people once fated for extinction regard as their greatest legacy: descendants.
"It's too late to ask certain questions," said Joseph Garay, a 73-year-old New Yorker who lost his parents and six siblings in the camps. " 'Have you seen my brother, my sister, my father?' We went through this already for 50 years. Who knows how many times we'll get together?"
The setting of the event itself attests to achievement. "Gentiles only" signs once kept Jews from buying land or staying in hotels in Miami Beach. But it has become a Jewish tourist and residential enclave that now has its own Holocaust memorial and soon will be home to the state's first Jewish museum, scheduled to open in April in a restored Art Deco synagogue.
After a decline in the Jewish population in the 1980's, when mostly the old stayed, the area is now experiencing a renewal evident in new kosher restaurants and stores along Arthur Godfrey Road and younger Orthodox homeowners to the north of South Beach. Dade County, the metropolitan area that includes Miami Beach, has 166,000 Jews, the sixth largest Jewish community in the United States, demographic studies show.
An estimated 20,000 Holocaust survivors settled in the three South Florida counties of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. Dr. Nitzberg, a hematologist who moved to Broward County's Hollywood in 1958, said he came seeking economic opportunity.
"I felt it was backward country and there were not too many specialties in my field," he said.
For Dr. Nitzberg and other survivors, there is no better proof that they have transcended the past than the professional success of their children. Four of Dr. Nitzberg's five children are medical doctors and the fifth is a clinical psychologist. He has 11 grandchildren.
A native of Poland whose family was forced into a ghetto and then to Auschwitz, Dr. Nitzberg said he motivated his sons and daughters by example and by lessons drawn from his Holocaust experience. His father, an engineer who was killed after falling ill with dysentery and diarrhea in the camp, was initially spared the crematorium because he knew how to do dental work.
His usefulness, he said, gave him three more weeks of life.
"What you learn, nobody can take from you," said the doctor, who was brought to New York by relatives in 1946 and later attended the University of Georgia and Emory University Medical School.
His American-born wife of 45 years, Mildred, and the couple's children said he attributed other values to his experience in Germany. One is a strong sense of loyalty to family (only a brother survived the war). Another is unwavering direction.
"He took hold of what he wanted out of life and held on to it with incredible vigor," said Laurie Sabra, his 36-year-old daughter. "He has a clear view of what's important -- family, being honest and going to bed at night with a clear conscience."
Dr. Nitzberg, who still works in private practice, said, "I decided long ago that the past is the past and I can't do anything about it."
This weekend's event drew 4,000 people, 3,500 of them survivors. There were reunions of friends and relatives at a "survivors village" in a ballroom, where computers from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum allowed for tracing names and pictures from a survivors registry.
Scheduled for the event were the presentation of flags of liberating United States Army units and a videotaped address by President Clinton at a Sunday dinner.
Today, a giant screen in the "village" flashed slides of family after family as they are today, mostly portraits of two and three generations at weddings and other celebrations. On the floor below, the happy pictures were tempered by wounds still open half a century later.
"Have you been in Auswitz-Birkenau, Lager D., Barack 30, October 1944. Please contact me," read a sign carried by a woman survivor still looking for information about a sister who was 15 when she last saw her.
"I have no celebration in my life," said the woman, Elizabeth Ungar, 70, a Hungarian now of Highland Beach in Palm Beach County. "All the happiness was always covered by sorrow."
In the group there was also the sense that the living memory of the Holocaust is inexorably fading. About 70,000 survivors remain in the United States, a shrinking group despite expanding families.
As time passes, each reunion becomes the most moving yet, some say.
"When you get older you get a little bit more emotional," said Benjamin Meed, a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto and president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, which organized this event. Mr. Meed has organized five similar events since 1981.
"We are losing people every day," he said.
But then, as always, the talk turned to the children.
"Our vengeance," Mr. Meed said, "was rebuilding life."

HEADLINE: It's a Hard Job Saving Foreign Aid (but the Job Is Still There)

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
At a time when Government bureaucracies all over Washington are scrambling to survive, J. Brian Atwood is developing a reputation as a master of that particular game.
He is the director of the Government's principal agency for the distribution of foreign aid, a program the public in general regards with distaste and the Republicans in particular rate lower than welfare. 
 As if that were not enough, Secretary of State Warren Christopher joined other critics last month to propose shutting down Mr. Atwood's shop, the Agency for International Development.
But after a passionate round of lobbying, speech-making, letter-writing, log-rolling, string-pulling and plain old pleading that could serve as a model of how such behind-the-scenes battles are fought, Mr. Atwood persuaded Vice President Al Gore to reject Mr. Christopher's proposal, and he and his agency are still standing. At least for now.
Eager to chop foreign aid and to demolish what they view as an outdated, inefficient bastion of bureaucratic self-preservation, Republican leaders announced plans this week to push through legislation to scrap Mr. Atwood's agency and merge it with the State Department.
For Mr. Atwood, this new threat means remounting his lobbying bicycle. It will mean more speeches to foreign policy groups to rally support. It will mean many more one-on-one meetings on Capitol Hill to defend programs like assistance for Africa and population stabilization.
It will also mean more gettogethers with editorial writers and appeals to relief groups to urge Congress to preserve the $13.7 billion foreign aid program. It will require more broadcasts of the agency's public service ads, which describe the agency's efforts to help eradicate smallpox, fight famine, protect rain forests and increase literacy rates -- all while creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs.
Mr. Atwood will once again be taking to the airwaves to respond to Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who is leading the new drive to abolish the agency. While some Administration officials dismiss Mr. Helms as a cranky conservative who is more bark than bite, his effort has Mr. Atwood's full attention because it is backed by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
After a month of scrambling and fighting, the strains on Mr. Atwood are starting to show. His words have become more caustic, less tempered.
"Because of the impression that has been created that our foreign aid program is nothing more than an international welfare program," he said in an interview, "it has been possible for demagogues, isolationists and populists, all sometimes in the same person, to exploit that and to exploit people's fears."
Appearing on C-Span this week, Mr. Atwood lashed out at the Helms proposal to eliminate his agency.
"It's mischievous," he said. "It's designed more to pursue an isolationist foreign policy than it is to do something constructive."
A tall, stocky 51-year-old who was once captain of the Boston University football team, Mr. Atwood has won admiration within the Administration for his perseverance.
Those on the other side, however, may credit his skills but are far from persuaded.
"He's a good salesman, but he's selling to some very tough customers." said Charles Bass, a New Hampshire Republican on the House Budget Committee who recently met with Mr. Atwood. "It's not clear to me we need all those aid missions overseas acting like second State Departments."
Mr. Atwood bridles at the suggestion that his goal is bureaucratic self-preservation. Rather, he says he has to protect a program that first flourished when the Marshall Plan provided billions of dollars to rebuild a devastated Europe after World War II.
Defying the current mood, Mr. Atwood insists that foreign aid deserves a new mandate, rather than a retreat. In the post-cold-war world, he argues, the crises that America faces -- and sends troops to -- will increasingly involve not the Soviet Union, but countries like Somalia and Rwanda afflicted by hunger and overpopulation. In his view, aid is essential to prevent those problems from exploding.
"There are more threats coming from societies that are failing than from the threats we used to see," he said. "When societies fail, there are wars and huge flows of refugees, and then the whole world has to spend a lot of money to resolve them. A little more investment earlier on might have helped prevent such crises and saved a lot of money."
As he hunches forward on a burgundy chair in his dark, oak-walled office, Mr. Atwood can scarcely hide his hurt that colleagues in the Administration had proposed abolishing his agency. In January, after Vice President Gore asked the State Department for suggestions on reducing the foreign policy bureaucracy, Mr. Christopher proposed merging A.I.D., the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department.
Mr. Atwood met several times with Mr. Gore and Mr. Christopher to make his case. An official who sat in on some of those meetings said: "Brian made his case on three fronts: 'I've made major changes in this organization already. My agency has a unique and important mission in support of foreign policy. And don't disrupt my efforts right now when I'm in the middle of our own reinvention efforts.' "
Mr. Gore decided in late January against merging the three agencies into the State Department. In explaining the decision, it was clear that the Vice President was influenced by Mr. Atwood's arguments. He agreed that the aid agency had such a distinctive mission that a merger would be ineffective, and that a merger would undermine the cost-cutting already under way.
Other senior officials, however, said that just as important was the concern that the State Department had management problems of its own.
In an Administration that has talked ceaselessly about reinventing government, Mr. Atwood has shut down 23 overseas missions and cut his agency's roster by 10 percent, to 2,900. He has turned off the spigot to countries like Zaire and Cameroon that have not made effective use of aid. He has replaced the agency's 13 financial management systems and 42 overseas accounting offices with one central office and system. And he has revamped the agency's procurement procedures.
Despite those efforts, some critics view his work as a lost cause.
"He's doing as good a job as he possibly can to run what is essentially a relic of the past," said Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. "A.I.D. is a dinosaur. It's time to put it to rest."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Joins Forces With India's Silicon Valley

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Massachusetts announced plans today to forge an alliance with India's equivalent of Silicon Valley in California.
"We hope to have a sister status with Karnataka," Gov. William F. Weld told reporters after opening the India office of the Raytheon Company, a military contractor in Lexington, Mass. 
 Several large computer companies have opened in and around Bangalore, the capital of the southern state of Karnataka, taking advantage of a three-year-old economic reform program in India. Karnataka is home to many of India's top engineers and software professionals.
"Bangalore and Karnataka are a perfect fit because we are the software capital," Mr. Weld said, referring to the 1,800 software companies that are based in the Boston area.
Mr. Weld, who is leading a 22-company business delegation to India, said the details of the planned alliance with Karnataka would be worked out next week, when he is scheduled to hold talks with the recently elected chief minister, H. D. Deve Gowda.
Mr. Gowda, who heads the centrist Janata Dal government, put out the welcome mat for foreign investors after his party defeated Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's Congress Party, which has championed the free-market policies.
Mr. Weld said his state had worked out similar arrangements with Guangdong Province in China and with the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Massachusetts signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday with the Confederation of Indian Industry to increase business contacts.
The Massachusetts delegation includes executives from companies representing industries like telecommunications, financial services, environmental technology, engineering, biomedical technology and computer software.
Mr. Weld also said Massachusetts would receive an Indian business delegation in April.

HEADLINE: These Days, the Circus Animals Sneak Into Town

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Feb. 18

 BODY:
When the circus rolled into Richmond five years ago, disk jockeys broadcast live by cellular phone from the backs of the elephants, as they lumbered through downtown in a parade from the railyard to the big top. Globes proclaiming "The Greatest Show on Earth" glittered from the harnesses of the great beasts as children of all ages waved in the streets.
This week, the circus tip-toed into town, an hour after sundown. No riders. No globes. Officials of the circus, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows Inc., asked reporters not to publicize the arrival time. 
 The circus parade, a 198-year-old tradition that once stopped traffic with clowns and calliopes, has yielded to economics, insurance and animal rights. Ringling Brothers said in a news release, "The animal walk is not a parade, rather, a logistical necessity to move our animals from the circus train to the Richmond Coliseum."
So fans have begun camping out for hours to await the pachyderm procession. In California last summer, a headline in the Long Beach Press-Telegram announced, "elephant hunt tonight."
Some Richmonders tracked down the train by calling the police. Debbie Worten, a homemaker, set out in search of the circus with a former neighbor and their four children at 3 P.M. on Monday. They were four hours early for the caravan of 22 horses, 18 elephants, 5 camels, 4 ponies, 4 zebras, 2 llamas and 1 street sweeper, which zig-zagged from lane to lane.
"We didn't find any elephant droppings, so we knew we weren't late," Mrs. Worten said.
A Ringling Brothers executive called the change a reflection of the time. "Things are a lot more regulated than they were five years ago," said Rodney A. Huey, the vice president of public relations. "Risk management is much more involved."
Dale A. Riker, a former president of the Circus Fans Association of America, said the decision seemed reasonable, because of threats from animal-rights demonstrators and the possibility that an animal would bolt.
Circus promoters also said they were concerned that people watched the parade but then did not come to the show and pay admission. Indeed, at the Richmond animal walk, several parents shivering in the 30-degree chill said they could not afford to show their children the circus any other way.
And Ringling Brothers said unpredictable train schedules had led to complaints from spectators. Many, though, do not seem to mind. A circus spokeswoman said that even at 2 A.M. or 4 A.M., several hundred people line the Manhattan side of the Queens-Midtown tunnel each year as the animals march from the tracks in Long Island City, through the tollbooth, to Madison Square Garden.
Fred Dahlinger Jr., the library director at Circus World Museum, in Baraboo, Wis., said the first circus parade was held in Philadelphia in 1797. "There were really two shows -- the free one as they unloaded, and the formal one in the ring," she said.
In decades past, people munched picnic lunches as they watched the elephants hoist tent poles. Workers at downtown companies brought their children to work on parade day. John Farmer, 79, who watched keepers unload the stock cars this week, remembered being nabbed by the britches when, as a boy of 10, he tried to sneak into the big top. He got a free ticket in return for helping to set up seats.
For decades, parades had been hampered by overhead utility wires, growing suburbs and innovations like electric winches that shrank the number of roustabouts.
In the last two years, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, based in Bethesda, Md., began posting protesters in each of the 92 cities Ringling Brothers visits. The group says the animals are victims of "circus savagery," including rough handling and cramped travel quarters.
"The stealth circus is really a P.R. decision," said Kathy Savory, a spokeswoman for the group. "If people get too close to the animals, they may see the scars, may see them limping."
Mr. Huey said Ringling Brothers had made no changes in response to the campaign, because the animals' comfort and safety had always been the company's top priority. "They make it like we're hiding something," he said. "We display our animals to over 11 million people a year."
The circus still has three rings, and still has a flying trapeze. But the performers are lighted using technology from rock concerts. This year's circus features the "Globe of Death," with three motorcyclists cartwheeling inside a sphere of steel mesh. Music by U2, the stadium rockers, blares during another act, the "Wheel of Death."
Standing beside the train this week, Art Ricker, a regional vice president of Ringling Brothers, adopted a soft, self-mocking tone as he said the 53 cars were "jammed and crammed with wonders from every corner of the earth."
Jim Ragona, 40, who lives in a Ringling Brothers coach car, was ringmaster for 12 years, and now is the performance director. Instead of the handlebar mustache of the old-time ringmaster, he has a master's degree from the Art Institute of Chicago.
Mr. Ragona recalled the 1940's, when John Ringling North, who owned the circus until 1967, would pull into town in a train car.
"His entire advertising budget went to posters," Mr. Ragona said. "He mixed the glue himself. So the most important tool he had was the parade. Now, kids are bombarded with media, and stay home and play Nintendo. It no longer makes sense to pack up absolutely everything you own, and cart it through the streets."

HEADLINE: Watershed Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
It was both pragmatic fiscal pressure and broad political ideology that combined last week to produce a watershed in New York City politics: a Mayor proposing to make drastic cuts in the city's aid to the poor.
In releasing his preliminary budget for the next fiscal year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said essentially that after five years of budget trouble, the city had run out of easy spending cuts. And so he called for reductions of $1.2 billion in welfare and Medicaid, the government health program for the poor and disabled. 
 Beyond budget problems, the Mayor's decision was also provoked by the remarkable shift in national and state politics that occurred last November, when Republicans committed to shrinking government, cutting taxes and reducing spending for the poor seized control of both houses of Congress and the Governor's mansions in Albany and Hartford.
"A budget is driven by both numbers and values," said Mark J. Green, the city's Public Advocate. "A lot of the Giuliani fiscal plan is driven by sheer numbers, in a way that whether it were Giuliani or Freddy Ferrer as mayor, the reductions would be similar. However, a big chunk of it is values driven."
Finally, the Mayor's decision to seek a profound change in New York City's tradition of magnanimity toward its poorest citizens could not have happened without both the political and fiscal conditions that shaped his choices.
If New York's economy had begun even a modest recovery last year from a deep five-year recession, as many economists had expected, there would have been a vastly diminished need for extraordinary budget cuts. Mr. Giuliani must close a $2.7 billion gap in a nearly $30.5 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins in July.
And if Democrats over the last three decades had confronted the vast inefficiencies of welfare and Medicaid, many proponents of the Mayor's plan say, the program would not have been nearly so vulnerable now.
"It is precisely the failure to prune the Great Society programs, to use them intelligently, that has made them so difficult to trim now," said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group associated with centrist Democrats.
Mayor Giuliani, who was elected as a fusion candidate in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, had not previously indicated much taste for dismantling automatic benefits programs. As a candidate for mayor in 1993, he did not advocate major reductions in welfare and Medicaid, although he emphasized the need for encouraging welfare recipients to find jobs and for shrinking the size of city government.
Last year, he asked for a state takeover of the city's Medicaid costs, a burden of more than $2 billion a year -- equivalent in size to the city's long-term, or structural, deficit. With George E. Pataki now in office, and the possibility of a takeover eliminated, Mr. Giuliani is still seeking state aid on Medicaid, although his strategy is entirely different. Now he wants the state to help by enabling the city to cut Medicaid.
Mr. Pataki proposed two weeks ago in his budget to reduce spending on Medicaid and welfare by $1.9 billion statewide. The Mayor asked the Governor last week to go much further, to a total of $2.5 billion statewide, which would allow the city to save about $1.2 billion altogether on such spending in its budget. (The state and city each pay 25 percent of welfare and Medicaid; the Federal Government pays for the rest.)
"Unfortunately, the fiscal stability of New York has slipped to the point where we have to take these drastic measures to balance the budget," said the city's Budget Director, Marc V. Shaw.
"The state and Federal government are not going to bail out the city with cash," Mr. Shaw said. "So faced with that reality, the City of New York would be two-faced if it did not treat seriously the chance to consider new ways to slow down spending on entitlements."
Of course, the administration could have made other choices. It could have cut police spending, demanded additional productivity from workers or even raised taxes. But Mr. Giuliani's personal predilections and the national mood apparently ruled that out.
"The climate is so profoundly different since November that people in public life no longer defend things that they once thought were absolute necessities," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
"The Republican victory in Congress has basically cleared the way for New York State Republicans, both Giuliani and Pataki, to have carte blanche on budget policy, because whatever they do in New York is still not as mean-spirited as what they do in Washington."
Many advocates of the Mayor's approach say that the city's deteriorating fiscal condition requires deep cuts in programs for the poor. Since almost a third of the city's spending involves service to the poor, in one form or another, they say it should not be surprising that closing a huge budget gap would involve large cuts in aid to the poor.
Some also argue that the city has long spent too much on social services and other aid to the poor, making New York uncompetitive with other regions. A cutback has been long overdue, they say.
"The reason things seem so Draconian now is that decisions that should have been made over a decade have to be made at once," said Mr. Siegel of the Progressive Policy Institute. "In effect, we've used Medicaid as a jobs program. It's a kind of fool's gold, because you mine something that does not develop the local economy."
But Mr. Siegel said he feared that withdrawing so much aid to poor people, and poor neighborhoods, so quickly could have serious consequences. "I think the effect of the Medicaid cuts will be terribly deflationary," he said. "We're draining a lot of money out of the economy. But if we continued down this path, we'd end up in a situation where we would be uncompetitive all across the board."
Other supporters of Mr. Giuliani's plan said that short-term effect might not be so bad. "I think what we're seeing is not a dismantling, but probably the most significant review of the whole social welfare program that we've seen in 30 years," said Abraham Biderman, a former city housing and finance commissioner who is now an investment banker.
"The net will still be there, the cost will still be dramatic as compared to what existed before Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, but the city has never dealt with this segment of the budget this way. We're revisiting things that were sacred in the past."

HEADLINE: Merchants Fear Plans To Attract Big Stores

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Ten months ago James Novak moved his 18-year-old auto parts business from Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights across Flushing Bay to a thriving district in College Point because of what he called a decline in economic conditions.
Now he is being met with a new challenge: a city plan that would allow the opening of a megastore at the College Point Corporate Park just blocks away from his newly renovated business at 14th Avenue and 132d Street. 
 "If I had known about the plan, I would have given more thought to moving here," Mr. Novak said yesterday between sales of quarts of oil and jugs of antifreeze. "It would eliminate the small mom-and-pop shops that make up this community. I'm going to send out a few dozen letters to city officials."
Complaints like these are likely to multiply as a result of a proposal unveiled by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at City Hall yesterday. The plan would open several neighborhoods to discount retailers and warehouse stores that were previously prevented by zoning laws from moving in.
The Mayor said the proposal would create new jobs and stimulate business in local communities.
Since megastore developers began eyeing New York City several years ago for potential sites, Queens has been the center of many clashes because of its suburblike qualities. Last summer residents of Astoria shot down a proposal for a Pathmark to open there and residents of Laurelton and Springfield Gardens are engaged in a bitter battle to prevent Pathmark from opening a branch in their community.
Some community leaders, merchants and members of the City Council reacted strongly against the Mayor's proposal yesterday, saying they would be precluded from waging such battles.
"It's a sad day for the city," Fred Mazzarello, president of the College Point Board of Trade, said of the Mayor's proposal. "The city's not going to get out of it what they think they will. These stores aren't going to generate jobs. They're going to take them away."
While officials with the city's Economic Development Corporation would not say what companies submitted proposals to open in the College Point Corporate Park, Mr. Mazzarello said PriceCostco, a wholesale membership warehouse, has blanketed the community with fliers asking for residents' support to open there. If the large discount store opened, selling clothes, automotive parts, pharmaceutical products, baked goods and groceries, it would be in direct competition with businesses like Mr. Novak's.
To develop the corporate park just off the Whitestone Expressway, the city is trying to attract retail companies and reclaim some of the tax revenue the city is losing to Long Island and New Jersey. The New York Times has signed a lease-purchase option for 32 acres at the site for a printing plant.
Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist and executive director of the Neighborhood Small Business Association, a group that has long opposed the arrival of megastores in the city, said the incentives in the Mayor's proposal to help small businesses are insufficient. The incentives include eliminating the law that requires businesses to sweep the streets, switching one-hour parking meters to two hours and setting up a coordinating agency to centralize the licensing and regulatory process.
Daniel Doherty, 45, owner of Nelco Hardware at 18-08 College Point Boulevard, believes he would be crushed by a megastore's opening at the corporate park and by Home Depot, which is scheduled to open at the old Taystee Bread factory in Flushing. He would be caught in the middle, he said.

HEADLINE: New Position On Rebel Flag In S. Carolina

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 18

 BODY:
A Republican who recently became Attorney General of South Carolina said on Friday that he would reverse the policy of his predecessor and seek to keep the Confederate battle flag atop the South Carolina Statehouse unless the Legislature decides to take it down.
The Attorney General, Charlie Condon, asked the State Supreme Court to either dismiss a lawsuit challenging the flag or allow him to prepare a new brief outlining the state's new position. 
 The court is considering a lawsuit by business and civic leaders, including Mayor Bob Coble of Columbia, who say the flag hurts the city and state's economic growth and is an inappropriate reminder of slavery.
In 1962, the Legislature adopted a resolution that put the flag atop the Statehouse, which with the defeat of recent attempts to take it down gives the banner legal authority to remain in place unless the Legislature says otherwise, Mr. Condon said.
South Carolina is the only state that still flies the Confederate battle flag, which has white stars on a diagonal blue bands with a red background, above its statehouse. Mississippi and Georgia incorporate the design in their state flags, which also have brought protests.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People organized marches against the flying of the flag last summer in Myrtle Beach and in Hilton Head over the Labor Day weekend. The group has also threatened an economic boycott against the state if the flag keeps flying, although it said it would take no action until the State Supreme Court rules on the challenge.
The flag's supporters say it is an important part of the region's heritage that honors those who fought in the Civil War.
Mr. Condon, a Republican who took office last month, said during last year's campaign that he thought the former Attorney General, Travis Medlock, was wrong when he ruled in October that there was no legal authority to fly the flag.
Mr. Medlock, a Democrat, refused to defend the state in the lawsuit. He did not return messages left at his home and office on Friday.
Richard Gergel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

A Dropout Returns

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
A benevolent ruler is felled by a mysterious illness and is widely rumored to be mad -- then returns to power months later none the worse for wear. While this happens to be the plot of Alan Bennett's "The Madness of King George," it is also the true story of Neil Rudenstine, the president of Harvard.
Suffering from "severe fatigue and exhaustion of unknown origin," Mr. Rudenstine abruptly vacated the most visible job in American higher education in November, setting off both rumors about his mental state and a national reassessment of the role of university presidents in a stressful age. During his absence, The Wall Street Journal questioned his ability to pass Management 101 at Harvard's own Business School. The Harvard Crimson described him as "a grind," with "few grand accomplishments to show for his hard work" during his three-year tenure. 
 But Mr. Rudenstine is back, defending his record and saying the only ailment he had was indeed exhaustion. On Thursday he officially returns to his office. Last Thursday I visited him at home here, in the forbidding mansion, well removed from the campus, where Harvard has safely ensconced its presidents since tear gas flooded Harvard Yard in the late 1960's.
Wearing a terminally Ivy blazer without a tie, as well as a deep tan picked up in the Caribbean, Mr. Rudenstine looks far too young and fit for someone who just celebrated his 60th birthday. When he describes himself as "very healthy" and his mind as "clicking along," the protestations sound redundant.
Nor has he been much chastened by his sabbatical. Though others may have seen his flameout as a sign that a university president can no longer be all things to all constituencies -- from a high-powered C.E.O. to an avuncular scholar-administrator to a national intellectual force -- Mr. Rudenstine disagrees.
He still believes the presidency of Harvard is a doable job, and one primarily concerned with the university's educational mission, even at a time when he must spearhead an unprecedented $2.1 billion fund-raising drive mandating the raising of $1 million a day. Though he will be delegating some duties to others, he will not disown the operating style that drives him to write staggering numbers of handwritten notes and play a hands-on role in what some critics feel is academic minutiae. His aim "is to be more efficient without being less personal."
Mr. Rudenstine's efficiency does not extend to being on-line. He doesn't use a computer. Which is what's both appealing and worrisome about him. Like George III, both he and the kingdom he runs may be straddling a fault line of perilous historical change.
He sees the crisis as coming from without, not within. Should the 104th Congress cut Federal student aid, he says, it will be "the first major reversal in more than a century" of the goal of making higher education affordable to "all students of talent and motivation from all backgrounds." (Mr. Rudenstine himself was a scholarship student.) Should cuts in research funding follow, so will a decline in "the quality and capacity of the human capital that's actually out there leading and running our society."
But can a Harvard president do anything about it? Mr. Rudenstine says he will speak out in Washington, but realistically adds that "religious colleges" and what he calls "small colleges" -- Kennesaw State, perhaps? -- may make more of a political difference than the culturally elite Harvard right now. Gone are the days when a Harvard president like James B. Conant could command the attention of the nation. Mr. Rudenstine says he must compete not only with far more university voices than Conant did in the 1930's but with a cacophonous society mirroring talk radio.
Besides, he adds, we now live in an era where so much of "the action" has shifted to the economic and political arenas that "education itself has fallen down in terms of the nation's priorities." And if education is not a high American priority, university presidents are not about to be "high on the list of what the nation listens to."
That Mr. Rudenstine is now strong enough to make himself heard is beyond question. Whether anyone listens or not will tell us more about the country's long-term health than it does about his own.

For Black Coaches, New Direction Needed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

 BODY:
DURING an interview last August, Rudy Washington, the executive director of the Black Coaches Association, predicted that the next level of dissent in intercollegiate athletics would not come from coaches.
"These students are going to be the biggest fear," Washington said. "Not the coaches." 
 Six months later, Washington's prediction has come true,
At Rutgers, more than 150 students, most of them African-American, walked on the basketball court before the start of the second half in a game between Rutgers and Massachusetts. The students proceeded to accomplish something the coaches' group had threatened but never pulled off: they forced a game to be called off. The students were protesting statements made last November by Francis Lawrence, the president of Rutgers, but only recently made public.
During a discussion of standardized test scores, Lawrence cited statistics showing that blacks scored relatively low. He suggested they were genetically incapable of doing better. "Do we set standards in the future so we don't admit anybody? Or do we deal with a disadvantaged population that doesn't have that genetic, hereditary background to have a higher average?" he said.
Washington applauded the Rutgers protesters for their "courage" and said: "Their fortitude in a very difficult situation exemplifies a true strength of character. Ten years from now we may consider this incident to be the watershed in the fight for educational opportunity."
The protest was actually an evolutionary outgrowth of a protest movement the B.C.A. began on Jan. 14, 1989 when John Thompson, head coach at Georgetown, left the court to protest the passage of a measure he felt would hinder economically disadvantaged athletes in earning athletic scholarships.
Since then, members of the association, especially Thompson, John Chaney of Temple, Nolan Richardson of Arkansas and George Raveling, the former Southern California coach, have been at the forefront of the battle for increased opportunities in intercollegiate athletics for African-American and other minorities.
But this time the B.C.A. missed an opportunity to ignite a movement it actually predicted.
The Rutgers president, in referring to "genetic, hereditary background," put a tangible face on a deeply rooted issue the B.C.A. exposed last year. The association learned that key members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's data analysis group had strong ties to Beyondism, a eugenics-oriented movement that espouses genetic and racial superiority.
At the time, the B.C.A. had nothing tangible to hang its hat on except the names of faceless individuals who played down their association with Beyondism and remained out of the limelight.
"I began to wonder if maybe I was a little paranoid, then up pops the devil," John Thompson said in a telephone interview yesterday, referring to the attitude reflected in the type of comment Lawrence made. "We've been saying all along that this mentality exists. It exists in the N.C.A.A., in higher education. It exists, of all places, at the presidential level."
Unfortunately for the B.C.A., Thompson made his remarks yesterday, more than a week after the Rutgers incident. There was not a hard, sharp B.C.A. stance on Lawrence's comments.
The most vocal coach was Chaney, who said he supported the protest but at the same time chided the students and said they were "misdirected."
Lawrence later disavowed the remark, saying he had jumbled his words and that he did not believe that hereditary factors determine ability and achievement.
Chaney said he accepted Lawrence's later apology. But Chaney suggested that when Lawrence made the remark, he was expressing his true feelings, and the coach said than rather than replace him with someone who would be less forthcoming, students should work with Lawrence. "Do you want the devil you know or the devil you don't know?" Chaney asked Wednesday after a game with Rutgers.
Thompson said that he didn't want to make a personal attack on Lawrence, but that the more he thought about the comments, the less inclined he was to pass them off as a careless linguistics lapse. "This was not just a slip of the tongue," he said. "This was a deep statement interjected in conversation that was intended to be handled subtly or privately."
In retrospect, Thompson agreed that the B.C.A. would have been better served by a more penetrating response to the larger issue of eugenics and the narrower issue of sustaining broad-based student protests. But from now until late March, a coach's focus is basketball.
"The timing is bad for us," Thompson said. "Everyone is involved with our teams, the various struggles and doing our jobs."
More than anything, the Rutgers controversy dramatically underlines the need for the B.C.A. to appoint a full-time executive director and establish a national office in Washington.
This is an absolute must if the B.C.A. is to avoid being perceived as a stagnant association more concerned with protecting status -- and status quo -- than widening the window of opportunity.
Rudy Washington often points out that the fear of the riot is often worse than the riot itself. But the B.C.A. has run out of threats and, in the case of Rutgers, came up short on providing direction as well.
There was a movement in Piscataway, ready to be ignited. The B.C.A. wasn't prepared to strike a match.

'Disrespect for Game' A Managerial Lament With Modern Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 18

 BODY:
Managers, in the early days of this spring training, don't have players to talk about, at least none they want to talk about, so some of them express their concerns about the players who aren't in Florida and Arizona and aren't expected any time soon.
Tony La Russa of Oakland and Joe Torre of St. Louis spoke not of specific players but of players as a group, lamenting the changes they have seen develop over the years. 
 "The players, especially the ones you need most, are more and more disrespectful to everybody -- other members of the organization, to fans," La Russa said. "They can't be bothered with this request or that request. They're disrespectful to past players. Former players walk into the clubhouse and they look at them like, how good could they have been; they didn't make this kind of money."
Simply put, La Russa said, the players have a "disrespect for the game." The message, he said, "has to go out to them that they've got to change the way they view it."
Torre said the problem is money. He wasn't campaigning on behalf of the owners to induce the players to accept management's position in the stalled negotiations, but he made a point that even people on the players' side of the labor dispute have seen and commented on in recent years.
"I don't think many players are aware of what went on 20 years ago, how this came about," Torre said, referring to the lucrative economic position players enjoy. "They have no idea of where the money came from. They feel they have it coming."
In his time as a player, Torre was intimately involved in off-field developments, first as a club player representative, then as the National League representative. Some people might see his current views as the typical reaction of former players to those playing now, the new generation of players and all that.
But 25 years after Curt Flood and nearly 20 years after Andy Messersmith, a player survey on the relationship of those names to the current players' wealth could produce embarrassing results. Younger players especially act as if baseball history began with them, as if they are entitled to salaries in the millions.
"I have trouble with guys," Torre said, "who are negotiating between four and five million and they don't want four million because, they say, they're thinking of their family. That sort of thing doesn't go over well with the public. Don't flaunt it."
But Bob Gibson, the Hall of Fame pitcher who is back in the game after a 10-year absence, added some perspective.
"I haven't been altogether away from the game that I don't understand that things have changed," the Cardinals' new bullpen coach said. "It's not just players; it's society. I've been involved in society, so players aren't going to be any different."
Torre himself provided a note of perspective showing that it's not only players who have changed. Consider autograph seekers, the manager said.
"I've seen kids get my autograph, then go give it to somebody and he gives him a buck or two," Torre related. "You ask a kid's name so you can write 'To Billy,' and he says, 'Oh no, just sign your name.' Not even 'best wishes.' "
Adulterated autographs don't sell, and autograph seekers no longer seek players' signatures to put in a scrapbook or a desk drawer. If one of the worst modern practices of players is to charge for their autographs and if they need an excuse for doing it, the collecting industry has given it to them.
 
An Innocent Victim
 Sam Mejias, the Seattle Mariners' first base coach, has become an unintended victim of the strike. A resident of the Dominican Republic, Mejias has been unable to get into this country to work, even though he has a P1 visa. Because the Labor Department has certified the players strike, the immigration department won't allow foreign nationals into the country to work with P1 visas at strike sites.
The Players Association pursued the certification, intending to block the clubs from bringing in replacement players from Latin America and elsewhere. Now the Mariners might need a replacement coach.
 
Anderson's Viewpoint
 Sparky Anderson is notorious for ascribing Hall of Fame qualities to untested rookies. Now he has graduated to front office executives. Discussing his decision to step aside as the Detroit manager for replacement baseball, Anderson told of his conversations with John McHale Jr., the Tigers' new president.
"They got something there," Anderson said of the 46-year-old McHale. "I mean they got themselves a catch. If they leave this man alone and let this man go about his business and let him do his work, they finally got a catch. I really believe if they leave this guy alone for two years, McHale is going to clean this mess up."
Anderson publicly disclosed for the first time the real story behind his 16-day leave during the 1989 season. At the time, the Tigers said he was exhausted.
"That thing had nothing to do with anything but my daughter," he said. "My daughter was going through a terrible thing with her husband. That was a very concerning thing. She was seven months pregnant and getting anorexic over this thing. This guy was putting her through the wringer. When I got home, I got that straightened out. Jim Campbell was very good about the way he covered it," he said, referring to the Tigers' then-chairman. "I told Jim, I don't want my daughter brought up in this. Jim, as always, knows how to cover things. He said, we'll say it's fatigue."
Anderson also spoke about his 1995 salary of $1.2 million, though he didn't acknowledge the figure. "This was the first time I asked for the money," he related. "I said a number. I kind of shook when I said it. I heard a couple things what guys were getting, and I said if that guy's going to get that, I should get this. I went to the top very fast."
Anderson said he doesn't want anyone to salute him for shunning replacement baseball. The person to cheer, he said, is Cal Ripken, whose consecutive-game streak could end with the first replacement game.
"Just imagine what he's risking," Anderson said. "Is that character? You think I got character? I got to take a back seat to old Calvin. That is strong character that you cannot buy. It's unassailable. This man does not deserve not to have a legitimate shot at it."
Not only does Anderson not like replacement players, but he also doesn't care for strikers who would return to work before the strike ends.
"You and me play together," he said. "If you're going to suffer, don't I have to suffer? Why are you different than me? Why do you have to take the bow and arrows and I don't have to. We started out on an even playing field. Mine got rocky so now I'm supposed to cry and squeal and run for cover? No. When the field gets rocky. you got to be there. You can't go back and forth. You're not allowed to do that."

An Antitrust Settlement With a Glitch

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

 BODY:
Seven months after Federal antitrust officials declared they had reined in the mighty Microsoft Corporation, they saw their work rebuffed by a hard-nosed judge.
Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin refused to approve a consent decree between the Government and Microsoft, calling the deal "too little, too late." 
 At issue is Microsoft's power over the market for personal computer software. The company's flagship programs -- the MS-DOS operating system and Windows -- are used on more than 50 million personal computers. Critics say that Microsoft has employed a host of unfair tactics to block rival operating systems.
The Justice Department, after a year-long investigation, targeted a narrow set of Microsoft's licensing practices for prosecution. Microsoft's investors were relieved that the plan was so mild.
But Judge Sporkin wouldn't go along. "The U.S. Government," he said, "is either incapable or unwilling to deal effectively with a potential threat to this nation's economic well-being."
An appeals court will have to settle the issue. In an odd twist, the Justice Department and Microsoft are now on the same side; both oppose the pugnacious judge.

THE DE-MORALIZATION OF SOCIETY
From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values.
By Gertrude Himmelfarb.
314 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
THERE are 12-year-olds who were not even born when Margaret Thatcher first called for a return to Victorian values; yet the echoes of that electioneering remark seem to be growing louder. Her cocktail of Victorian virtues consisted of hard work, self-reliance, thrift, cleanliness, self-respect, neighborliness and patriotism. The recipe has changed in a few details since then, and in the United States one version is being served up as "family values." For Gertrude Himmelfarb, an emeritus professor of history at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, the cocktail is still tempting. She argues in "The De-Moralization of Society" that the material, political and social gains made since Victorian times have been blighted by "no less considerable losses in moral well-being." Miss Himmelfarb says she does not want to turn back the clock, but she finds much to admire in Victorian morality, and much to mourn in the loss of it.
Her excellent history of 19th-century ideas ought to raise the level of debate about family values. Yet the polemical heart of her book is just as likely to do the opposite. For although Miss Himmelfarb certainly sheds light on the Victorians, it is not clear that the same can be said for her account of us.
Her argument about the "de-moralization" of today's Britain and United States goes like this: Our problem is not that we have the wrong morality, but that we do not, in effect, have any morality at all. Our age is a "thoroughly relativistic" one, in which we are "constantly beseeched to be 'nonjudgmental.' " The result is a "reluctance to speak the language of morality." Miss Himmelfarb provides dramatic charts on illegitimate births and on crime, both of which show a steep upswing since about the 1960's. This, it would seem, is what you get if you forget "the importance of an ethos that does not denigrate or so thoroughly relativize values as to make them ineffectual and meaningless."
Until you stop to think about it, this kind of thing can sound plausible. But look at the matter another way. What exactly are we alleged to be less judgmental about? Abortion (to take a characteristically modern issue)? Plenty of people think it is plain wrong to have an abortion, and plenty of other people think it is plain wrong to interfere with a woman's right to choose. Neither side could exactly be described as "nonjudgmental" about the values of the other.
Perhaps our overtolerance is more easily found in small issues -- the treatment of animals, factories that pollute, smoking. Hmm. "Nonjudgmental" still doesn't quite catch the spirit of the age here. Maybe these topics aren't serious enough to get to the bottom of our de-moralization. What about the sorts of offenses aggregated in Miss Himmelfarb's crime charts? Is it murder, theft or rape that we are no longer prepared to condemn? Well, no. Moral judgment about these things still seems to be quite popular, actually.
In fact, moral judgment still seems to be quite popular, period, even about consensual sex. One of the few pieces of direct evidence about contemporary attitudes that are cited by Miss Himmelfarb is a National Opinion Research Center survey that says 90 percent of people "believe it to be always or almost always wrong" for a married person to have sex with someone other than his or her spouse.
Ah -- but they still commit adultery, don't they? And look at those charts; look at what people practice, not what they preach. But that would wreck Miss Himmelfarb's argument. For when she defends the Victorians against the charge that their age was ruled by "cruelty, misery, drudgery, squalor and ignorance," she rightly urges us not to confuse moral values with social realities. It is not enough, she says, for critics of Victorian values to argue that many Victorians often violated those values, for "values remain values . . . even if they are not always carried out in practice." If that goes for the Victorians, it goes for us, too. The fact that we (or some of us) commit murder or adultery does not show that our society is nonjudgmental about such things.
So where are all the morality-shy relativists whom Miss Himmelfarb bemoans? It seems they mostly work for government. "You can't impose your standards on someone else," she quotes former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders as saying. "I don't like to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children out of wedlock is just wrong," said the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, who evidently does suffer from an un-Victorian "reluctance to speak the language of morality" (but doesn't seem to mind self-contradiction). Now we are getting somewhere. It all boils down to sex, marriage and children. That is what Dr. Elders was talking about, that is all Miss Himmelfarb offers hard evidence about and that is one of the few areas in which her claim of relativism seems to be right.
We are indeed more tolerant than the Victorians about premarital sex, religion and a couple of other things. Miss Himmelfarb tactfully refrains from inciting us to a Victorian-style condemnation of non-Christian religions or of homosexuality. Instead, she focuses her disapproval on illegitimacy, which now accounts for more than 30 percent of births in Britain and the United States. But it is worth asking what exactly the parents of these illegitimate children are rejecting. Not two-parent family life, on the whole. In Britain, according to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, three-quarters of illegitimate births are registered by both parents, a rising proportion of whom already live together at the time of registration. Miss Himmelfarb tries to run illegitimacy and single-parent families together as if they were the same thing, but they are not. Single-parent families are overwhelmingly the product of marital breakdown, not of illegitimacy: in both Britain and America, census data show, the proportion of single-parent families headed by a mother who has never been married is less than one-third.
Miss Himmelfarb admits that unmarried cohabitation "complicates" the issue of illegitimacy, but insists that it is "no substitute for marriage, since such arrangements are far less stable than marriages, only 16 percent lasting more than five years." She continues: "This compares with a 10-year average for marriages that end in divorce -- and, of course, most marriages do not end in divorce." Well, there are lies, damned lies and statistics, but that deserves some sort of prize. Miss Himmelfarb takes her "16 percent" from a newspaper article, which quoted a study, which got it from a British survey. And what the survey actually says is that by 1989 only 16 percent of the unmarried couples in its sample had already been cohabiting for more than five years, which merely reflects the fact that cohabitation was then very new to Britain. Ten years earlier, a mere 3 percent of single women under 50 were cohabiting with a man; by the time the survey was finished, more than a quarter were. Times were thus changing, but not fast enough to show how long such unions would last. Especially not if they involved children.
The truth of the matter? In 1992, Susan McRae of the Policy Studies Institute in London looked at a broad sample of women who had had illegitimate births five years earlier while cohabiting: 77 percent were still cohabiting. And many of the couples had been living together for several years before the birth of the children. So such unions do not seem to be "far less stable" than marriage at all. Besides, after five years of parenthood nearly half of these mothers were married -- though their children, of course, were counted among the illegitimate births that so distress Miss Himmelfarb.
The past, Miss Himmelfarb notes at one point, is a foreign country. What seems to get forgotten in her romp through statistics is that the present is a foreign country, too. It calls for analysis that is no less careful than a study of the distant past needs to be. And that goes for crime as well as for family life.
The police records that Miss Himmelfarb uses to prove an unparalleled rise in crime in recent decades are notoriously hard to interpret. They are affected by all kinds of factors: burglary statistics, for example, rise with the spread of household insurance, which gives victims a greater incentive to report break-ins. Comparisons of police records with the results of victim surveys show that crime in general is underreported, and presumably always has been. This muddies Miss Himmelfarb's neat charts because nobody knows how fast the gap between crime and recorded crime has been closing. If, say, a Victorian servant raped by her employer was less likely to go to the police than a college student is to go to a support unit after being the victim of a date rape, then actual rapes may not have increased in the way the records suggest.
There is just one crime that criminologists can confidently track over long periods. That is murder, and it does not fit Miss Himmelfarb's story of unparalleled contemporary wickedness. Murder rates peaked in the United States in 1980, but at a level not significantly higher than the peak that came and went with Prohibition. Was Al Capone de-moralized by a nonjudgmental ethos? Or did the opportunities and pressures created by that eminently Victorian project of Prohibition have something to do with it?
Come to think of it: if the citizens of Britain and the United States are so tolerant and nonjudgmental, why is it politically impossible to advocate an end to the unsuccessful prohibition of drugs?

HEADLINE: Formal Wear for Expectant Mothers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
AN invitation to a black-tie dinner or a formal wedding sends most women into a what-to-wear? panic, but when you are five months' pregnant, finding a dress to suit a grand occasion presents a real challenge.
"I needed something smart and fashionable," said Sharon Robinson, who is expecting her first baby in June. "I wanted to do my husband proud at a black-tie dinner held at the Waldorf for Manhattan College, which was his school. But I didn't want to spend a fortune on a one-time-occasion dress, and the few evening things I saw in maternity shops were out of the question. Either they were ugly or they were too expensive." 
 Ms. Robinson, a civil engineer in White Plains, said she solved her problem when she learned about Loretta Chiavetta, who owns Formal Expectations in Pleasantville, a shop that rents dressy and evening maternity clothes.
"I made an appointment to visit the shop after work, and I was thrilled to find the perfect outfit," Ms. Robinson said. "It was a two-piece, floor-length black velvet, with a top that dipped in the back, which was fastened with rhinestone clips. It was perfection. I had a great time at the dinner, probably because I felt I looked good."
And looking good during pregnancy is half the battle, said Ms. Chiavetta, adding that she got the inspiration for her rental business when she could not find anything to wear to the 1989 Emmy awards.
"I was in the corporate fast lane then, working as an international TV sales executive at Sanbow Productions in Manhattan," she said. "My territory was the Far East, mainly Singapore and Hong Kong. I sold existing U.S. animated children's programs to customers there."
In the course of her job, she said, she was required to attend dinners and evening affairs on a regular basis. "When I became pregnant with my first child," she said, "I needed maternity evening clothes, so I went to Saks Fifth Avenue. "They had a big maternity department then, but I was shocked at the prices. Anything really nice started at $500."
As luck would have it, she was out of town for the Emmy awards so that presented no problem. "But the whole occurrence started me thinking about rentals," she said. "Men have been renting tuxedos forever. And shops renting evening dresses for women were around, but I couldn't find one that rented good-looking maternity clothes. I thought it might be an idea for a business but the business was not for me. I was committed to my job."
But when her son Daniel, who is now 7, was 1 year old, "something tragic happened that impelled me to examine my own life and my priorities," Ms. Chiavetta said. "A close friend of mine, who was coming home from a routine business trip in London, died in the Pan Am 103 disaster." She said she then realized she was going in the wrong direction.
"I was missing my life," she said. "My son was already a year old, and I wasn't there when all the important things were happening. I knew I wanted to stay home. I wanted to get off the career track."
Nine months later, in November 1989, she said she incorporated Formal Expectations, a maternity rental service, and she was running the business out of her apartment in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
 "My husband, David, who is a manager for Kodak, was very supportive," she said. "He agreed that we would invest $10,000 of our savings to start my business. Most of it went to buy clothes, which I got directly from the manufacturers. I sent out press releases announcing the service as the first of its kind in the tristate area, which it was."
But her first and best customers were friends or friends of friends, all successful career women. "They would come after work because I saw them by appointment," she said.
 "They were women with good jobs who not only had to look good but who had no time to shop."
After she made an appearance on WNBC-TV News and placed an ad in a parents' magazine, her business began to snowball.
 "I felt I understood the needs of the market," she said. "But I made my share of mistakes, like buying dresses with fancy skirts that could not be hemmed, or buying styles that could not easily be altered."
A year after the Chiavettas bought a house in Pleasantville, Ms. Chiavetta felt confident enough about the success of her business to open a store. "There is so much more business in the suburbs," she said. "I was amazed. Women here have cars. They have mobility, and they can drop in whenever they please."
The store, she said, stocks more than 300 pieces ranging from mix-and-match separates to elaborate sequined floor-length evening dresses.
Claudia Graham, a nurse who lives in Peekskill, is having her first child at the end of March. Ms. Graham recently visited Formal Expectations and selected a black-velvet pants suit to wear to a business dinner.
"It was a gorgeous outfit," she said. "I was complimented on it all evening. And the price was great. I never could have bought nor would I have bought it for a one-time occasion."
Ms. Chiavetta said: "Women come to me for something extraordinary. I have customers who rent clothes two or three times during a pregnancy. They go to a lot of events, and they want to look different at every one. Some rent outfits for a whole week, like executives who may have to go to company meetings in Florida on short notice. So I stock good-looking summer clothes all year around."
Rental prices at Formal Expectations range from $29 for a dressy shirt or pants to $99 for an evening dress that will wholesale for $600. A security deposit is required with every rental. Ivory and black are the most popular colors, Ms. Chiavetta said, and the shelf life of the clothes is about 10 wearings.
"We take hems up," she added. "We put hems down. I have a wonderful seamstress who does the alterations, but there's a lot of wear and tear. Clothes are dry cleaned before every rental."
Occasionally, she said, she puts on fashion shows at maternity expos, and, she added, it was at such an expo that she became acquainted with owners of similar shops, like one in Washington.
"Now we help each other," Ms. Chiavetta said. "For example, I shipped her 30 outfits for the Clinton inauguration when she ran out of clothes. Now we're exploring the possibility of economies of scale by buying together."
Ms. Chiavetta has already expanded her store by adding christening dresses for babies.
 "All of them are handmade, and beautiful," she said. "We rent them for $40 to $50, which if they were bought would cost at least $300."
She said she was also considering offering another type of rental service. "A lot of women who wear large sizes are coming into the store and looking around," she said. "But they are embarrassed to wear maternity clothes, so many of them have asked me if I would stock evening wear in large sizes for them. And that may very well be my next venture."

The 13th Sign

BYLINE: By Cathleen Schine; Cathleen Schine is the author of "Rameau's Niece" and a regular contributor to this page.

 BODY:
Saturday. Yesterday I was an Aquarius. Today, I'm lost. A friend called to tell me that Jacqueline Mitton of the Royal Astronomical Society has announced the existence of a 13th astrological sign and the year has to be divided up differently and we've all been dislodged. Who am I? And what is my birthstone?
 
Sunday. Maybe I'll have to go to a singles bar and pick myself up, put my hand on my arm and say to myself smoothly: "Hi! What's your sign?" Do they still have singles bars? I'm too busy to go to a singles bar: I have to watch Court TV. I have an obligation. Should I become a "Citizen for Court TV"? There's a special number to call to become a Citizen for Court TV. "An idea as old as America," says the ad. I'd better call. After all, astrology is even older than America, and look what happened to it. 

Monday. When I was an Aquarius, I was intelligent, zany, iconoclastic, humanitarian, individualistic and unconventional and sought truth and knowledge. Like Lana Turner. Now that I'm a Capricorn I have to be dour, dutiful, driven, tenacious, plodding, persevering, organized, austere, scrupulous, cautious, economical, practical and uninspired. Like Richard Nixon. And Danny Thomas.

Tuesday. My favorite judge, Elliot Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, has been on Court TV for months presiding over a dramatic and disturbing wrongful-death case. Sometimes I turn to Channel 51, hoping against hope to see his impassive face. But the trial is over. I miss Justice Wilk. I wonder what sign he is. If he's been demoted to Capricorn like me, I would feel a little better. It's exhausting being driven and organized and dutiful. Justice Wilk would be a good role model in this confusing new order. He is my hero, for Justice Wilk is the ideal mother, and I want to be an ideal mother. In his last case, Tom Moore, described by the press as "flamboyant, fiery and determined," was the attorney for the plaintiff. Luke Pittoni, described by the press as "flamboyant, fiery and determined," was one of the defense attorneys. They both bear an eerie resemblance to my children. "Ju-udge, he's talking when I'm talking. . . . Ju-udge, he's doing it again, and you told him not to. . . . Why am I being sanctioned? I didn't do anything." "See you all Thursday," Justice Wilk says calmly in reply. He must have taken one of those Parent Effectiveness Training courses. And he doesn't even wear a robe.

Wednesday. I can't get used to being a Capricorn. I keep having these secret zany and intelligent feelings. They creep up on me. I'm really trying to be a Capricorn, but sometimes I have an almost unbearable iconoclastic urge. I'm sure Justice Wilk is in the same position. I feel a bond. I wonder if Justice Wilk ever leads PET workshops. I want to sign up. I want to sit high above my children, intelligent and iconoclastic once again, listen, nod my head the slightest bit and say evenly, "See you all Thursday." I want my children to call me Judge. But I want a robe, too.

Thursday A.M.: Where do you buy judges' robes? It's not so easy following in Justice Wilk's footsteps. "You may answer," I say to one son. "Do you want me to have to call a recess?" I ask the other, firmly but without anger. Then I remember that I'm now dour, tenacious and plodding, and I sulk in a dour, tenacious and plodding way for a while. But then I start yelling and chasing everyone around the house with a rolled-up newspaper. I'm confused. My new personality is no help at all. What am I going to do?

P.M.: I watched the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous" on Comedy Central, and I think it's possible that Edina, the outrageously irresponsible mom, might be a little easier than Justice Wilk to emulate, whatever my sign is. Drugs, drink and designer clothes! "Sweetie, darling," I drawl to the children, admirably imitating Eddie's accent, my aching head on the kitchen table. "Get Mummy some coffee."

Friday A.M.: Got the mail. Invited to a reading by William Kunstler. He's written a book of poetry. I bet Justice Wilk is a better poet. I miss Justice Wilk. That O. J. (Battered Man) Simpson is on Court TV again. Maybe in Los Angeles, Judge Ito passes for a maternal role model, but New Yorkers would never attend his PET seminar. Sometimes in the New York trial, the lawyers actually pushed each other. Those L.A. lawyers don't push. Or yell. Not loudly, anyway. They just stand there. Like sticks. Dapper, smarmy, slick defense sticks; droning prosecution sticks. What are they, a bunch of Capricorns? Don't they know how lawyers act? They're from Hollywood! Don't they go to the movies? Don't they know anything about trial law? Maybe they just haven't been notified of their new signs yet. I hope they've all been changed to Sagittarians -- philosophically inclined chatterboxes, boisterous and flighty know-it-alls with big thighs searching for wisdom in a friendly and outgoing manner.

P.M.: Looked through Kunstler's book of poetry. The Hallmark 7? There's even a sensitive rhyming ditty about O. J. The Lana Turner in me is offended. Where are we headed, America? Has our legal obsession really gone too far? I'm frightened. If my kids ever push their glasses up on their heads and write sonnets to the Central Park Jogger rapists, I'll have to adjourn for good and get my own coffee. See you all Thursday.

A Sioux Poet Whose Fiery Protests Now Come Packaged in Jewel Boxes

BYLINE: By JOHN MARCHESE 

 BODY:
THERE IS A LINE IN THE title track from the American Indian poet John Trudell's latest album, "Johnny Damas and Me," that would be ironic if it weren't simply dead-on accurate. "We've been laying real low," Mr. Trudell says over the rock riffs of electric guitarists, nearly chanting the lines in a voice once described by the writer Peter Matthiessen as "merry and harsh at the same time." "Laying real low in the shadow of the road to success."
It can be in America's nature to embrace its harshest critics occasionally, even turn a few into stars. John Trudell, 49, a Santee Sioux who headed the American Indian Movement during much of its confrontational and sometimes violent first decade in the 1970's, would be happy to emerge from the shadows. Although he describes his work as "leafleting," and his rhymed rants attack "the industrial ruling class" that presides over the "Nazi Babylon," Mr. Trudell's protests are now packaged in jewel boxes, and he wants to sell a million of them. 
 "If I'm lucky enough to do this," he says, "then I've created an economic base by using my mind, and in some ways my body through performing. They took all our land; I don't have any land to toil. My crops have to grow somewhere else."
Almost a year ago, the large independent record company Rykodisc began distributing "Johnny Damas and Me," Mr. Trudell's second release with the label. It has sold about 100,000 copies so far, twice the number of his 1992 debut record, "A K A Graffiti Man." Mr. Trudell is scheduled to perform at the Bottom Line on Wednesday and at Wetlands on March 2.
Some of his songs take love as their subject, but most are in some way political. "Money and authority/ have their own way of talking/ when it comes to the man/ versus what the woman said," he says in "Shadow over Sisterland," a song from the latest album. In "All There Is to It," an indictment of big business, Mr. Trudell defiantly looks authority in the face and repeats: "We don't believe what you say/ We don't believe what you say/ We don't believe what you say." His unusual combination of words and music, poetry and politics, is perhaps best described by the title of the first track from the album, "Rant and Roll."
"What he does works," says Don Rose, Ryko's president, who signed Mr. Trudell in 1991 after a pitch from the singer Jackson Browne, the executive producer on both albums.
The John Trudell sound is difficult to define, and for that reason it is difficult to market. Because he does not sing, Mr. Trudell seems to be a spoken-word performer. But Rykodisc has refused to label it that way. A number of critics have compared Mr. Trudell to another spoken-word performer, Lou Reed, but while the similarity is obvious, it is superficial. In his two Rykodisc recordings, the music ranges from pop-influenced love songs to heavy metal. Throughout, there are heavy doses of blues guitar and frequent use of American Indian singing. Sometimes, snatches of Mr. Trudell's words are sung by musicians in his backup band. But Mr. Trudell's big speaking voice -- often angry, often sad, only sometimes merry -- is always dominant.
"Words are accompaniment in many forms of rock-and-roll," Mr. Browne says. "That's not true with John. It's compelling as music. But what's there is in the dialogue. It can't be used as background music for conversation. It is the conversation."
Mr. Rose of Rykodisc says: "I felt that John's experience could be translated from a marketing standpoint."
John Trudell was born in 1946 on the Sioux reservation in northwestern Nebraska. His mother died when he was 6, and his boyhood was divided between Omaha (where his father worked) and his grandparents' house on the reservation. After a stint in the Navy, he moved to southern California and took classes in communications at a community college.
In the summer of 1969, Mr. Trudell heard that a coalition of organizations called Indians of All Tribes had occupied Alcatraz Island. He took his wife at the time and their two daughters and headed north.
"It just felt right to me," he says. He quickly became a leader of the occupation, emerging as spokesman for the cause. The occupation ultimately failed, but it galvanized political consciousness among American Indians. The American Indian movement sprang from its wake, and Mr. Trudell gravitated to those young, militant Indians like himself.
His first marriage ended about the time the occupation did, and in 1971 he moved to Oklahoma to work with an Indian agency. There he met a Paiute woman named Tina Manning. They married and had three children. The couple moved a lot, keeping up with the requirements of AIM advocacy. But the Trudells' home base was always Tina's Nevada reservation.
During a protest outside the F.B.I. headquarters in February 1979, Mr. Trudell burned an American flag in a soft snow. The next day, a fire broke out at his home in Nevada, killing Tina, who was pregnant, and their three small children. The Bureau of Indian Affairs concluded that it was accidental, but Mr. Trudell remains convinced that it was not.
"I have experienced within my own lifetime the attack of my winter camp and the killing of the women and children," Mr. Trudell says. "It left me even angrier than I was -- and I was never too calm to begin with. Between the years 1979 and 1984, I drove 250,000 miles. I just ran it out." During this time he began to write what he calls "my hanging-on lines."
Mr. Trudell drifted away from AIM and started working with nuclear energy opponents and environmentalists. At a 1979 rally to protest uranium mining near Mount Taylor, N.M., Mr. Trudell appeared on stage with Mr. Browne, who was performing.
"He was by far the most compelling speaker," Mr. Browne remembers, "very impassioned, with unflinching honesty and a certain good will -- even when he was talking about 500 years of abuses." The two became friends.
"Jackson appearing in my life just opened this door for me and gave me this place to be," Mr. Trudell says. "I knew I had to stop running. I had to be in a place. Los Angeles became that place. Jackson made sure I could survive in L.A."
Something about John Trudell attracts patrons. Mr. Matthiessen, who chronicled the American Indian movement in his book "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse," says Mr. Trudell had the personality to become "a kind of angry jester for the rich revolutionaries of the entertainment world."
Several times during the next 10 years, Mr. Trudell moved into Mr. Browne's home. Over the years, Kris Kristofferson and Bonnie Raitt have given him either moral or financial support. His friend Steven Seagal cast Mr. Trudell in a small role in his 1992 movie "Under Siege."
Mr. Browne says Hollywood people are attracted to Mr. Trudell's poignant personal story and his honesty. "People just took John to their hearts." Which is a good thing, Mr. Browne adds, because Mr. Trudell "is not too interested in solvency."
"He accepts the largess of friends," he says.
BY 1985, MR. TRUDELL, now a poet, met Jesse Ed Davis, a Kiowa Indian known from his work with Bob Dylan and Mr. Browne, as well as three records of his own. Mr. Trudell remembers Mr. Davis telling him, "I can make the music for your words." A collaboration began that lasted until Mr. Davis's death in 1988 and laid the foundation for Mr. Trudell's current work, both by helping to mix poetry with rock and by introducing Mr. Trudell to other influential people. One was Mr. Dylan, who was given a tape that Mr. Trudell had produced and was soon after quoted in Rolling Stone magazine saying that Mr. Trudell had made "the album of the year."
Mr. Trudell recently remembered meeting Mr. Dylan. "He told me," he says, "that what I was doing with music was revolutionary. And he said to stay with it -- don't change a thing, stay after it. That was encouraging because there were definitely some stretches that were like looking down a long tunnel." He has not quite come out the other side. "I'm basically a starving artist," Mr. Trudell says. "But that's got to change."

HEADLINE: MEXICO IS FACING NEW RESTRICTIONS TO GET U.S. HELP

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
After three days of intense negotiations with top Mexican officials, the United States is preparing to announce details of a plan to bail the country out of a continuing currency crisis, including newly toughened restrictions that are likely to send already high Mexican interest rates soaring.
Details of the plan were still being negotiated here tonight between Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, who has been in Washington since Thursday. A spokesman for Mr. Rubin said that negotiators were making progress, but it was unclear whether any agreement would be concluded on Monday. 
 The new conditions, described by Americans and Mexicans familiar with the talks, pose enormous political problems for President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.
To get the $20 billion in direct American help that the Clinton Administration announced last month, Mr. Zedillo's Government is agreeing to shrink Mexico's money supply, even if that means interest rates of 50 percent or more on business loans and home mortgages.
Also included in the draft of an agreement here is a toughening of a highly controversial condition that Washington is placing on the Mexicans: The United States would effectively control the flow of the billions of dollars that Mexico earns every year from the export of its oil, starting in the next few months.
Under an earlier plan, the United States would have control of Mexico's oil revenue, its biggest single source of foreign currency, if Mexico defaulted on some of its American-backed obligations.
The newer, even more stringent conditions seem bound to open Mr. Zedillo to charges at home that he has permitted the United States to dictate his country's economic policy, an enormously sensitive matter in Mexican politics.
But Clinton Administration officials, fearful that they will be blamed by both Republicans and Democrats if Mexico requires another bailout later this year, have insisted in recent days that there is no other choice.
Anything short of Draconian fiscal discipline, they insist, will mean that foreign investors continue to pull money out of the country -- and the problem the Administration raced to solve last month could return as a bigger crisis.
If a recession in Mexico follows -- which many Mexican and American economists consider a real risk -- the result could be more social unrest in the country, where a 14-month-long rebellion in a southern state, Chiapas, is already plaguing Mr. Zedillo's weakened three-month-old administration. Last week, his party overwhelmingly lost an election in a big western state, Jalisco, and several more such elections are scheduled later in the year.
At the heart of the negotiations between United States and Mexican officials this weekend was the Clinton Administration's fear that Mr. Zedillo, under growing political pressure, would be tempted to print more money or to lower interest rates before the coming state elections.
The result, in a nation where inflation was running in January at an annual rate of more than 45 percent, could be even steeper inflation. The current level is already a shock to Mexicans, because last year inflation dropped to less than 10 percent for the first time in recent memory.
However, maintaining interest rates at a high level -- they are already more than 40 percent to keep up with the rising inflation -- seems bound to touch off a recession, and with it the possibility of kindling for social unrest.
"This is scary," said Jonathan E. Heath, an economist in Mexico City. "A recession is already unavoidable. The concern for the United States Government is probably that if you start pursuing a very restrictive monetary policy, and things start to get bad, the Mexican Government will want to let up."
That is what Washington says Mexican officials did last year, as the Presidential election neared.
When the Clinton Administration announced its plan last month, Mexican officials knew that it would carry tough conditions that would be difficult to sell at home.
But they were not counting on such a large run-up in inflation in January, making it all the more painful to meet the plan's conditions. Similar conditions apply to about $30 billion in other help promised to Mexico in the last month, including $17.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund.
"Investors are still nervous about Mexico," a White House official said last week, after the value of the peso had again dropped. "And if the markets are nervous, we have to be nervous."
A Mexican finance official familiar with the discussions said tonight that even before Mr. Ortiz left for Washington last week, there was an understanding that with inflation and interest rates above what had been forecast, the Government would have little choice but to tighten the money supply.
"We recognize there's not going to be an easy way out," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "What they're talking about in Washington now is just a difference of degree."
The official said the Mexican Government recognized the social risks involved in such moves and was preparing several responses, including an emergency jobs plan, using funds from an antipoverty program. The Government will also zero in on areas of high unemployment and political instability with more than 500,000 job-training grants.
The first victims of the tight monetary plan are expected to be Mexico's weaker banks. At least 8 of the 18 major banks are already considered on the brink because many of their clients cannot repay loans carrying variable interest rates that have soared in recent weeks. There are virtually no fixed-rate loans available in Mexico, so everyone from large companies to ordinary homeowners have been hit hard by the fallout from the currency crisis.
Several of those banks seem likely to be merged in the next few weeks, for fear that investors, particularly United States investors, would otherwise remove funds invested in certificates of deposit in the last year or so. The banks are holding about $8 billion in such assets now, and if these are not reinvested, the money is expected to fly to safer havens.
Under previous pressure from the United States, Mexico had agreed to open its banking system to acquisitions by foreign banks.
All this is expected to put great pressure on Mr. Zedillo, an economist by training. In the last few days, he has been on the phone to Mr. Ortiz and to top United States officials, who have tried to lay out the economic and political tradeoffs.
They have told him that while the tight monetary policy would be painful for the next year or so, it was the best hope of stabilizing the economy. At the same time, they are trying to give him some political cover, so that it does not appear he has fully capitulated to American conditions.
One of the provisions carrying the most potential volatility is proposed American control of the revenue from Mexico's oil, a cherished national asset and the source of $7 billion to the Government each year.
When Mr. Rubin described the bailout plan in Congressional testimony several weeks ago -- after President Clinton abandoned any hope of getting Congress to pass the program and acted on his own to provide Treasury funds for loans and loan guarantees -- he said that "in the unlikely event" that Mexico defaulted on its United States-backed loans, foreign purchasers of Mexican oil would be required to remit their payments to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That money, in turn, would be used to pay American investors.
But members of Congress including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, charged that the plan provided insufficient protection. And Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Mr. Rubin it was ludicrous to think that Washington would cut off Mexico's oil earnings, for fear that such a move would cause wide protests.
To mute such Congressional criticism, the new accord would require foreign buyers of Mexican oil to send their payments through the New York Federal Reserve Bank, starting in the next few months, regardless of how well Mexico was paying off its obligations.
It is unclear, however, whether that move alone would satisfy Mr. D'Amato, who, with other members of Congress, introduced a bill last week requiring the Treasury to issue much fuller reports about the details and progress of its bailout effort.

After three days of intense negotiations, the United States is preparing to announce the details of its plan to bail Mexico out of its continuing currency crisis, including toughened restrictions that are likely to send interest rates in Mexico soaring. [Page A1.]
Two months after devaluation set off Mexico's current crisis, the shock waves are rippling south. The Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires stock markets fell almost every trading day in February. [D1.] 
 After years in which it lectured the United States on the need to reduce its budget deficit, Japan is facing a deficit of its own that is by, some measures, larger than the United States'. Yet many economists say Japan's fiscal condition is not as bleak as is painted by its conservative Finance Ministry. [D1.]

Employers say one-fifth of American workers are not fully proficient in their jobs, and they express a lack of confidence in the ability of schools and colleges to prepare young people for the workplace, according to the first national survey done by the Census Bureau of hiring, training and management practices in American business. [A1.]
The nation's two big apparel unions, formed from some of the same roots early in the 20th century yet often bitter rivals, are about to join forces, with a combined membership of 350,000. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union are expected to announce merger plans today. [D1.]
 
Companies
When the airlines began imposing a $50 maximum on travel agency commissions a little less than two weeks ago, they seemed to have given the agents little choice. But travel agents have begun organizing rallies and demonstrations aimed at forcing the carriers to restore traditional 10 percent commissions. [D1.]
 
The Media Business
A news story as big and juicy as O. J. Simpson's trial would once have attracted huge audiences to the broadcast networks' evening news programs. But in the age of CNN, the trial has done the opposite, drawing viewers away from the newscasts and reducing their weeknight audiences as much as 10 percent. [D1.]
Smart Money magazine is tightening its rules regarding the investment practices of its outside contributors after a columnist's holdings in three stocks jumped in value by about $2.5 million after he endorsed those stocks in his column. [D2.]
Throughout NBC's challenge to the Fox network over ownership of its TV stations, many NBC executives described the action as right fighting wrong. Then NBC withdrew its F.C.C. petitions and announced a new business deal with Fox's owner, Rupert Murdoch. Bill Carter: Television. [D5.]
John F. Kennedy Jr. wants to make politics entertaining. He calls George, a magazine he has co-founded, a life-style publication about politics. He and his partner have signed with Hachette Filipacchi to start publishing George in September. [D5.]
The cost of book paper, which typically constitutes a third of the cost of manufacturing a book, has begun climbing, leaving publishers to devise ways to make up lost dollars. [D5.]
A judge in Nevada could earn a place in the anti-media hall of fame by making a formal determination that the local paper qualified as "garbage, rubbish or waste" under the law. [D5.]
 
Today's Column
A proposal to roll back a change in patent law is gaining support and generating debate. A professor of electrical engineering and a Congressman from California are stirring enthusiasm for the issue by casting it as a quest to save that mythic figure, the independent American inventor. Teresa Riordan: Patents. [D2.]

HEADLINE: Mexican Crisis Depressing Brazil and Argentina Stocks

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Two months after the start of Mexico's financial crisis, the shock waves are rippling south, depressing stock markets in Latin America's two other major economies -- Brazil and Argentina.
Despite rallies Friday, the markets in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires fell almost every trading day in February. Since Dec. 20, the day the Mexican crisis broke, Sao Paulo's Bovespa index has dropped 34 percent and Buenos Aires's Merval index has dropped 37 percent. 
 "There is a lot of potential supply, but virtually no demand," said Alden Brewster, New York partner for Banco Icatu, a Brazilian investment bank. "Speculators and bottom fishers don't want to go into what is perceived as a crisis situation."
While traders joke nervously about "submerging" markets, the steady outflow of capital from South America's largest stock markets is provoked by a variety of factors: rising interest rates in the United States, disappointment over a cautious privatization program in Brazil, and anxiety over a possible devaluation of the peso in Argentina.
Oddly, the sharp downturn in the Bovespa index in Sao Paulo coincides with a surge in long-term factory investment by foreign companies in Brazil. While hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing out of foreign-held stock portfolios in Brazil, foreign companies are pursuing 1995 investment plans in Brazil that total $5 billion, double the $2.5 billion invested last year.
Brazil investments by Ford Motor, Volkswagen and General Motors will total $2 billion through the end of 1996. With Brazil expected to repeat last year's growth of 5 percent, this year's overall investment rate is expected to hit 21 percent, a level not seen here since the "miracle" growth years of the 1970's.
While Brazil's production of color televisions, videocassette recorders and refrigerators is running at double the levels of two years ago, Sao Paulo's stock market, now Latin America's largest, is at its lowest level in 10 months.
Many foreign investors were heavy buyers of stocks in Brazil's state oil, electricity and telephone companies, gambling that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso would privatize these companies. But as a presidential candidate last fall, Mr. Cardoso said only that he would open these state monopolies to joint ventures with private partners. Last Thursday, he submitted to Brazil's Congress constitutional amendments to allow joint ventures.
"In the case of telephones, I cannot open to exploitation by private capital only the filet mignon, leaving the state with only the bones," Mr. Cardoso said when asked about disappointed stock market investors.
Today, stocks in the three state utility companies -- Petrobras, Eletrobras, and Telebras -- are worth roughly half of what they were in late September, a few days before Mr. Cardoso's election. Previously, foreign investment in Brazil's stock markets had soared.
"There is disappointment in the market over Brazil's definition of privatization," said Laurie W. Higgitt, director of Stephen Rose & Partners, a London brokerage firm specializing in Brazil and Argentina.
After Mexico's debacle with the overvalued peso, there also is concern that Brazil's new currency, the real, is overvalued by at least 25 percent. Used as a price anchor, the strong real contributes to Brazil's new low inflation rate -- about 1 percent a month.
Coinciding with an opening to imports, the strong currency has pushed Brazil from enjoying a fat trade surplus into watching a trade deficit run for three consecutive months. In November and December, the United States maintained trade surpluses with only two of its major trading partners -- Hong Kong and Brazil.
"The crisis in Mexico has not created any diversion for us; we are focusing on Brazil as one of the top three emerging export markets in coming years," Jeffrey E. Garten, United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said in an interview today in Rio, a stop in a 10-day tour of Argentina and Brazil.
Charles Dusseau, Florida's Secretary of Commerce, said after visiting Sao Paulo last week, "With everything that has happened to the Mexican peso, Brazil will be Florida's largest trading partner in 1995."
But Brazilians are afraid that their 1994 trade surplus of $10 billion will erode to a few billion dollars this year. Liquid reserves are already dipping, hitting $37 billion today, from a high of $41 billion last September.
"We can't keep losing reserves and we can't keep showing foreign trade deficits," said Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank president.
Fears about an overvalued currency are undermining South America's second-largest stock market -- Buenos Aires.
Although Argentina's peso can be devalued only through an act of Congress, nervous Argentines have withdrawn an estimated $2 billion from banks since the Mexican crisis. That is severely straining the banking system and forcing Argentina into an economic slowdown. In recent weeks, 1995 growth forecasts have been reduced to zero to 2 percent from the 5 or 6 percent level.
"Banks are delaying payments, there is no liquidity," said a Brazilian banker who asked not to be identified. "You have a country that is very much dependent on foreign money, and that spigot is off."

HEADLINE: Egypt Criticizes Israel on Nuclear Arms and Palestinian Talks

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, said today that after 15 years of relative serenity in relations with Israel, "serious difficulties" had emerged. At issue, he said, are Israel's nuclear weapons program and the "fragile and vulnerable" state of talks between Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
In a wide-ranging conversation here, he said Arab countries would insist that Israel accept some restraints on its nuclear arms, because of concerns that "Israeli extremists" could come to power and be tempted to use them. 
 Mr. Moussa spoke at his hotel here after attending meetings on Saturday with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, and the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat. The meetings failed to budge the frozen peace negotiations.
Mr. Peres sounded conciliatory in his response today, saying in a statement, "It is only natural that differences of opinions exist even among friends."
In impromptu remarks to reporters, he said talks on Saturday between Mr. Moussa and Mr. Arafat had softened disagreements over the slow pace of Mideast negotiations. But in an interview broadcast on Israeli television today, Mr. Peres complained about Iran's pursuit of nuclear research, saying, "Why isn't anyone saying anything to Iran?"
An unconfirmed report today in Maariv, an Israeli daily, said that as a conciliatory gesture, Israel was prepared to allow Egyptian scientists to visit their Israeli counterparts to discuss nuclear issues.
Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, would not comment beyond saying, "There are talks going on between us and the Egyptians on a possible compromise."
But Mr. Peres insisted that Israel had not wavered in its refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Israel's stated position is that it will not sign until it is satisfied that other Middle Eastern countries, notably Iran, Iraq and Libya, do not pose a nuclear threat.
Mr. Peres, Mr. Moussa and Mr. Arafat were in Paris at a conference on the future of the Mediterranean after peace comes about.
Mr. Moussa's remarks came at the end of a tense week during which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel accused him of leading a hostile campaign to embarrass Israel over the nuclear nonproliferation issue. The treaty to limit the number of countries with nuclear weapons is up for indefinite extension in April.
Israel has also charged President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt with impeding Israel's normalization of relations with other Arab countries and lining them up behind Egypt's stand on the nuclear treaty.
The United States, which supports Israel's position that its acquisition of nuclear weapons is a separate issue from the extension of the nonproliferation treaty, has hinted that it may penalize Egypt by reducing its $2 billion annual aid.
But Mr. Moussa said pressure would not dissuade Cairo, insisting that Israel must give concrete assurances that it would address Arab concerns.
The Israeli complaint against Egypt last week came during what many experts in Middle East affairs considered to be the low point in relations since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.
But the dispute over nuclear disarmament has taken center stage, as a number of Arab countries have said they stand behind Cairo, threatening to deal a blow to Washington's hopes that a majority of countries will renew their commitments to the nonproliferation treaty.
Israel is reckoned by Western intelligence services to have some 200 nuclear warheads. Although it has never acknowledged that officially, Israel has argued that it faces potential nuclear threats from Iran, Iraq and Libya.
But Mr. Moussa said that if Israel did not join a nuclear disarmament program, "the region is certain to slip into an arms race, which to our way of thinking would be a catastrophic development."
The adamant Egyptian position has puzzled Middle East experts, since the issue of Israel's nuclear weapons has not been raised in years and the consequences of American anger could bear heavy penalties for Egypt's hard-pressed economy.
But in recent weeks, several senior Egyptian policy makers said they hoped to reassert Egypt's regional influence, which they charged was being eroded deliberately by Israeli and American diplomacy.
They also noted a growing conviction in Cairo that American financial aid was bound for a substantial reduction anyway as part of an attempt by Washington to downgrade its strategic ties to Egypt.
Asked about Israeli concerns about Iran, Iraq and Libya, Mr. Moussa called the argument untenable in the face of close scrutiny.
"No one seriously believes that Libya threatens Israel," he said. "That's a bad joke. As for Iraq, it is under one of the strictest surveillance and monitoring regimes by the United Nations. And Iran is already a member of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Its facilities are open to inspection.
"It is not an exaggeration for us to be concerned about Israel's refusal to cooperate in any form on restraining its nuclear arms production program. Israel also has its extremists, whose political affiliations and names are well known to all. If the democratic process in Israel brings these extremists to power, we cannot rest assured they may not resort to using weapons of mass destruction."

TRIBE'S LAND IS RICH BUT UNEASY
Eight years ago, Joey Carter was chopping wood for a living, earning $5 an hour and living in a two-bedroom apartment he shared with seven other people. He recalled his grandfather, Clifford Sebastian, a half-blood Mashantucket Pequot Indian who lived on a pig farm with no electricity or running water. The grandfather would spit on the ground in bitterness every time he talked about the fate of the once proud Pequots. But new Pequot stories are about sudden and astounding success. The lives of Mr. Carter and all other Pequots have been transformed by the booming, cash-raking phenomenon of Foxwoods Casino, the tribe's huge gambling development in the Ledyard woods of southeastern Connecticut. A1.
HOSPITALS ARE SPURNING ABORTIONS
Slowly, quietly, over the last 10 years, almost all of New York City's full-service hospitals have backed out of the abortion business, driven away in part by economics and in part by fear. Even as they are rapidly expanding their repertory of treatments in an era of managed care, they are no longer doing many elective terminations or training residents in the procedure and refer patients elsewhere. A1.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
4 IN S.I. FAMILY SHOT TO DEATH
Four members of a Staten Island family died of gunshot wounds in a bloody quarrel that the police said followed years of disputes and numerous police visits to their quiet, working-class neighborhood of Arden Heights.
A 55-year-old Staten Island man surrendered to the police a few hours after the discovery of the bodies of his wife, his stepson and a man and woman believed to be his in-laws. B3.
CHILD KILLED AND 2 HURT IN FIRE
On Saturday night, Catalina Figueroa sat with her granddaughters, 11-month-old Ashley and 6-year-old Shaina, and watched the video "Cinderella" before putting them to bed in their apartment in a Mott Haven housing project.
Hours later, Ashley Figueroa was dead and Shaina Perez and a friend of Mrs. Figueroa's were in critical condition, victims of a fire that gutted the apartment. B3.
MORE COMPLAIN OF ILLNESS FROM FUMES
Six people were taken to hospitals after complaining of nausea and dizziness that they said was caused by fumes in a Brooklyn apartment building, where two dozen residents were overcome on Thursday by poisonous carbon monoxide. But investigators armed with carbon-monoxide detectors said they could find no trace of the lethal fumes. B3.
COLLEGE-HELP PROGRAM FACES AX
Twenty-six years ago, New York created a program to help needy, motivated students attend private colleges. The Higher Education Opportunity Program, or H.E.O.P., is small, relatively inexpensive ($22 million out of a $32.4 billion state budget), and is one of the few such efforts that even critics of government largesse acknowledge is a success. But $22 million is $22 million. The program is headed for extinction in Governor Pataki's budget. B3.
KEEPING FAMILIES INTACT IS HIS GOAL
He cannot console the girl whose mother is dying of AIDS, or promise the frightened young woman that her boyfriend will not hit her again. He cannot replace the father who was murdered, or comfort a child late at night, when the gunfire starts. But on a good day, Carlos Scott can offer a family hope.
Mr. Scott is a social worker at the Children's Aid Society, one of the largest social welfare agencies in New York and one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Although his field is preventive services, he fights problems that have plagued poor families for centuries: domestic violence, drug abuse, illness and emotional distress. B2.

PATAKI FACES A TOUGH CHOICE
In his search for a state environmental commissioner, Governor Pataki has found himself torn between two clashing interests that have long considered him an ally: business leaders and environmentalists.
Mr. Pataki has said his ideal environmental commissioner would blend an understanding and respect for business with a strong sensitivity to conservation issues. His ideal candidate, he said, would have worked in both areas. B5.

HEADLINE: For Health Agency, a Fiscal Wake-Up Call

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Few agencies have ever enjoyed stronger bipartisan support than the National Institutes of Health. Indeed, Congress has lavished billions of tax dollars on the Government's biomedical research enterprise. And until now, the main question was how best to spend more money.
But that has abruptly changed. The health agency is receiving skeptical scrutiny from Republican members of the House determined to cut the Federal budget deficit. This change is most evident in the House Appropriations subcommittee that earmarks money for the institutes, $11.3 billion this year. 
 "There was an acceptance that we were doing the Lord's work," said Alan G. Kraut, executive director of the American Psychological Society, who represents research psychologists. But this year Dr. Kraut was taken aback when he was asked by Representative Jay Dickey, Republican of Arkansas, "Do you understand that this Government is insolvent?"
For his part, Mr. Dickey said that there seemed to be "a conspiracy" among scientists, patients and public health advocates seeking more money to investigate specific diseases and disorders.
He asked Dr. Kraut a novel question: "If we were going to cut 25 percent from what you had last year," how should it be done? Mr. Dickey expressed impatience when Dr. Kraut and other witnesses refused to discuss potential cuts. The Congressman said the scientists were forcing lawmakers to make the difficult decisions without the benefit of their expert advice.
The institutes' budget grew an average of 14 percent a year in the 1960's and nearly 9 percent a year in the next two decades. But these days an increase of 3 percent or 4 percent, just to keep pace with inflation, is considered a major victory.
Most of the health institutes' budget is spent on research grants awarded to scientists at universities around the country. Slightly less than 11 percent is spent on research by health institutes employees. Even before the November elections, this intramural research program was being scaled back as part of President Clinton's effort to reduce the size of Government.
The number of health institutes employees has declined by 1,200 since 1992, to 16,197, and is scheduled to fall to 14,839 by 1999, for a total reduction of nearly 15 percent in seven years. Yet scientists in and out of Government express frustration, noting that the cutbacks come at a time when new scientific techniques and discoveries offer more opportunities for productive research.
Officials say they cannot speak out for fear of seeming disloyal. But Dr. Thomas J. Kennedy Jr., president of the N.I.H. Alumni Association, said, "An exceptionally fine research endeavor, a national treasure, is being severely compromised as a result of the overall effort to reinvent Government."
Like a college campus, where buildings are named for generous alumni, the grounds of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., include many buildings named for members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, who pumped tax dollars into the agency: Representatives William H. Natcher of Kentucky, Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts and Claude Pepper of Florida, and Senators Warren G. Magnuson of Washington, Lister Hill of Alabama and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut.
That bipartisan custom may be laid aside for a few years. Members of Congress have told officials at the health institutes that they should not count on much construction money because new buildings can easily be deferred.
The Republicans have promised to cut taxes and to eliminate the Federal budget deficit without altering Social Security or cutting military spending. That implies substantial cuts, ranging from 10 percent to 30 percent, in programs like biomedical research, education and public works, for which Congress appropriates money each year.
Representative John Edward Porter, Republican of Illinois, is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the Departments of Labor and Education as well as the Department of Health and Human Services, of which the N.I.H. is a part.
Mr. Porter, an outspoken supporter of biomedical research, said the subcommittee had "always worked by consensus" and had not taken any roll call votes in 14 years.
"That's undoubtedly over," he said. There will be roll call votes this year, he explained, and "everything, including N.I.H., is at risk."
A Congressional aide said of the panel: "It has never really had a strong conservative element in its membership. Ranking Republicans like Mr. Conte made sure they didn't get any conservative bomb throwers on the subcommittee."
But this year five conservative Republicans have joined the panel: Mr. Dickey and Representatives Ernest Jim Istook Jr. of Oklahoma, Dan Miller of Florida, Frank Riggs of California and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.
Mr. Istook's aide for subcommittee business comes from the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Mr. Miller's aide used to work at the conservative Heritage Foundation. And a top aide to Mr. Wicker is from the conservative Free Congress Foundation.
Officials at the National Institutes of Health say they are confident that they can educate the new subcommittee members about the importance of biomedical research. The message is simple: such research saves lives, is good for the economy, has given birth to the biotechnology industry and may lead to discoveries that help control health costs.
While the Republicans may not provide much more money, they may give the scientists more freedom to set their own research priorities. Now, lawmakers give detailed guidance to N.I.H. officials in reports that accompany the annual appropriations bill. In addition, several Republican lawmakers said they wanted to reduce Federal regulations that increase the costs of operating research laboratories. As an example, they cited Federal standards for the care of laboratory animals.
This year, as in the past, the subcommittee has heard testimony from dozens of patients, doctors and lobbyists pleading for money to support research on specific diseases and disorders. The witnesses came from such diverse groups as the American Lung Association, the American Diabetes Association, the Autism Society of America, the National Breast Cancer Coalition and the AIDS Action Council.
In an interview, Mr. Dickey said that many experts appearing before the subcommittee were "in a state of denial" and still did not comprehend the meaning of the Nov. 8 elections.
"Voters gave us a ticket to a different train, which may be going in a different direction," said Mr. Dickey. "N.I.H. will have to take some cuts."

HEADLINE: Japanese Deficit to Grow Sharply

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19

 BODY:
After years in which it lectured Washington on the need to reduce the Federal budget deficit, Japan is now facing a Government deficit of its own that is by some measures larger than that of the United States.
The deficit is making it difficult to pay for the reconstruction from the devastating earthquake in Kobe last month, a job that will cost tens of billions of dollars and which will only strain Japan's finances further. "The fiscal flexibility is so low now," lamented an official in the budget bureau of the Ministry of Finance. 
 The need to finance Japan's Government deficit and the earthquake reconstruction will also mean that Japanese financial institutions will have less money left for activity in other countries, like buying United States Treasury bonds, economists said. That could contribute to what some analysts say is a coming global shortage of capital and a rise in world interest rates.
Indeed, Japan is expected this year to become the largest net issuer of debt in the world, according to estimates of J. P. Morgan. The investment bank estimated that Japan would be a net issuer of $172 billion in Government bonds this year compared with $130 billion by the United States.
"The Japanese Government is in a worse position than the Government of the United States," said Jesper Koll at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo.
Yet many economists here say Japan's fiscal condition is not as bleak as is painted by its conservative Finance Ministry, which considers any deficit to be a sin.
Most other industrialized countries are running far greater deficits as a percent of economic output than either Japan or the United States. And Japan's budget situation will improve as the economy recovers.
More important, in contrast to the United States, where people spend a lot and save relatively little, Japan has a very high household savings rate. That provides the funds that can be used to help finance the Government deficit without putting too much upward pressure on interest rates. Japan also has huge current account and trade surpluses.
The budget deficit "is rather a secondary problem," said Yukio Noguchi, a professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. "For the economy as a whole, the important thing is the savings rate."
As recently as 1992, Japan enjoyed an overall Government budget surplus, making it the envy of other industrialized nations. But its financial picture has worsened as a result of a three-year economic slump, which has reduced tax revenues and forced the Government to increase public spending in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
"Japan's public finance just started to deteriorate in the last three years," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, who characterized Japan's proposed budget for next year as "borrow now and worry later."
Until recently, the United States and other industrialized nations had pressed Japan to increase Government spending, even by going into deficit, to stimulate its economy, which would in turn help the world economy and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus by increasing the nation's imports.
At the same time, Japan had been urging the United States to reduce its budget deficit, arguing that the Federal Government was competing with American industry for scarce capital. Japanese officials and businessmen have long argued that the big Federal deficit, and not any unfair trading practices by Japan, was responsible for the trade deficit with Japan.
Now to some extent, both sides have done the other's bidding. Japan has cut taxes and increased public spending enough that Washington recently stopped calling upon Tokyo to take further stimulatory steps. Meanwhile, the United States has cut its deficit for three consecutive years, owing to spending cuts and a strong economy and increased tax revenues.
Before the earthquake, Japan was expecting a central budget deficit of 14.9 trillion yen, or about $149 billion, in the fiscal year that ends this March, and a deficit of 12.6 trillion yen, or $126 billion next year, the Finance Ministry official said. By contrast, the American deficit this year is expected to be $192.5 billion.
But since the American economy is larger than Japan's, economists tend to look at the deficit as a percent of the total economy.
Japan had a deficit of 5.7 percent of its gross domestic product in 1994, compared with 2.9 percent for the United States, according to estimates made by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development before the earthquake. Back in 1991, the situation had been reversed, with Japan having a deficit of only 0.8 percent of its economic output while Washington had a deficit of 4.2 percent.
Using a broader measure favored by economists that includes the Social Security accounts, Japan and the United States both had a deficit in 1994 equal to 2 percent of gross domestic product, according to the organization. But as recently as 1992, Japan had a surplus of 1.8 percent of its gross domestic product while the United States had a deficit equal to 4.3 percent.
Because of Japan's high savings rate, some economists do not expect the earthquake reconstruction to be that big a problem.
"There is enough money to invest in fiscal assets, including earthquake recovery," said Hirohiko Okumura, executive fellow at the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. He said it was wrong to look only at the balance of the Government budget and to ignore other sources of funds like Government-controlled pension funds and savings accounts.
Indeed, Japan has long drawn upon its "second budget," a vast pool of funds held in savings accounts run by the postal service and in nationally managed pension funds. But even those funds are being stretched thin, some analysts say.
The Jan. 17 earthquake, which killed more than 5,000 people and devastated the port city of Kobe, could significantly increase the deficit, both because of the reconstruction costs and because of a decline in tax revenues from companies and individuals who suffered damage in the quake. The Government has also decided to grant tax exemptions and postponements to quake victims.
To help pay for earthquake repairs, Japan's Cabinet on Friday approved the basic outline of a supplemental budget of 1.02 trillion yen, or roughly $10 billion, for the fiscal year that ends next month. At the same time, it estimated tax revenues would fall 602 billion yen, or roughly $6 billion, in the fiscal year because of the earthquake.
Even larger extra expenditures are expected in the next fiscal year. Japan's total central Government budget is about $700 billion annually.
In financing rebuilding, the quandary is that to avoid increasing the deficit further, taxes might have to be raised, after having been lowered last year to stimulate the economy. But a tax increase would be politically unpopular and would undermine the nascent economic recovery.
To avoid an immediate tax increase, the Government decided Friday to borrow the money needed for the supplemental budget. It will issue nearly $8 billion in construction bonds, tied to the building of public works, as well as about $8 billion of what are known here as deficit bonds, which cover day-to-day operations and which the Finance Ministry tries to avoid at all costs. Deficit bonds have not been issued without securing a revenue source to pay for them since 1989.
Japan had high budget deficits in the late 1970's, but they were gradually reduced in the 1980's. In the late 1980's, when Japan's economy boomed because of rising land and stock prices, the central Government had a surplus, when the social security account was included.
Japan has about 200 trillion yen, or $2 trillion dollars, of outstanding debt. In the budget proposed for next fiscal year and made before the earthquake, 16.4 percent of total expenditures would go for interest payments on the past debt.
Economists say the accumulating debt will be a problem for Japan because the percentage of elderly people in its population is growing rapidly. That will increase the need for social welfare payments.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Simpson Case Gives Cable An Edge on the Networks

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
While jurors and trial watchers ponder the DNA factor in the O. J. Simpson trial, it's the CNN factor that is worrying people inside the news divisions of the three major television networks.
A news story as big and juicy as Mr. Simpson's murder trial would once have attracted huge audiences to the networks' evening news programs. But in the age of CNN, which is available in about two-thirds of the nation's households, the Simpson trial has done the opposite: it has taken viewers away from the newscasts, reducing their weeknight audiences as much as 10 percent.
While specifics are hard to come by, those audience losses, if sustained for a few months, could cost the networks hundreds of thousands of dollars a week.
When a big story breaks -- or unfolds, as with the Simpson trial -- Americans need not wait to get home and hear a brief account of it from Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings or Dan Rather and Connie Chung. Instead, they can flip to CNN at their convenience for the latest -- often live -- coverage. And they can do so from offices, hotels or airport lounges.
The Simpson case is the most dramatic, and melodramatic, example of this phenomenon to date. Because the trial is taking place in Los Angeles, live coverage on CNN and Court TV continues well into the evening in the East and Midwest -- often as late as 8 P.M., but certainly through the network news time slots.
And the fact that a trial is a continuing defined event makes it easy to know when to tune in. With other kinds of dominant news events -- a foreign war, an earthquake or other disaster -- viewers might be better served by the summing-up coverage offered in a scheduled newscast.
"You just have to look at CNN's ratings and Court TV's ratings," said Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, "especially in the 5 to 7 P.M. Eastern time period, and the correlation is so strikingly clear: O. J. is the only explanation."
CNN's afternoon ratings for the first three weeks of the Simpson trial coverage were 5.1, 5.6 and 6.3 -- far above its 0.7 average for that time period.
And the ratings for Court TV were even higher -- as much as double those of CNN in the 20 million homes that receive both CNN and Court TV. At the same time, the evening news ratings for ABC, CBS and NBC have declined, collectively, nearly two ratings points from the period in 1994, to an average of 9.4 from 11.3 last year.
CNN's ratings do not directly compare with the networks' because CNN is available in about 64 million homes, while all three main networks reach about 95 million homes. A CNN rating point represents 658,000 households, while a Court TV rating point equals 200,000 households. A network rating point represents 954,000 households.
The Simpson trial has aggravated an overall decline in the network nightly news ratings. The collective audience for network news has shrunk from a 77 share in 1979-80 -- that is, network news was on 77 percent of all sets that were tuned to something -- to a 58 share last season and a 54 so far this season.
That shrinkage is costly. In the last year, the three networks have each added a minute of commercial time to their nightly newscasts to make up some revenue.
But it is too early to tell how costly the Simpson-related defections will be. Generally, advertisers buy commercial time in news packages that include the evening news and morning shows like "Today" or "Good Morning America" and prime-time news programs like "Dateline" or "20/20." So as the year progresses, the ratings for these packages may recover enough so that the networks meet their minimum-ratings guarantees to advertisers.
"Still," Mr. Lack of NBC said, "if this trial goes on for four or five months and the audience for it remains undiminished, we'll take a significant economic hit."
A media buyer with many clients who advertise on news programs, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "I think people will get tired of this trial as it drags on. But if audiences stay down or erode further, and the trial lasts until mid-May or June 1, it could cost a network $1 million or more per week."
David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for planning and research at CBS, said, "Even after accounting for the normal pattern of erosion we've been seeing, the network news audiences are down about 10 percent since the O. J. Simpson trial began" on Jan. 24.
The trial also provides daily fodder for tabloid television, talk shows and local newscasts, as well as radio programs -- all potential competition for the network newscasts.
"It's a relatively recent phenomenon of our business that people have so many choices at any given time," said Mr. Brokaw, the anchor and managing editor for the NBC Nightly News. "I sometimes say, in not entirely mock frustration, that when I started out in the 1960's, there were effectively two network news programs, and at 6:30 P.M. people turned on either Huntley-Brinkley or Walter Cronkite and got their news for the day. And I'd like to have that back again."
The networks will never regain such a near-monopoly. But not all agree that the Simpson trial will accelerate the long-term erosion of the network news audience.
"The O. J. trial is unique in terms of the huge interest in it and the availability of live coverage on a regular schedule," said Lane Venardos, a vice president for news and special events at CBS. "Those two streams converged to make this a larger-than-life event, and I don't think we'll see that again soon."
Mr. Lack seems to agree. "Last year, when we had the L.A. earthquake, for example, CNN's ratings didn't spike up the way they have for O. J.," he said. "Most people still tuned in to us at night to get the major news coverage."
This time last year, intense interest was focused on the assault on the Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan by men said to have been commissioned by her rival Tonya Harding. "With the Nancy-Tonya story, people couldn't get any better or more coverage from CNN than they could get on the network news," Mr. Poltrack said. "But a lot of people would rather watch O. J. itself live, instead of the network news account of it later."
Indeed, figures from CNN show that Simpson-related events have been the highest-rated programs on cable television in the last 14 months excluding National Football League games.
Mr. Venardos of CBS said the network news divisions had offered extended live coverage of the 1989 and 1994 California earthquakes and of the Persian Gulf war. They also covered the opening statements in the Simpson trial live and will presumably televise the closing statements and the verdict.
"Any time there's a big enough event, we can break in and go live," Mr. Venardos said. "CNN does not have the franchise on live coverage of news events."
But CNN, which will celebrate its 15th birthday in June, does not have to worry about pre-empting lucrative entertainment programming. A broadcast network loses money whenever it bumps afternoon soap operas or prime-time shows to cover news live. The same big news story can earn extra money for CNN because its ratings go up.
Mr. Brokaw cautioned those who would conclude that the cable ratings for the Simpson trial were an omen of future decline for network news audiences, because of this story's "soap opera quality."
"In most instances," he said, "a big story will take away from us for 24 hours or so, and then the country gets back to normal."

HEADLINE: Tribe's Promised Land Is Rich but Uneasy

SERIES: Hitting the Jackpot: Casino Money and the Pequots -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn.

 BODY:
Eight years ago, Joey Carter was chopping wood for a living, earning $5 an hour and living in a two-bedroom apartment he shared with seven other people. He recalled his boyhood, growing up poor in Rhode Island, and his grandfather, Clifford Sebastian, a half-blood Mashantucket Pequot Indian who lived on a pig farm with no electricity or running water. The grandfather would spit on the ground in bitterness every time he talked about the fate of the once proud Pequots.
Old stories rooted in the tribe's centuries-long decline into poverty and near extinction abound in Pequot country. New Pequot stories are all about sudden and astounding success. Mr. Carter now owns a rock crushing business, valued -- he volunteers -- at $3.9 million. On his office wall are blueprints for another private business under development for a nightclub restaurant. His sister, Carrie, owns a masonry company that has done well, too, he said. 
 The Carters' lives, along with all other Pequots', have been utterly transformed by the booming, clattering cash-raking phenomenon of Foxwoods Casino, the tribe's huge gambling development in the Ledyard woods of southeastern Connecticut.
While many American Indian tribes have embraced gambling as a way to pay the bills, the 318 members of the tiny Pequot tribe, by the sheer scale of their ambition, have made the business a rocket ride to a new world, building from scratch, in just three years, the most profitable casino in the nation.
So great are the gross winnings -- more than $800 million last year, twice as much as either of the nation's two next-most profitable casinos, the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nev. -- that the Pequots are able to guarantee an upper-middle-class standard of living for every tribe member.
Each Pequot is guaranteed a job with an average salary of $50,000 to $60,000 a year. This salary is also payable to a single Pequot parent who stays at home to care for young children. The tribe will provide a house, built on the reservation or bought in one of the surrounding towns, and will pay for all educational expenses for tribe members or their children, from preschool through a Ph.D.
By the standards of Indian reservations, where poverty is often pervasive, the Pequots have created a promised land. But building this utopia has not been without its stresses. Pequots were scattered across the nation, and those who have returned to the reservation to share in the boom from places like Utah, Indiana and Florida are struggling to adjust. Many of their non-Indian Connecticut neighbors resent their new wealth. There are white Pequots and black Pequots and the tensions between them are no different from those in society at large.
The goal at the casino, which employs 10,000 workers, is to have a tribe member supervising all major departments. But can the tribe do that and still maintain quality?
The Pequots say they are giving their own people opportunities, not free lunches. "If you don't work here, you don't get a dime, you don't get a penny," said Mr. Carter, who as the tribe publicity director, makes $55,000. "You know what your check comes in? Zero, zero, zero."
 
The Return
Wealth and Worry Never Imagined
Everywhere on Mashantucket, as the Pequots call their lands, are stories of Pequots who have returned, and Pequots who have made good, and those who are not Pequots at all, but are simply trying to cash in on the tribe's new-found wealth.
Alan Pearson Jr. returned to Connecticut with his family two years ago from Florida to take part in the Pequot bonanza. "You say you're coming back home and you can have a position and training if it's available and college if it's available and you have medical, and here's a house if you don't have one," he said. "If we don't have a house and you wait a little, here's some place to stay and we'll build you one. That's nice."
Mr. Pearson, who vividly remembers showering and shaving at nearby Ledyard High School because there was no running water on the reservation in the 1960's, co-manages the casino's engineering department.
Bruce A. Kirchner, who 10 years ago was an aide in a nearby psychiatric hospital and did volunteer work at the reservation on weekends, is a casino senior vice president managing 500 people. Tom Christensen, a Mormon who never believed in gambling, retired after 30 years as a Federal benefits officer in Utah and moved here, working now in the casino assessing property accident claims.
It has all happened so fast. In the 1970's the Pequots were officially pronounced extinct by Connecticut, which wanted to convert the 1,200-acre reservation into a state park. To make ends meet, surviving Pequots sold firewood and raised hydroponic vegetables and pigs.
But in 1983, after a seven-year campaign, an act of Congress sponsored by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. gave the tribe Federal recognition as a sovereign Indian nation. Three years later, the Pequots -- freed by their sovereignty from state gambling prohibitions -- opened a bingo hall, and then in 1992, Foxwoods Casino. Across the nation, 95 tribes conduct or own some gambling business, according to the National Indian Gaming Association. But none have come so far, so fast, as the Pequots.
Gambling industry experts say that Foxwood's location -- particularly its monopoly as New England's only casino -- is responsible for much of the success, but the Pequots themselves say the years of collective struggle, and the vision of the tribal leaders, were just as important.
The tribe is formally a democracy, in which each of the 170-odd adult members get a vote on major issues, and where all are encouraged to speak their minds at the monthly community forums held in the tribal community center. Day-to-day operating authority, however, both to make laws and enforce them, is invested in the seven-member Tribal Council, led by the tribal chairman, Richard (Skip) Hayward.
The Council, tribe members say, has all the stresses of a multimillion-dollar corporation, plus all the headaches that only family can create.
Growth has also brought questions about what role the Pequots should play in the state, economically and culturally. In trying to diversify beyond gambling, the Pequots have bought thousands of acres of land in southeastern Connecticut, including a huge industrial parcel previously owned by the Electric Boat shipyard, and several small manufacturing companies. By this spring, Mr. Carter said, the tribe will be entirely debt-free, with its $300 million in start-up loans for the casino paid in just three years.
Sudden wealth has its burdens. The Pequots are constantly being solicited for money by charities and causes, and there is much pressure on the tribe to invest wisely. In hopes of giving their children a better future they have donated generously to a local private school that was faltering financially, Pine Point, where many young Pequots now study. In hopes of spreading good will, they donated $500,000 to help rebuild a minor league baseball stadium in Norwich.
But many tribe members, stung by local hostility, are wary of opening up to outsiders. Some do not want themselves or their children photographed, and some express worries about robbery and kidnapping.
There is also the nagging question of what comes after the Foxwoods gold rush slows, which may be soon. Both tribe members and gambling industry experts agree that the casino is probably at the apogee of its earning powers. Other casinos, including one about 10 miles away in Montville, operated by the Mohegan tribe, and one about 20 miles away in Charlestown, R.I., by the Narragansetts, are scheduled to open.
 
Cultural Shock
Mormons Adjust To Life Near Sin
Delia Christensen grew up Mormon in Blackfoot, Idaho, on the broad flat scrub land of the Rocky Mountains' western slope, where gambling was seen by her community as a sordid business run by sharpies from Las Vegas and where a reservation was synonymous with poverty. When her husband, Tom, a quarter-blood Pequot, said last year that he wanted to move back east to Connecticut, to the reservation, to work at his tribe's casino, she just about died.
"I told him to come alone," she said.
Mrs. Christensen relented after flying out and looking at the place. She admits she is getting used to what this new Pequot life has to offer: A house, a job for her husband on a career track to management, expensive private schooling free for the three children and a dazzling wood-and-stone community center literally in her backyard, just past the tennis courts, where she takes her morning aerobics class, and where the children compete as members of the Pequot Foxes swimming team.
"They're eating it up," she said.
Still, there are adjustments. In Utah, there was a Mormon church on practically every corner. Here, Mr. Christensen said, he must drive 40 minutes to worship services, and when he arrives he often smells like cigarette smoke from the casino.
It raises eyebrows in church meetings because practicing Mormons do not smoke or drink alcohol.
"I wear suits to work and I wear suits to church and they're the same suits," Mr. Christensen said. "I don't smoke but I smell like I do."
Another thing the Christensens have had to quickly learn is how to negotiate the anti-tribe, anti-casino feeling that permeates towns in this part of the state.
Mr. Christensen, who was born in Providence, R.I., and went west to Utah in 1947 at age 4, recalls sitting in a Ledyard barbershop shortly after his arrival with his son, Clinton, 9.
"The men were talking, and there was a lot of hostility toward the tribe and I'm sitting there with my boy hoping he doesn't blurt out and tell them, 'Well, we're from the reservation,' " Mr. Christensen said.
Even the landscape can seem strange. Mrs. Christensen, sitting in the living room of the house her family was assigned when its name came up on the waiting list -- a four-bedroom ranch built in the 1970's with a Federal Housing and Urban Development loan before tribal prosperity came -- said the narrow, winding wooded roads of rural Connecticut sometimes leave her lost and claustrophobic.
There have been moral quandaries as well. Because of the Mormon Church's vehement stance against gambling, the Christensens hesitated about moving here, however alluring the opportunities, until they got a special dispensation letter from church authorities, saying that Mr. Christensen would still be regarded as a good Mormon. Some family members back home, however, have not been so quick to reconcile.
"I don't know if my mother has accepted the fact yet that my husband works for the casino -- that's just taboo," Mrs. Christensen said.
 
The Races
Black and White Get Used to Unity
The first great familial fact of Pequot life is that nearly every tribe member is descended from a single group of five sisters whose grandchildren and great-grandchildren are now in adulthood.
The second great fact is that some of those descendants married into the black community, while others married into the white, and that elders fought each other long and hard over their racial divide, carving out deep wounds that are yet to fully heal.
"The fences are coming down, slowly," said Judy Bell, a quarter-blood Pequot who moved back to the reservation from Florida three years ago.
Mrs. Bell, 48, a former human resources administrator, now runs the tribe's Indian Preference Office, where her job is to insure that newly arriving Pequots and members of other tribes who have come here looking for work get first crack at casino jobs. Her brother is Mr. Pearson. Her first cousin is Skip Hayward, the tribal chairman.
All are white. In fact, Mrs. Bell said that when her grandmother, Elizabeth George, died in 1976, her descendants -- and so far as Mrs. Bell was aware then, the only Pequots left in the world -- were all light skinned. "That's all we knew," she said.
The ensuing years brought the return of families with darker skins, like the Reels, Sebastians and Carters, who now form perhaps a quarter of the tribe.
Cousins like Mr. Carter recall old hurts. His grandfather, he said, never fully accepted him and his brothers as Pequots because their father was black. And he thinks that much of the local resentment is not truly over huge land purchases by the tribe and the efforts to convert that land into nontaxable Federal trust status, but is really a matter of racism.
"That's what most of this is over," Mr. Carter said. ' "Look at all that money them brown-skinned people have.' "
Shortly after the Christensen's youngest daughter, Kelli, 7, arrived in Connecticut from Utah last year, she dreamed that she had turned black. "She'd never been exposed," Mrs. Christensen said.
Within the tribe, there have been charges of nepotism, and questions about why some get better jobs and bigger paychecks. Tribe members like Mr. Pearson say that this is inevitable, simply human nature.
"Everybody's mixing in and everybody's striving and you're going to have little rumples," he said. "You have people from different backgrounds, all coming together as one, and they're used to this and you're not and you're used to this and they're not -- it's just learning to give and take and I think it's going quite well."
Mrs. Bell said that tensions had declined in recent years, and that things like the community center swimming team were bringing families together. Her grandchildren, she vowed, "will not know prejudice."
Still, it is clear that some of these clans do not communicate much.
Sometimes, Mr. Carter said, the whole tribe will disappear into the woods for 24 hours, drumming and singing and getting back in touch with their Native American roots. When asked if she ever participated in those spontaneous outings, Mrs. Bell said she might, if she ever knew about them.
"Chances are they're not putting signs up at the community center," she said.
 
Identity
What Is Pequot, Not Just Who?
Mr. Carter offers an oft-told tale of modern Pequot life:
"A guy calls up and says, 'Uh, yeah, I'm one of them peacocks.' "
"I said, 'Who?' "
"He said, 'One of you guys, one of them peacocks.' "
"I said, 'It's Pequot, Mashantucket Pequot.' "
"He said, 'No, no, no, you're not pronouncing it right.' "
"I said, 'I don't think I'm pronouncing it wrong because I AM one of them Pequots.' "
"He goes, 'Well, maybe in the past they pronounced it wrong, because it's peacock,' " Mr. Carter said. "This is what we've been going through."
Everybody wants to be a Mashantucket Pequot now, and no small wonder. As word of the tribe's story has spread, there have been thousands of callers from as far as Cuba and Bermuda and England, all seeking membership.
The big problem is that no one, even many Pequots, is quite sure what being Pequot means. Beyond the requirement that would-be tribe members prove genealogically that they are at least one-sixteenth Pequot (and thus descended no more than four generations from a full-blood tribe member), there are no other guideposts.
Some people who have called from the Bahamas, for example, may be Pequot descendants, since members of the tribe were shipped off into slavery there in the 1600's. But none so far has qualified because the link was too weak, too long ago.
Some callers have asked for a spiritual membership. "People said, 'Oh, I knew a Pequot when I was a kid and we cut ourselves and rubbed our hands together so we're blood brothers so that makes me a Pequot,' " Mr. Kirchner said.
The Pequots' language and culture began dying in 1637, after English and Dutch colonists slaughtered most of the tribe. Later colonial laws, which lingered well into the 1800's, prohibited even speaking the Pequot language, now long dead but for a few vestigial words. In local churches in southeastern Connecticut, certain rear benches facing backward are still known as Pequot pews, because tribal worshipers were not permitted to face front.
In homes like the Pearsons', whose living room has American Indian paintings on every wall, the culture is kept alive, but Mr. Pearson is first to admit that it is a generic concept and no more.
"The Pequots were wiped out at such an early age, everything was thrown out the window," he said. "We've picked up many of your Western Indian regalia here, costumes and bells, but that wasn't our people."
Mr. Carter said that much of what he knows of his tribe's history he has learned from talking to anthropologists retained by the tribe to investigate artifacts and old reservation campsites.
The rest he got from his family. From a crusty old Pequot woman he knew only as Aunt Matt, he said he learned of self-reliance. She carried a shotgun wherever she went, even into town -- to kill snakes, she said. His grandfather taught him to kill a pig in the most painless way, neatly severing its spinal cord, and to find sassafras and edible mushrooms in the wild. He now takes Pequot children into the hills on weekends to pass on that knowledge, he said.
Mr. Kirchner, a quarter-blood whose grandmother was Alice Brend, one of the five matriarchs, admits that he does not pay much attention to American Indian traditions. His house, a Government-built home on the reservation that he gutted and remodeled last year, is decorated with few Indian elements. Its open kitchen, hardwood floors and fireplaces could be an upper-middle-class home anywhere.
But with the Pequot rebirth, Mr. Kirchner said his two sons, Myles and Carl, are being exposed to far more Indian culture than he ever was growing up in nearby Norwich. The Pequots can afford culture now, he said; in the days of his youth, culture was a luxury beyond reach.
Next: Through real-estate investments, private schools for their children, charities and even minor-league baseball, the Pequots are using their wealth to reach out beyond the casino, widen their community role and, for the first time, be insiders.

HEADLINE: Strengthening Public Housing

 BODY:
In much of the country, what began as decent public housing for the working poor has degenerated into dumping grounds for troubled families. Federal regulations discriminate against letting in poor people who work while favoring the desperately poor and long-term unemployed.
New York's public housing is well kept and orderly compared to harrowing places like Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, but it, too, has suffered. So Ruben Franco, chairman of the New York City Housing Authority, is wisely taking steps to preserve New York's standing. Last month Mr. Franco unveiled an ambitious plan to persuade police officers to move into public housing in exchange for career incentives. Now Mr. Franco says the Housing Authority will give preference to the working poor over welfare recipients in filling vacancies. 
 Both measures deserve vigorous support. The new preference for working families is an especially important step in the battle to stave off social disintegration. As recently as 1984, nearly half of the families in public housing included at least one working adult. That number has now fallen to 31 percent. Among current applicant families, fewer than 10 percent include an adult who works.
Working families had been shying away from public housing for decades on their own. But government policies instituted in the 1980's encouraged the trend by stipulating that 90 percent of public housing be set aside for the poorest of the poor, among them people who were homeless or involuntarily displaced. The public housing system also let lapse the screening procedures that once insured that new tenants would be responsible neighbors.
The Housing Authority plans to alter the mix by giving working families preferential status for up to 50 percent of vacancies, or about 4,000 apartments each year. Advocates for the poor worry that the change could eliminate a critical housing option for the desperately poor. But it makes more sense to disperse poor families into mixed-income neighborhoods through so-called Section 8 subsidies than to warehouse all of the city's poorest citizens in public housing projects.
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has approved New York's initiative and is encouraging other cities to follow suit. New York's Housing Authority is planning an advertising campaign to recruit working applicants.
The idea looks like a winner. The working poor will find relief from steep market-rate rents while altering public housing's chemistry for the better. The rent they pay will reduce Federal subsidies at a time when every penny counts.

HEADLINE: An Investment Worth Saving

 BODY:
The Senate Budget Committee staff has circulated a proposal to terminate American contributions to multilateral development banks. It is a callous and shortsighted idea that should be disowned by the committee.
The United States contributes money to the United Nations Development Program -- which the proposal also threatens -- as well as several development banks, the most important of which is the World Bank. Other recipients include the Africa, Asia and Inter-American development banks, which lend to poor countries for economic development. 
 The Budget Committee staff apparently thinks the money is wasted. The staff's judgment is myopic. It takes no account of the relatively modest contributions that Washington makes to the development banks, and shows cold indifference to the role that a wealthy and powerful country like the United States ought to play in helping desperate people subsisting on less than a dollar a day. American contributions, multiplied many times over by money from other industrialized countries, has done much to reduce infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, raise food production in South Asia and educate children in Latin America.
The World Bank -- the largest recipient of American money -- is far from ideal. Created in the aftermath of World War II, it started off financing huge dam, transportation and other infrastructure projects. Some made sense. Others were environmental and social disasters, uprooting communities and entrenching corrupt politicians. But the bank's tactics have changed, and it is now investing more in people. The bank pours money into vaccine, nutrition, education and clean-water programs that have helped ameliorate horrific living conditions throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America. The World Bank is also an invaluable source of policy advice, helping countries set up judicial, financial and monetary institutions to carry their economies toward democracy and open markets.
The United States spends about $2.5 billion on the multilateral banks and other development programs. In a $1.5 trillion Federal budget and a $6 trillion economy, these sums are small. Yet they loom large to recipients because Western allies chip in more than $10 for every dollar Washington contributes. The expenditures buy a faster-growing third world, which translates into more American exports, less military aggression, fewer refugees and more certain evolution of democratic government and open economies.
Critics of development aid argue that the third world is better off opening up their economies to trade and investment than reaching for handouts from Washington. But this nostrum overlooks a harsh reality: Private investors shun the frailest cases, funneling more than 70 percent of their investment in developing countries to only 10 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa attracts only 2 percent.
The development banks are the only institutions that possess the resources, expertise and will to attack crushing poverty. The United States already ranks last among industrialized countries in the percentage of its income devoted to foreign aid. It should sink no lower.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Back in the Dock

 BODY:
Judge Stanley Sporkin has every right to feel frustrated. After four years of Federal investigation, the Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation reached an antitrust settlement designed to end unfair, anticompetitive practices by the software giant. But neither Judge Sporkin nor any other outsider has the foggiest idea whether the agreement is adequate or a mere wrist slap when stronger measures are needed.
We still don't know whether Microsoft for the most part competes fairly, in which case it is a crown jewel of the American economy, just the sort of technological and business success this nation badly needs to compete in world markets in the coming information age. Or is Microsoft a predator that uses its market dominance to freeze out the superior products of competitors while insuring success for clunkier products of its own? 
 Microsoft is clearly the dominant powerhouse in providing software for personal computers. It manufactures the basic operating system (MS-DOS) that runs more than 70 percent of all personal computers. It produces Windows, a software program that allows users to manage scores of specialized applications programs. It also produces a powerful array of those applications programs itself, including a huge chunk of the word processors and spreadsheets used in personal computers.
The company's future plans are breathtaking. It hopes to develop its own on-line network and seeks to purchase a company whose personal-finance software dominates that market, opening the way for electronic banking and purchasing.
But as Microsoft has become ever more dominant, complaints about its practices have mounted. The Federal Government has investigated Microsoft for the past four years, first at the Federal Trade Commission, inconclusively, then at the Justice Department, where Assistant Attorney General Anne K. Bingaman has been trying to revive the antitrust division from its torpor during the Reagan-Bush years. Last July, the long Federal probe reached an anticlimactic conclusion -- a narrow consent decree in which Microsoft agreed to change certain licensing practices that seem clearly anticompetitive.
For example, Microsoft had been requiring computer manufacturers who licensed its MS-DOS operating system to pay a royalty for every computer they sold, even if many of those computers did not actually use MS-DOS but contained a rival operating system instead. That put enormous pressure on the manufacturers to shun the rival system altogether. Microsoft has now agreed to abandon the practice, and to stop a few other licensing practices also deemed unfair.
That's a clear gain. But Judge Sporkin, who must rule whether the decree is in the public interest, rejected it last week for failing to address critical issues. The judge complained that, even on the licensing practices, the agreement would simply require Microsoft to "sin no more." It would do nothing to offset the unfair advantage Microsoft had already gained. He is unquestionably right on this point; the only issue is what can be done about it.
Even more important, Judge Sporkin expressed concern that Justice may have caved in on some very big issues that the consent decree does not even address. For example, there are complaints that Microsoft has an intimidating habit of announcing, prematurely, that a new product will be coming out so that customers will not buy a competitive product. Others accuse Microsoft of using its dominant position in operating systems to give its own applications designers an advantage over rival software designers. The judge was particularly frustrated by the Justice Department's refusal to say what practices it had investigated and what findings it made before letting issues drop.
Both Justice and Microsoft are appealing to a higher court, contending that Judge Sporkin exceeded his authority. Justice claims its ability to negotiate consent decrees would be crippled if judges can wade in after the fact and demand that other issues be addressed and investigative findings be revealed. But control of the electronics marketplace is too important to be settled in secret. The public needs full disclosure from Justice to make certain that this fabulously successful company is behaving properly and not setting up roadblocks on the emerging information highway.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Major League Managers Are Making the Best of It

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Baseball's managers are attracting much attention in the early days of baseball's ersatz spring training, not surprising since they and their coaches are the only legitimate connections to major league-caliber baseball having donned uniforms.
So it was easy to understand why one manager, Lou Piniella of the Seattle Mariners, turned a head or two the other day when he said that if he were at the bargaining table, he would have had the players' strike, now in its seventh month, solved long ago. 
 When asked how so, however, Piniella, let go with his patented rat-a-tat laugh, shrugged, then admitted he had no idea.
So it is for every major league manager this side of Detroit's self-liberated Sparky Anderson and the excused Cito Gaston of Toronto and Phil Regan of Baltimore. The rest of the managers have no choice short of unemployment but to work with replacement players. And as they wade into the unknown, they are filled with emotions as confused as their peculiar status as management men as well as dues-paying members of the Major League Baseball Players Association.
Thus, Piniella's forced humor. Thus, the hollow hopes for a liberating settlement held by Dusty Baker. "I still believe in miracles," the Giants' manager said quietly last week.
There are the anxieties of those who were once very active in the union, but are now members of both camps, without a vote anywhere. "I don't feel used, but I do feel frustrated," Don Baylor of the Colorado Rockies said. "If I could make a difference, I would. But I am there with minor league kids. That's what I'm doing."
Then there are the melancholy ones, like the Oakland A's Tony La Russa, who, like Anderson, wrestled the propriety of participating in replacement baseball.
"I thought about it, about the issues, the owners' and the players'," La Russa said. "Then I realized, it's academic. The game comes first; everybody's interests follows. The game is suffering because we're not on the field. I think fans understand that we have to be on the field. So I'm putting on the uniform.
"It's a sad day that it's gone this far, but sadness was not having a post-season, sadness is spring training starting up and you don't have baseball. This is making the best out of a bad thing."
The bad thing could have been worse, because many managers came into spring training not only forlorn, but also angry toward their union. That ire arose from rumors that the striking players might cut licensing funds to managers as well as the trainers and coaches who are also in the union if they worked with replacement players.
"Dusty, Don Baylor, Carney Lansford, Dave Duncan, Bob Boone -- the current major leaguers owe so much to these guys," La Russa said, naming a host of former players who helped build the union. "Then when it came out that they were going to penalize them, I thought to myself, you've got to be kidding me -- that's how far this has gone? Suddenly, we weren't a part of the team anymore."
The union has steadfastly denied that any moves to cut licensing income were contemplated. It reiterated that in meetings with managers, coaches and trainers in Florida and Arizona last week.
"I don't believe that the executive board, the guys who have been members for a while, like Scott Sanderson and Jay Bell, ever intended to take the coaches, trainers and managers off," Baylor said Saturday night after the eight managers stationed in Arizona met with union officials. "But it took a meeting like this to clear the air, without question."
The managers also wanted to hear what the union expected of what is quite possibly the nation's most unusual wing of labor. After all, Baker said: "When you've been around for 25 years, like Sparky, you can do whatever you want. I've only been around for two years. A lot of us are just starting. If I get fired, blackballed, is the union going to give me a job?"
"They are caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place," said Donald Fehr, who heads the players association that pays the benefits, pensions and perks to managers and their staffs. "I have no doubts where their sympathies lie. But you have to remember, it's the clubs that are saying you have to do this or we will fire you."
And what is the union telling the men in the middle? "We are not asking anybody to do what Sparky did," said Fehr, referring to the Tiger manager having taken an unpaid leave of absence. "People have to do what they think is best in their own circumstances."
And, guarantees Baylor, "everybody will do what he has to do."

Economics 101: Baseball Owners' Egos Would Ease the Luxury Tax

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
IT'S almost time for the baseball players to end this thing. Time for them to proclaim: "The war is over. We won." They have outlasted the salary cap, and isn't that why they tipped over their water buckets and marched out of the coal mines last August?
The wonderful owners are no longer demanding an artificial salary ceiling for every club, and isn't that why those jokers killed the World Series? Instead of fighting over a salary cap, the owners and the players are now fighting over something called a luxury tax. 
 According to a noted economist -- that is to say, me -- the players can live with the luxury tax, which is based upon one of life's great certainties: the individual arrogance of the baseball owners.
Oh, I don't think the players should settle just yet. They should keep a militant posture until that raggle-taggle latter-day Coxey's Army of scab players debases baseball in the first week of March. Fans should be exposed to just how low Bud Selig and John Harrington and Jerry Reinsdorf and the Tribune people will sink. Then the baseball players should cut a deal. Announce they are saving America from the owners.
You could see why the baseball players didn't want the salary cap. It gives owners and general managers a legal excuse not to finagle. In basketball, the Phoenix Suns induced Danny Manning to play for only $1 million a year in order to fit under their salary cap, and the poor guy tore up his knee, so now he depends on the generosity of an owner. In football, the San Francisco 49ers cut private deals with players to fit them into the salary cap, and they won the Super Bowl, and all kinds of bonuses kicked in.
Baseball players did not want a future of 28 general managers wringing their hands and saying, tsk-tsk, there was no more money left because of that big, bad salary cap. Now we have Bud Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, who is acting as commissioner, assuring us, "The clubs moved away from a salary cap. The luxury tax is a mechanism to put a drag on salaries, but it must be meaningful to have an effect on salaries."
The mediator Bill Usery Jr. has proposed, apparently just for openers, a luxury tax of 50 percent on all club payrolls above $40 million, the average club payroll. If a club right at the $40 million level wanted to sign one player for $2 million for one year, it would have to pay an extra tax of $1 million. That sounds like a significant jump in cost, but look at the way the owners have fought each other for the privilege of paying fortunes to swaggering mediocrities. You think the owners are going to stop splurging? I don't.
The luxury-tax concept appeals to me because the tax itself would presumably go to the lower-market clubs. The owners are too selfish to openly share their vastly disparate local television revenues, but they could accept playing Robin Hood, robbing from the rich to give to the poor.
And at the risk of sounding like some trickle-down voodoo Reaganite economist, I say that every dollar in luxury tax that helps keep teams in worthwhile towns like Seattle, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Montreal only gets spent again -- in player salaries. So what's the harm?
"We don't believe the clubs should be penalized for going after players, for thinking this is a nefarious activity," said Gene Orza, the lawyer with the Players Association. "We tax cigarettes, but if we taxed them at, let's say, $5,000 a pack, people wouldn't buy them. Why would a club want to pay a tax most Americans wouldn't want to pay?"
The fact is, there are already so-called "sin taxes" on items like cigarettes, alcohol and gambling. People do pay to play. It adds an extra fillip of danger to their habit. The owners can relate.
It is significant that the players are counterproposing a 5 percent tax on payrolls between $20 million and $40 million, 15 percent on payrolls between $52 million and $64 million and 25 percent above $64 million.
Orza said the players support some form of revenue-sharing for the smaller markets. They just want a lower tax, lesser drag, more action from the owners. As David Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association, always reminds me, it's always about numbers.
Besides, history tells us that baseball owners will never stop spending money. They need a relief pitcher in August, a power hitter in the off season, a one-time superstar to finally produce a champion, they will spend the money.
"I know Freddie Wilpon, I know Paul Beeston, I know George Steinbrenner," Bud Selig said the other day, talking about operators of the wealthy Mets, Blue Jays and Yankees.
Baseball owners have always believed they were smarter than each other. That's how their payrolls got so high. The owners would treat a luxury tax as just some annoying (but in its own way prideful) assessment down at the country club.
The players should take the owners up on a negotiated luxury tax. But first they should rub the owners' noses in the first week of scab exhibitions. That stench would never go away.

A Simple Idea for Schools Turns Complicated

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

NATIONAL STANDARDS IN AMERICAN EDUCATION
A Citizen's Guide
By Diane Ravitch
223 pages. The Brookings Institution. $22.95.
A simple message lies at the heart of Diane Ravitch's useful new book, "National Standards in American Education: A Citizen's Guide." If clear and consistent goals of learning could be set for all American children, rich and poor, gifted and ordinary, then all of these children would end up better educated than they now are likely to be. 
 But so fraught with complex implications is this message and so conscientious is Ms. Ravitch, an authority on American education, in acknowledging them, that the thesis of her book is sometimes hard to grab hold of. For instance, in summarizing the case against setting goals for education, or national standards and assessments, as she calls them, she lists nine complaints critics have raised, some of which seem repetitive and others of which seem to mix up apples and ball bearings.
(One objection she cites is, "National standards will be minimal, reduced to the lowest common denominator, especially if they are controlled by a Federal agency." Another is, "National standards based on traditional subject matter disciplines such as mathematics, science and history will narrow the curriculum," as if narrowing was significantly distinct from reducing to a common denominator.)
Weighing Ms. Ravitch's record on the one hand as a writer of lucid histories ("The Great School Wars: New York City, 1805-1973" and "The Troubled Crusade: American Education, 1945-1980) and on the other as a former Assistant Secretary in the Department of Education under Secretary Lamar Alexander, one suspects that the problem here is less a failure to think categorically and more an eagerness to acknowledge overlapping political constituencies. It should not be overlooked that this book is subtitled "A Citizen's Guide."
Still, at the risk of flattening out the tall peaks and deep valleys of her argument, one can sum up the core of her message as follows: American education is failing to fulfill its potential. The few available measures of students' aptitude and achievement have shown a decline in the last three decades. The gap between the top and bottom students has been growing over all. Most disturbingly, most evidence indicates that American students are at best mediocre in achievement compared with those of many other industrial nations.
While such shortcomings are adverse in themselves, Ms. Ravitch adds, they are bound to loom larger as the American economy continues to shift from being labor-based to knowledge-based. Therefore, she concludes, some sort of basic reform in educational techniques will become increasingly essential.
Although many look back to schools of an earlier era as exemplars of academic rigor, the author continues, nostalgia for the past is wrong because a form of elitism was in effect that educated only the best students while the rest were sorted out, or "tracked," and exposed to less demanding curriculums. What a wide range of evidence now indicates, Ms. Ravitch writes, is that "students who take a full program of history, geography, English, mathematics, science, foreign language and the arts are best prepared for whatever lies ahead in their lives."
She concludes, "In other words, a liberal education -- one that opens the mind to new worlds and liberates the individual from ignorance -- remains not only the best education for free men and women but the best preparation for the future, whether one chooses to enter higher education or the work force."
More and more, Ms. Ravitch reports, a system of national standards and assessments is being seen as the key to providing such a liberal education to every student, regardless of ability or promise. The process of developing such standards has even begun with the passage of President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation in 1994.
But while surveys indicate that the American public likes the idea of higher standards, they also reveal deep skepticism about imposing them on the present educational system. Many feel that neither Congress nor the Federal Government should dictate what children should learn. Others fear the consequences of forcing uniform criteria on schools of unequal merit; they feel the playing field ought to be leveled before everyone is forced to compete on it. Still others worry about what they see as the so-called dumbing-down effect of teaching all students the same material; they assume that the bright students will be held back until the slowest students meet the new standards.
Ms. Ravitch responds to these objections. She concedes that Congress ought not "meddle in the educational affairs of the nation's schools," that it "should remember that the intent of the national goals process is to create academic standards that are national, not Federal." Responding to the level-playing-field argument, she cites an analogy offered by Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers: what if the rules for Olympic competition were not established until all likely contenders had the same opportunities, when the whole point of participation is precisely to define standards against which athletes measure themselves?
And to the question "Does the slogan 'all children can learn' mean that the curriculum will be dumbed down?" she replies: "The goal must be to raise achievement for all students, while narrowing the range from top to bottom. This does not mean dragging down the students at the top but expecting more of all students, especially those who are in the bottom half."
These are just a few of the arguments in a book that is knotty with hopes and fears, proposals and counterproposals, and theses, antitheses and syntheses. The whole does not make for especially smooth reading. But Ms. Ravitch has taken an important issue and examined it in all its snarled complexity.

HEADLINE: Finances and Fear Spurring Hospitals To Drop Abortions

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The obstetrics and gynecology clinics at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center aim to give poor women one-stop health care, from pap smears to parenting classes to contraceptive counseling. They are widely considered a model of comprehensive medicine. But there is one service that they do not generally provide: a conventional outpatient first-trimester abortion.
Slowly, quietly, over the last 10 years, almost all of New York City's full-service hospitals have backed out of the abortion business, driven away in part by economics and in part by fear. Even as they are rapidly expanding their repertory of treatments in an era of managed care, they are no longer doing many elective terminations or training residents in the procedure and are referring patients elsewhere. 
 "Increasingly, the hospitals have not wanted to be involved," said Allan Rosenfield, dean of the School of Public Health at Columbia-Presbyterian. "That's partly because of the political issues and harassment related to abortion and partly because the freestanding clinics are doing it so well."
Hospitals say that clinics offer more cost-effective care than they can provide.
But critics say that in making this decision, hospitals have cast abortions outside the protective aura of established medical centers, creating delays for women who need abortions and leaving the independent clinics ever more susceptible to violence.
"Abortion ought to be integrated into women's health care, not separated so that it is vulnerable to attacks from people who want to criminalize it," said Alexander Sanger, president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. "Hospitals have not stepped up to solve the problem. They are afraid of losing donors who oppose abortion. And afraid of having pickets on the sidewalk."
Last week, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which sets the standards for doctors' training, announced that residency programs in obstetrics had to teach abortions.
But critics say that hospitals now perform so few abortions that it will be difficult for doctors-in-training to learn. Only about one third of the residency programs in New York offer the option of abortion training, and about half of those send their residents to Planned Parenthood to learn the procedure.
Although the majority of abortions in the state have always been done at private freestanding clinics, until recently hospitals also did a significant share. In 1982, 30 percent of abortions in the New York area were performed in hospitals, but that number dropped to 16 percent by 1988, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research organization. And of the 110,435 abortions performed in New York City in 1993, only 9 percent were in hospitals. About 6 percent were at the city's 12 public hospitals, and 3 percent were spread between the dozens of private institutions.
This general trend has been seen across the country, and in some states there are now no hospitals that will perform abortions.
The vast majority of abortions in New York City are performed by a handful of freestanding clinics. There are currently only eight licensed institutions in New York City, each performing thousands of abortions a year. According to statistics compiled by the New York City Department of Health, Eastern Women's Center in Brooklyn is the city's largest provider, performing 19,938 abortions in 1993. Choices Women's Medical Center in Queens did 17,792. In comparison, Bellevue Hospital Center did 331, Columbia-Presbyterian did 152 and Lenox Hill Hospital, 39.
Today, most of the abortions conducted in hospitals are complicated procedures often done later in pregnancy, experts say, and few are the simple elective abortions that account for about 90 percent of pregnancy terminations in this country.
Some doctors applaud the trend. "The freestanding clinics are much less expensive and much more user-friendly," said Irwin R. Merkatz, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. "The hospital is the last place you want to be providing these services." Montefiore is one of the few hospitals in New York that still performs simple outpatient abortions; it did 152 last year.
But clinic directors, who complain they have been "ghettoized," suspect other motives. "When picketing and violence first began, hospitals gradually began cutting back their abortion services and training, and that accelerated as the violence accelerated," Mr. Sanger said.
For women, the shortage of hospital abortions often results in dangerous delays, as women who rely on a particular hospital for the rest of their health care search elsewhere for an abortion. While abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are extremely simple procedures that do not require more than local anesthesia, second-trimester abortions are more dangerous and complicated.
In one study by researchers at Planned Parenthood, 25 percent of women who got second-trimester abortions at New York City public hospitals had tried unsuccessfully to get an abortion earlier in their pregnancy and one-third had made four or more visits to hospitals before they had the procedure.
"The main problem was getting an appointment for the procedure," said Mary Ann Castle, who ran the study. "There were many people wanting to have abortions and not enough doctors willing to provide them."
The shortage of in-hospital abortions has also left women who want abortions and the doctors who do them more vulnerable to attacks, abortion rights advocates say. By relegating the procedure to freestanding clinics, hospitals have made it possible for anti-abortion forces to identify and harass doctors and their patients. If abortions were just one among the dozens of procedures performed in a hospital's or health maintenance organization's outpatient clinic, it would be impossible to identify targets.
Representative Nita Lowey, from parts of Westchester, the Bronx and Queens, who has campaigned for abortion rights, said: "The Catholic hospitals don't do it. The municipal hospitals get political pressure not to do it. It's such a hot potato that the medical schools have shied away. And the result is that many of the clinics are isolated and are subject to violence."
Although many hospitals technically offer abortions, they do so in ways that make them inaccessible or unattractive to the women who need them, critics say.
Most hospitals require that they be done in an operating room, for example, with full preoperative testing and general anesthesia; freestanding abortion centers do early abortions with local painkillers in a regular clinic.
"We are not well equipped to take care of medically uncomplicated patients who need an abortion," said Carolyn Westhoff, associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. "We are not really on the ball there. Patients who are complicated get taken care of in the O.R. Patients who are not do not get abortions here. We refer them to a variety of clinics."
Also, many hospitals that perform the procedure do so in a very limited way: one morning a week, for example, and so there may be long waits.
The situation is even more difficult for women who need abortions after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, experts say, since some major hospitals have no one who knows how to perform second-trimester abortions. Abortions are legal until the 24th week of pregnancy in New York State.
"This is basic health care and a service that must be offered," said Representative Lowey, who has campaigned in Congress for abortion rights. "I was visiting a H.I.P. Clinic in Queens and they were bragging about how a person could come in and get the full range of services. And I said, 'What about abortion?' And they said: 'Oh, no, no. We don't do that here.'"
Abortions were one of the first surgical procedures to move outside of the hospital, pioneered by organizations like Planned Parenthood in the early 1970's. As a whole, the licensed abortion clinics became proficient at offering easily accessible, high-quality, low-cost care.
Hospital administrators say that in-hospital abortions are inherently expensive, since they require an operating room and much of the testing that surrounds any surgery. But critics point out that hospitals eager to bring in paying customers have recently figured out how to offer a range of minor surgeries outside the operating room.
"This is the safest surgical procedure in the country," Mr. Sanger said. "I see no reason why it couldn't be done in a hospital outpatient clinic."
Choices center in Queens performed abortions on more than 17,000 patients last year. But Merle Hoffman, the president of the center, is ambivalent about the medical institutions that through their castoffs have made her clinic a success, but still regard her as a pariah.
"The medical establishment has yet to welcome in abortion providers and gynecologists who are committed to women's choices," she said. "Unfortunately, I have not seen much activity by hospitals. Maybe they just don't want to see people screaming 'Don't kill your baby' outside their front door."
Ms. Hoffman and others point out that many of New York's hospitals no longer even train residents in gynecology to do abortions. Only half a dozen of the city's obstetrics training programs teach the procedure.
Since 1993, Planned Parenthood of New York City has offered to train residents in their clinics, with a mixed response. Half a dozen programs, including the one at Columbia-Presbyterian, send residents to Planned Parenthood to learn the procedure. But rather than hospitals paying Planned Parenthood for providing this service, Planned Parenthood pays the hospitals for the lost labor.
"I'm grateful they're doing it, but I think it's outrageous that Planned Parenthood has to educate medical students and residents about this, instead of medical schools," said Dr. Eileen Hoffman, associate director for education of the Women's Health Program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. "It tells you how insane this whole issue is."

HEADLINE: Bankers Fear New Lending Risks

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Remember the credit crunch, when executives and entrepreneurs around the country squawked that banks had raised standards so high that no one could get a loan?
Well, the only crunch today is the sound of bankers slamming into each other as they race to shower new loans on business and consumers. 
 But now that banks are lending again with gusto, helping to fuel the rebound in the economy, banking officials warn that the industry is getting caught up in another frenzy likely to end badly. The fear is that banks are taking too many risks and losing sight of some cautious practices instituted after the collapse of the commercial real estate market in the late 1980's.
To win all sorts of business -- from loans for corporate takeovers to consumer credit card accounts -- bankers have loosened their rules again. As a result, they are lending more money at narrower margins for less collateral and with fewer restrictions than just a year ago.
"This past year we have really seen a deterioration of standards," said Verne G. Istock, chairman of NBD Bancorp in Detroit. "Banks are planting the seeds of the next wave of problem loans."
Loans at NBD were up 12 percent last year amid the boom in the Midwest. But Mr. Istock says that growth, however welcome, is also a warning sign: "We're reminding our people that bad loans are made in good times."
 NBD is not alone. Despite rising interest rates, lending at the nation's banks is up sharply, as the banks rush to take advantage of the improving business climate. The Federal Reserve says that the nation's largest banks had $1.141 trillion in consumer and commercial loans outstanding at the end of 1994, up a brisk 7 percent from the year before. By comparison, total lending at these banks declined by 9.6 percent from mid-1990 to mid-1993, as they strove to recover from the problems created during the real estate lending spree of the late 1980's.
No bank will openly admit to making bad loans, of course. But many bankers say that competition is forcing them to measures that make them queasy.
 "We find ourselves being pushed right up to the line," said Sloan D. Gibson, the head of corporate lending at the AmSouth Bank of Alabama in Birmingham. AmSouth, which increased its loans by more than 10 percent last year, acknowledges that it was able to do that only by cutting its interest rates and fees and easing its standards.
 For example, Mr. Gibson said the bank would now make real estate loans that do not have the full personal guarantee of the property's owner. It also might make a secured loan of as much as 65 percent of a business's inventory, even though it feels that 40 percent is a more prudent level.
 "The challenge for any bank is to not get caught up in the herd," Mr. Gibson said. "You have to be willing to say 'there is a line I will not cross,' but that's hard to do."
One measure of the gold-rush atmosphere is the interest rates and fees charged to borrowers, which are falling sharply, especially for loans to corporations.
Overall interest rates have risen. But banks set the price of business loans as a spread -- that is, a set number of percentage points above a floating interest rate. For small and medium-sized businesses, interest is tied to their stated prime rate; for larger businesses, rates are tied to the London interbank offered rate -- known as Libor -- which is the interest rate banks pay on large deposits.
The average interest rate on a loan to a big company with a comparatively weak BB credit rating, has fallen from 1.30 percentage points above Libor in 1992 to 0.79 point above Libor at the end of last year, according to statistics complied by Loan Pricing Corporation, a New York consulting firm. Spreads for companies rated A fell from 0.40 point to 0.25 point. And while statistics are not available, bankers say that rates for small businesses are declining at least that much.
Analysts say banks are now charging rates so low they are not really making a profit once money is set aside in reserve for inevitable future losses. At best, they say, much corporate lending is a break-even proposition for banks, offered to attract more lucrative business, such as money transfers or management of corporate pension plans.
 Credit standards are harder to gauge, but there are signs that banks are lending more on looser terms. In the resurgent market for leveraged buyouts -- corporate takeovers paid for largely with debt -- the average bank loan represented 2.9 times the company's cash flow at the end of 1994, compared with 1.8 a year earlier, according to Loan Pricing.
Bankers are also making more long-term loans, which are riskier than loans renewed every year. Last year 39 percent of corporate loans were for five years or longer, compared with 16 percent in 1992.
 Another reason that this lending cycle may get out of hand is that many banks no longer worry as much about future losses because they sell large chunks of their big-loan portfolios to other investors, like foreign banks and mutual funds. To the extent they off-load their loans, of course, the banks will not have to suffer for their mistakes.
For all the current lending enthusiasm, standards today have not slipped as far as they did in the late 1980's. And because banks are still cleaning up past problems, the level of loans in trouble continues to shrink at most banks. Moreover, when losses from the current round of new lending start showing up, banks should have a lot more capital to cushion themselves than they did five years ago.
Still, longtime bankers say that the compromises in standards look distressingly like the start of an apparently inescapable "lend then lose" cycle that has dominated banking for decades. Apart from the commercial real estate disaster, the years since the late 1970's have witnessed the Latin American lending spree; the Southwest oil drillers fiasco; the leveraged buyout frenzy and myriad other seemingly sure-fire propositions.
 Some of the swing in bad loans follows from the ups and downs in the economy. Defaults on credit card balances, for example, rise and fall in lockstep with the unemployment rate. But bankers have a history of amplifying the cycles, as they lend too much in good times and cut back too far when things get tough.
 What is most worrisome today, said L. M. Baker Jr., the chief executive of the Wachovia Corporation, "is that credit seems to be expanding faster than the economy."
Wachovia, which increased its loan portfolio by 13 percent last year, has one of the best records of avoiding bad loans. Still, Mr. Baker says the bank is not immune to today's siren songs. "Somewhere out there somebody in the bank has made a mistake; you just can't make too many of them," he said.
 Other bankers insist that the industry has finally learned its lesson.
 "We remember the trouble that we and many other banks had to work their way through," said Maurice Hastings, executive vice president for commercial lending for National Westminster Bancorp, the American unit of the big British bank. "We don't plan to go through the same kind of pain again."
 Still, NatWest is trying to lend more money to small- and medium-sized businesses in New York and New Jersey, where Mr. Hastings says competition is lowering prices and loosening standards. NatWest hopes to avoid problems by not permitting a big concentration of loans to one company or a single industry.
 Indeed, the one discipline that banks seem to be maintaining is in the size of their loans. For the most part, they have cut the size of each loan they make.
 "In 1988, you could do a $20 billion syndicated loan, because there were so many banks that said 'sign me up for $100 million,' " said Christopher L. Snyder, Loan Pricing's president. "You couldn't do a $20 billion syndication today, because banks won't hold more than $25 million."
 Banks are approaching lending to large companies as if they were underwriting bonds, selling small pieces to investors, typically regional and foreign banks and mutual funds. But, according to Mark Solow, the former head of corporate banking at Chemical Bank, that approach is fraught with peril if banks start to think they are lending other people's money rather than their own.
 "The greatest risk is that people start to compromise on credit quality because they think they can sell the paper," he said. "It looks too easy to people, and when things look easy that's when they get in trouble."
 Banks could be hurt if things turn bad and they hold an unexpectedly high inventory of loans, just as brokerage firms have been caught with holdings of junk bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
 Moreover, somebody else stands to be hurt when things go sour, as is already evident from the collapse of the Mexican peso. The commercial and investment banks that arranged the deals are not the biggest losers in Mexico; instead, it is the mutual funds and pension plans that bought into the program.
 No type of loan has yet emerged to dominate this new cycle so nobody is sure where the next big problem will come from. Many worry about the rise of consumer loans. Others see small business as a potential sinkhole. But as always, the banks will not really know where the trouble areas are until it is too late to do much about them.

HEADLINE: Serb Leader Rejects U.S.-Backed Proposal

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Serbian President has rejected an American-backed proposal offering a lifting of trade sanctions on Serbia in exchange for recognition of Bosnia and Croatia, Government officials said today.
The offer, prepared by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, always appeared far-fetched in that the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, has consistently said the status of the Serbs holding 70 percent of Bosnia and 30 percent of Croatia must be resolved before recognition of the two countries is possible. 
 Croatia and then Bosnia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992. But the Serbian minorities in the two countries, backed by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army, went to war to contest joining the new states.
"Recognition is almost certainly impossible until the conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia are resolved by the parties there," said one Government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "When sanctions were imposed, they were not linked in any way to recognition. So why should they be now?"
Responding to the crushing Serbian offensive in Bosnia after war broke out in April 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Serbia in May 1992. There was no mention in the resolution of any requirement on Serbia to recognize Bosnia and Croatia.
The official news agency of the remnant Yugoslav federation, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, said today that "Belgrade is categorical -- first a lifting of sanctions and then everything else." What that "everything else" meant and when it might happen was left vague.
It appeared highly unlikely, however, that the United States could ever agree to a lifting of sanctions on Serbia without securing Mr. Milosevic's recognition of Bosnia and Croatia. The role of the Serbian army in supporting the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs is generally discreet, but the support is widely viewed as crucial nonetheless.
Mr. Milosevic's position, spelled out this weekend to the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, reflects the overwhelming convictions of most people in Serbia, who would see the recognition of Croatia and Bosnia as the betrayal of the more than one million Serbs who have fought to change the borders of those countries.
Last August, Mr. Milosevic did break with the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, over Mr. Karadzic's refusal to accept a peace plan offering the Serbs almost half of Bosnia. Mr. Milosevic imposed a porous blockade and set about extending the influence in Bosnia of his Serbian Socialist Party.
But the dispute was always more about the best tactics for achieving the unification of Serbs in a single country or confederated states, rather than any other goal. Mr. Milosevic, and most other Serbs, are skeptical about the existence of a state called Bosnia.
Western diplomats say Mr. Milosevic may be closer to a possible recognition of Croatia -- a state that Serbs at least acknowledge exists even if they dispute its size -- but objects to being rushed by the recent decision of the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, to end the mandate of United Nations troops in Croatia at the end of next month. The troops' departure could open the way to a second Croatian war.
In a clear preparation for this, Mr. Karadzic and the leader of the Croatian Serbs, Milan Martic, met in the Serbian-held Bosnian town of Banja Luka today and announced the formation of a joint defense council obliging each to come to the defense of the other if necessary.
The creation of the council merely imposed a formal bureaucracy on a reality that has long existed: Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serbs, leads all Serbs west of the Drina River and coordinates their military campaigns -- as in the recent Serbian attack on the Bihac area.
Further preparations for renewed fighting have also been evident among the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces in recent days, with at least 17 helicopters and one mysterious transport plane landing at Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia in defiance of the "no flight" zone over Bosnia. United Nations officials have been unable to explain the origin or purpose of the flights.

HEADLINE: These Days, The Mark Keeps Rising

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 20

 BODY:
This would seem to be a script for investors to sell the German mark:
Metalworkers in Germany may go on strike Friday, halting much of the nation's automobile and machine-tool industries. Or, there may be relatively generous wage settlements that the financial markets would consider inflationary. Government reports have shown recent levels of economic growth as stronger than previously expected. 
 Today, though, the mark continued its rise of last week against the dollar and European currencies, closing at the highest level since October 1992 against the dollar, and at record highs against a basket of currencies of 18 industrial nations.
As the dollar falls over the feared cost to the United States in rescuing the Mexican economy, as the British pound falls amid lack of confidence in Prime Minister John Major's political survivability, as the lira drops over worry about runaway budget deficits, and as the yen struggles after the Kobe earthquake, the German mark continues to rise.
Analysts said that more than anything else, investors are persuaded to buy marks from their belief that whatever happens with the wage negotiations or economic growth, the German central bank will not let inflation get out of hand.
"It's called credibility," said Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist for the Union Bank of Switzerland in London. "Ultimately, the strength of the mark reflects the people's confidence in the Bundesbank's ability to maintain stable prices over the medium term."
In trading today, the mark rose early in the day in Tokyo to 1.4710 to the dollar, then declined slightly in the European currency markets to 1.474 to the dollar -- below its 28-month high at the end of last week.
There was very little trading in New York because of the observance of Washington's Birthday.
Trading was light in Europe today, as investors waited to look for more developments in the United States over the rescue package of Mexico and how easily Mexican politicians would be able to carry out the terms of the agreement.
Central to the concerns in Europe is whether the proposed rescue of the Mexican financial system will hinder the Federal Reserve Board from focusing on American monetary policy and on limiting inflation. For weeks, investors here have expressed a lack of confidence in the Fed's determination to stop inflation by raising interest rates further. They worry that the delicate state of the Mexican economy may persuade the Fed not to raise rates again soon.
Economists and traders said the market was waiting until Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testifies before Congressional committees on the economy and monetary policy.
"If the Fed says it sees a robust economy, then I think the markets will take it as a signal that the Fed will do everything it can to make sure inflation does not pick up," Mr. Cunningham said. "It is good for the dollar as long as the market believes the Fed is ahead of the curve, moving against inflation before it kicks in."
Here in Germany, the markets obviously do not doubt that the Bundesbank would act to stamp out the earliest signs of inflation, as seen in the confidence expressed in the mark despite the possibility of higher inflation from wage settlements.
Whatever the outcome of the wage settlement, it is now being seen as positive for the mark. If the metalworkers get a significant wage increase, the Bundesbank has made it clear in the last week that it will act decisively against any inflationary effects. And employers are taking a hard line with the big trade union, IG Metall, which has asked for a 6 percent pay increase.
Brendan Brown of Mitsubishi Finance International said, "There is real evidence that the employers are being tough and a settlement of a 2.5 percent increase will emerge, so we can look beyond the wage conflict and see the inflationary impact will not be excessive."

Dollar Up Against Yen
 TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 21 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The dollar gained against the yen here today, rising to 97.43 yen in late afternoon trading, up from 97.15 late Monday, but still not far above a record low of 96.10 set in November.
Japanese stocks also traded higher today. Led by semiconductors, other electronics, transportation and auto issues, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 139.77 points, or nearly eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 18,096.25 at the close. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 64.03 points, or 0.36 percent.
"People are jumping in on the electricals because they think the dollar has bottomed out," a trader at a major brokerage firm said.
The mark's strength did not go unnoticed here either. On Monday, Hidenori Takigawa, a manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said that the German currency had risen even against the Swiss franc, a traditional haven, indicating how much the markets were being driven by the mark's power.
In the past, the Swiss franc tended to gain from a weaker dollar. But the mark is being quoted around 84.60 Swiss centimes, compared with 83.60 at the start of the year.

HEADLINE: Anti-Crime Bill as Political Dispute: President and G.O.P. Define the Issue

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
 Most Americans think that having more police officers on the streets is a good way to fight crime. So do most police officers and both political parties. So why, in the recent House debate over crime legislation, did the matter of providing more police become the central dispute and the magnet that drew President Clinton's first explicit threat to veto a bill?
The basic dynamic driving the legislation that emerged from the House last week was this: Mr. Clinton and the Democrats swiped the crime issue from the Republicans. Then the Republicans got it back, not by any bold move but by relentless criticism of the 1994 anti-crime legislation. With last November's elections having left the Democrats in disarray on virtually every front, the President now finds himself fighting desperately to reclaim the issue. 
 Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, summed up the Democrats' situation by quoting an old American position on the Panama Canal: "You can't take it from us, because we stole it fair and square."
Never mind that many criminologists believe that crime cannot be fought with Federal legislation. Never mind that previous efforts from Washington have generally been considered ineffective.
For Republicans, the crime issue has been theirs almost by birthright. It was only when a Democratic candidate for President finally said, as Mr. Clinton did in 1992, that he favored the death penalty -- and allowed the execution of a brain-damaged man to go forward before the New Hampshire primary -- that the Republicans began to lose the issue.
Public opinion polls in January 1994 showed crime overtaking the economy as the biggest perceived problem facing the nation. And for the first time, voters thought Democrats and Republicans could handle it equally well.
Since then, the President has signed into law some popular crime-fighting measures. These include a ban on assault weapons and a three-strikes-and-you're-out provision that imposes life sentences on criminals convicted of a Federal crime after two previous convictions.
The Republicans, who can read polls as well as anyone, did not challenge either the ban or the three-strikes proposal in their Contract With America, their 1994 campaign manifesto.
Nor did the contract directly challenge another major element of last year's anti-crime law -- Mr. Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 additional police officers on the street.
The contract's main thrust on crime was to build more prisons, make prisoners serve longer sentences, prevent criminals from getting off on technicalities and cut the prevention programs that Democrats had stuffed into last year's bill.
While there are deep philosophical differences between the parties over how to fight crime, Republicans in the House did not really object to the Democrats' desire to hire more police officers. Indeed, the contract called for "additional law enforcement," an acknowledgment that this was a good idea.
But they saw the President's pledge for 100,000 new officers as dishonest, saying the bill would not come close to paying for that many and would provide communities with only seed money for five years. They also argued that some communities did not need or want more officers, and that the legislation should have concentrated the new officers in high-crime areas. And they portrayed the prevention programs as wasteful social spending.
So the contract collapsed last year's money for police and prevention into a lump sum, or block grant, of $10 billion over five years for local communities to fight crime any way they deemed fit, including the hiring of more police officers.
Over the last two weeks, this provision became the most contentious in the new crime bill, eclipsing other divisive matters that had blocked agreement on crime legislation for nearly a decade. These included measures to allow officers to make searches without warrants and to speed up carrying out executions, in part by ordering Federal courts to defer to state courts.
The Republican changes brought protests from some liberals and some lawyers, who said the changes were a direct assault on fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. (The Republicans even voted down an amendment, proposed by the Democrats, that contained the exact language of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unlawful searches.)
But for the most part, the Republican changes sailed through the House. Even Mr. Clinton, who once taught constitutional law, did not put up a fuss.
The fact is that these constitutional safeguards are political losers with a public fed up with criminals getting off on technicalities and tired of waiting years for executions to be carried out. Being against them would put Mr. Clinton on the wrong, "old Democrat" side of crime.
He made his stand instead on the 100,000 new officers and, for the first time in his White House tenure, he pledged to use the veto against a specific piece of legislation. It was, after all, one of the most visible of his campaign promises to become law, and to retreat on it now would have been unthinkable.
"It's one of his few popular accomplishments," said a Democratic aide in Congress. "If he lost that it would be a major blow. The White House has probably already cut their commercials for '96 on the 100,000 cops."
Even Republicans concede, if backhandedly, that the veto threat on the police issue worked to the President's advantage.
"They run an Administration by survey research," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. And the research shows that governors, mayors and voters believe that more police officers on the beat, along with keeping criminals in prison for their full sentences, is the most effective way to fight crime."
Since the November elections, the Administration has been searching for ways to reassert itself. The crime issue, which Mr. Clinton had turned to his advantage before, provides a logical opportunity.
"There was a feeling that the best way to differentiate himself from the opposition was to make positive pronouncements and to draw lines in the sand," said the Democratic aide. "There was a feeling that he hadn't done a particularly good job with either, and there has been pressure on him to pick a couple of battles."
While the Democrats lost the vote in the House on protecting money for the additional police officers, they had other reasons to rejoice: a vote on a separate amendment indicated that they had the numbers to block any attempt to override a veto.
Moreover, the Democrats appeared to have won the war of words. They were able to frame the debate so that it looked as if the Republicans were eliminating 100,000 police officers -- even though they believed their own bill would provide for more officers than the Clinton measure would if local governments chose to spend all of the money on additional police.
And the veto threat, strengthened by the strong support from House Democrats, also translated quickly into hints of accommodation from Republicans in the Senate, where the bills will be taken up next month.
The Senate seems likely to be more accommodating than the House anyway. Some Republican senators do not like block grants for the same reason that House Republicans once opposed them: the money can easily be diverted from its intended purpose.
But the politics could still prove tricky for Mr. Clinton. The Senate could eliminate money for the 100,000 police officers but send the President an otherwise tough anti-crime package in a single bill.
Mr. Blankley, the Gingrich spokesman, said it would be a bad idea for Mr. Clinton to veto such a measure.
"The way information gets communicated to a general audience is not in multiple paragraphs, but in snippets of headlines, and I don't think he and his party are currently positioned to win in that snippet-information process," Mr. Blankley said. "If he seems to be fighting the Republicans on crime, most people would correctly assume he's wrong. It's been a Republican issue for over 100 years. It's counterintuitive to think that the head of the Democratic Party is tougher."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "POINT BY POINT: The House Crime Bill: What's at Stake"
 
Victim Restitution Act
 Requires that victims of Federal crimes be compensated.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: Limited restitution to victims of sexual abuse and related Federal crimes, and to victims of Federal child pornography offenses.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports the Republican bill.
 
Exclusionary Rule Reform Act
 Expands "good faith" exception to allow courts to accept evidence at trial that was obtained without a search warrant, as long as the police believe they were complying with constitutional rules.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: No provision.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Opposes expansion of the good faith exception beyond the Supreme Court holding.
 
Death Penalty Appeals
 Limits the period of time in which death row inmates can file petitions for habeas corpus in Federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of their sentences. Makes the death penalty easier to impose by reducing the discretion of juries.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: Efforts to limit habeas corpus appeals to Federal courts were dropped because of fear that the controversial issue would have killed the overall crime bill.
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports limits on habeas corpus if linked to stronger protections of right to counsel than this bill provides.
 
Prisons
 Provides $10.5 billion over five years for new prison construction but tightens conditions on states receiving the money. Puts new limits on prisoner's lawsuits and court orders over-crowding suits. Includes a ban on exercise equipment that enhances fighting strength and curtails other amenities available to prisoners.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: Provided $7.9 billion for 1996-2000 for building prisons but imposed different and to some extent looser conditions on eligibility for the money.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Says the eligibility standards in the new legislation are so stringent that few states will be able to receive state prison funds, and to meet the standards many states will have to spend billions of their own dollars. Generally supports the provisions limiting abusive prisoner lawsuits.
 
Police and Prevention
 Grants for new community police officers and crime prevention programs folded into $10 billion in block grants.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: Provided $8.8 billion to put new police officer's on the nation's streets and $6.9 for crime prevention programs.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Opposes eliminating any crime prevention programs. President Clinton said block grant plan would undermine his pledge to put 100,000 more officers on the street and has threatened a veto.
 
Criminal Aliens
 Further speeds up deportation procedures for criminal aliens and expands the number of crimes for which an alien can be deported. Provides additional funds to reimburse states for incarcerting criminal aliens.
 
1994 CRIME LAW: Expedited deportation for aliens who are not lawful permanent residents. Provided $1.8 billion to reimburse states for incarceration of illegal criminal aliens.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Generally supports the Republican bill

HEADLINE: Skilled Asians Leaving U.S. For High-Tech Jobs at Home

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
Twenty-five years after coming to the United States from Taiwan, David Chiang had all the trappings of the American dream: a job as a jet engine engineer, three happy children and a home in the suburbs with a station wagon in the driveway.
But for all his achievements, he felt as if he was in a rut -- one of hundreds of engineers at General Electric Aircraft Engines vying for the few promotions that would pop up every now and then. 
 In the depths of white-collar anxiety, he took a trip to Taiwan two years ago and discovered that his once struggling country was pushing to create an aerospace industry of its own. As a Chinese speaker with impeccable high-tech credentials, he was the hottest commodity around.
Within seven months, he had put his brick colonial near Cincinnati on the market, packed up his family and returned to Taiwan -- this time on the management fast track at the Government-sponsored Center for Aviation and Space Technology.
"It's been great so far," said Mr. Chiang, who now supervises 12 engineers working on jet engine development. "Of course, there's no place like the States for living, but here, I have a good future and it's a warm feeling to know that you are working for your own country."
Mr. Chiang is part of a rising homeward flow of engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs, following an economic boom in the Far East that has transformed countries like India, Taiwan and Korea into high-tech powerhouses.
For years, the best and brightest of Asia flocked to the United States to pursue advanced degrees and jobs on the cutting edge of business, science and technology.
But with the American recession of the last four years and the development of high-technology industries in Asia rivaling the best of the West, a small but significant number of Asian-born professionals, from aerospace engineers in Los Angeles to financial analysts on Wall Street, have begun moving home.
They are part of a growing emigration that the Census Bureau now estimates at 195,000 foreign-born Americans each year -- the highest number since World War I.
The number parallels the surge in immigration and, demographers say, keenly reflects the fluidity of movement in the expanding global village, the way people move back and forth between countries.
Many of those returning to Asia, in fact, retain their American citizenship or their green cards as a way of keeping their global options open. They are, for all intents and purposes, neither here nor there forever.
The journey is not always smooth -- filled with homesickness and sometimes resentment from co-workers who see them as intruders. Nevertheless, from computer programmers in Bangalore, known as the Silicon Valley of India, to aerospace engineers in Taiwan's high-technology city, Hsinchu, the returning expatriates have found their homelands bursting with new enterprises and optimism.
In Taiwan, the high-tech migration is being called the "rencai huiliu," literally the "return flow of human talent." But for the thousands of American-trained scientists, weaned on late-night pizza at the computer center and shopping at the mall, it is simply called the reverse brain drain.
"It's not just Taiwan, but the whole of Asia is developing so fast," said Li Chen-ching, director of cultural affairs for the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, which serves as Taiwan's embassy in the United States. "People know that the future is in the Far East."
When David Chiang left Taiwan in 1978 to study at the University of Cincinnati, there was not much opportunity in his native land for a young engineer with an advanced degree.
Taipei was still a steaming city known for cheap clothes and cut-rate electronics; the prestigious National Tsing Hua University was surrounded by rice paddies and rural villages.
A majority of his classmates left for the United States after graduation and few returned after receiving degrees in advanced fields like avionics and computer design.
Like many students who came to the United States, Mr. Chiang always wanted to return to be with his aging parents and have his children grow up among Chinese, although he knew there was no place he could put his advanced skills to work.
It was only two years ago that he realized how much his homeland had changed. Around his alma mater in Hsinchu, a sprawling new technology and industrial park had risen out of the fields. Scattered through the park were tennis courts, swimming pools, new condominiums with all the modern conveniences and even a bilingual school for the children of the returning engineers.
He got an interview with the Center for Aviation and Space Technology and on returning home, weighed his chances of advancing at General Electric against moving into management in Taiwan.
In Taiwan, he saw a new industry sprouting and sensed the opportunities before him. With all the aerospace cutbacks in the United States, he jumped at the chance to go home, even at a 30 percent pay cut.
"The best part is that we can spend all our weekends with my parents and my wife's parents," Mr. Chiang said.
The growth of opportunities in Asia has even attracted a small number of engineers and scientists from those who were born in Asia but grew up in the United States. They are far less emotionally attached to Asia than their parents' generation, but have been drawn home by the opportunities available to them.
Min Choi, a 32-year-old financing specialist from Astoria, came to the United States from Korea with his family in 1976, when he was 12. He went to high school in Flushing and got a degree in economics from Rutgers.
But after working as a commodity credit analyst for Lehman Brothers and an assistant manager for the Bank of Seoul in New York, he traded his American comforts for the harsh life of a "hoesawan," a Korean company man.
His parents were stunned at his decision to return, but ultimately relented and wished him well in his new position as an assistant manager in charge of international finance for Cheil Foods and Chemicals Inc., the largest food company in Korea.
Even with a 40 percent pay cut, he is happy with his decision. "Five to eight years down the line is where I'm looking," he said. "It's a great adventure, that's for sure."
What has been hardest for Mr. Choi is adapting to a society that is, in many ways, foreign to him. He quickly shed his flashy Wall Street cuff links, fancy ties and suspenders for plain dark business suits. He embraced the Korean corporate work schedule of six days a week, 12 hours a day with weekly late-night drinking binges with fellow executives. "I try to keep that to a minimum," he said. "They drink like we do in college -- drink till you drop."
Denny Ko, the president of a high-tech consulting and investment concern in Torrance, Calif., said that adapting to Asian business culture is difficult, even for those who grew up in Asia.
Mr. Ko was recruited three and a half years ago to start a national aerospace company, the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation. He seemed to be the perfect match -- he had grown up in Taiwan, had a doctorate in aeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology and had successfully formed several high-tech businesses in Taiwan and the United States.
But before the end of his first year on the job he began to understand how vast are the differences in culture between Taiwan and the United States.
Executives said nothing in meetings; debate was virtually unheard of. Business was often conducted in private, in contrast to the boisterous meetings of American business.
He also sensed a simmering resentment from co-workers that an outsider from America had been put in charge. After two years, his contract with Taiwan Aerospace expired and he headed home for Torrance.
"Even though you are Chinese and you speak Chinese and read Chinese, your work and social experience is all American," Mr. Ko said. "It just got to the point where I couldn't get anything done. It was a mess and I had to walk away."
The biggest problems in adapting to a new culture have been experienced by the children, some of whom do not speak their parents' native language.
Mr. Chiang said he was lucky that all his children spoke excellent Chinese. His two youngest, then 2 and 5, easily adapted to their new lives.
But his oldest daughter, who was then 11, was homesick for America and constantly asked about returning.
Mr. Chiang said he felt it would benefit his children to have grown up in both countries, but he was heartbroken to see his daughter so sad.
Then, several months after the move to Taiwan, a McDonald's restaurant opened 10 minutes from their home in Hsinchu.
For Mr. Chiang's daughter, it was a small but important link that seemed to say that Taiwan and America were not so distant after all.
"That was a real savior," he said. "I'm not a big fan, but they loved it."

HEADLINE: Rates Up Sharply In Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Responding to pressure from the United States, Mexico's central bank said today that it was raising already high short-term interest rates a further 10 percentage points, pushing the rate on some Government debts to 50 percent.
United States officials have insisted that Mexico tighten its credit substantially and reduce its money supply as part of the conditions of $20 billion in American assistance proposed by the Clinton Administration. 
 An official at the Mexican central bank said today that the decision to increase interest rates "arose from the negotiations between Mexico and the United States" continuing in Washington and the sharp drop in the value of the peso late last week.
Bank officials said the higher rates should help stem the flow of money out of Mexico and strengthen the badly weakened peso by making Government debt and other investments denominated in pesos more attractive to buyers.
The currency markets responded favorably to the central bank's move, and the peso rose to an exchange rate of 5.565 to the dollar, up from 5.725 to the dollar on Friday.
But Mexican stocks fell, with the benchmark index dropping 64.33 points, or 3.51 percent, to close at 1,766.14, a loss that reflected investors' concerns that higher interest rates would hurt company earnings.
Analysts reacted somewhat skeptically to the central bank's rate move, saying that while the higher rates might bolster the peso in the short run, they would hit Mexico's faltering banks hard. The banks' large portfolios of overdue loans will increase, analysts said, and credit will be so costly that bankers will see little new business.
"All we've seen so far has been very weak policy responses to a crisis that is a lot more fundamental," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist here. "This will have only a limited effect on the market, and the long-term outcome is not necessarily positive."
Mr. Ramirez de la O said the central bank might have raised interest rates today in an attempt to influence the negotiations in Washington over the details of the $20 billion in direct American help.
The intense discussion between American and Mexican finance officials that have been going on since Thursday resulted in a preliminary agreement by the Mexicans to sharply increase interest rates.
Along with the stricter Mexican fiscal and monetary policy, restrictions have been written into the proposed agreement by American negotiators that would make it extremely hard for the Mexican Government to start spending freely if economic and political conditions in the country worsened.
A spokesman for the United States Treasury said the two sides were making "good progress" at the talks led by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, but could not say when an announcement would be made.
Mexico's state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, reacted in measured terms today to a report from Washington that the United States was seeking fuller control over the flow of Mexican oil revenue as a condition for the economic help.
"The Government will keep at all times its unrestricted freedom to administer the resources from oil exports," a statement by Pemex said. "The United States Government could only have access to some of these funds on a contingency basis if there had been a prior case of Mexico failing to meet payment obligations."
Pemex did not confirm or deny the reported proposal to channel all oil-export revenue through the American Federal Reserve, but said that both it and the Mexican central bank would "have the use of the funds obtained from oil exports, with every freedom and with no restriction of any kind." It added that in any case, such arrangements were not new, and it called the possibility of a Mexican default on loan payments a "remote eventuality."
Economists and investors have many doubts about Mexico's economic recovery plan, but some of the most persistent arise from Mexico's lack of a viable exchange-rate policy for determining the value of the peso against the dollar. The Mexican Government has let the peso float freely since Dec. 21, and as a result the peso's value has shifted erratically. Before the devaluation, a peso was worth slightly less than 29 cents. At today's exchange rate of 5.565, it is worth a bit less than 18 cents.
In various documents, the Mexican central bank has said that it will continue to allow the peso's value to float. But that creates an uncertainty that has harmed Mexican markets, analysts said.
The central bank, while so far rejecting suggestions that Mexico establish an independent currency board to set the peso's value, is reported close to approving a mechanism that would index debt to the inflation rate. Chile has used a similar system for more than a decade.
A Mexican central bank official said the plan under discussion had "nothing to do with exchange-rate policy," and was only a measure to protect the principal in bank loans from being eroded by inflation. Economists here and in the United States, however, say that such a plan, if adopted, would in effect constitute a new exchange-rate policy.
Under the plan, the Mexican central bank would make regular, even daily, measurements of the rate of inflation. The principal of a loan would be adjusted to maintain the same inflation-adjusted level as before, relieving inflationary pressures to raise interest rates.
Thus, for example, if inflation were estimated to have risen 3 percent, the principal on a loan would also be increased 3 percent. There is a nominal increase in principal, but in real terms it remains constant.
But economists fear that by indexing inflation in this way, Mexico would have a harder time bringing rates back down. "It constitutes almost an incorporation of inflation into economic expectations," said Lawrence B. Goodman of Salomon Brothers in New York. "The implications could be terrible."

HEADLINE: Republicans Skeptical of Its Worth Would Like to Eliminate Education Department

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Terrel H. Bell was on the way to a State of the Union address by Ronald Reagan more than a decade ago when he received a lesson in relativity. His car phone rang and the President's chief of staff told Mr. Bell, who was the Secretary of Education, to turn back and head home.
Someone had realized that it was not the practice to have the entire Cabinet in one place because of the question of succession. "And I ranked dead last," Mr. Bell said. 
 As he watched the speech at home on television, Mr. Bell shared a joke with his wife. "I got sent home," he said. "But don't worry. By the time this is over, I might be President."
Since its creation under President Jimmy Carter in 1980, the Department of Education has had an awkward existence as a bureaucracy under constant fire. Republicans perceived it as a political payoff to the National Education Association, a huge union that historically -- and often energetically -- has thrown its support behind the Democrats.
Now, Speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other powerful Republicans have renewed the call to eliminate the department.
"People were always asking me if I thought we even needed the department," said William J. Bennett, an Education Secretary under President Reagan. "I often told them, 'No.' "
The department's primary duty is the distribution of about $30 billion a year in loans and grants through 240 programs. It also sets education policy guidlinees and goals and oversees college accrediting agencies. If the department is eliminated, its critics concede, many of its duties would have to be taken over by other agencies.
Mr. Reagan called for the department's elimination before he took office in 1982. And other politicians, complaining about bloated bureaucracies and Federal meddling, have repeated the call since then.
"When we got here, this department had suffered 12 years of neglect," said Madeleine M. Kunin, the Deputy Secretary for Education. "I wouldn't say benign neglect. It was really very tough neglect."
Files were jammed in cluttered corners. The computer system had hardly been updated in two decades. The loan program that is at the center of the department's duties was a paradigm of bureaucratic mismanagement because of soaring student loan defaults. Conservatives assailed the way the agency carried out its civil rights duties, contending that it followed a liberal agenda.
Even the department's building -- now undergoing a $60 million overhaul -- was a mess, full of asbestos and aged wiring. Morale was so bad, went one story making the rounds, that Mr. Bennett refused to ride the elevators with bureaucrats for fear of catching their malaise.
This week, Representative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, introduced legislation to merge the Departments of Labor and Education. Such a move would eliminate Education's separate Cabinet rank, bring schools and job training under one department and the United States in line with scores of other countries.
Those who would like to see the department eliminated have two former Education Secretaries on their side, Mr. Bennett and Lamar Alexander, a former Tennessee Governor who was head of the department under President George Bush.
In testimony before the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee on Jan. 26, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Alexander called for all the important programs handled by the department to be distributed among various agencies.
"Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would leave the Department of Education with nothing to do," they said in their joint testimony, "there would be no need to retain it."
Yet eliminating the department would send the wrong message, most education specialists say. Coming at a time of educational crises and when industry needs a well-trained, literate work force, a Federal role is crucial, these experts say, even if it is largely symbolic.
The current Education Secretary, Richard W. Riley, a soft-spoken former Governor of South Carolina who backs giving the states control over policy and spending, has stayed largely outside the debate. But he chafes at its timing.
"I didn't come here to fight for the bureaucracy," he said. "That's not my nature. But it hits me that to do away with the Department of Education at this particular moment in history would be like doing away with the Department of the Army in the middle of World War II."
It would also be like swatting at a fly on the back of Federal bureaucracy. The Education Department spends about one-tenth of what the Department of Health and Human Services or the Pentagon spends and half of what goes to the Agriculture Department each year. Of all Cabinet departments, it has the smallest staff by far, about 5,000, compared with more than 800,000 in the Defense Department and about 100,000 in the Agriculture Department.
Though nearly 70 million Americans are involved in education and the nation as a whole spends about $500 billion a year on it, the Federal Government contributes only about 8 percent. Most school money comes from local property taxes.
Under Mr. Riley, the department has restructured the loan process, backing direct loans managed by the Government in a program that has drawn the ire of the banking industry and conservatives who do not trust the Federal bureaucracy to manage so large a task.
Smaller programs are also under assault, since over the years Congress has hidden its share of pork in the Education Department. For instance, more than a dozen programs that benefit only Hawaii. And at least one program, which uses the arts as therapy with disabled children, is the brainchild and namesake of the Kennedy family.
"We have to cut back," acknowledged Marshall Smith, an Under Secretary of Education. "But what we are cutting back is what Congress put in."
But Mr. Bell, the former Education Secretary, fears that eliminating the department would give states too much latitude in an area that they have yet to prove themselves. "We talk about giving more responsibility to the states and I think we should," he said. "But we shouldn't do it because of their record in education. It's been terrible."
Increasingly, guidance -- not micro-management -- has become the department's central theme. The broadest education legislation passed in years, the Goals 2000 program, was a Republican idea first backed by President Bush but passed only last year. It specifically stays out of the business of dictating policy, relying instead on lump sums, or block grants, to states as they work toward upgrading education levels to meet voluntary achievement standards in everything from music to math.
The department's new strategic plan, a 28-page document intended to map the future, repeatedly emphasizes the need for states to make their own decisions.
"The tendency is always to do things the way they have been done," Mr. Smith said. That, he adds, has led to an odd dichotomy at the Federal level. "What we need now is to tell people to be innovative," he said. Under Goals 2000, he added, that mandate "comes with the force of law."
"We are legislating flexibility," Mr. Smith said. "There is something crazy about that, I know. But if you deal with people used to regulations you need to do more than just do away with the regulations."
But changing old patterns is not easy. And it is not entirely the business of the Education Department since, in fact, many Federal programs already fall to other agencies.
The Head Start program for pre-schoolers, for instance, is operated by the Department of Health and Human Services; the Department of Defense runs schools on military bases; the Department of the Interior deals with education on Indian reservations, and the Department of Energy runs technology programs.
Science projects usually fall to the National Science Foundation and the Labor Department has long had purview over job training programs, though it increasingly shares that mandate with the Department of Education. The Commerce Department finances technology training programs. And student health issues fall to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Committee on Education and Labor, believes that pulling these stray strands together can only help. To that end, he backs the Gunderson proposal to merge the Labor and Education Departments. And he has another idea, too. "Probably adding Health and Human Services to that group would also make some sense."
Then again, God is in the details.
"I honestly don't know how you get rid of the department," said Leo Kornfeld, a former corporate chief executive who runs the Education Department's direct loan program. "I mean, how do you do it? All this stuff has to go somewhere."

HEADLINE: In Tough Neighborhood, Students Show Courage

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The walk to school is not easy for any of the children at Junior High School 263 in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
For some, the difficulty begins with the first step from bed, as 12-year-olds pick their way through decrepit apartments, hallways littered with crack vials and buildings riddled with bullet holes. For the children who live in the nearby homeless shelter, the walk is one more trip through one more neighborhood, the latest steps in their odyssey of displacement. 
 Even the many students blessed with dedicated parents have to travel perilous streets to get to the squat brick school that sits surrounded by some of the city's most troubled public housing projects.
"I don't think you could get a more challenging neighborhood for a school child to have to deal with," said Margo Spielberg, the principal at J.H.S. 263. "To come to school, to thrive, it's the truest test of endurance and strength."
The test asks a lot, perhaps too much, demanding that junior high school students find within themselves not only the strength to make the ordinary choices of a child -- difficult enough -- but also to overcome the extraordinary failings of those around them.
Ivy Pearson, 12, walks through the streets of Brownsville every morning, past the grown men who whistle at her and the fourth graders who already hang around on the corners with no intention of going to school.
"It doesn't matter how old you are -- courage can be needed at any age," said Ivy, a sixth grader. "And you can come up with that courage."
It is tough talk, but it is a language of personal responsibility that fills the classrooms of J.H.S. 263. The students speak with an unflinching equanimity about the facts of life in Brownsville, and there is no great reservoir of empathy toward those who cannot seem to make it to school and make something of their time there.
"Whatever is wrong, the kids are supposed to go to school," said Benny Gary, 13, who lives in the Marcus Garvey Houses. "They should be able to do it."
It is, of course, the children who do not brave the daily walk to school who most frequently wind up in the newspaper headlines. Teachers in the neighborhood's schools have grown wearily accustomed to seeing their students on television broadcasts about the latest notorious violent crime.
Last December, three teen-agers, all former students at J.H.S. 263, were arrested and charged with murder. The police have said the three were accomplices in the failed, fatal holdup of a Brooklyn bicycle store that ended with a 26-year-old New York City police officer dead.
The particulars of the lives of the teen-agers were hardly startling: raised in the Brownsville Houses with no fathers in the household, trips to Family Court, neglect, economic hardship and truancy.
What was held out to them at the junior high school on Chester Street, modest but real, was not seized.
"If being from the Brownsville Houses is their excuse, it's not enough," Shatia Simmons, 12, said of the arrested teen-agers. "I've been here all my life. And trust me, I have faced it all."
Shatia lives in the Van Dyke Houses. She said she knows about gangs and killings, about the lethal arbitrariness that can interrupt the life of a seventh grader.
"It can be bad," she said. "People can come up to you thinking you are somebody else, and they can try and stab you. Sometimes, you wish you could just get your mind blank. But I keep coming. Last year, I didn't even know how to spell dictionary. I was the laughingstock of the sixth grade. Now, my books are filled with work."
And so day after day, imperfect morning after imperfect morning, hundreds of students at J.H.S. 263, by whatever means necessary, come up with the required courage.
Teachers at the school, which was termed "wild" by the principal when she took it over in 1990, used to have to carry around their own doorknobs to get into classrooms that had been vandalized. But now the school has recruited young, dedicated teachers and retained its most capable veteran staff members.
There is a new library and two computer labs. Attendance averages 85 percent, no tiny triumph given that a full quarter of students failed to turn up on any given day several years ago. Ms. Spielberg has divided the more than 600 students into four "mini-schools" to foster order and more focused teaching.
The school isn't idyllic. Children are checked for weapons daily. Fights occur; 13-year-olds wind up arrested or pregnant. But reading levels are up, and the district school board is considering expanding J.H.S. 263 to include fifth graders.
"We call it the renaissance," said Martin Brodsky, an assistant principal. "But it's the school that has undergone the renaissance, not the kids. The kids have always been there for us to work with."
One day recently, a dozen of those children gathered to talk about their strong feeling that their neighborhood should not serve as justification for a surrender to violence or defeat.
"To me, Brownsville is not a bad place," said Lakesha Perry, 13. "I've been in worse. It's a place you just have to work harder to do what you want to do. But you can make up your mind what it is you want to do. You can do that."
Almost none of the dozen students had both parents in their homes. All had come to J.H.S. 263 afraid of what they would encounter. Each said they felt fear on their way to and from the building, set against the looming towers of the Langston Hughes Houses. But their conviction that the school offered real rewards was fierce, their belief that children their age could be capable of deciding whether to go to school or to go bad was firm.
"Every day you get up and basically hope you see another day," said Shawn Gladden, 13. "I didn't know what I would find at this school. But this school is everything I was looking for."

HEADLINE: Gambling Helps Tribe Invest In Education and the Future

SERIES: Hitting the Jackpot: Casino Money and the Pequots - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STONINGTON, Conn.

 BODY:
In July 1990, Margaret Field, headmaster of the Pine Point School left the campus and drove north with the school's banker in tow, to sing the praises of private education to leaders of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe in Ledyard.
The Pequots were on the verge of striking it rich in the casino business, and the headmaster was hoping to build a connection. 
 Her school was in trouble: enrollment had dropped during the recession, and pledges to pay for a new $1.5 million gymnasium and arts building were not coming in. Three times during the previous school year, members of the board of trustees had dipped into their own pockets to pay faculty salaries.
Ms. Field left that day thinking that she had made a good impression on the seven-member tribal council.
And she was right. The seed planted that day five years ago has borne fruit, for both the struggling private school and the Pequots, owners of Foxwoods, now the most profitable casino in the nation.
Today, one in six students in the lower grades at Pine Point are Pequots -- their entire $9,200 tuition paid for by the tribe. The tribe has its own private Pine Point bus, which barrels up through the woods along Barnes Road to the secluded campus daily. A Pequot sits on the board of trustees. A Pequot, Alan Pearson Jr., has pledged to donate two fully loaded personal computer systems every year until his 7-year-old son, Matthew, graduates in eight years.
And what did the Pequots get in return? Pine Point's 7-to-1 student-teacher ratio is a third that of the local public schools. The suburban private school's curriculum now includes regular programs of American Indian dancers and story tellers.
Less quantifiable but quite crucial, tribal members say, is the chance to be part of the region's network of old-school ties. In the hallways of Pine Point, these parents say, where overstated grunge flannel and Doc Martens boots mix side by side with soft pastel sweater sets, the future of the region is being written. And the Pequots, for perhaps the first time in their history, are insiders.
"A lot of these kids are going to be the next selectmen, the next mayors," said Joey Carter, who heads up public relations for the Pequots, and who has a son, Jared, in the fifth grade at Pine Point. "They're going to understand the Pequots because half of them will have gone to school together."
Tribal officials say that what is happening at Pine Point is also mirrored across a whole spectrum of areas where the Pequots are reaching out beyond the walls of their casino, exploring their role in the community -- economically and culturally, as Indians and as Connecticut residents.
Foxwoods, which earned an estimated $800 million to $900 million last year before expenses, is probably at its pinnacle, they say, its regional monopoly as the only casino in New England almost over. Other tribes are preparing to start casinos and Gov. John G. Rowland has said he is open to the idea of legalizing gambling off reservation lands, which could open the state to many interested parties, including Donald Trump. Diversifying the tribe's economic base will mean reaching out farther still.
"You had tremendous early success and now the question becomes what do you do with that and how does that play out over time?" said A. Searle Field, who was former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s chief of staff until he was hired last year by the Pequots to manage the tribe's noncasino investments. "The tribe has not reached a finish line," Mr. Field said.
 
Charity and Investing
Quick Decisions By Tribal Council
One of the extraordinary advantages the Pequots have is their small size, which eliminates the need for a bureaucracy. They govern themselves with a seven-member tribal council that has been given the power to set policy and make decisions quickly.
Mr. Carter, the tribal spokesman, heard, for example, about a playground near the reservation that was in such disrepair that it could not be used by local children. It seemed like a good cause, he said, so he took it to his council colleagues. He is in the construction business and swiftly calculated how many cubic yards of concrete and gravel would be needed, how many trucks to haul it, and how much labor and how long it would take. The council took about five minutes to say yes, Mr. Carter said. Dump trucks were rolling the next day.
Such efforts have not always been warmly received. Local critics routinely denounce the Pequots as modern-day imperialists, out to colonize and buy up every square inch of land they can.
"They think that putting land into trust is a God-given right," said one nearby town official who would not give his name because he said he feared aggravating already tense relations between the tribe and the town.
Even the tribe's high-profile charity work is seen by such critics as grandstanding public relations.
Complain or not, the Pequots have become a source of major capital investment in Connecticut as they have reached out beyond their borders. The targets of their charity and investment are a real mix, and while council members will not go into great detail in explaining their choices, tribe members say they are open to all comers and willing to consider any reasonable pitch.
Last year, the little tribe gave $10 million to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington for a new American Indian building -- the single biggest contribution ever to the museum. The Special Olympics World Games, to be held in New Haven this summer, got $2 million.
The tribe recently rescued a local minor-league baseball team, the Norwich Navigators, by contributing $500,000 to buy the stadium. Members say that with Foxwoods, the tribe is in the tourist business, and as a policy they try to bolster other local attractions.
The Democratic National Committee received $500,000, and the Old Mystic Baptist Church got $50,000.
When it comes to investments, land has been the focus. In North Stonington, a town adjoining Ledyard, the Pequots were the town's second largest property tax payer in 1993 and have increased their holdings since then, including a silica mine on 315 acres, bought last year.
In Groton, individual tribe members, including Richard Hayward, the tribal chairman, have bought homes and commercial properties. Mr. Hayward, who declined to be interviewed, has invested more than $1 million in the town, including two adjoining residential properties on the waterfront for $920,000 in 1993, according to town records.
Last month, the tribe bought two manufacturing sites, including a printing-press plant in North Stonington, and an industrial parcel previously owned by the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton. Specific plans for those sites have yet to be announced. Earlier this month, the tribe paid $1.4 million for a historic colonial restaurant and inn, called Randall's Ordinary, set on 30 acres in North Stonington.
Mr. Field, charged with developing a diversification plan for the tribe, said that the Pequot investment schedule would be largely focused in Connecticut and that in five years the tribe hopes to be in a position to weather any storm, even if the casino is "not delivering," as Mr. Field put it. High-tech companies are one area of particularly keen tribal council interest, he said.
And things may happen rapidly when they break. "Economic diversification, though in its infancy, can move relatively rapidly, once decisions are made," Mr. Field said.
 
Spending on Education
Student Expenses Paid by the Tribe
But nothing, the Pequots say, takes a higher priority than education. The tribe will pay all members' expenses, from private kindergarten to studies for a Ph.D., law or medical school.
And the inducements have worked. More than a third of the tribe's 140 school-age children are now enrolled in private schools and academies around the region, from the Williams School to the Norwich Free Academy and St. Thomas More, and about a third of the adult tribe members are attending college.
"The future of this tribe is going to be education," said Mr. Pearson, a supervisor at the casino whose son Matthew attends Pine Point. "If we cannot give them the best that we can give them, then we shouldn't be allowed to exist."
The story of Pine Point -- a kindergarten through ninth-grade school that routinely sends graduates to places like Choate, Loomis Chaffee and St. George's in Newport, R.I. -- illustrates what can happen when that kind of determination is backed by immense financial clout.
Although the 17 Pequot students here represent only about 7 percent of the Pine Point student body of 254, the impact of Pequot parents like Mr. Pearson is considerable.
Beyond his own contribution of computer equipment, Mr. Pearson has challenged other tribal parents to match his largesse, and plans to petition the Pequot tribal council to underwrite a $250,000 capital expansion of the school's science and technology lab. He's confident they will go along.
Many Pequots say having the option of a private education has made a huge difference. Sandee Kirchner said she believed that her son, Carl, who started in public school before switching to Pine Point, had been "slipping through the cracks."
"He had 28 kids in his class and one teacher and an aide for half an hour out of the day," Mrs. Kirchner said. "They didn't even know he was there."
Tensions with the public schools in Ledyard have also worsened, tribe members say, as anti-tribe sentiment over land acquisitions and envy have boiled through local towns.
"When you have a choice of having your child either get beat up or talked down to or ignored, and the choice of putting them in an environment where they're treated like other children and they are encouraged to participate, which environment would you put your child in?" said Judy Bell, a tribe member who has two grandchildren at Pine Point and another on a waiting list. "We have a choice now -- years ago there was no choice."
Pine Point, founded in 1948 by a group of local families, is a school where every student of both sexes takes dance every year, and where there is an emphasis on self-expression and art. The curriculum is integrated across every subject, per the teachings of John Coe, the British educational theorist. If the subject in history is ancient Egypt, for example, the students will likely construct pyramids in art class.
It is a school with its own 24-foot boat, which the ninth graders use to study the ecology of Long Island Sound for their science class, and where the winning recitation at a recent poetry contest was Sir Walter Scott's "Lochinvar."
It is a place of great exuberance, where a life-sized papier-mache man, his arms thrown wide, hangs upside down from the front entry ceiling, his long black hair hanging down, his mouth formed into the perfect round O of a shriek -- there just to make you think.
Administrators here say programs in arts, music and dance were already borrowing from American Indian themes before the first tribal enrollment in the school and will do so more in the future, with the Pequots as full partners. Indeed, tribal parents are considered an important curriculum resource.
"They're always asking me questions, can I get us some information or get us in contact with somebody," said Mrs. Kirchner, who married into the tribe and has no Indian heritage. "They wanted to know about the harvest," she said. "That was their latest thing."
Sometimes the Pequots learn about themselves at Pine Point. Tom and Delia Christensen, for example, who moved here from Utah last year to rejoin the Pequot tribe, and the Pearsons, who moved back from Florida two years ago, knew few relatives For them, Pine Point is a place of socialization. The Christensens said that the idea of all-expenses-paid private education was one of the reasons they moved back to the reservation and that Pine Point, in particular, is one of the reasons they would never consider leaving.
 
Forging a Link
How Pequots Join Behind a School
The Pine Point-Pequot connection did not just happen.
Governor Weicker was running for governor in 1990, and the man he later hired as his chief of staff, Mr. Field, now the Pequot investment administrator, was a past president of the Pine Point board of trustees, and a boyhood friend of the Pequot tribal chairman, Mr. Hayward.
Mr. Field said he steered the Pequots toward Pine Point in the interests of the school where he had sent his own children, but also for the tribe's benefit. Mostly white schools like Pine Point were coming under increasing pressure to increase minority enrollment, and here, right in Pine Point's backyard, was a minority group with huge economic potential as well. At the same time, Mr. Field's boss, Mr. Weicker, was pushing a voluntary integration plan in the public schools.
"We were making sure Pine Point didn't become a magnet for white flight," Mr. Field said. "It made sense to reach out to a group that was developing some prosperity but was looking for some quality."
Tribal policies also changed. Under the new tribal rules passed by the council over the last few years, profit-sharing from the casino is directly linked, on a point system, to one's educational attainment.
Pine Point's current headmaster, Barry Bedrick, said the bottom line was that in the 1990's Pine Point could no longer be the closeted, low-profile little school that it had been for half a century. Like the Pequots, the school had to evolve.
"Schools have changed, and this one particularly, has grown up," he said. Before the school's financial crisis, Mr. Bedrick added, "the energy went entirely into the education of the kids in the classroom, and at some point the school had to figure out that we had to do more than that -- have a soundly run business, market itself, reach out to new constituencies -- and not just be an insular place where kids could get a nice education."
 
Higher Education
Special Programs Tied to University
In a classroom on the Groton campus of the University of New Haven, 14 adult Pequots -- or nearly one in 10 in the tribe -- began work this month on an education program that will award them, in two years, a degree unlike any other. The Pequots helped the school create the program and endowed it as a new department of tribal management.
The degrees will be, in their core curriculum, identical to the standard associate degrees in business offered by the university. In place of all cultural studies, however -- in music and philosophy in particular -- American Indian themes will be supplanted. The goal is to have a whole cadre of trained Pequot managers who can take over various tribal business affairs with maximum sensitivity and conformity to American Indian customs.
"It's designed to take a group of individuals through a two-year program as a team, on projects together," said Douglas Johnson. Mr. Johnson is acting president of the the tribe's casino management school, the Pequot Academy, which spawned the new University of New Haven program. The casino academy, with a faculty of eight and a capacity of 1,400 students per term, is geared solely to the casino and is open to all employees. The New Haven program is just for Pequots.
But wealth gives people more choices. A fierce debate has been building within the Pequot tribe about the future direction of its education policies. Should the tribe continue to send its children to established schools like Pine Point? Or should it charter its own school on the reservation, with its own handmade curriculum like the school in Groton?
Tribe members like Mr. Carter are insistent that the Pequots, even if they can afford it, must continue to mix with the outside world and not become insular or inward looking. For many Indian tribes, he argues, that has been a recipe for failure.
"A lot of the reservations in the Midwest, people don't leave there -- 90 years and they've never been off the reservation," he said. "It's very difficult to try to adapt with someone and try to make a business deal if you don't really know who they are."
Other tribe members, like Mrs. Bell, are just as vehement in supporting the idea of a Pequot private school. "The tribe has, right now I feel, an obligation to invest in our children, from the little ones on up and to provide the best education they can even it is creating a new school system on the reservation," she said.
Bruce A. Kirchner, a senior vice president at the casino and a member of the Pine Point board, said that he believes a Pequot Prep of some sort on the reservation will happen and that a decision will have to be made about his two young sons in time. He said he worries how it could divide the tribe and is not certain what he would do.
"I don't know," he said. "We're very loyal to Pine Point."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
For Buffett wannabes, mixed views of his latest strategy.

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell 

 BODY:
THE periodic disclosure of new holdings by the Omaha billionaire Warren E. Buffett is as eagerly awaited by some investors as the new spring styles in Paris are by the fashion conscious. With well-timed picks in such companies as Coca-Cola and Capital Cities/ABC, Mr. Buffett has racked up an enviable long-term record.
So it was no surprise last week that there was keen interest in the shares of American Express and the PNC Bank Corporation, in which Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said it had large holdings. Both stocks surged on heavy volume on Tuesday, when the holdings were disclosed. 
 Mr. Buffett's style, of course, is to be contrarian, buying good companies with solid managements when they are out of favor. So would a true Buffett wannabe, trying to emulate the master's no-nonsense approach, buy shares in a company after Buffett No. 1 had disclosed his holding, driving up the price?
One source of confidence for investors is that the current prices of both stocks are probably not that much higher than what Mr. Buffett paid, although it is difficult to tell exactly when he bought his shares and at what prices.
American Express disclosed last week that 42 percent of the 48.5 million shares that Mr. Buffett holds -- a 9.8 percent stake -- were purchased this year. That means he paid between $29.25 and $32.375 for them, not too much less than Friday's close of $33.75, up 87.5 cents.
In the case of PNC, the Pittsburgh bank, all that is known is that Mr. Buffett now owns 19.5 million shares, an 8.3 percent stake, much of which was bought in 1994. PNC's stock closed Friday at $24.875, about halfway between its high and low of last year. The shares hovered around $30 for the first half of last year after rising from a trough of $8 in 1990 that was caused by a bundle of bad real-estate loans. But the stock sank as low as $21.50 in October after the company disclosed that it had made an enormous -- and, in retrospect, wrongheaded -- bet on interest rates that would lock it into low yields on investments for two years.
Rumors of Mr. Buffett's interest in PNC predate its most recent problems, so his investment could well be underwater now, although he has been known to buy more shares of companies he likes when they run into short-term trouble.
What of the companies themselves? Both have well regarded senior managements, who are devoted to ever more stingy bouts of cost-cutting, a quality much admired by Mr. Buffett, who named his corporate plane the "Indefensible."
Yet Wall Street analysts, whose advice Mr. Buffett often disdains, are split on these companies. Most are bullish on American Express, which has mostly recovered from credit losses and a restructuring that shed its investment banking businesses.
David Hilder of Morgan Stanley, for example, rates American Express a strong buy, estimating that the stock will shoot to $40 over the next year. He argues that the company's growth will be driven by new products, a plethora of niche credit cards and a new card for purchasing managers.
But many analysts are shying away from PNC; several have published "sell" ratings on the stock, which is unusual on perennially bullish Wall Street.
One PNC bear is Sally Pope Davis of Goldman, Sachs, who argues not only that the bank's ill-fated investments will hurt earnings, but also that those earnings are artificially inflated. That's because PNC is not adding new money into its loan loss reserve as it makes new loans, a situation that it will not be able to maintain.
So what is a prospective Mini-Buffett to do? There seems to be no harm in buying the shares of American Express; Mr. Buffett said he was asking the Government for permission to buy more. But that company is already trading at an eight-year high.
The true long-term contrarian, then, may favor PNC. It is out of favor and well off its highs, for one. Its problems have apparently been fully disclosed and will not get worse. Moreover, even Ms. Pope Davis sees long-term value in the bank's large and expanding operations in mortgages and money management, two fields that are generally more lucrative than basic banking.
One warning, however: one of Mr. Buffett's most disastrous picks was a huge position in PNC's Pittsburgh neighbor, USAir.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Finding Help to Regain Self-Sufficiency

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
She had a baby girl last summer, but J. Sellers felt no joy. She was just 22, recovering from an anguished childhood and finding that maturity brought its own misery.
"I didn't want to see her or hold her," she said of the infant. "I was all wrapped up in my problems, and I couldn't think about anything else." 
 At the time, Miss Sellers was being evicted from an illegal basement apartment in Brooklyn. Unemployed and estranged from the baby's father, she had no place to go. Her isolation was cripplingly complete.
When she was 12, Miss Sellers said, she was sexually abused. She spent the next three years in foster care, but her foster parents had little time for her. She was placed in a psychiatric hospital for several months, an experience that she said was horrific.
"I wasn't crazy, but they were treating me like it," she said softly. "They really put me through the works."
Her only solace during those years was the journal she kept, which helped make some sense of her suffering. She still carries a poem she wrote at 12, simple words of hopelessness:
Can't call home my own, when I got no place to stay.
Can't call money mine, when I have to give it away.
Can't think, my mind blanked out.
Can't scream or even shout.
She fell in love at 17 and hoped to move in with her boyfriend's family. But they resisted, so the pair spent several months on the street.
"We would ride the subway all night long, or sleep in a park," she said. "I wasn't that scared, because he was with me."
Despite her hardship, Miss Sellers finished high school and received an associate's degree in human services from La Guardia Community College. She had a son in 1991 and continued studying and working part time. But in 1993, her boyfriend was shot and killed. Suddenly, she found herself with nothing again.
She had lost her job because of government cutbacks and could not find another. She and her son depended on welfare checks, and when her daughter was born, Miss Sellers was barely getting by.
While she was in the hospital, a social worker told her about the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, an agency supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. For 83 years, the fund has helped charities assist the city's poor, sick, elderly and disabled.
With her eviction imminent, Miss Sellers went to the bureau's East New York Family Center, where counselors help families handle the stress of poverty. A caseworker, Marcia Young, helped her sort through her problems and set priorities.
"She helped me focus on one thing at a time," Miss Sellers said during a visit to the center, as her children played quietly at her feet. "She really listens to me, and I can count on her."
While Miss Sellers stayed with friends, Ms. Young helped her search for housing. In December, she moved into an apartment in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. She has decorated the walls with her diplomas and awards, and while it is not her dream home, she is content.
"I'm happy to have a roof over my head," she said.
Ms. Young helped Miss Sellers apply for city-run day care, and her children should be placed in a program soon. At that point, she will devote her energy to job hunting. She hopes to be a counselor for teen-agers, using personal experience as a guide. But she will settle for anything that pays more than minimum wage.
"All I want is to be self-sufficient," she said. "I'd like to go back to school someday, but I can't think about that yet."
Meanwhile, Miss Sellers is lavishing affection on her children, playing with them for hours each day and making sure they feel loved. She writes daily in her journal, a tattered notebook that she carries everywhere. And she practices her counseling skills on neighbors, who seek her out when they need advice.
"They listen to all I've been through, and they can't believe I'm still here," she said. "If I can make it, they can, too."

HEADLINE: The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate, which peaked at 7.7 percent after the last recession, could have reached 9 percent if a balanced budget had been required, Government and private economists estimate. And a laid-off worker who collected $12,000 in unemployment pay might have received only $7,000 or so.
Such estimates of the potential economic impact are not emphasized very much, however, in the debate over the balanced budget amendment. So far, the battle has focused on its value as a tool to shrink government or to discipline spending. But if the amendment is enacted, the side effect would be huge: a system that has softened recessions since the 1930's would be dismantled. 
 "There are risks associated with a balanced budget, and I don't think anyone should deny them," said William Hoagland, the Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. "Nevertheless, the debate on the floor has been dominated by what we must do to get the budget in balance, not what the risks of a balanced budget amendment might be."
Mr. Hoagland expressed surprise that the biggest risk -- deeper, more painful recessions -- had not figured significantly in the debate, although Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, had called attention to this risk in several floor speeches. "The reason must be that the advocates of a balanced budget see the benefits to the economy as far outweighing the negatives associated with cyclical downturns," Mr. Hoagland said. "That must be what is going on."
No benefit seems to hold more sway than the view that the amendment would shrink the Federal Government by restricting its power to tax and to spend. A dollar not collected and spent by the Government is a dollar left in the hands of the private sector. And the private sector invariably invests money more efficiently than the Government, this view holds.
"The people have spoken clearly that government is too big and we need to do something about it," said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist who favors smaller government. "The problem is that the balanced budget amendment is a heavy-handed solution and risky."
The biggest risk is to the nation's "automatic stabilizers," which have made recessions less severe than they were in the century before World War II. The stabilizers, an outgrowth of Keynesian economics, work this way: When the economy weakens, outlays automatically rise for unemployment pay, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid. Simultaneously, as incomes fall, so do corporate and individual income tax payments. Both elements make more money available for spending, thus helping to pull the economy out of its slump.
The problem, of course, is that the stabilizers make the deficit shoot up -- by roughly $65 billion as a result of the 1990-1991 recession, according to the Treasury Department. Under the balanced budget amendment, Congress and the Administration would be required to get the budget quickly back into balance, through spending cuts, higher tax rates, or a combination of the two -- perhaps even in the midst of a recession.
"The Government would become, almost inevitably, a destabilizer of the economy rather than a stabilizer," said Joseph Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Many economists share that view.
Absent the stabilizers, every 73-cent drop in national income in the last recession would have become a $1 drop, said Bradford DeLong, deputy assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who as a Harvard economist studied this dynamic and recently updated his research. Of the 27 cents in cushioning, 20 cents came from falling tax revenue and 7 cents from the higher spending.
Economists outside the Government offer similar estimates. Ray Fair of Yale University, for example, said for every $10 billion decline in national income during a recession, the deficit rises by $2 billion, as the stabilizers kick in with their higher spending and lower tax revenue.
"We ought not to give up the stabilizers," Professor Fair said. "That would be very Draconian."
Nearly every economist agrees that the American economy requires, if not stabilizers, some substitute method for offsetting recessions in an era of balanced budgets. And those who favor the amendment are no exception.
"It would be a disaster to lose the stabilizers," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, who endorses the amendment as a necessary step if the nation is to afford the high cost of Social Security and Medicare for the baby boom generation, which reaches retirement age early in the next century.
Mr. Bergsten notes that the amendment, as now worded, would permit Congress to bring back the stabilizers by a three-fifths vote in both houses. The vote would permit the necessary deficit spending to finance the stabilizers.
While a three-fifths vote is a big hurdle, Mr. Bergsten and others argue that Congress would get used to authorizing the necessary deficits during recessions. Nevertheless, he would prefer a different solution. Once through the painful process of balancing the budget by 2002, as required by the amendment, then the Government should run budget surpluses in years of strong economic growth and full employment, Mr. Bergsten said.
The surpluses would cover the rising costs of the stabilizers during recessions. "You could go down to a balanced budget in the hard years, and still give the economy a little stimulus," he said.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the surplus needed to pay for the stabilizers during a recession as severe as that of 1981-1982, the worst since World War II, would be 1 percent of the national income during robust periods of full employment, and perhaps as much as 1.5 percent.
That would mean an annual surplus in today's dollars of $70 billion to $100 billion, rather than the nearly $200 billion of so in annual deficits expected under current policy. Most of the $200 billion is to help pay for programs like highway construction and new weaponry that have fixed costs and do not fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economy, as unemployment pay, food stamps, tax revenues and the other stabilizers do.
Some economists -- including Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics who is with the Hoover Institute -- hold that the stabilizers, despite the ballyhoo, are no longer so important. The Federal Reserve, through monetary policy, can more than offset their disappearance by lowering interest rates an extra notch or two to give the economy an additional stimulus in hard times.
"I have looked at many episodes in the world in which monetary policy went one way and fiscal policy the other, and I have never found a case in which monetary policy did not dominate," Mr. Friedman said. He favors a balanced budget amendment that would shrink the Federal Government by putting a ceiling on the tax increases that could be enacted to balance the budget.
But the Clinton Administration and even Federal Reserve officials question whether monetary policy could alone handle the task of reviving an economy in recession. The stabilizers, they note, kick in automatically -- before the Federal Reserve and most economists often realize that the economy is falling toward recession.
A recession might be well along and getting deeper before the Fed recognized the problem and began to drop rates. The lower rates, in turn, would not be felt in the economy for a year to 18 months, the traditional lag. And even if the Fed acted quickly enough, the economy would behave in new and different ways without the stabilizers.
"My guess is that we would get it wrong the first time we went into recession, making that recession much deeper than it should be," said a Federal Reserve official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "But we would learn from that experience and do a better job thereafter."

HEADLINE: Investors Having Second Thoughts on Hungary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Hungary, once the lustrous pioneer in attracting Western investment to Eastern Europe, is losing its glamour as a result of the ambivalent policies of a coalition Government led by former Communists.
Analysts and investors point most recently to the cancellation of a big American hotel deal because of the personal intervention of Prime Minister Gyula Horn and the resulting resignation two weeks ago of the country's internationally respected Finance Minister, Laszlo Bekesi. He is being replaced by Lajos Bokros, chairman of the state-owned Budapest Bank, the nation's sixth largest. 
 Adding to the consternation, the privatization chief, Ferenc Bartha, one of the few technocrats in the Government, was dismissed by Mr. Horn and has yet to be replaced. Another important post, the governorship of the central bank, which has been vacant since the Prime Minister pushed out Peter Akos Bod in November, will be filled by Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of the Central European International Bank, the eighth-largest commercial bank in Hungary.
But potential investors have been most alarmed by the Prime Minister's decision last month to overturn the agreement reached between Hungary's privatization agency and American General Hospitality, which had offered $57.5 million for a 51 percent stake in the state-owned HungarHotels chain.
Apparently bowing to pressure from the left-wing unions of his Socialist Party -- the renamed Communists -- Mr. Horn declared that the properties were undervalued and the price too low. The American company argued in turn that there was only one outstanding property among the 14 hotels for sale, the Forum Hotel in Budapest, and even that had faded a bit by Western European standards.
Angered by interference in what it considered a completed transaction, American General Hospitality, which is based in Dallas, declined to renegotiate and canceled the deal.
Mr. Bekesi, whose performance as Finance Minister had been praised by the International Monetary Fund, then quit, saying his authority had been eroded and that political decisions were inappropriate in the privatization process.
He also questioned the resoluteness of Mr. Horn's Government in dealing with the country's macroeconomic problems. Hungary has a foreign debt equal to 67 percent of its gross domestic product -- a greater burden, some analysts have noted, than Mexico's 46 percent.
Analysts of the proposed 1995 budget said Mr. Horn had not been willing to make the spending cuts demanded by the International Monetary Fund for securing a new lending agreement. Failure to get the agreement would be a big embarrassment for the Government.
Mr. Bekesi, pointing to the gap between himself and the Prime Minister, said after he resigned, "If I had seen any chance that the most basic conditions for the stabilization of the country's economic situation could be created with my assistance as Finance Minister, I would not have offered my resignation."
His departure has particularly troubled outside investors.
"Bekesi had real credibility for foreign investors," said Peter Fath, executive director of the 350-member American Chamber of Commerce here. "They saw him as the right man in the right position. They trusted him."
Mr. Fath said Mr. Horn's plan to establish a privatization ministry outside the orbit of the Finance Ministry would only present further obstacles to privatization. "But the process is so slow now I don't know how you could slow it down further," he added.
Ralph Gerson, president of Guardian International, a division of Guardian Industries of Northfield, Mich., which has invested $120 million in a float glass plant in southern Hungary, said Mr. Horn's actions had made newcomers to the country warier.
"I've heard a lot of concerns from companies interested in investing in Hungary," said Mr. Gerson, who is also president of the Hungary-United States Business Council.
Foreign investors, unsettled by the vacancies at the central bank and the Finance Ministry, were somewhat reassured by the two successors nominated by the Prime Minister. Mr. Bokros led Budapest Bank back to financial health and into a possible sale to Credit Suisse, which is negotiating to buy a majority stake in the bank for $100 million.
And Mr. Suranyi, who said he won guarantees of independence from Mr. Horn before accepting the nomination, has said that he will continue a tight monetary policy at the Hungarian central bank.
But some investors said it remained to be seen whether the two would have greater success battling the iron hand of the Prime Minister than Mr. Bekesi did. Mr. Gerson said some Western investors already in Hungary were taking a second look at their expansion plans.
The turmoil is a startling change in image and substance from the go-go years after 1989, when the remnants of the comparatively easygoing "goulash Communism" in Hungary, its welcoming if exasperating bureaucracy and its sophisticated capital on the Danube, made this country the most beckoning in Eastern Europe for foreign investors.
The so-called gold rush into Hungary -- led by automobile, lighting and glass companies -- yielded significant gains for the state treasury. Since 1989, Hungary has attracted more than $6 billion in Western investment, small by the standards of emerging economies in Asia, for instance, but by far the largest amount of any country in Eastern Europe.
American companies are the biggest investors in Hungary and account for more than $3 billion of the foreign investment, Mr. Fath said.
Mr. Horn -- a strong-willed man who rose through the ranks of the Communist Party to become Foreign Minister in the 1980's and whose party of former Communists was successful at the polls last May -- is popular among the Hungarian electorate. His cancellation of the hotel deal met with the approval of many voters exasperated by the specter of foreign ownership and still high unemployment.
A poll published last Friday by the daily newspaper Magyar Hirlap reported that only a third of 709 Hungarians reached by telephone welcomed foreign investment in their country. A further 28 percent considered it "bad but necessary," while 35 percent disapproved. The remaining 4 percent did not know. No margin of error was given.
As viewed from outside, though, Mr. Horn's moves came at a particularly unfortunate time -- in the wake of the Mexico crisis, as investors in emerging markets everywhere reassessed their positions.
Hungary is vulnerable to the jitters of foreign investors because it has relied heavily on foreign capital to modernize its economy. The Government has budgeted on the basis of about $1 billion in direct foreign investment and more than $1.2 billion in sales of state companies this year. With this extra revenue, the budget deficit is put at 5.5 percent of the gross domestic product.
But analysts doubted that these targets would be met in the environment created by Mr. Horn.
The next big privatization deals involve the country's utilities. The Government has pledged to offer investors minority stakes in the electric-power grid and other power utilities. But in what a Western diplomat called one of Mr. Horn's "Orwellian" recent statements, the Prime Minister put a question mark on these plans, too.
"It is of strategic importance that the country not be dependent either on foreigners or domestic private businesses in terms of its power supply," Mr. Horn told Nepszabadsag, Hungary's most widely read newspaper.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Working in Tijuana

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico

 BODY:
Here I am in Tijuana and instead of buying a rhinestoned sombrero souvenir, licking salt and slugging down a tequila, peering around for Mexicans plotting to sneak into the United States or doing other useful border-type things, I am just wandering around thinking of four fellows I have left in the car -- Rudy Giuliani, Jack Kemp, Mario Cuomo and William Bennett.
They are in the trunk -- in the suitcase stuffed with the immigration file. Of the hundreds of politicians, academics and journalists who have committed articles, speeches or interviews about what is known as the immigration problem, these four keep coming to mind. 
 In New York, I thought of them when a city official told me of telephone calls in the middle of the night. People were listening to music on the roof, so they must be illegal immigrants; come and arrest them.
In Los Angeles I thought of them when nurses and doctors said they would refuse to obey Proposition 187. That is the new package of laws ordering them to report to the police any sick person who might have that certain illegal look or sound.
I thought of them in San Francisco when the man near me at dinner turned out to be an immigrant from China -- Chang-Lin Tien, now Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley. And in Washington -- when the House committee stripped all other legal immigrants of 35 social and economic benefits.
So in Tijuana, probably the biggest border crossing, legal and illegal, in North America, I return to the car to dig for what the four had said.
Their value was not in any sudden flash of inspiration but almost the opposite. They had said things that were once taken for granted in America but had become terribly unfashionable and, for politicians, even dangerous.
Last June Mr. Cuomo, then Governor of New York, decided against suing the Federal Government to recover costs of social services spent for immigrants -- a growing trend in some states. He decided it would send a false message that immigrants were a national burden. Then he said something astonishing:
"I love immigrants. Legal, illegal, they are not to be despised."
Mayor Giuliani says it even more powerfully. In a City Hall interview he told me that illegal immigrants were among the most hard-working in the city. He said that if they continued to contribute to society, this Mayor would not hunt or hound them or try to kick their children out of schools and hospitals, as the new California regulations demand.
The Mayor, a former Federal prosecutor, was scathing about Federal failure to deport those illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes after coming to America. Scores of thousands of cases are waiting for Federal action. So, he said, New York has better things to do than pursue cases against illegals who have never committed any crime but to come looking for work.
Mr. Kemp and Mr. Bennett issued a joint statement when they were possible Republican candidates for President. They did not do themselves any political good.
They said illegal immigration was a serious problem that should be met principally at the borders. But they came out against Proposition 187, now in the courts.
They said a concern about illegal immigration was no excuse for "fundamentally flawed, constitutionally questionable steps that would help contribute to a nativist and anti-immigrant climate." They warned that one day these steps could haunt American minorities.
Immigration scares come in cycles. Something touches American anxieties. A recession or technology threatens employment. Cultural changes make people look more closely at faces, and listen to fear talk. Even Americans born to immigrants begin worrying -- maybe it is time to pull up the gangplank.
Put together, what the men in the trunk were saying was a reminder that the country was built heavily on immigrant brawn, brain and, yes, family values -- and that the time to think most carefully about this reality was when the pressure was on against immigrants, legal or illegal.
So I smooth the four out and put them carefully back in the suitcase. Feeling better, I decide to have one tequila after all. But that sparkling sombrero -- I don't have the courage.

HEADLINE: Seal the Iraq Embargo

 BODY:
A United Nations-sanctioned embargo compels Iraq to give up its weapons of mass destruction and accept monitoring of its arms-making. Iraq has yet to comply fully with the embargo. That makes it particularly dispiriting to discover that two of America's allies, Turkey and Jordan, have been helping Baghdad circumvent it by permitting Iraqi oil exports to be trucked unimpeded across their borders.
Turkey and Jordan should seal the leaks. Until Baghdad lives up to the letter of the law, it is essential to maintain U.N. sanctions. Yet if Washington wants to sustain political support for disarming Iraq, it must be ready to relax the embargo when Baghdad does comply. 
 Under the terms of the Persian Gulf war's cease-fire resolution, Iraq had to relinquish its arms and not resume arms-making. To accomplish those aims it was required to identify all sites, materiel and equipment used to manufacture nuclear, biological and chemical arms and missiles and to disclose how it obtained the supplies for arms-making. Baghdad continues to provide incomplete and inaccurate disclosures on its biological weapons program and supplier networks. The embargo is still needed to compel full Iraqi compliance.
It is difficult to keep any embargo from springing leaks, especially when Iraq is prepared to sell its oil for as little as $8 a barrel -- $6 below market price. Yet the limited amount of oil now being trucked through Turkey and Jordan could soon grow. Already oil companies from France, Italy, Russia, Britain, Canada and elsewhere are rushing to conclude arrangements to obtain Iraqi oil once the embargo is lifted.
The Clinton Administration will not succeed in holding back that tide forever. America, supported solely by Britain, wrongly wants to prevent any relaxation of sanctions even if Iraq does come clean on its arms-making. That would invite international winking at the embargo, and more oil sales. Iraq should be allowed to export oil, as the Security Council stipulated, once it complies on disarmament -- no sooner and no later.

HEADLINE: The Bosnia Follies Roll On

BYLINE: By Morton I. Abramowitz; Morton I. Abramowitz is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Despite Administration rhetoric about backing diplomacy with a credible threat of force, the U.S. and its allies are doing exactly the opposite in Bosnia.
In recent weeks, direct talks with the Bosnian Serbs have failed to induce them to accept the map of a future Bosnia drafted by the five-country "contact group." So much for the U.N. resolution prohibiting states from political talks with the Bosnian Serb leaders as long as they reject the settlement plan! 
 The Bosnian Serbs are not buying a reduction in the 70 percent of the country they occupy -- and for them it's a buyer's market. The West's efforts to gain leverage over them through a federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia helped to end the fighting between them. But it didn't frighten the Bosnian Serbs into a deal. Nor will new political and economic measures to strengthen the federation just endorsed by the "contact group" be enough to impress the Bosnian Serbs.
The West's fevered search for peace has now turned toward President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, putting into the driver's seat the man who brought us ethnic cleansing and who even now is destroying the last independent media in Serbia.
The Westerners, and apparently the Bosnians and Croats, have convinced themselves that he will deliver peace in Bosnia, will deliver stability in the Serb-controlled region of Croatia called Krajina after the United Nations force leaves, and will deliver America from its empty (conveniently forgotten) promise to put 20,000 to 25,000 troops into Bosnia to enforce a negotiated settlement.
They rationalize that Mr. Milosevic is ready to deal because he is tired of war, wants to focus on his economy and may be ready to recognize Bosnia's and Croatia's borders in exchange for a suspension of trade sanctions against Serbia. Thinking that he will stick by any deal is a big gamble. Yesterday, he turned down an offer to lift the sanctions in exchange for granting recognition. If he does not strike a deal, or insists on more "carrots," the West can be expected to provide them or to turn up pressure on the weaker party, the Bosnian Muslims, to simply extend the cease-fire Jimmy Carter brokered.
Despite protestations to the contrary, the West is headed for a policy that would institutionalize the Serbs' gains. Not prepared to use force or give the Bosnians the arms they need, the West is likely to accept what it said it never would -- the Bosnian Serbs' victory along present battle lines -- and justify it with the usual humanitarian rhetoric.
Croatia does not want war with Serbia. But Croatia's latest threat to evict the U.N. force separating Croats from Croatian Serbs may lead to it. Croatia considers the U.N. force the chief impediment to recovering the Krajina area. Most Croatians believe that the Government is serious about eviction and would not have threatened it without being being confident of a deal with Serbia at Bosnia's expense. Croatian officials deny it, while in the same breath belittling the Bosnians as "fundamentalists." Croatia may have to back down because of U.S. pressure and agree to a fig-leaf U.N. monitor presence.
The Bosnians harbor conflicting views about the West's intentions. Some still believe the U.S. will ride to their rescue; others expect the U.S. to sell them out. The first notion is delusional; to accept the second is to abandon hope.
Most Bosnians support the bill in Congress to unilaterally lift the arms embargo, but they fear that even if it passed it would not lead to deliveries of needed materiel. In the meantime, their forces have been strengthened by arms from Turkey and Iran. While those arms are not sufficient to change the balance of power, they have significantly improved the Bosnians' position.
Meanwhile, the French have proposed, and the U.S. apparently supports, a summit conference involving Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia aimed at preventing a wider war. But such a conclave cannot do what NATO won't do: achieve and enforce a better settlement. Such delusional diplomacy wastes precious time and may well lead to calamity.
By legitimizing the Bosnian Serbs' demands through our timidity, we invite trouble elsewhere. Macedonia, where ethnic tensions are rising, is getting little international support for its strangled economy. Next door, in the Serbian province of Kosovo, Belgrade is pressing down on the Albanian majority, increasing communal strife. If Macedonia or Kosovo explodes, Albania will surely join the fray.
The U.S. and its allies are slowly tightening the noose around the Bosnian Government but calling it a lifeline. They are loosening the screws on Belgrade, calling such action leverage. Deluding the other guy is an old game for diplomats -- deceitful yet often effective. But we should be honest with ourselves. At best, our policy is based on hoping something turns up; at worst, it sells out the Bosnians. If we persist this way, a bloody springtime beckons.

HEADLINE: Police Cite Marital Strife In S.I. Deaths

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
A Staten Island man charged with shooting to death four members of his family on Sunday may have been angry about his wife's request for a divorce or separation, the police said yesterday.
"He was supposedly upset over the upcoming breakup," Lieut. Raymond Ferrari said. "I know for a fact they were married four years and they were having family problems. I'd imagine he was despondent and the problem just caught up with him." 
 The man, Phillip Gurriero, 56, surrendered to police on Sunday, about an hour after the noontime shooting that took the lives of his wife, Angela Gurriero, 44; his stepson, Raymond Alvarado, 26; and his in-laws, Joan and James Dugo, both 60. The police later found the bodies, all shot in the upper torso, on the top level of the two-story house. Mr. Gurriero was charged with four counts of second-degree murder.
The police said yesterday that a sawed-off shotgun believed to be the weapon used in the shooting was found on Sunday night in a locked box in the basement during a search of the house, on Evan Place in Arden Heights. The gun, a double-barreled Stevens Model 311 Savage Arms, and 16 shotgun shells were being tested by ballistic experts yesterday, Lieutenant Ferrari said.
The Gurriero family had a history of volatile domestic arguments that attracted visits from the police, neighbors and the authorities said.
But Deputy Inspector William Allee, commanding officer of the Staten Island detectives, said yesterday that only two incidents involving the family had been referred to his office in the last year and that those cases did not involve Mr. Gurriero. Inspector Allee said the incidents, in October and December, both concerned disputes between Angela Gurriero and her daughter, Kimberly Alvarado, 21, who moved out of the house recently.
A neighbor and longtime friend of the family, Nina Apman, said that Mrs. Gurriero had told her that other arguments involved Mr. Gurriero and Mr. Alvarado, who was Mrs. Gurriero's son from her first marriage.
The police said that Mr. Gurriero, an Italian immigrant who operated construction cranes and other heavy equipment until he became unemployed about a year ago, apparently did not have an arrest record.
Mrs. Gurriero's 9-year-old daughter, Marissa Pomarico, was in the house with the family's live-in baby sitter when the shootings took place. She ran to Ms. Apman's house for help, the police said. Marissa, who was staying at an uncle's house in Brooklyn yesterday, was interviewed by the police investigating the shooting.
Mr. Gurriero was arraigned last night in Brooklyn, because Staten Island courts were closed for the holiday. Inspector Allee said he would be held without bail and would be formally arraigned before a Staten Island judge today. The police said that shortly after he turned himself in, Mr. Gurriero asked to see a priest.
Yesterday, neighbors in the normally peaceful, working-class community talked of the raging arguments frequently heard from the Gurriero house.
"They did fight an awful lot," said Marge Bisignano, who lives around the corner. "They were very abusive. A lot of times, there was a lot of cursing and screaming and yelling."

HEADLINE: Older Americans Cited in Studies Of National Savings Rate Slump

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite their reputations as role models of thrift, older Americans appear to be the ones chiefly responsible for the slump in the country's savings rate.
That is the surprising conclusion of several recent studies comparing the spending and saving of different generations over several decades. 
 If the researchers are right, the savings incentives for younger families in the Republicans' Contract With America and in the White House's new tax proposal -- promising broader access to individual retirement accounts and the like -- will not lift the nation's savings much, if at all.
The rate of savings suddenly collapsed in the early 1980's, dropping below 5 percent of national income from 9 percent or so during most of the previous three decades. A decade later, the savings rate has slipped further and is now barely more than 3 percent.
At first, most analysts pointed a finger at the baby boom generation, the supposedly self-indulgent 45 million Americans born from 1946 through 1964. Since people generally save more in middle age than in youth, some economists -- including Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser -- optimistically predicted that savings would rebound as these boomers grew older and presumably wiser.
But evidence gathered by several researchers suggests that the baby boomers were not responsible for the problem to begin with and that counting on a natural recovery in the savings rate is probably a mistake.
"The great bulk of the decline was due to changes in the saving patterns of people born before 1940 -- those who are 55 or older today," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution and one of the first experts to reconsider the subject. "The saving of people who were born after 1940 is holding up pretty darn well."
A deep pool of savings has all kinds of beneficial effects for society. It can make people feel more secure; business has more to invest in ideas because money tends to be cheaper, and the nation has to borrow much less from abroad.
The ill effects of saving too little admittedly take a while to show up. But sooner or later they do, just like the sorry consequences of not flossing your teeth.
The updated picture of the nation's savings habits is based on a clutch of Government surveys on income, consumption and saving by Americans of different age groups from the 1950's to the 1990's.
Americans drawing near retirement age today are saving less than their parents did at the same point in their lives. Moreover, Americans who are already retired -- beneficiaries of relatively generous Social Security payments, pensions and health care protection -- are consuming considerably more than previous generations consumed.
For example, by the mid-1980's, Americans born during the Depression and approaching retirement were saving a much smaller part of their incomes than their parents had tucked away: 11 percent versus 17 percent. That is according to a study by Mr. Burtless; a Brookings colleague, Barry Bosworth, and John Sabelhaus, a researcher at the Urban Institute.
The same was true of those people's older brothers and sisters, born during the 1920's, who were setting aside only 16 percent of their income just before they retired, compared with 23 percent for their parents.
Most people think of saving as depositing $ 100 in a bank account every month or contributing to their company's 401(k) plan. But economists take a different view. To them, saving is everything that is not spent by consumers, business and government on their immediate needs. By consuming less now, people make it possible for themselves and their children to live better in the future.
"If you want to find out why our saving is down, find out who's consuming more," said Laurence Kotlikoff, chairman of the economics department at Boston University.
By consumption, economists do not necessarily mean lavish living. Consumption is also buying fuel to heat a house, or using an orthopedic surgeon or a nursing home.
And in looking at what people are consuming, analysts include items that people do not necessarily pay for themselves. In today's modern social welfare state, the elderly consume lots of resources, especially medical care, that the rest of society helps to subsidize.
Consequently, the consumption of older Americans has soared relative to that of younger generations. A study by Professor Kotlikoff, Mr. Sabelhaus and Jagadeesh Gokhale, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, found that today's average 80-year-old is spending $ 1.16 for every $ 1 that a typical 30-year-old spends. In the early 1960's, the average 80-year-old was spending just 65 cents for every $ 1 a 30-year-old spent.
Much, but not all, of the increase in spending by the elderly reflects higher medical costs. Medical spending soared from less than 6 percent of household consumption in the early 1960's to almost 17 percent today. Meanwhile, personal consumption for everything but medical care grew, too, although its share of the national income, which rose even faster, fell by 2.3 percentage points, to 63.7 percent from 66 percent. (Government spends the remaining one-fifth or so of income directly.)
All of this suggests that the underlying source of America's much-lamented savings problem may simply reflect a decision by society as a whole -- explicitly or not -- to let the elderly consume a bigger share of the nation's resources. That consumption is paid for largely by taxing younger Americans and future generations.
One reason the savings rate fell in the 1980's was that Americans who had accumulated enough wealth to acquire a home and build up some financial assets received a terrific windfall in the early part of that decade. With their stocks, bonds and houses suddenly worth a lot more, some people cut back on saving because they did not feel the need to keep building their nest eggs.
Some researchers have focused on the growth of government benefits for retirees, especially subsidized health care, as a more important contributor. America's old-age medical and retirement system now provides a security blanket for most of the elderly.
"For many people, we've basically eliminated the need to save, because you can have a comfortable retirement without saving," Mr. Sabelhaus of the Urban Institute said.
That is not particularly true of younger workers today. "If you're sure that Social Security will treat you generously, you spend more," Professor Kotlikoff said. "If you're pessimistic, as many boomers are, you might hold down your consumption."
Older Americans may also be more free-spending, Professor Kotlikoff added, in part because they receive income and benefits as they need them rather than in lump sums that would require husbanding.
"Government policies are responsible for 70 percent to 80 percent of the decline in national saving," he asserted, "and the rest indirectly by handing the elderly in-kind goods and services and annuities."
Many commentators have cited the huge rise in the Federal budget deficit in the 1980's as a source of the decline in savings. But the fact is that one of the forces fueling that deficit has been the rapid growth of retirement benefits and medical subsidies for the elderly.
This shift of society's resources to the elderly, of course, accounts for one of the great success stories of American social policy. In contrast with the stark circumstances of many of the elderly in 1960, when one in three was poor, only 13 percent of today's older Americans are in poverty -- a lower rate than that of younger people.
Robert Harootyan, a researcher for the American Association of Retired Persons, bristled at any notion that the elderly were going on shopping sprees or vacations.
"These programs have kept a lot of older people out of abject poverty," he said.
And not all the experts are ready to conclude that Government largesse toward the elderly explains the decline in savings.
"These are big social questions I don't think anyone can know the answer to," said Marilyn Moon at the Urban Institute. "Most good, careful researchers can't talk about causation with certainty."
As for the baby boomers, it turns out that members of that much-maligned generation have not been spending all their time at the shopping mall flashing credit cards.
The average boomers were saving almost as much as their parents' generation saved at the same age, 9.5 percent compared with 9.6 percent, the Brookings study found. And a second study by Orazio Attanasio done when he was a research associate at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., suggests that savings rates among today's 30-to-48-year-olds may even be slightly higher.
That is not to say that young and middle-aged Americans are saving enough. According to Mr. Sabelhaus, they "need to save significant sums simply to safeguard themselves against future tax increases or reductions in transfer payments."
 The article also misstated the number of Americans born from 1946 through 1964, which is considered the baby-boom generation. It is 75 million, not 45 million.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 25, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about the savings patterns of generations of Americans misstated the views of Michael J. Boskin, who was chief economic adviser under President George Bush. He is pessimistic, not optimistic, that the aging of the baby boomers will raise the national saving rate.

HEADLINE: Peso Rescue Sets New Limits on Mexico

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The United States and Mexico reached agreement today on a broader-than-expected rescue plan that will include the use of American funds to keep Mexico's private banks from collapsing, while effectively giving Washington veto power over much of Mexico's economic policy for the next decade.
The $20 billion aid program, the centerpiece of an international loan package for Mexico worth about $50 billion, is intended to restore the confidence of international investors in the Mexican economy and gradually pull the country out of its financial crisis. The accord was signed this afternoon by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz. 
 But the harsh austerity required to carry out the deal will impose a tremendous immediate burden on the once-booming Mexican economy -- reflected in a sharp drop of almost 5 percent in the Mexican stock market today. The new regimen will also be a setback to the hopes of those American companies that had been counting on Mexico to continue to grow into a larger and larger market for American exports.
Included in the agreement are stringent financial requirements, including provisions that Mexico run a budget surplus this year and clamp down on credit by charging interest rates above the soaring rate of inflation. The Bank of Mexico increased its short-term lending rate to nearly 50 percent on Monday.
Mexican officials said that the provisions would cause considerable pain to the Mexican people and acknowledged that the country could be forced into a recession. That, in turn, could fuel the country's social unrest, deepen the challenges to the weakened Government of President Ernesto Zedillo, and perhaps greatly increase the flow of illegal immigrants into Texas and California.
But Mr. Ortiz and his aides said that all the alternatives to such austerity were far worse, risking greater political and financial chaos and the possibility of even larger flows of illegal aliens. "Obviously this is not easy," a senior Mexican official told reporters today. "The conditions Mexico is facing are very difficult. But there is no other way out."
At the White House today, President Clinton praised Mexico's leaders for taking "some very courageous steps" and said that the deal was not a bailout. "We have very good collateral on this deal," he said, a reference to American requirements that all of Mexico's export earnings on oil be available to back the loans. "So we have done the right thing by the American taxpayers and the American people as well."
While most of the details of the agreement have been described by Treasury officials during the last few weeks, today's accord also included new language that specifically permits Mexico's central bank to use American funds to support Mexico's banking system and keep its depositors -- including many wealthy Americans -- from losing billions of pesos.
In an interview this evening, Mr. Rubin said that the new provision was not intended to be a bailout of the banks and their owners but rather an effort to keep the underpinnings of the Mexican economy from crumbling. "As time went on and the situation deteriorated in recent weeks," Mr. Rubin said, "the conditions of the banks became worse and there has been more focus on the banks among all those concerned."
While Congress does not have any direct role in the rescue package, American officials are clearly worried that this provision could generate opposition to the deal. The Administration's plan to use $20 billion in Treasury funds to aid Mexico does not require legislative approval. It was developed only after it became clear that a $40 billion American-only package would be tied up in Congress for months, and might be doomed to defeat.
"The ultimate success of this program depends on Mexico," Mr. Rubin said at the signing ceremony today, appropriately held in the Cash Room of the Treasury, where clerks once disbursed the Government's funds from a room-sized vault.
The agreement includes none of the political concessions from Mexico -- including policing of the Mexican side of the border to prevent illegal crossings -- that many in Congress demanded last month, before President Clinton decided to bypass Congress. But in a statement this afternoon, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that there was already evidence that Mexico was acting to make "bridges and border crossings more secure" and would step up pressure on drug cartels.
"With the signing of this agreement, we are bringing this crisis to a close," Mr. Christopher said, showing considerably more optimism than many others in the Administration that the problems were over.
The tougher financial conditions appeared intended to allay criticism that the Administration was cutting a deal for Mexico that it would not cut for Orange County, Calif., which has filed for bankruptcy, or the near-bankrupt government of the District of Columbia.
"This is a better deal for American taxpayers than the last deal," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and one of the leading Republican critics of the agreement. "But it is still woefully inadequate."
Mr. Rubin and other Administration officials pointed out tonight that they had repeatedly warned Congress that troubles in the Mexican banking system would have to be addressed, even if they had not specifically laid out plans before to use American funds to help maintain liquidity in the banking system.
But in recent weeks, it became clear that it was not possible to save Mexico without explicitly permitting the Mexican authorities to use part of the $20 billion to save many of the banks from defaulting on billions of dollars in certificates of deposit.
"The depositors will be protected," Mr. Rubin said tonight. "But I fully expect that the result will be the diminution of the interests of the shareholders."
While American officials tried to head off criticism of the moves to keep the banks solvent, Mexican officials were playing down the American requirement that all revenues from the export of Mexican oil and petrochemicals must be deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The proceeds could be automatically seized by the United States if Mexico defaults on any of its repayments to Washington.
Mexico agreed to publish a wide variety of weekly and monthly indicators of its economic health -- something investors have lacked until now. Officials said they would post these on the Internet so that investors around the world could receive them instantly on line.
Administration officials decided against the path advocated by conservative critics of the rescue who wanted to require Mexico to go back to a fixed exchange rate of roughly 3.5 pesos to the dollar. That would once again make American imports attractive in Mexico and reduce the competitiveness of Mexican goods in the United States.
But Mr. Rubin and his team feared that if the markets determined that the fixed rate was artificial, there would soon follow another drastic devaluation of the kind that plunged Mexico into this crisis in December.
Instead, the heart of the deal lies in requiring Mexico to pursue an extremely tight monetary policy, shrinking the country's money supply and preventing it from spending Government funds to stimulate economic growth. For Mr. Zedillo, who only a few months ago was talking of creating a million new jobs and sustaining a growth rate of 4 percent or more, that means selling Mexicans on a strict diet of austerity.
Behind the austerity package is the idea that squeezing inflation out of the Mexican economy will help restore the confidence of investors. The agreement with the United States, for instance, specifies how much of Mexico's short-term dollar-denominated bonds called tesobonos must be converted to longer-term bonds by the end of the year.
American officials noted that several billion dollars would probably be needed in the next few weeks just to shore up the banks. "The banking problem will be with us for a long, long time," one senior American official said tonight.

HEADLINE: Sense of Dollar Duress;
With Deeper Pain Ahead, Many Mexicans Accuse President of Yielding Sovereignty

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Almost before the ink dried on today's agreement to provide Mexico with $20 billion in emergency help from the United States, President Ernesto Zedillo has found himself accused in Mexico of trading his nation's sovereignty for a sack full of American dollars.
The severe economic restrictions that United States officials placed on the $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees mean that Mexico has surrendered an almost unprecedented degree of control over the management of its economy to its big neighbor at a critical time. Mr. Zedillo's presidency is already weakened less than three months into his six-year term, and social unrest is simmering through this country. 
 "As a Mexican, I'm really angry that these decisions are being made in Washington, not here," said Benjamin Miranda, a middle-class manager who was getting his shoes shined in front of the stock exchange here this afternoon. "People here are tired of so many drastic measures. It's like we're all in a pressure cooker that is about to explode."
While the agreement signed in Washington today may help ease the economic crisis set in motion by the peso's devaluation two months ago, it will force this nation and its embattled President to pay dearly in political as well as economic terms.
But it could also tarnish the United States in Mexican eyes by portraying it as an economic bully.
Most postwar economic rescue plans have been carried out by a number of countries and administered by the International Monetary Fund, which is also providing $17.8 billion to Mexico.
The fund's bureaucrats were blamed for the pain caused by the economic rigor those rescue packages demanded. But their professional anonymity diluted any political backlash against their prescriptions.
With the United States firmly in command of this Mexican rescue operation, the blame for the economic medicine to be swallowed by Mexico has become more focused.
"We had to pawn our oil to get this help, and I don't think it's really in our best interest," said Raul Cruz, a 24-year-old messenger at a downtown Mexico City office. "I'm worried that the Government is going to just use up all the money, like you'd use a Christmas bonus."
While the United States did not force Mexico to accept political concessions like breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba, as some members of the American Congress had demanded in Washington, Mexico did agree to raise interest rates and to allow the United States to review its handling of the economy.
There were some Mexicans, though, who agreed with Clinton Administration officials' insistence on strict guarantees from the Mexican Government.
"I think the United States has all the reason in the world to ask for guarantees," said Genaro Velazquez, a 56-year-old bank clerk. "They're giving us money and they want to protect themselves, to make sure we pay it back. Yes, we're losing a little of our sovereignty, but what does that matter if you don't have enough to eat?"
Yet, Mexico has agreed to cut its spending so severely that a deep recession seems inevitable. If that leads to deeper unemployment and poverty, as expected, this country's uneasy social order could erupt.
With the Mexican economy already teetering on the edge of recession and the peso still wobbly, President Zedillo may have had no choice but to accept the tough conditions placed on the money by Americans, who were not convinced that Mexico was ready to change the way it managed its economy.
If Mexican officials were hoping that the signing of the accord would buoy the peso or the stock market, they were disappointed. Stocks continued their slide today, losing a further 86.95 points, or 4.92 percent, to close at 1,679.19. Analysts said higher interest rates made investors switch from stocks to Government bonds and certificates.
And the peso closed at 5.605 to the dollar, down slightly from Monday's close of 5.565. A peso was worth almost 29 cents on Dec. 19. Now it is worth just under 18 cents.
In an interview with Mexican radio from Washington, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz tried to anticipate criticism that Mexico had surrendered too much authority to the United States. "There is absolutely no kind of political condition in this agreement," he said. "And the economic conditions that are included are ones that we ourselves have selected and that have been supported by international financial organizations."
Whether in fact the United States officials dictated policy or prescribed tough but necessary fiscal and monetary steps for Mexico, the impression that Mexico is bowing to Washington is widely held here.
Reaction was particularly negative to the requirement that receipts from export sales by Pemex, the state oil monopoly, be placed in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where the United States will have a first claim on them in case Mexico defaults on its repayments of the $20 billion package.
"Part of the reserves of Mexico will be controlled not by a Mexican plan to protect our money supply but by the demands of the United States," the left-leaning daily La Jornada declared.
President Zedillo has spent much of his two and a half months in office struggling to get the Mexican economy back on the track that until recently made it one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. But a series of missteps and seeming policy flip-flops have left him open to charges of being a weak leader -- anathema in a Mexico that still expects a President to wield unquestionable authority.
Mexican officials said they will use the money from the $20 billion package to help reduce the Government's overreliance on short-term debt denominated in dollars. Investors will be encouraged to trade one-year bonds for 5- and 10-year obligations. Other bonds will be paid off and retired. Mexican finance officials say that since the beginning of the year, the Government has reduced the value of outstanding bonds paid in dollars from $30 billion to just under $21 billion.
The details of the package announced today also make it possible for Mexico to use the money to help support some of Mexico's 18 largest commercial banks that have been forced to the brink of failure by the devaluation.
The rigid fiscal and monetary restraints that United States Treasury officials have forced upon Mexico will reduce consumption and restrict the outflows of money.
But what concerns most analysts and economists is that higher interest rates will choke off what little strength the Mexican economy has left and submerge Mexico in a deep recession. Since the financial crisis began in December, more than $10 billion has left the country. Automobile sales dropped by 50 percent in January, while sales of buses and trucks fell 84 percent. And unemployment has jumped substantially.
Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist here who often criticizes Government policies, said that instead of an economic-stabilization plan, the Government had put together "a bunch of gimmicks." And lacking a strong president who can lead the country through difficult times, Mr. Ramirez de la O said that Mexico's prospects for recovery, even with the $20 billion from the United States and billions more from other international sources, were dim.
After two months of crisis, many Mexicans seem to have lost some of their faith that the Government can turn the situation around.
"Supposedly, this package is going to save us," Humberto Hernandez, a 42-year-old salesman, said of the foreign bailout. "It sounds so good what they say. But I have my doubts."

HEADLINE: National Economic Council Head Is Named

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
After weighing the decision for more than two months, President Clinton today elevated Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacant post as coordinator of the Administration's economic policy.
In her new job as the new head of the National Economic Council, Dr. Tyson will succeed Robert E. Rubin, who held the job until he was named Treasury Secretary in December. She will move to the head of the table in Cabinet-level discussions on economic policy, with power tantamount to that of the national security adviser, from her current job, one that is usually filled by an academic economist. 
 But while her new job is in part to be a mediator of economic views, White House officials said it was Dr. Tyson's skills as a communicator that proved most instrumental in the President's decision to promote her. Dr. Tyson, they said, is now more likely than Secretary Rubin to be the official most often dispatched to talk shows as the advocate of the Administration's positions.
After Mr. Clinton announced his decision in the White House briefing room this afternoon, Dr. Tyson said she found the promotion "a little unnerving."
A 47-year-old former professor at the University of California at Berkeley who made her name as a champion of managed trade, Dr. Tyson was regarded an unorthodox choice when Mr. Clinton picked her two years ago to head the Council of Economic Advisers. But in addition to her talents as a spokeswoman, she has proven herself a heavyweight in an Administration crowded with officials who have been aggressive in advocating their views on economic policy, including Labor Secretary Robert Reich and Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff.
Mr. Clinton had initially intended to replace Mr. Rubin with Erskine B. Bowles, a deputy White House chief of staff whose first job in Washington was as head of the Small Business Administration and who is highly regarded for his managerial skills. On the day that Mr. Rubin was named Treasury Secretary, White House press aides even reproduced a one-page biography of Mr. Bowles in anticipation of that second announcement.
But after reviewing the proposed appointment well into January, Mr. Clinton decided that he needed Mr. Bowles at the White House. Today, Dr. Tyson said that she and Mr. Clinton first talked about her taking the job several weeks ago and that he had offered it last week.
In explaining the lag in filling the vacancy, White House officials said Mr. Clinton had always been slow in making important personnel decisions.
Mr. Clinton praised Dr. Tyson today for having offered "unfailingly frank, direct and principled advice" in her current position and said he looked forward to more of the same as she moved from the Old Executive Office Building into the West Wing.
With the appointment, which is not subject to Senate confirmation, the President filled the last important job vacancy in his Administration as he begins the second half of his term. But Mr. Clinton must now replace Ms. Tyson at the helm of the Council of Economic Advisers, a post that does require Senate approval.
Among the President's original team on the panel, only Joseph E. Stiglitz, a microeconomist who is on leave from Stanford University, remains. Alan Blinder, a macroeconomist who might have been a likely successor to Dr. Tyson, left the council last year when Mr. Clinton appointed him vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors; his designated replacement, Martin Neil Baily of the University of Maryland, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.

HEADLINE: Fleet Financial Offers $3.7 Billion for Shawmut

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
In a deal that would create the largest bank in New England, the Fleet Financial Group of Providence, R.I., agreed yesterday to acquire the Shawmut National Corporation of Hartford and Boston for $3.7 billion in stock.
After completion of the deal, Fleet would be the country's ninth-largest bank, with more than $80 billion in assets. The headquarters of the new bank, which plans to use the Fleet name, would be in Boston, where both banks have large operations. 
 The planned merger is the largest among banks in more than a year and continues a trend of consolidation among the nation's major regional banks that has pushed four of them onto the list of the country's top 10 banks in the last decade.
The deal is expected to be completed next fall, subject to Government approval. Investment bankers said they did not expect another bank to make a rival bid for Shawmut.
Experts have long predicted that many of the country's 11,000 banks would merge into a handful of coast-to-coast powerhouses as restrictions on interstate banking have been lifted during the last decade.
But these mergers have occurred more slowly than many expected, largely because bank executives have the power to keep their institution independent and preserve their jobs. Shawmut was close to a merger with the Bank of Boston in 1991, for example, but the deal fell through because of personal incompatibilities between the banks' two top executives, Joel B. Alvord of Shawmut and Ira Stepanian of Bank of Boston.
Hostile takeovers are difficult in banking because the industry is so heavily regulated. Moreover, share prices of big acquiring banks have been depressed in the last year, making mergers less likely because most banks pay for their acquisitions with stock.
Now that the rapid profit gains most banks enjoyed in the early part of the economic recovery have slowed, though, a number of bank executives are considering selling out. The Michigan National Corporation agreed earlier this month to be bought by the National Australia Bank for $1.6 billion.
Analysts suggested that Shawmut's financial condition was not improving as robustly as most other banks in recent years and that it had paid a high cost for a string of regional bank acquisitions.
"Shawmut became vulnerable last year because it is one of the few banks that declined in book value," said Thomas H. Hanley, an analyst with CS First Boston. "They were overpaying for banks and having to take heavy one-time charges."
Fleet is paying a high price for Shawmut. The deal values Shawmut at $30 a share, a 45 percent premium over its close of $20.625. Shawmut shares leaped $4.375 today, to $25.
The purchase price is also 2.4 times Shawmut's tangible book value, which is toward the high end of what is typical for bank mergers. Fleet, however, argues that cost savings and post-merger market dominance justify the price.
The bank said it would have the largest market share of deposits in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Fleet, which acquired Norstar Bancorp of Albany in the late 1980's, has a large presence in upstate New York and a toehold in New York City. The combined bank would also be the country's largest processor of student loans, and its second-largest mortgage company.
The Fleet-Shawmut deal was first proposed on Feb. 6 by Mr. Alvord, Shawmut's chairman, at a meeting at the Providence home of Fleet's chairman, Terrence Murray. After Mr. Murray accepted the proposal in principle the following Wednesday, negotiations proceeded in New York through this past weekend with 75 people crowded into two conference rooms of Fleet's law firm, Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
At a Boston news conference yesterday, both executives said they were driven to merge to keep pace with other regional banks that have grown into nationwide powerhouses. Banks such as Nationsbank and the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., Banc One in Columbus, Ohio, and the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis have all grown much faster in the last decade than the big New York banks that used to dominate the industry.
"One of my concerns is that we get a situation here such as happened in Texas, where there isn't a single home-grown institution in that market," Mr. Murray said. "Unless you're strong and have some muscle you can't control your own destiny."
 Shawmut, which had been the third-largest bank in the region after Fleet and the Bank of Boston, has long been regarded as a takeover target, either by one of the two larger New England banks or by a growing regional like Nationsbank or Norwest.
Mr. Alvord said he chose to approach Fleet this year because of his 25-year relationship with Mr. Murray. "I thought long and hard about the personal fit with Terry and Joel," Mr. Alvord said. "From my part, there is an atmosphere of respect and trust."
Mr. Murray, 55, Fleet's chairman, will be president and chief executive of the new bank. Mr. Alvord, 56, will serve as chairman until he retires in 1998. He remains eligible for Shawmut's existing "golden parachute" that will grant him roughly $10 million should he leave the bank before that, people familiar with the deal said.
Gunner S. Overstrom, Shawmut's president, will run branch banking in the new company. Most other top officers, and a majority of the directors, are to come from Fleet.
 Fleet had said it was interested in a so-called merger of equals in which it would combine with a similarly sized institution in a different region. It was reportedly in talks about such a deal last year with the Bank of New York Company.
 Mr. Murray, however, was eager to shift the strategy to take advantage of the cost-cutting opportunities from a Shawmut acquisition. But it still plans to expand further after it finishes digesting Shawmut.
 "Building a national franchise from an $80 billion-plus institution is more realistic," Mr. Murray said. "We get more flexibility."
 With substantial overlapping operations, Fleet said, it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs, 10 percent of its combined work force. The bulk of these cuts will be in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
 That should cut expenses by 14 percent, or $400 million a year. To cover the cost of severance and other consolidation, the bank plans to take a charge to earnings of as much as $400 million.
 The bank expects to sell 75 to 90 branches, mostly in the Hartford area, to comply with antitrust requirements. And it plans to close about 150 in overlapping areas to leave about 900 branches, the largest system in New England.

HEADLINE: Ottawa Journal;
Envoy Defends Eskimos' World (It's Her World)

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OTTAWA

 BODY:
She speaks of the despair that leads some of her people to alcoholism, drug abuse and suicide and of their pessimism over the lack of job opportunities. Yet to Mary Simon, an Eskimo who recently became Canada's first Circumpolar Ambassador, the news is not all bad.
"Not everybody is out drinking and living a life of despair," she said. "Part of our culture is thriving, and there's a strong determination to pull through all of this. So I say we can make the changes that are necessary to bring back the pride and the self-esteem." 
 One of the changes she hopes to see as Canada's chief diplomat on northern issues is creation by the world's eight circumpolar nations of an Arctic Council, to make policy commitments in areas of overlapping concern such as environmental protection.
Not until the cold war ended was it possible for more than 115,000 Eskimos, 40,000 of them Canadian, to turn their attention to the enormous common problems of degradation of their environment and deterioration of their economic and social life.
"My own experience goes back 20 years working on both environmental and economic issues in the Canadian north," said Ms. Simon, a 47-year-old Inuk from Kuujjuaq, a settlement on Ungava Bay in northern Quebec to which she returns frequently, "but now for the first time we have the possibility of a coherent approach by eight governments."
In addition to Canada, the circumpolar nations are the United States, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark, which administers Greenland.
Ms. Simon, the first Eskimo to hold the rank of ambassador in Canada, said she wants to look not only at environmental questions, "but at the broader picture of how people live in the north, how developmental projects affect people in the different regions."
"Does that wealth go back into the north or is it just taken out?" she said "Is there development taking place in such a way that will provide new jobs for the young people who are desperately in need of work?"
The council is a six-year-old Canadian initiative that has won the backing of all polar powers except the United States. Washington has had reservations about creating a new international bureaucracy, but Ms. Simon's lobbying appears to have brought the Clinton Administration around.
David A. Colson, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State responsible for polar affairs, said recently from Washington, "I would hope to be in a position to reconcile our differences and have a common point of view with Canada that we could express to the other six countries in March."
The issue of environmental security has taken on a sense of urgency with the huge oil spill last year near the Russian Arctic city of Usinsk and the disclosure of dumping by the Soviet Union of nuclear reactors in the shallow waters of the Kara Sea.
The eight polar countries adopted an Arctic Environment Protection Strategy in 1991, but it was a nonbinding agreement lacking enforcement provisions. Pollution has also been a top agenda item for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a nongovernmental group representing all the native people in the north, which Ms. Simon headed from 1986 to 1992.
But the hope is that the new governmental body would be able to forestall such disasters and protect the fragile Arctic ecosystem.
By addressing standards required for proper environmental management and conservation, the council could set the stage for sustainable economic development, said Christopher D. Stephens, an Arctic scholar who directs the Indigenous Development International program at the McDonald Institute of Cambridge University.
Canada, which occupies 30 percent of the Arctic land mass, is particularly anxious about the environmental deterioration. PCB's and chemicals associated with pesticides have already shown up in disconcertingly high concentrations in the Canadian north, borne by winds, rivers and ocean currents.
Through fish and marine mammals, which form a large part of native diets, they enter the food chain. PCB levels, for example, have been found to be five times higher in the breast milk of Eskimos in northern Quebec than in mothers in southern Canada.
Ms. Simon, who has three children, said people in the north feel an urgency about the contamination. "The concern is something you feel -- like it's in you, like I'm really worried about this," she said. "People are worried that they won't be able to eat fat any more, and where are they going to get a nutritionally based food source because the cost of living is so great?"
A youth steeped in Eskimo culture gave Ms. Simon a deep understanding of the people's concerns. Her mother is an Eskimo, and her father, a Hudson Bay post manager, is a white Canadian who has long lived in the north. The family spoke Inuktitut, the local language, and her mother speaks little English.
As a child, Ms. Simon and her seven brothers and sisters learned how to drive a dog team and to build igloos, but they were taught to appreciate both cultures. She went to high school through correspondence courses. Later she taught Inuktitut at McGill University in Montreal and then joined the Northern Service of CBC as a radio and television broadcaster.
Asked if she is torn between the two cultures, she replied: "Not so much torn. But I find if I'm away for too long from my home community, or from the region, which is very different from living down here, I get a very strong longing to be back, and I have to go back a lot."

HEADLINE: Changing an Inflation Gauge Is Tougher Than It Sounds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
At first glance, Alan Greenspan appeared to offer Congress a relatively painless way to slash $150 billion from the Federal deficit over the next five years. But when it comes to saving money in Washington, nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems.
Last month, Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers that inflation might be overstated by as much as 1.5 percentage points in official Government figures. He suggested that a simple fix in the Consumer Price Index could reap big savings. How? Trimming the inflation numbers would mean lower payouts to Social Security beneficiaries, other recipients of Federal benefit programs and retired Government workers. 
 Although the Fed chairman did not emphasize the point, lower consumer inflation numbers would also translate into higher tax bills because the annual inflation adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions would be smaller.
While Mr. Greenspan couched his proposal largely in technical terms, what he was doing was reopening a debate -- dormant for almost a decade -- over the larger political question of who should pay to narrow the budget gap.
"In the end, it is going to be a judgment and a political compromise," said Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan. "Ultimately, it will be Congress that will change the law, after listening to a variety of experts."
Mr. Greenspan's proposal was greeted enthusiastically by Republicans on Capitol Hill. He appeared to offer a way out of one of their biggest quandaries: how to cut spending on Federal entitlement programs without a specific vote that would clearly tamper with politically sacrosanct Social Security benefits. It would also allow Congress to increase tax revenues at a faster rate without requiring a political death wish: a vote to increase income taxes.
Indeed, House Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to threaten to withhold financing from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- responsible for compiling the monthly consumer price report since 1919 -- unless it changed its approach.
To those with long memories, however, the arcane technical debate was little more than a replay of the bitter 1985 battle to cut cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA's, directly.
Back then, the Republican-controlled Senate approved by a one-vote margin a one-year freeze on COLA's for Social Security and other Federal benefits. But when President Reagan abandoned Senate Republicans after both House Democrats and Republicans objected, the idea died in a House-Senate conference committee. Partly as a consequence of the fiasco, Republicans lost control of the Senate in the 1986 election.
"This is not a new issue," a Senate Budget Committee staff member said. "But 1985 was the last real attempt to get at mandatory growth."
For the most part, economists who have studied the issue do not favor an overhaul of the index. The task, they say, would not only be costly and time consuming but probably fruitless as well.
Generating a more accurate consumer price index "is a worthy goal," said Robert J. Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. "But as a purely practical notion, producing a Consumer Price Index that is a totally accurate reflection of inflation is just not on."
The Consumer Price Index, most economists agree, tends to overstate the actual rate of inflation by failing to completely account for gains in quality and improvements in technology and by only intermittently taking account of changes in buying patterns.
But rather than force the Labor Department to alter its methods, they argue, it would be more useful if Congress agreed to set its own limit on COLA's. While politically risky, Congress could declare that Federal benefit programs and tax brackets should be adjusted only by a set amount, say one percentage point less than the actual increase in the Consumer Price Index.
In his testimony on the subject, Mr. Greenspan said the overstatement might be as much as 1.5 percentage points but could be as little as one-half of a percentage point. Researchers at the Congressional Budget Office say the range of the bias is smaller, probably in the area of two-tenths to eight-tenths of a percentage point.
A detailed study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas concluded that it was probably impossible to pin down the exact error in the price index. "A figure of less than 1 percent strikes us as a plausible estimate of the overall bias" in the Consumer Price Index, they wrote, but "the true figure may be a lot larger or a lot smaller."
"At present, we simply do not know," they said.
Much of the current debate on the issue was set off by the Bureau of Labor Statistics itself. In December 1993, researchers at the bureau published a series of technical articles concluding that the index overstated inflation by as much as six-tenths of a percentage point. Only then did analysts at the Fed and the Congressional Budget Office start their own studies.
"There are a great many economists who sympathize with the notion that the index overstates inflation," said John Peterson, the Congressional Budget Office expert on the subject. "The difficulty is in getting hard statistical evidence. I doubt that policy should be changed without that evidence."
Whatever the correct figure, it is clear that even a modest change in inflation adjustments would translate into significant savings for the Federal Government and fewer dollars in the pockets of millions of Americans.
A reduction in the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index by just half a percentage point would cut the deficit by $64.4 billion over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Taxes would be $21.6 billion higher over five years than under current rules and benefit payments would be $36.4 billion lower. Roughly 70 percent of that amount, or $25.7 billion, would come from lower Social Security payments. The remainder of the savings would come from lower interest costs on the national debt. An adjustment of a full percentage point each year would double those figures.
A one-point adjustment would also mean that the average Social Security recipient would get about $1,220 less money over five years, while the average taxpayer would pay an extra $385 in income taxes over the same period.
Not surprisingly, the proposals produced strong reactions from groups representing those who would be most affected.
"Mandating they change the C.P.I. adjustment is no more than saying there will be a cut in cost-of-living adjustments," said David Certner, senior coordinator for economic issues at the American Association for Retired Persons.
To Mr. Certner, the inflation adjustment should go the other way.
"The elderly spend more of their dollars on health care, which is rising faster than inflation," he said. "That puts a whole new wrinkle into this thing."
Most economists who have studied the issue closely, however, say the current system is too generous to Federal beneficiaries and taxpayers. Mr. Gordon of Northwestern said the pain of lower COLA's and slightly higher taxes would be unavoidable but nonetheless appropriate. A change would be a cut "only in the sense that you are taking away a phony benefit," he said. "If inflation is being overstated, we are giving a false benefit."
And Professor Feldstein pointed out that no benefits would actually be cut. "People have probably been getting 1 to 2 percent more a year than they should have," he said. "But no one is talking about rolling that back. What we are saying is that going forward, it will not be there."

HEADLINE: Congressional Republicans Take Aim at an Extensive List of Environmental Statutes

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Republicans plan to escalate their war on Federal regulations this week as House debate begins on a series of bills that, taken together, would fundamentally affect the enforcement of every existing environmental law.
The measures would temporarily freeze the Government's powers to make rules in virtually every area of Federal authority and strictly limit those powers in the future. But nowhere would they have greater effect than in environmental regulation, where about 20 major laws generate a steady stream of rules intended to protect health, safety and natural resources. 
 The Republican proposals include a moratorium on new regulations, compensation for landowners when regulations hurt their property values and a requirement that new rules be subjected to elaborate risk assessments and cost-benefit analysis.
President Clinton hinted today that he might veto so far-reaching a package. "The environment is still not able to protect itself," he said in a speech announcing his own package of measures that he said would make regulations less burdensome without rolling back existing laws.
The coming votes will signal how determined the Republicans (and some Democrats) are to rethink a whole generation of environmental laws. Senior Administration officials expect most, and perhaps all, of the package to pass the House, although there are signs that the Senate might modify it.
Even in the House, however, a number of Republicans are hesitant about some of the package's provisions. While the majority party has so far maintained virtually flawless unity in pushing its Contract With America, 15 House Republicans last week wrote to Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, saying they opposed one bill in the package.
Republican leaders in Congress say they intend to rewrite several environmental laws later this year, including the Superfund law, on cleaning up toxic waste dumps; the Clean Water Act, controlling pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans; the Safe Drinking Water Act, governing municipal water supplies, and the Endangered Species Act, protecting the habitat of threatened plants and animals. There are also proposals to repeal parts of the 1990 Clean Air Act and to increase logging in publicly owned forests. And an industry-backed bill to rewrite tolerances for pesticides in food is also likely to move forward, along with farm-bill provisions involving conservation.
In a speech last week, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the policies of the past 20 years or more "have been absurdly expensive, created far more resistance than was necessary and misallocated resources on emotional and public relations grounds without regard to either scientific, engineering or economic rationality."
"And that," he said, "requires very profound rethinking of what we want to do collectively as a species in order to save the environment."
For the moment, though, the proposals before the House take an indirect route, dramatically restricting the effects of environmental laws without actually rewriting any of them.
"Every person in this Administration is greatly alarmed," said Carol M. Browner, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, discussing the bills coming to the House floor this month as part of the Contract with America.
She said the proposals would fundamentally undermine existing laws by replacing health protection with economic considerations as the determining factor in setting environmental standards.
"The Administration is not going to be a party to that," she said. "Absolutely, positively not. I do know that the Administration will not allow these laws to be dismantled."
At least three bills are ready for action on the House floor, having been approved by House committees in the last two weeks:
*Title III of H.R. 9, called the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, requires elaborate risk assessments to be conducted for any new rules and prohibits regulations unless their economic costs are justified by a cost-benefit measurement.
*A stopgap anti-regulation measure known as the Regulatory Transition Act would halt the imposition of most new Federal regulations dating back to November, and would remain in effect until broader regulatory changes of H.R. 9 were enacted.
*A bill called the Private Property Protection Act would compensate landowners when the value of their property declined because its use had been restricted by Federal regulations.
Although the regulatory moratorium probably will be debated first, it is so likely to be vetoed -- with little chance of an override -- that its importance could be mainly symbolic. As a result, the two other bills will probably be argued over more fiercely.
The bill on private property rights was cleared by the House Judiciary Committee last week. It would require the Federal Government to compensate any property owner whose land values declined by at least one-tenth because of rules restricting how the property could be developed.
That bill is the one that has sparked open dissent among some Republican lawmakers, and prompted them to write Representative Hyde declaring their opposition.
"If this legislation were to become law, the Federal Government could be required to compensate a landowner who is denied a permit to site a hazardous waste facility over an aquifer that supplies drinking water to a nearby community," they said.
The committee voted down a proposal to limit the bill to cases in which land values were reduced because of regulations protecting wetlands or endangered species, but such an amendment is likely to be offered on the House floor. By focusing on two laws that many property owners oppose, it would strengthen the bill's chance of passage.
The biggest fight of all may be over the risk-assessment and cost-benefit provisions, because they would replace health-based environmental standards in existing laws with standards based primarily on economic calculations.
The complex package is likely to get prolonged scrutiny in the Senate, where the votes might not divide entirely on party lines.
"Some of the regulatory reform measures that have been introduced this year go way too far," said Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He singled out the risk-assessment provisions proposed in the House, saying, "If there ever was a prescription for gridlock, that's it."
Other influential senators, however, are supporting risk-assessment legislation that could be brought to the Senate floor without passing through Senator Chafee's committee. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, has a proposal that would affect only the Energy Department, and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, has a version of his own that would affect all Federal agencies.
Environmental groups are mounting a concerted lobbying campaign in response to the risk-assessment bill, which they call the biggest single threat to their cause in a generation.
In a 120-page report issued today, the Natural Resources Defense Council offered a detailed discussion of how existing laws could be affected by the Republican proposals that will be debated soon.
"We are confronted with sweeping legislation that does not directly amend any single environmental law, but will make efforts to carry out all of them exceptionally difficult, if not impossible," the report says.
A separate analysis issued by the Environmental Protection Agency made the same point. Under existing law, the agency said, it is required to set air quality standards for lead, smog, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide on the basis of health protection alone, not taking costs into account. Nearly 100 million people live in areas where these standards are not being met, and the agency is considering tightening the standards for smog and particulate matter.

HEADLINE: Nassau, Reining In Deficit, Just Misses Breaking Even

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Feb. 21

 BODY:
A drop in sales tax revenue at the end of the year and higher social service costs left Nassau County with a deficit of $3.9 million in 1994, county officials said today.
But the deficit was down sharply for the second consecutive year, after peaking at $120 million in 1992. 
 "We're not out of the woods yet," said Frederick E. Parola, the County Comptroller. "However, Nassau has made a remarkable recovery from the height of the recession in 1992."
County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta had anticipated that the county would break even for the first time since 1989, counting on a continued rise in retail sales toward the end of the year for higher sales tax collections. The sales tax provides a third of the county's revenue.
Although sales began to climb shortly after Thanksgiving, they suddenly slowed down just before Christmas. In addition, Mr. Parola said, social service spending was $38.5 million higher than expected, as a population increase put pressure on areas like Medicaid, home relief assistance for the elderly and care for handicapped young children.
Despite the year-end disappointment, Mr. Parola said the deficit of $3.9 million, in a budget of $1.9 billion, sent a positive message to Nassau residents and Wall Street that the county was on more solid footing than it had been.
He said the County Medical Center showed a surplus of $8.6 million, which could affect the debate over whether the hospital should be sold or leased to private operators.
"The center is recovering from the days when the general fund had to subsidize the facility to the tune of over $30 million," Mr. Parola said.
The county had anticipated taking in $625.5 million in sales tax revenue last year but realized only $611 million. Mr. Parola said the sales tax figures were "clear evidence that Long Island's economy is still vulnerable."
Nevertheless, he said that total sales tax revenue showed a 4 percent increase from 1993 and that an additional 5 percent increase had been projected for the 1995 fiscal year.
Mr. Parola cautioned that because of the county's dependence on sales tax revenue, this might not be the time to consider reducing the tax, as the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, has proposed there.
Citing government cost-cutting, lower welfare expenses and improved economic conditions in Suffolk, Mr. Gaffney, a Republican who is expected to seek a second term in November, called last week for a cut of a quarter of a percentage point in the sales tax, to 8.25 percent, which would reduce county revenue by $32 million a year.
In Nassau and Suffolk, as in many counties throughout New York, the sales tax has become an important tool for holding down property taxes. The 8.5 percent sales tax in Nassau and Suffolk is the highest in the state and among the highest in the nation.
Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the largest business and civic group on Long Island, has long sought to reduce taxes in both counties as part of a drive to strengthen the region's economy.
"Any decrease in the sales tax that would encourage people to buy here on Long Island rather than elsewhere would certainly be desirable from an overall business standpoint," Mr. Crosson said. "But it would have to be done without undermining essential government services."

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mixed, With Dow Rising 10.43

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday as gains in oil and bank issues tempered losses in shares of tobacco companies.
Stocks were held in check in part by the recent weakness in the dollar, which fell to a 28-month low against the German mark yesterday. A weak dollar makes American stocks and bonds less attractive to foreign investors. 
 In addition, traders were unwilling to place big bets on stocks ahead of today's Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Stocks surged the last time Mr. Greenspan addressed Congress, when he suggested in late January that the Fed's rate increases had already slowed the economy's brisk growth.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.43 points yesterday, to 3,963.97, its sixth gain in the last seven sessions. On Friday, the average fell 33.98 points in the biggest one-day decline since it dropped 46.77 points on Jan. 19. The market was closed Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.75 point, to 482.72, below its all-time closing high of 485.22 set on Thursday. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.35 points, to 784.62, its third consecutive decline after rising 11 of the previous 12 sessions.
The rise in bank stocks yesterday came after Fleet Financial Group Inc. agreed to buy the Shawmut National Corporation for $3.7 billion, a merger which would create the ninth-largest banking company in the United States. Shawmut's stock soared 4 3/8 a share, to 25.
"The strength in the bank area is an indication that more mergers could be in line," said Paul Hennessey, head of equities trading at the Boston Company Asset Management Group. "The acquisition talk from a year ago may be starting to resume."
The S.& P. regional banking index of 21 stocks rose as much as 1.71 points before closing up 0.46 at 178.39. Fleet, which will issue new stock to pay for the transaction, saw its shares fall 3 1/4, to 30 3/8. Baybanks Inc. surged 2 7/8 a share, to 63; U S Bancorp gained 5/8, to 25 1/4; Wells Fargo & Company jumped 1 1/8, to 157 3/4; the Mellon Bank Corporation rose 1, to 38 7/8, and Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. added 3/8 a share, to 30 5/8.
Oil issues gained on optimism that energy consumption is not waning and the companies' attractive dividends will draw investor interest, traders said. Separately, Texaco Inc. said it would sign a multimillion-dollar agreement for nine plants in China that convert fuels like coal and heavy oil into clean gas.
"Energy companies are undergoing massive restructurings and as some developed countries recover from recession, there'll be an improvement in oil consumption," Doug Terreson, an analyst with Paine Webber, said. "Dividends will be higher this year as well, so it's going to be a pretty good place to invest."
Shares of Texaco gained 7/8, to 63 1/2; the Mobil Corporation rose 1, to 88; the Exxon Corporation added 5/8, to 64; the Atlantic Richfield Company rose 1 1/8, to 107 3/4, and shares of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation jumped 7/8, to 19 7/8.
The biggest loser among the Dow industrials was the Philip Morris Companies, which dropped 2 3/8 a share, to 57 7/8. The State of Florida sued 17 tobacco companies to recover the cost of treating some victims of smoking-related illness. Last week in New Orleans, tobacco companies failed to head off a class-action lawsuit.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Don't Mess With Moody's

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the 1960's the most important visitor a developing country could have was from the head of AID, the U.S. agency that doled out foreign aid. In the 1970's and 80's the most important visitor a developing country could have was from the I.M.F., to help restructure its economy. In the 1990's the most important visitor a developing country can have is from Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Because we now live in an age when governments are basically broke, the only way for most countries to raise cash for development is either to enforce savings at home or attract investors from the world's major bond markets. Moody's is the credit rating agency that signals the electronic herd of global investors where to plunk down their money, by telling them which countries' bonds are blue-chip and which are junk. 
 That makes Moody's one powerful agency. In fact, you could almost say that we live again in a two-superpower world. There is the U.S. and there is Moody's. The U.S. can destroy a country by leveling it with bombs; Moody's can destroy a country by downgrading its bonds.
Moody's rates the investment quality of countries today just as it rates companies. Those that get their economic house in order will be rated AAA and be able to sell bonds at low interest. Those that don't will be rated C and have to pay pawnbroker interest rates.
If you doubt Moody's influence, ask Mexico and Canada. President Clinton visits Ottawa tomorrow, but all the Canadian papers are talking about is the visit they just had from the other superpower -- the man from Moody's. The Canadian Government was just putting the finishing touches on a major budget overhaul designed to slow the decline of the Canadian dollar, which has lately been dubbed the "northern peso" and is down to 70 U.S. cents.
But before Canada's Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, could even unveil his planned spending cuts and tax hikes, Moody's launched a pre-emptive strike. It declared the proposed cutbacks in the Canadian budget insufficient and put Canada's debt rating under review for possible downgrade. This triggered a big selloff of Canadian dollars and bonds. The Reform Party leader, Preston Manning, told the Canadian Parliament: "When one of the world's largest bond-rating agencies won't wait two weeks to get the minister's budget, they are telling him that his targets are not only unbelievable, they are unacceptable to the markets."
They are also telling him who's boss.
Indeed, Moody's message to both Canada and Mexico is that either you vote the economic pain on yourself -- in the form of deep cuts in government spending and higher domestic interest rates to suppress inflation -- or the bond market will force you to do it by withholding capital. The Canadians couldn't do it on their own because they feared that a tough budget would encourage Quebec separatists by disillusioning people about the federal Government. Mexico's weak, corrupt Government couldn't reform itself because it was too busy buying votes.
So in both cases the bond market is forcing the pain. The U.S. yesterday announced its $20 billion rescue package for Mexico. But the terms of that deal -- both the design of the U.S. loans and the level of Mexican reforms -- were largely dictated by what the two Governments thought the bond market would require to resume private lending to Mexico.
A senior Clinton finance official remarked that it is almost spooky dealing with market powers. At least with the Russians there was a hot line with someone's voice at the other end. But with the bond market, the official said: "You can't argue with it, you can't bargain with it, sometimes you can't even find it. It is an impersonal arbiter, and governments just have to get used to it."
Francis Fukuyama wrote a couple of years ago that democracy and capitalism constituted "the end of history" -- the highest level of human political and economic organization. But I've been thinking that maybe the bond market is the end of history. Moody's and the bond market are now imposing on democracies economic and political decisions that the democracies, left to their own devices, simply cannot take.
I now understand that graffito that reportedly appeared on a wall in Poland last year. It said: "We wanted democracy but we ended up with capitalism." I would refine that to say: "We wanted a parliament, but we ended up with the bond market."

HEADLINE: In America;
Whitman Steals the Future

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Over the past 25 years the State of New Jersey has struggled, under a succession of Democratic and Republican governors, to reverse a social and economic decline that, by the 1960's, had hit many Northeastern industrial areas.
Difficult budget decisions were made, often at significant political cost. But the benefits for New Jersey residents were many. A vastly improved higher education system was developed and state aid to local public schools surged. The environment was cleaned up. Mass transit was improved. The state's budget was balanced without gimmicks and its credit rating was triple-A. 
 There is a strong link between those developments and the fact that New Jersey residents today are among the best educated in the country, and rank near the top in per-capita income.
Now many of the gains made over a quarter of a century are in danger of slipping away because the current Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, has chosen to finance her political ambitions with a popular buy-now, pay-later economic policy that will place a financial stranglehold on future generations of New Jerseyans.
This is best illustrated by Mrs. Whitman's decision to withhold billions of dollars that should be going into the public employee pension funds over the next few years, and using the bulk of that money to balance the state budget. Then, with an audacity that dazzles her supporters and even draws grudging admiration from opponents, Mrs. Whitman smiles and characterizes the withheld funds as savings.
Of course, they are not "savings" -- not in any sense of the word. The pension obligations at some point will come due and future generations will have to meet them.
Not only will the money have to be made up, but future taxpayers will be deprived of the income that the money -- if properly invested now -- would be expected to generate.
Mrs. Whitman's pension maneuvers have not gotten a lot of publicity -- in part because the eyes of reporters and readers alike tend to glaze over when confronted with complex budget details. The changes that she has made have been drastic. According to the New Jersey Education Association, which has filed suit against the state, the employer contributions to the pension system this year will be as much as 96 percent below the amounts contributed in the early 1990's.
By all accounts, the employer contributions have been reduced by nearly $1 billion a year. The Whitman administration insists that this is not a problem. Needless to say, others disagree.
"There is no question but that this is creating future debt," said Richard C. Leone, a former New Jersey State Treasurer who is now the president of the Twentieth Century Fund. "This is just another way of getting around the balanced-budget requirement, a kind of deficit spending. It is the sort of thing that comes back to haunt you."
Until the changes adopted by Mrs. Whitman, New Jersey had been very conservative in its approach to its pension obligations. For example, the state had started to pre-fund the health care benefits of its retirees, building up reserves against post-retirement liabilities. As one state official said: "That was prudent. Health-care costs are a big problem."
Prudent or not, Mrs. Whitman scrapped the pre-funding. She used the reserves that had already built up to help balance her budget. For Christine Todd Whitman, the pension funds have become a budget-balancing machine.
Mrs. Whitman and the long-term interests of New Jersey appear to be at odds. The Governor won election by promising tax cuts, and any further advances in her career will be powered by her ability to "deliver" on that promise. Like most politicians, her eyes are on the short term: today's budget, tomorrow's election. It requires courage to look beyond Election Day to the long-term interests of constituents.
Young men and women who were children in New Jersey 20 or 25 years ago are benefiting from the vision and courage of the politicians in power then, politicians who were not afraid to lead. They weren't perfect but they had a sense of responsibility toward the generations growing up behind them. It's a quality that nowadays is in extremely short supply. And not just in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Beyond the 100 Days

BYLINE: By Newt Gingrich; Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, is Speaker of the House of Representatives.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Believing that a campaign promise is one thing but a signed contract is quite another, House Republican candidates signed the Contract With America last September. Today, we reach day 50 of that historic commitment to change this country. This midway point is a time to reflect on our progress.
As promised, on a memorable first day the House passed legislation that brought Congress under the same regulatory laws as other businesses. To control runaway Federal spending, we have passed the balanced budget amendment and a Presidential line-item veto. To curb Congress's habit of creating a program but leaving the payments to the states, we have enacted reform of "unfunded mandates." To restore credibility to the criminal justice system, we have revised the exclusionary rule, which would end legal technicalities that freed many criminals, and we have established an effective death penalty. And to insure that our military forces are not needlessly put in harm's way, we have voted restrictions on how our troops are deployed overseas. 
 Despite a small majority (230 to 204) Republicans have produced huge bipartisan majorities for bills in the contract. These results show the difference between the last legislative session and this one: a liberal Congress out of touch with the nation created gridlock; a conservative Congress elected to do the people's work creates results. Now many of our initiatives await action in the Senate, where the rules give the minority greater power to slow debate.
The next 50 days will produce tax relief for families and the elderly, job creation bills, common sense legal reform, votes on term limits and welfare reform. The last item will undoubtedly be the most contentious in the contract. But we cannot replace the welfare state unless we change welfare itself. Thus, we will work to end cash payments to unmarried teen-age mothers and create incentives to get people to work while allowing governors to reform welfare at the state level, where change is most effective.
The pace that the 104th Congress has set in getting its agenda completed can make it easy to lose sight of what we are doing.
Republicans were sent to Washington not just to set records of legislative activity, though that's been necessary to fulfill the contract. Setting records is fine; but remembering the lessons of history is a far greater responsibility.
We Republicans must keep in mind that we are heirs to a great legacy. February marks the births of three of our most outstanding Presidents: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. After leading the Colonies through the Revolutionary War, Washington displayed rare insight that set the right tone for leading a young Republic. Though easily electable to a third term, he chose to return to his farm; in effect setting a two-term limit for Presidential service (breached only during a national emergency by Franklin D. Roosevelt), he was the true ideal of a citizen-statesman.
During some of our darkest hours, Lincoln never wavered in his belief that America's destiny lay as one unified nation. Despite slavery, despite economic adversity and the Civil War, he fervently believed that the divisions tearing his society apart could be surmounted.
When Ronald Reagan became President, he found a dispirited country that was stagnating economically and embarrassed internationally. His policies, unswerving optimism and vision brought forth a true rejuvenation, including a record 93 months of economic expansion.
The moments associated with these three leaders -- birth, reconciliation and rejuvenation -- will remain with the Republicans as we complete the contract.
While some mourn the death of the liberal welfare state, the nation must, like George Washington, be prepared for the birth of something much stronger -- in this case, a conservative opportunity society. Despite the decay and division around us, Republicans must take Lincoln's example and never falter in our determination to see a society reconciled. And like Ronald Reagan, we must remain committed and optimistic about bringing about national rejuvenation.
Completing the Contract With America is only a beginning -- the start of a program to renew American civilization and to build a true civil society. That is the Republicans' goal for next 50 days -- and beyond.

Prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday, weighed down by concerns about the weak dollar, the auctions of new government securities and this week's semiannual report from the Federal Reserve to Congress on the conduct of monetary policy and the state of the economy.
Donald E. Maude, chief United States fixed-income strategist at the Scotia McLeod brokerage firm, said that not many traders were showing a willingness to make a big bet on the direction of interest rates ahead of the testimony of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, scheduled for today and tomorrow. 
 Mr. Maude said that he believed that Mr. Greenspan would continue to emphasize the concerns of the Fed about the potential for a pickup in inflation and its primary worry that the economy was pressing up against full capacity in both the labor force and manufacturing.
"Right now the market has ruled out another Fed tightening at least until May," Mr. Maude said. But he said that "I think Greenspan's views will be a lot more hawkish" than recent comments from other Fed officials and the "market may not be prepared."
"I tend to believe this will be less than friendly for the markets," he said of the Greenspan testimony.
The bellwether 30-year bond fell 9/32 , to a price of 1007/32 to yield 7.61 percent, up from 7.58 percent on Friday.
Today the Treasury will auction $17.25 billion worth of two-year notes and tomorrow will auction $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading these securities were offered at prices to yield 7.10 percent for the two-year and 7.35 percent for the five-year.
Yesterday the Treasury held its weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, with the average rates at auction down to their lowest levels since late last year. The rate on a three-month bill fell 8 basis points, to 5.74 percent, near the 5.56 percent of Dec. 27, while the six-month dropped 14 basis points, to 6.01 percent, the lowest since the Nov. 28 level of 5.86 percent.
The following are the results of that auction:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.549	96.962	Discounted Rate	5.74%	6.01%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.28%	High Price	98.557	96.977	Discounted Rate	5.71%	5.98%	Coupon Yield	5.87%	6.25%	Low Price	98.549	96.962	Discounted Rate	5.74%	6.01%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.28%	Accepted at low price	62%	44%	Total applied for	$45,926,452	$45,123,472	Accepted	$13,514,172	$13,497,872	Noncompetitive	$1,522,195	$1,445,631

Talk of German Rate Rise Pulls Dollar Down vs. Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to a 28-month low against the German mark and slumped against most other currencies yesterday after a report from the Bundesbank indicated that German interest rates were poised to rise.
The signing yesterday of an agreement between the United States and Mexico on a $20 billion portion of a rescue plan for Mexico failed to provide much support for the dollar. The dollar has been weighed down by fears over the costs of rescuing Mexico. 
 The mark continued its recent advance against the dollar yesterday after the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said in a monthly report that the nation's economy showed "undiminished strength" at the end of 1994. Rising commodity and import prices and dwindling industrial capacity added to the risk that inflation would accelerate, the report said.
"The mark is the focus of attention, and if the Bundesbank raises rates, the mark will benefit," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York.
The Bundesbank's longstanding top priority is controlling inflation. Raising interest rates -- the bank's most common method of tempering growth and curbing price increases -- would make mark-denominated deposits more attractive.
The dollar fell as low as 1.4690 marks, its lowest level since Oct. 16, 1992. In late New York trading, the dollar recovered to 1.4700 marks, down from 1.4802 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.2430 Swiss francs from 1.2520 francs, and to 97.05 Japanese yen from 97.40 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5862 from $1.5820.
Trading was thin on Monday because markets and many foreign-exchange desks in the United States were closed in observance of Washington's Birthday.
 Germany's report on producer prices also fueled speculation that the Bundesbank would soon raise interest rates. The Federal Statistics Office announced that western German producer prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in January, the biggest monthly gain since July 1991.
The Bundesbank last changed rates on May 11, when it lowered its discount rate, which acts as a floor for money market rates, and cut its Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling, by half a percentage point, to 4.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
The Federal Reserve in the United States has raised rates seven times since February 1994, pushing the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 6 percent from 3 percent. The comparable German rate is 4.85 percent.

Second Childhood Ends: Fantasy Leaguers Suddenly Find They Have to Get a Life

BYLINE: By PAUL BELINKIE 

 BODY:
Dave Pearlstein, a real-estate broker for a company outside Boston, has been playing fantasy baseball for six years and spends 30 hours a week on the game.
Because his league will not play with replacement players this season, Pearlstein will fill the void by exercising and attending replacement games to scout for next year. "Without my Rotisserie fix, I may have to go back to smoking," the 26-year-old Pearlstein said. 
 For more than a decade, an estimated two million fans have competed in Rotisserie Baseball, an arena in which their judgment of talent and the ability to maneuver within salary guidelines has provided a test of baseball knowledge.
But in addition to the thousands of people employed either directly or indirectly in baseball, people who play fantasy baseball and people who earn their livings by supplying fantasy leagues with statistics are also experiencing hardships because of the current baseball strike.
Bob Weiser, 35, the general manager of a Holiday Inn in Atlanta, is a commissioner who spends about 35 hours a week on his league. He now says he will spend more time with his family.
"As a commissioner, the additional paperwork and rule changes would make it impossible to play with replacement players," he said, echoing the sentiments of other frustrated fans.
John Leven, 28, the franchise sales director for Uno Restaurant Corporation, has been playing for three years and devotes 20 hours a week to the game. Leven will fill this void with a more diverse social life and by attending replacement games.
"The game itself is bigger than the players," he said. Leven would like to play with replacement players, but says that no one knows replacement players well enough to play. Leven, however, is looking forward to going to replacement games to see whether some of his old Red Sox favorites come out of retirement.
In addition to fantasy players, the strike has hurt businesses that supply leagues with statistics.
Richard Pike, 34, and his partner, Michael Oliveto, of Allstar Stats, Valhalla, N.Y., worked for the Prodigy on-line service in sales before starting their business five years ago. They currently service 650 baseball leagues and 85 basketball leagues.
Last year, Allstar Stats, like every other statistical organization surveyed, offered leagues refunds or credit for this season. Pike has found that leagues are split evenly between those that will play with replacement players and those waiting for the real players to return.
Pike, who is married and has two children, is concerned that his phones are quiet.
"If this strike doesn't end soon, my wife may have to get a job," he said.
Bill Meyer, a 40-year-old lawyer, runs USA Stats in Baltimore. He supplies 370 leagues with weekly updates and will be starting his seventh year in the statistics business. Although he still practices law in the off season, Meyer says that if the strike doesn't end soon, he may have to return to more legal work or his wife, Lucy, who works with him in the statistics business, may have to resume selling real estate.
Eric Bielawski, 37, of Eric's No Frills Stat Service, in Ontario, provides statistics for more than 200 baseball leagues. A former computer salesman, Bielawski estimates that the strike has cut into his business by 30 percent.
"A lot of my customers are mad at baseball and don't know if they'll return to the game," he said.
Bielawski opposes both sides in the labor issue. "President Clinton summed it up best when he said, 'What we have is a couple of hundred people deciding how to divide $2 billion.' " he said.
But Bielawski is still optimistic about the season getting under way. "As a provider of stats, the strike casts a shadow over what I'm able to do and hoping to do," he said.
Most fantasy baseball players believe the biggest winners in baseball's new economic world will be the young players making relatively small salaries. The biggest losers, they believe, will be the journeymen players who will be forced to play for salaries slightly more than the minimum paid to rookies or players with minor league or make-good contracts.
In other words, there will be no more Spike Owens languishing on a major league bench as an expensive insurance policy in case someone gets injured or a highly touted rookie prospect fails.
Fiscal responsibility, like in any business or a Rotisserie Baseball league, will become the order of the day. Just because Bobby Bonilla is paid $7 million by the Mets or costs $35 in a fantasy league, doesn't mean he will earn it. And if the Brewers, owned by Bud Selig, the acting baseball commissioner, didn't sign Ted Higuera to a four-year, $13 million deal and Franklin Stubbs to a three-year, $6 million contract, perhaps they would have been able to afford to re-sign Paul Molitor when his contract expired.
A common fantasy baseball question has always been which would you rather have, a star player such as a Barry Bonds and a player earning near the minimum salary, or two well-paid players? The answer, which is even more relevant now than ever, will depend on who the other player is.

HEADLINE: America Online Adds Clients

 BODY:
America Online Inc. said yesterday that it had surpassed two million subscribers, and it asserted that it had overtaken both Compuserve and Prodigy to become the largest consumer information service in the United States.
America Online, based in Vienna, Va., said it had added 500,000 members since December. But the growth has come at the cost of deteriorating service, many subscribers have complained. Busy signals, slow connections and electronic mail delays of several hours, or in some cases days, are increasingly common. 
 In some cases, electronic mail "is zapped into never-never land," said Mary Modahl, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "The degradation of their service is remarkable. They haven't been able to keep up with demand."
Steve Case, America Online's president and chief executive, acknowledged the problems in a letter to subscribers earlier this month, noting that the service was struggling to handle 1.5 million electronic mail messages a day.
America Online's rivals shopped short of disputing the assertion by the company that it was now the largest domestic on-line service.

HEADLINE: New Faces in the Old Masters Trade

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Just as contemporary-art galleries have a uniform look -- antiseptic, spare white spaces and highly polished floors -- so do galleries for Old Master paintings and drawings. Theirs is a more hushed atmosphere where works by Rubens and Rembrandt, Van Dyck and Guardi, hang in a stately cavalcade on richly brocaded walls.
While London has traditionally been the center of the Old Master trade, with dozens of galleries clustered around Old Bond Street, New York has, until recently, had just a few big-name dealers like Colnaghi or the Newhouse Galleries, and business was, for the most part, private and by appointment only. Except for the highly publicized auctions held twice a year at Sotheby's and Christie's, sales made by dealers were kept as quiet as the personalities of the collectors who bought. 
 But times have changed, and the number of dealers specializing in art generally dating from the 14th century to about 1850 has multiplied in recent years. The profile of the Old Master dealer has changed, too. No longer crusty Englishmen who are more at home with books than with prospective buyers, the new breed of Old Master dealers dispels the myth that they are a group nearly as old as the paintings they sell. Today's generation of Old Master dealers range in age from mid-30's to late 40's. Their galleries, most of which are off Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side, are open and inviting.
And business, while far from booming, has picked up over the last year.
"The field is becoming more popular," said Rachel Kaminsky, 33, who left Christie's in October to become the director of Otto Naumann's new East Side gallery. "There are more exhibitions, more antique shows and more publications all geared toward the Old Master market."
Ms. Kaminsky said that in her last few years at Christie's she noticed an increase in buyers entering the field, both new collectors and what she calls "the more mature collector" who were buyers in other areas but opted to switch to Old Masters.
Affordability is one reason for the increase in popularity. Old Masters are still undervalued when compared with Impressionist or modern art. Another reason is that the amount of scholarship in the field has grown over the years, so that there are fewer sticky issues of provenance and attributions. Buyers are seeing less risk than they once did, since more information is now available to the public.
Even contemporary-art dealers are jumping into the field. Larry Gagosian, who has galleries on the Upper East Side and in SoHo, is hard at work on a Rubens exhibition scheduled to open in his Madison Avenue space on April 1. Mr. Gagosian said he thought a Rubens exhibition would be something his clients could relate to, since many contemporary artists look to the Old Master for inspiration. He said he hoped the show would broaden the tastes of people who frequent his gallery.
Old Master dealers, both in New York and in London, think that idea is just fine. In fact, many of them are lending Mr. Gagosian paintings for the show in the hopes of expanding their market. "The more excitement that surrounds Old Masters and the more dealers there are, the more collectors will appear," said Adam Williams, a director of the Newhouse Galleries. "We're all working hard to generate more business."
Mr. Williams, 42, is one of the old-timers, relatively speaking, having come over from London in 1983 to work at Newhouse. His colleague Nicholas Hall, the president of Colnaghi in New York, came to the United States 10 years ago, two years after Colnaghi had opened a gallery in New York.
"Perhaps the biggest change is that most of the newer dealers are American, not English, and all these people seem here to stay," Mr. Hall said. "There are certainly more young independent Old Master dealers than there were."
Ian Kennedy, who was the director of the Old Master paintings department at Christie's in New York for 16 years, opened the New York branch of the Simon Dickinson Gallery in January 1994. "In the 1980's there were a lot of Old Master dealers," he said. "Some of them survived, but a lot of them didn't. Then the recession hit. This new crop of dealers is proof that there is more optimism in the field."
Mr. Kennedy said New York, not London, was the place to be right now in the Old Masters field because America has the greatest potential for making private sales.
Many dealers in this increasingly crowded field would once have been more inclined to enter academic circles or become museum experts. Not anymore. Last year, Mr. Kennedy was a serious candidate for one of the most prestigious jobs in the museum world: curator of paintings at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. But he opted to stay in New York instead.
"Museum work has become too bureaucratic," said Mark Brady, a dealer who specializes in Old Master and 19th-century drawings and oil sketches. "The great attraction to dealing is that it's entirely object-oriented."
Mr. Hall agreed. "In museums you don't play with paintings; you play with labels and budgets," he said. "The museum world is failing to attract good people for many reasons. Certainly money has something to do with it. So does the fact that the emphasis in museums today is on education, exhibitions, fund raising and politics, and less on connoisseurship and acquisitions."
Mr. Brady also said he saw a change in the way dealers were perceived. "Art dealing has become a respectable commodity," he said. "In a commercial city like New York, the stigma of being in the trade has diminished. Now, being a dealer has a funny respectability to it."
The change that Otto Naumann, another New York dealer, has made in his business recently supports Mr. Brady's theory. After 13 years of dealing privately, Mr. Naumann has renovated the first two floors of 22 East 80th Street and opened them to the public. "I'm trying to run the gallery in a commercial way," Mr. Naumann said. "Being commercial isn't bad."
The dealer said he used to spend two or three hours talking to a client and bring out only one painting, maybe two. "Now it's just just the opposite," he said. "Ninety percent of my stock is on the walls."
The building that houses his gallery has been dubbed "the Old Master mall" by Mr. Naumann's colleagues. Upstairs are two other Old Master dealers, Bob Haboldt and Guy Sainty. "We're trying to do what London does," said Mr. Naumann, 46. "Not only in terms of proximity to each other, but also proximity to the Met. We've installed piped-in music. The point is to put the public at ease."
Jack Kilgore has assumed a higher profile, too, but in a significantly smaller way. Although his East Side gallery is still by appointment only, this year the dealer held his first exhibition for which he advertised steadily in both art and general interest publications. "The market here is better for selling, but in France and England it's better for buying," he said. "From 1989 till 1993, sales for Dutch paintings dropped off. Now it's back, and people are buying again."
Even so, most dealers admit their stock isn't splashy. After all, seeing a Canaletto or a Guardi hanging in someone's living room just doesn't scream "Rich!" in quite the same way seeing a Picasso or a Matisse does. Still, the dealers argue, Old Master paintings are good value. When compared to the Impressionist or modern artworks today, they seem downright cheap. "You can still buy a good Old Master painting for under $200,000," Mr. Kilgore said. "And that says something."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
THERE are still some wine enthusiasts in New York who remember the old Ambassador Wine Shop on East 86th Street, in the heart of Yorkville. Ambassador, as might be expected in that once-solidly Teutonic neighborhood, specialized in German wines and stocked hundreds of different labels.
The Ambassador shop has been gone since the late 1960's, and nothing has come along to take its place. With good reason. The interest simply isn't out there. 
 Except for a few enthusiasts here and there, Americans are just not drawn to German wines. It's unfortunate. Germany's best white wines are among the world's finest. And they are perfectly compatible with the way most people think of food and fitness: they are light, refreshing and low in alcohol, mostly between 8 and 11 percent, compared with up to 15 percent in some California chardonnays.
So what's the problem? Accessibility, mostly. It is not easy to win over a casual drinker with a wine called Bodenheimer Heitersbrunnchen Scheurebe Kabinett. And when such names appear on labels in an almost illegible gothic script, as many of them still do, many consumers shrug and move on to something else, like a California chardonnay.
Every decade or so, the Germans take another stab at simplifying their wine laws. But they remain an impenetrable thicket that, like the labels, send prospective customers away shaking their heads.
Then there is the question of when to drink German wines. Hardly anyone, at least in this country, is quite sure what to do with them. Are they food wines, to drink with lunch or dinner? Or are they aperitifs, like sherry and champagne?
The people who make them insist they are food wines, despite the fact that they are slightly sweet. There are, they say, many food and wine combinations based on German wines. They cite smoked fish, pasta, light cheese and even ham, one of the most difficult staples to match with a wine. Bigger German wines, those with an appreciable amount of sweetness, do, in fact, blend well with more pungent cheeses and hold their own admirably with assertive dishes like turkey and roasted game birds.
Nevertheless, in the book "How to Enjoy Wine" (Simon & Schuster, 1985), Hugh Johnson hails German wines as "the most exquisite of all wines for solo sipping."
In seeking a solution for their problems, German wine makers actually made things worse. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, they announced that henceforth they would make dry wines. Their motive was understandable; dry, or at least the perception of dry, was popular.
The most recent appearance of dry German wines -- the German word for dry is "trocken" -- has produced some elegant wines, but they are not what German wine loyalists have come to expect.
In another attempt to improve their economic lot, German wine makers have been experimenting with red wines, mostly pinot noir and a recently developed grape, the dornfelder. The best of these wines are attractive enough, but the chance of them ever finding serious markets outside Germany seems low. Currently, a group of mostly young, innovative wine makers has reverted to traditional styles; the wines display some sweetness but are beautifully balanced.
The writer and critic Stuart Pigott dates the current emphasis on quality and tradition to the vintage of 1983, when wine makers began experimenting with organic methods and getting lower yields to concentrate the flavors in the grapes.
There are 13 wine regions, or appellations, in Germany, all of them on or near the Rhine and Mosel rivers and their tributaries. The best known are the Rheingau, the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, the Rheinhessen and the Pfalz. The name of a region is always listed on a wine label, along with the name of the town and vineyard, the type of grape and the quality level of the wine.
The important quality levels are kabinett, spatlese and auslese. Kabinett wines come from grapes picked at normal harvest time; spatlese wines are made from late-picked grapes that have more intense flavors, and auslese wines come from particularly ripe grapes picked bunch by bunch.
The jaw-breaking name Bodenheimer Heitersbrunnchen Scheurebe Kabinett becomes a bit less formidable when broken into its components: the town is Bodenheim, in the Rheinhessen region, in the central-west part of the country; the vineyard is the Heitersbrunnchen, the grape is the scheurebe and the quality level is kabinett. The label will show the producer, in this case Kuhling-Gillot, and, of course, the vintage. By the way, in the 1992 vintage, this wine is an excellent buy, at about $10.
To avoid German-label panic, seek out reliable and interesting producers. Among them are Lingenfelder, Selbach-Oster, J. J. Prum, Schloss Vollrads, J. Lauerberg, Weingut Deinhard, Kurt Darting and, for that matter, any producer -- like Darting -- chosen by Terry Theise Estate Selection.

TASTINGS
Guenoc Petite Sirah, California North Coast, 1991. About $13.
 
The vogue for California wines made from grape varieties usually associated with the Rhone Valley in France has made syrah a fairly popular red wine. This gain has been partly at the expense of petite sirah, an old standby in the California vineyards, once used mostly for blending. Petite sirah is sometimes written off as a poor relative of syrah, but it has its champions, like Ridge Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Foppiano Vineyards in northern Sonoma County and, in this instance, Guenoc Winery in Lake County. Eighteen months in American and French oak have smoothed out the wine's tannins and added a touch of elegance that's rare in petite sirah. It is a rich, full-bodied wine that goes well with hearty stews and red meat on chilly late-winter nights.

HEADLINE: Agreement Reached On Gas to Balkans

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 21

 BODY:
The sanctions committee of the United Nations Security Council has reached an agreement that could allow a steady flow of Russian natural gas into both the capital of Bosnia and to Yugoslavia.
Providing the natural gas to heat homes, schools and hospitals is intended to forestall a crisis. At the same time, the agreement, which was reached Friday, would maintain the trade embargo against Yugoslavia that has been in place since 1992 to put pressure on the Serbs in Yugoslavia to halt the aggression by Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia. The agreement will extend through April 30. 
 Requests by the Russian Federation to be allowed to send about 130 million cubic meters of natural gas per month to the area had been rejected since last winter by the United States, France and Britain.
The committee's refusal was in part a response to the Bosnian Serbs' interruption of gas shipments into Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Bosnia and Herzegovina share a single natural gas pipeline with Yugoslavia. But Bosnian Serbs have been accused of repeatedly shutting off a line at the border carrying the small portion intended for Sarajevo.

HEADLINE: State Universities Reshaped In the Era of Budget Cutting

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
With the nation's new emphasis on cutting taxes and curbing government spending, governors and legislatures are reducing the budgets of state university systems and, in the process, forcing the most radical reshaping of public higher education since its rapid growth in the 1960's.
Universities are raising tuition and cutting staff, as they did in 1992 and 1993 because of deep, recession-driven budget cuts, but this time they are also reducing the requirements for a degree, closing entire departments and adding financial penalties for students taking courses beyond those needed for graduation. 
 Among the publicly supported four-year colleges, the State University of New York would increase tuition, now about $2,500 a year, by as much as $1,800. The City University of New York, which is principally supported by the city, would raise tuition, also roughly $2,500, by $1,000.
California, which now charges about $4,000 for the University of California, and $1,500 for the California State University system, would raise its tuition by 10 percent. Additionallly North Carolina plans hundreds of layoffs; Florida is encouraging students to declare their major freshman year so that they are guaranteed their required courses, and several states are considering a plan to penalize part-time students, many of whom work, by charging full tuition.
"We're living through the biggest change in the financing of public higher education since the rapid expansion in the late 1960's," said Terry W. Hartle, vice president of the American Council on Education, the Washington-based association of colleges and universities.
"I worry about what's happening," he continued, "because when college tuition goes up, enrollment among low- and middle-income students falls, and for those students a very important form of social and economic opportunity disappears."
For their part, university officials are trying to prevent tuition increases by encouraging students to complete their degrees efficiently and move on. Less than half of students nationwide finish in four years.
Kevin P. Reilly, the associate provost for academic programs at the State University of New York system, said: "Time creep -- students staying longer and longer in college -- is not only unhealthy for us but for students who now graduate with higher and higher debt burdens. We don't want to create knowledge factories where you get in and get out as fast as possible, but we think more colleges should make it more possible for more students to accelerate through their degree programs."
The proposed cuts are unusually severe in New York, where Gov. George E. Pataki proposes eliminating nearly half a billion dollars, or 12.6 percent, from New York's public colleges and universities. The heads of the State University and City University systems, as part of their lobbying for a restoration of funds from the State Legislature, have predicted faculty layoffs and tuition increases of $1,000 to $1,800 a year.
Tuition, plus fees, room and board, is now about $9,500 for in-state resident students at SUNY. CUNY, with very few students in dormitories, charges $2,450 for tuition and fees at senior colleges. Out-of-state students pay about $5,000 at CUNY for tuition and fees and about $11,500 at SUNY for tuition, fees, room and board.
More moderate -- and more typical -- is a proposal by Gov. James B. Hunt of North Carolina to increase tuition by 3 percent and to lay off 325 to 375 administrators to save $15 million. But such modest cuts -- or even slight increases -- mask the long-term erosion in financing for many state-supported institutions.
"This is not as heavy a cut as the one in 1990, but heavier than the last two cuts, and that makes it very significant," said Marvin K. Dorman Jr., state budget officer of North Carolina.
In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has proposed a 1 percent increase in support for state colleges and universities. Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said he "welcomed the turnaround," but that it went nowhere near replacing a cumulative cut of $11 million, or more than 25 percent of state aid, over the last six years. As a result, he said, Ramapo was forced to eliminate four degree programs and withdraw from intercollegiate football.
In California, where today's tax revolt was foreshadowed with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, the state subsidy for higher education has gone from deep cuts in the late 1970's to full recovery in the boom years of the 1980's. But during the last five years, the University of California's subsidy has been reduced by 25.5 percent and that of the California State University system by 21.3 percent.
The result, according to a new study by the Harvard University higher-education expert, David W. Breneman, leaves the California system in a state of emergency and ill prepared to meet an expected enrollment surge of nearly half a million students over the next decade.
Last month, Gov. Pete Wilson called for a 2 percent increase in the university budgets -- not enough to meet the governing Board of Regents' recommendation to increase badly eroded faculty salaries nor enough to keep pace with inflation. He has called for a 10 percent tuition increase, to come before the board in July, that would add at least $400 per year to the roughly $9,500 overall costs students at the University of California now pay.
Further enrollment declines are projected. In the five years between 1988 and 1993 when tuition rose steeply, the percentage of high school graduates who went on to the University of California or the California State University system fell from 15.3 percent to 14.6 percent.
 
Proposed Changes Bring Opposition
Because many of the proposed cuts are new, intense lobbying efforts, by local groups as well as the Washington-based American Council on Education, are still in the planning stages. Nevertheless, students and faculty around the country have already begun fighting the proposed cuts.
Last week, after a well-organized student demonstration in San Diego, the Board of Regents deferred approval of the tuition increase. A similar student protest rally is planned for Albany on Monday.
The University of Vermont, which has long been the highest priced state system, charges overall costs of $11,166 for state residents; Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island are just under $10,000, and Maine and New Hampshire are about $8,500. The national average, including room and board, is about $7,500, with Florida at the low end, charging about $6,500.
 
Some Institutions Will Suffer Less
In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland proposed a $6.4 million, or 1.7 percent, cut in the state's $381 million subsidy. Educational leaders say they hope the cut can be absorbed without a tuition hike.
Some public institutions are likely to suffer less than others because they have developed such high endowments and sources of private donations that they are commonly referred to as "state-assisted" rather than state-supported institutions. The University of Virginia, for example, receives only 13 percent of its $903 million budget from the state.
On the other hand, the City University of New York, the largest urban university in the nation, whose students are mostly drawn from low- and lower-middle-income families, has not been able to attract substantial outside income. About 67 percent of CUNY's $1.25 billion budget comes from the city and state. As a result, W. Ann Reynolds, the chancellor of CUNY, told legislators in Albany, the proposed cuts "jeopardize the very notion of access."
Educational leaders at public institutions have responded with steps like faculty reduction by attrition, administrative cutbacks and increasing faculty workload. One of the most talked about of these plans is the effort to increase what educators call "productivity": raising the number of students they educate with the same or a lower subsidy.
The University of North Carolina has imposed a surcharge on courses above 140 credit hours; only 120 hours are required for graduation. Texas and Oregon are discussing the same thing. Montana is charging the steeper nonresident tuition to all students on courses above 170 credit hours. And Colorado is considering a plan to eliminate the state subsidy entirely for students who have taken more than 140 credit hours.
The result of the surcharges, educators say, will be restrictions on the freedom of students to explore diverse fields of knowledge.
Benjeil Edghill, a biology major at the University of North Carolina's Chapel Hill campus, said he feared that the new surcharge would prevent him from pursuing art appreciation, literature and Arabic studies. "I thought college was where you go to obtain as much knowledge as possible, but now I'm not so sure," he said.
Not a few educators argue that the emphasis on productivity is wrong-headed. Sandi Cooper, a professor of history and chairwoman of the University Faculty Senate at the City University of New York, said, "To expect qualitative results measured by quantitative, bottom-line standards is a contradiction in terms."
Some state officials, struggling against the swift currents of the tax revolt, respond testily to such gripes. Anne Barnes, chairwoman of the Educational Oversight Committee of the North Carolina House of Representatives, reflected this attitude when she said, "We saw a pronounced pattern of students hanging around longer and longer to complete their undergraduate degrees, and so we said if you're going to do that you have to pay for it."
 
Pressures On Colleges
Several trends have combined to put pressure on colleges to move students in and out faster. For one thing, the student population is burgeoning. As children of the baby-boomers reach college age, 17 states will see the number of students soar by at least 20 percent over the next decade, according to a recent study by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.
Further, because today's college students are much more likely than their predecessors to hold jobs, have families or need remedial work, they are staying in college longer -- only 43 percent of 1990 graduates received degrees in four years or less, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a research branch of the Federal Department of Education.
Cheryl D. Blanco, education policy director at the Florida Postsecondary Education Planning Commission, surveyed productivity plans under consideration at state-supported institutions throughout the country last month and concluded that one of the most popular is the so-called block tuition plan.
Under block tuition, students would be charged a set fee for taking 12 to 18 credit hours a semester. (The usual load is 15.) If they took less than 12 credits, however, they would be charged a significantly higher fee. Some educators object to the plan, arguing that it unfairly penalizes students who have other demands on their time.
Dr. Blanco said the alternative was a state-imposed financing cut. "While we don't like to deny students the opportunity to shop around with courses -- which is one of the strengths of higher education in this country -- we would rather figure out how to meet the challenge ourselves rather than have it forced upon us by legislative mandate."

HEADLINE: Argentina's Pressured Press

 BODY:
Argentina has only recently emerged from a long spell of abusive government that left its economy in ruins and democratic political culture paralyzed by fear and cynicism. President Carlos Menem, seeking re-election this year, deserves much of the credit for Argentina's economic recovery, particularly steps that have tamed inflation and attracted foreign investment. But he has been less consistent in his commitment to democratic recovery. Now he is sponsoring new libel laws that threaten press freedom.
In the past few years a revitalized judiciary and press have helped expose the kind of government corruption that used to go unchecked. Such public scrutiny is essential to establishing democratic accountability and discouraging abuses of public trust. But Mr. Menem has not appreciated the role played by the judiciary and press and has repeatedly tried to compromise their independence. 
 Last month he submitted three bills to the congress clearly meant to bring the press to heel. Two of these would sharply hike penalties for libel, requiring news organizations to purchase expensive libel insurance.
In the United States, courts have protected press freedom against libel claims by requiring a show of deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth. Argentina's proposed laws contain no such protections, and editors reasonably fear they would stifle serious investigative journalism.
Mr. Menem could burnish his credentials as a democrat by withdrawing these dangerous and offensive bills. Failing that, Argentina's congress should vote them down.

HEADLINE: Shrinking Menus: G.O.P. Lunch Plan

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
CONGRESS has taken the first steps to repeal the National School Lunch Act, which has fed hundreds of millions of hungry children since 1946. The changes being proposed could affect the lunch choices of every child in every public school, regardless of income.
Many schools may simply get out of the business of offering school lunches. Or if they continue, they may raise prices for many students. For the poorest children, the changes could mean an end to the free meals, including breakfast, that have been linked to improved academic performance. 
 The House Economic and Education Opportunities Committee is expected to finish working today on a bill that would turn the school lunch and breakfast programs over to the states and reduce the amount of Federal financing.
The current bill from the committee's Republican chairman, Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, is a modification of legislation that had been offered by the House leadership.
"The Congress is taking a huge gamble with a program that has a proven record of success for almost 50 years now," said Marshall Matz, the legislative counsel to the American School Food Service Association, which represents food-service employees across the country. "No one has ever testified that this program doesn't work. This is one of the first implementations of the Republican Contract With America that really changes a Government program we've all grown up with."
"This was not a Roosevelt-Lyndon Johnson program," he added. "It was signed by Harry Truman because so many guys failed their physicals during World War II, and it was expanded by Richard Nixon."
Kelly Presta, a spokesman for the House committee, said the goal of the change was to make the program more efficient and to reduce administrative costs in Washington.
Ninety-five percent of all schools participate in the federally financed lunch program, which feeds 25 million children each day; more than half the children get a free lunch or pay just 40 cents. During 1991-92, the last year for which data are available, the rest paid, on average, about $ 1.15. Most of the almost six million children who eat school breakfasts receive either free or reduced-price meals. Meals for all children, including those who pay full price, are subsidized by the Federal Government.
Under the proposal, poor children would no longer be guaranteed free lunch or breakfast, and Federal nutrition standards for the meals would be replaced by state standards. In addition, the programs would no longer get extra money if they had to provide additional free meals because of a local recession.
The draft legislation would give the states block grants, and at least 80 percent of that money would have to be used to provide "free or low-cost meals or supplements to economically disadvantaged children.
"There is no requirement in this bill we can find for free lunch or free breakfast," said Ellen Haas, Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services. Mr. Presta, the committee spokesman, said that the grants would have to be used for poor children, but he would not specifically say that free lunches would continue.
The remaining 20 percent of the block grant could be used for other programs unrelated to school lunches or breakfasts, further reducing the money available to schools for meals.
The legislation calls for freezing the 1996 budget at the 1995 level. The block grants for 1996 are $ 300 million less than the Administration's proposed budget, which considered higher food costs and greater participation. Over five years, there would be a $ 2 billion decrease in funds.
If a state chose not to subsidize meals for children who pay full price, it would have to raise prices, which would probably mean schools would drop out of the program, because participation would drop. Every time the cost of meals goes up by 1 cent, participation drops by 1 percent. When the budget for school meal programs was slashed during the Reagan Administration, participation dropped to 23 million students, from 26 million students, and more than 2,000 schools dropped out. School officials say that because of certain fixed costs, they cannot reduce expenses in proportion to the income lost when students drop out.
Patty Morris, executive assistant to Ms. Haas, said states would be able to do what they chose, nutritionally. "What you will probably see is all the fast-food chains serving school lunches because it's easier and it's cheaper."
The current program must adhere to standards set by the National Academy of Science, which require that children get one-third of the Recommended Daily Allowances for certain vitamins and minerals. New standards were to take effect next year requiring school lunches to adhere to United States Dietary Guidelines that set limits for fat.
"With 50 different states setting 50 different standards, from historical experience we know some states will want to economize," Ms. Haas said. "That's what happened when the food-stamp programs were run by the states."
What has physicians, antihunger advocates and directors of food-service programs so concerned is the potential impact a greatly reduced and nutritionally inadequate school-meal program could have on the health of the poorest children.
Studies have demonstrated the benefits of school feeding programs. In 1987, researchers at Boston and Tufts universities looked at achievement test results of children for a year before and a year after the breakfast program began. The program was credited with causing significant improvements in attendance and standardized achievement test scores.
Dr. Larry Brown, director of the Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy at Tufts University, said the budget cuts and the block grants were coming at a time when "researchers have learned that the young child is even more susceptible to mild undernutrition than science previously knew."
"If more poor children don't get school lunch and school breakfast, which is inevitable, we are cutting off our nose to spite our face," he said.
Dr. T. Barry Brazelton, the pediatrician, was also gloomy. "You'd hope that states would take responsibility about nutrition, but our experience in the past is that the states with the largest group of people in poverty and the highest risk people are the states that are more whimsical about how they use their nutrition programs."
The final House bill is not expected to differ substantially from the bill being worked on today. The chance to make some changes may come in the Senate with Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, who has been a strong advocate of Federal nutrition programs for the last 30 years.
So was President Nixon, who said in 1969: "A child ill fed is dulled in curiosity, lower in stamina, distracted from learning."

HEADLINE: Income Gap Persists for Blacks and Whites

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Despite public policies intended to forge a measure of economic equality between races, little progress has been made in recent years in narrowing the income gap between whites and blacks, according to two reports issued by the Census Bureau today.
The reports said that in 1993 the median income for black men employed full time was $23,020, about three-quarters of the $31,090 that white men, a proportional disparity that improved only slightly since 1979. 
 Among women, a narrower income gap between blacks and whites widened slightly in the same 14 years, the reports said. In 1979, the median income for black women was about 92 percent of white women's; in 1993, the last year for which the Census bureau had complete data, the median income for black women, $19,820, was 90 percent of the $22,020 earned by white women.
Some blacks seized on the income gaps as evidence of continuing discrimination and the need to maintain affirmative-action programs, which are under increasing attack in the new Republican-controlled Congress and elsewhere.
"It has a made a critical difference," said Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a policy research institution specializing in issues related to African Americans.
In light of data showing that the income gap between whites and blacks had not significantly improved, Mr. Williams said, "Do we continue to need some effort on the part of government to address disparities which are, in part, based on racial discrimination?"
But while the census buttressed the arguments of those who favor maintaining preference programs based on sex or race, it also offered evidence of why some white men contend they are getting a smaller slice of the economic pie.
According to the report, the median income for men dropped from 1979 and 1993, adjusted for inflation, while the figure for women increased during the same period. White men experienced the largest drop in income, about 10 percent, while the median income for black men dropped about 8 percent.
In contrast, while still lagging behind white men, the median income for white women rose by 10 percent, and by 8 per cent for black women.
Income disparities aside, the two reports -- "The Black Population in the United States: March 1994 and 1993" and "Characteristics of the Black Population" -- include some surprisingly upbeat findings on the state of African Americans, who often are defined by their problems.
For example, the data showed that 28 percent of college-educated black men who worked full time in 1993 held executive, administrative or managerial jobs, nearly identical to the 30 percent of white men in that same category.
The reports also indicated that the high school dropout rate among blacks had improved, to about 5 percent in 1993, nearly identical to the white rate of 4 percent.
In contrast to many reports indicating widespread out-of-wedlock births among blacks, the report said 90 per cent of black girls from the ages of 15 to 17 were childless, and that 76 per cent of those aged 18 and 19 had no children.
Indeed, the rate of babies being born to unwed black teen-agers -- about 80 per 1,000 unmarried teen-agers -- remained virtually the same from 1970 through 1990, the report said. Consequently, what had been described as the sharp increase in the number of black children born out of wedlock resulted less from an increase in the percentage of single women giving birth and more from declining birth rates among black married couples, said the chief of the Racial Statistics Branch of the Census Bureau, Roderick Harrison.
Moreover, said Margaret C. Simms, director of Research Programs at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, the data also indicate that, contrary to the image of a population locked into welfare dependency, more than three-fourths of single black mothers held jobs.
"The data present a fuller picture of the African-American population," Ms. Simms said, "one that shows them, for the most part, in the mainstream of American society -- large numbers working, young people doing the right thing, in school, completing school, not having children. So it reflects a portrait that looks like a group trying to achieve the American dream, just like other portions of American society."

HEADLINE: Mexico Said to Promise Some Political Steps to Get U.S. Loans

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Despite the insistence of Mexico that it would not accept any political conditions on $20 billion it is to receive in loans and loan guarantees from Washington, officials said today that it did agree to sweeten the deal with new measures to control undocumented immigration into the United States and drug trafficking.
Mindful of the sensitivity of Mexico to the notion that it acted under American pressure, United States officials noted that its commitments grew out of discussions begun before the loan talks and reflected longstanding concerns of President Ernesto Zedillo. 
 But the Americans also acknowledged having pressed Mexico for quick results -- first to avoid more stringent political conditions on a $40 billion plan that the Administration ultimately abandoned, then to try to mollify Congressional opposition to the $20 billion agreement signed on Tuesday.
"There was clearly a commitment by the Mexicans before the financial crisis to work in these areas," one American official said. "But we've definitely made an effort to get some of these things more quickly and in writing."
In at least some areas, Mexico's promises appeared to be neither binding nor particularly specific. For instance, while the Zedillo Government pledged to crack down on the leaders of a notorious cocaine-smuggling organization, the so-called Gulf Cartel, American officials said their private agreement included few details about how Mexico would do so.
Still, the accords were focused deliberately on some of the most contentious issues on the bilateral agenda. And officials said the Administration had already begun presenting them to legislators who have complained for weeks that the United States was getting little in return for its sizable efforts to rescue Mexico's economy.
"There's a lot of politics involved," the United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, said in an interview today. "A lot of U.S. congressmen wanted to claim credit for forcing Mexicans to do things that they didn't want to do. I always felt that if you put these things into a package, it would undermine what we are trying to do."
Under draft legislation proposed last month by the House Banking Committee, part of the package called for Mexico to halt the debt-for-equity swaps under which the Government has forgiven hundreds of millions of dollars in Cuban debt in exchange for equity given to Mexican investors in Cuba, said officials who saw the draft.
A senior Mexican official said such conditions were rejected as "totally impossible."
Yet the accords that were finally reached appear to overlap closely with proposals that the State Department made to Mexico as part of a side letter that was intended to keep political conditions out of the loan-guarantee legislation itself.
Steps that Mexico agreed to take on undocumented immigrants included new measures to break up immigrant-smuggling rings, the expansion of a border anti-crime force and a promise to shut down a network of water tunnels in Nogales that are often used for smuggling immigrants.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS BEGIN DEEP BUDGET CUTS IN 5 HOUSE PANELS

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
 Setting the tone for promised reductions in the Federal budget, House Republicans today began moving on the first of up to $15 billion in cuts to the current budget, marking for elimination many social programs championed by Democrats for decades.
Calling the action a first installment on their promise to balance the budget by 2002, Republicans approved cuts in job training and education, assistance to homeless youths and veterans, foreign aid to Russian republics, money for United Nations peacekeeping operations and Federal subsidies to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
 If they stand, the cuts approved by five subcommittees today -- and those to be made by eight other panels in the next few days -- will eliminate many of the social programs that conservatives have criticized as wasteful and redundant.
But the Democrats, with President Clinton in the forefront, have already begun to fight back, and many of the midyear cuts in the 1995 fiscal year budget are expected to run into resistance in the Senate, which will not take them up until the House has completed its work.
After a strategy session with Democrats on Capitol Hill today, Mr. Clinton emerged to lambaste the Republicans for a proposal to replace the Federal school lunch program in the budget for the 1996 fiscal year with block grants to the states, calling it "a terrible mistake."
The most influential of the subcommittees -- Labor, Health, Human Services and Education -- proposed cutting $4.3 billion, affecting 142 programs, including 84 that were marked for elimination.
Among them were dozens of youth-training and education programs, like the Clinton Administration's Goals 2000, which sets national standards for secondary education. The Republicans would also reduce the $3.5 billion Head Start program by $105 million, eliminate $1.3 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program that provides fuel oil to the needy and would mark for termination a host of grants, like the National Science Scholars ($4.4 million) and the Javits Fellowships ($7.5 million).
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's $285.6 million budget was not marked for cuts this year, but in 1996 its budget would be cut by 15 percent, or $47 million, with an additional $94 million, or 30 percent of its current budget, pared in 1997. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said, "It represents the first whack in what the Speaker has said will be the total elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."
The Republicans' spending plans for this year would sharply alter some foreign-aid policies. They would cut $47.7 million of a promised $850 million in assistance to the independent states of the former Soviet Union, and $4.5 million of the $75 million that the United States had pledged to contribute this year to United Nations peacekeeping operations. A last-minute appeal from the White House preserved intact aid to Egypt and Jordan.
Also facing elimination are the drug-free schools program ($481.9 million), an education program for homeless youth ($28.8 million), job training for homeless veterans ($5 million), and a program to provide high-school equivalency diplomas to migrants ($8.1 million), as well as a college assistance for migrants ($2.2 million).
"There's too much money and too much personnel to administer -- we have to cut something," said Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois, chairman of the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education subcommittee, noting that his panel had 163 Federal job-training programs and 240 education programs under its jurisdiction alone.
The cuts, known as rescissions, are part of a midyear review that is a common occurrence on Capitol Hill. But the Republicans' proposed cuts, which could total $15 billion, are more sweeping than usual -- President Clinton proposed only $1.1 billion -- and are designed to give the Republicans both fiscal and political mileage.
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, called the proposed cuts "monumental." He said that the rescissions would have to be large enough to pay for all the supplemental appropriations requested by the White House, to cover the cost of the Republicans' proposed $500 per child tax credit and to provide a down payment toward the Republicans' goal of balancing the budget by 2002.
"The total rescission bill will amount to $10 to $15 billion," Mr. Livingston said.
With majorities in both the House and the Senate, the Republicans think they can get the cuts through Congress. But President Clinton could veto them, and the Republicans would then need significant help from Democrats to achieve the two-thirds majority -- 290 votes in the House and 67 votes in the Senate -- to override a veto.
Led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Republicans held a flag-festooned gathering on Capitol Hill today to mark the midpoint of their 100-day pledge to act on the provisions of their Contract With America.
There were rock and roll music, tiny American flags and copies of the Contract for everyone in the audience. Business representatives and crime victims also appeared, to offer testimonials about the strides made so far in what its adherents regard as a Republican revolution.
Democrats observed the day with the sort of oratorical bashing that has become their prime weapon against the Republicans. "Halfway to nowhere is still nowhere," the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said the day represented. "The fact is, the Contract With America does absolutely nothing to address the problems most Americans face in their daily lives -- good jobs, affordable health care, access to quality education, and a rising standard of living."
The five subcommittees of the Republican-controlled House Appropriations Committee that reported rescission bills today were Agriculture; Energy and Water Development; Foreign Operations; Interior; and Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. Mr. Livingston said that five more subcommittees would reports on Thursday and the remaining three would complete their work by next week.
About half the spending cuts proposed today, including those for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, were outlined by the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education subcommittee. The panel met late into the nigh, with Democrats offering dozens of amendments to try to save programs from cuts, and Republicans systematically voting them down.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives $285.6 million of its annual $1.8 billion budget from Washington. By Federal budget standards, it is a small amount of money. But in political terms, it has long been one of the biggest targets of conservatives, who have accused the corporation's leaders of using the money to promote a liberal agenda and programming with a liberal bias.
The corporation was created by Congress in 1967.
 The Republicans proposed dropping $191.6 million from programs that fell under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Operations subcommittee, including $152.6 million from the $5 billion budget for economic aid distributed by the Agency for International Development. They also outlined millions of dollars in cuts to dozens of domestic programs -- many of them agricultural and others involving regional authorities -- that have long been popular pork-barrel items for members on both sides of the aisle.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Faces Issue of Economic Spying

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
It was so much easier during the cold war.
Once, the Central Intelligence Agency's station in Paris stole secrets about the French nuclear arsenal and the local Communist Party chief. Now it is trying to steal the French position on trade talks with the United States. 
 As the balance of terror becomes less important and the balance of payments more so, the intelligence agency has struggled with the question of economic espionage. Are the risks, amply demonstrated by the embarrassing request by France that the C.I.A.'s former station chief in Paris and at least four of his undercover officers leave the country, worth the rewards? Should it be done at all?
"That is the real crisis of American intelligence -- what is the clandestine service supposed to be doing these days?" said Thomas Polgar, a retired C.I.A. officer and former station chief in Bonn and Saigon.
"In the good old days, when the Soviet Union was a going concern, learning the intentions and capabilities of the enemy had a potential impact on the national security of the United States," Mr. Polgar said. "The question of whether or not the French allow fewer Disney movies into their country does not affect the national security of the United States."
France's position on the import of American movies and other "cultural goods" nearly derailed the final talks last year on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The orders to the intelligence agency's Paris station to steal economic data from the French and the entrapment of the agency's officers by French counterintelligence reflect the fact that the C.I.A. thinks that the risks of stealing trade secrets are worth the potential payoff.
"The agency for last five years or so has been wrestling with the question of whether it has a role in support of American industry," said E. Norbert Garrett, a former C.I.A. station chief and a managing director at Kroll Associates, a leading international risk management company.
"It may sound crazy, using an intelligence apparatus to find out the French position on how many American movies we can import," he said. "But if it was of sufficient importance to the American side in the trade negotiations, you could make a case that there's a role."
The United States has many ways to steal information from foreign countries, including spy satellites and electronic eavesdropping, but the officers of the clandestine service of the C.I.A. contend that only they can obtain certain secrets.
The agency has boasted to Congressional intelligence committees for the last two years that it is able to obtain scoops on trade talks, diplomatic negotiations and foreign nations' compliance with their obligations under treaties.
But if only the C.I.A.'s spies can steal these secrets, they are also the only ones who can get into real trouble.
"When you engage in espionage, you engage in activity that is completely illegal," Mr. Polgar said. "You are engaged in a conspiracy to commit a crime. Whatever the target was in this case, it had to be worth a lot to take that kind of risk, although I imagine that you could get the French position on GATT without spying on them."
Allies spy on allies all the time. After Japan, France ranks among the allies and economic competitors that attract the most scrutiny from the C.I.A.
For instance, France's state-owned telecommunications giant has aggressively pursued contracts to build advanced telephone networks in developing countries. United States officials contend that unlike American competitors, which have to weigh profits and losses carefully, the French company will grab for everything it can, knowing that the Government can absorb losses.
American officials also maintain that the French are willing to bribe foreign officials -- and in fact tried to last year when bidding against an American consortium to develop a satellite surveillance system for the Amazon basin. The United States won the bid, but only after exercising political pressure.
The question is whether any of these issues rise to a question of national security, or indeed whether the C.I.A. is equipped to handle them, Mr. Polgar said.
"Maybe there are economic issues that are important," he said. "But the question that is unanswered is, what can the C.I.A. do about them that the rest of the American Government cannot?"

HEADLINE: Democrats Assail G.O.P. Bill to Change School Lunch System

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
With President Clinton in the vanguard, Democrats today began a campaign of guerrilla warfare against House Republican proposals to scrap the Federal school lunch program and give states a lump sum of Federal money to feed children.
"An old conservative adage used to be, 'If it ain't broke don't fix it,' " Mr. Clinton said after a strategy session with Democrats in Congress. 
 Republicans appeared to have the votes needed to approve the legislation in the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, which is responsible for the child nutrition programs, including school lunch. But Democrats predicted that the Senate would not approve it and said that the President would veto it if it did.
Although he did not go quite that far, Mr. Clinton said it would be "a terrible mistake" to end the program. He added: "Here's a program that isn't broke, that's done a world of good for millions and millions of children of all races and backgrounds all across our country, and I think it would be a terrible mistake to put an end to it, to gut it, to undermine it. And I hope that my party will stand against this."
Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the committee, said he had hoped that the panel would vote today to approve the bill, a keystone of the House Republicans' legislative agenda for the first 100 days of the new Congress.
Although he is a longtime defender of the school lunch program, Mr. Goodling said he was under a mandate from House Republican leaders to change the school lunch program. These changes, he said, will not destroy the program, but will improve it "by cutting out layers of regulations and paperwork, and by allowing states far more flexibility."
The bill would not only cut the amount of money that states get now, but would also give states vast new discretion to design their own food programs in place of the school lunch program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. The two programs serve more than 30 million people.
Under the Republican proposal, money for these and other nutrition programs would be consolidated in two lump sum payments, or block grants, providing states with a maximum of $11.3 billion next year. Democrats asserted that the bill would cut $7 billion, or 10 percent, from the amount that would otherwise be spent on such assistance over the next five years.
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative William L. Clay of Missouri, said the changes "will potentially starve hundreds of thousands of children and imperil the health of their mothers."
Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat, said there was no guarantee that in the future Congress would appropriate the full amounts allowed by the bill or provide any extra money in times of recession.
"These programs took years and years to create," Mr. Owens said. "Now this committee will, in a barbaric way, wipe it all out."
Representative Tim Roemer, Democrat of Indiana, said it was virtually certain that Congress would provide less than the authorized amounts if the Constitution is amended to required a balanced Federal budget. Moreover, he noted, the bill would allow states to use up to 20 percent of their food assistance money for other purposes like welfare, child care and social services.
The Democrats said there was abundant evidence that the school lunch and WIC programs were achieving the purposes for which they were created, to improve the health and nutrition of children and pregnant women. Democrats said the Republicans had cut a political deal with Republican governors, ignoring the needs of poor people.
Farm groups, including the National Milk Producers Federation and the Sun Diamond Growers of California, which sells fruit and nuts, said they objected to the block grant proposal. They like the current school lunch program, in part because the Government buys surplus commodities, keeping prices higher than they would otherwise be.
Republicans said governors wanted the authority to design welfare and food assistance programs to meet local needs. But Sheri E. Steisel, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said: "We have never suggested a block grant for nutrition programs. We have never asked for consolidation of the school lunch and WIC programs in a block grant."

HEADLINE: House Moves to Kill A Penn Station Plan

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The House voted today to take back $40 million that had been set aside to rebuild Penn Station in New York City, a cut that would effectively kill the $315 million project if it is not restored in the Senate.
The action was part of an effort to finance $3.2 billion in military programs by pulling back on money appropriated for other uses last year, taking $1.5 billion from within the military budget and $1.4 billion from other programs. 
 But some New Yorkers in Congress said the 262-165 vote was a slap to New York, which under the bill would also lose money intended for a technological reinvestment programs that would have helped ailing Long Island defense firms transform their operations.
In addition, New York would lose money for job training programs for young people and for school improvement construction, an area considered especially important since a recent General Accounting Office report on conditions in schools found New York State had a pressing need to rebuild schools.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat who represents parts of Westchester County, the Bronx and Queens, spoke in support of the Penn Station project on the House floor, saying, "There is no good reason why this project was singled out for the budget ax, except for the fact that New York bashing is always in season."
She said Penn Station is important to the regional economy because 75 million people pass through the station every year. It is Amtrak's busiest station and the hub of the city's transit system, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit.
Some New York Republicans in the House, including Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, said they would like to support the Penn Station project but think that insuring military readiness is more important.
Now, the fight will move to the Senate, where the Penn Station project has bipartisan support from Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato. The project is to receive $100 million from the Federal Government, $100 million from the city and state, and $115 million from Amtrak bonds and private investors. A total of $10 million in Federal money has already been spent.
The project is intended to transform Penn Station into a commercial as well as transportation hub along the lines of Union Station in Washington.
"This fight is not over," said William T. Cunningham, Senator Moynihan's chief of staff. "This is not at the expense of our servicemen and women. It was appropriated last year for a very worthwhile project. This station will hit gridlock in six years if nothing is done, and you could get a world-class station, a facility worthy of the region."
"It is not just about New York City," he said.

HEADLINE: Congress Presses Russia, And Clinton, Over Iran Deal

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Administration is struggling to resolve differences with Russia while leading Republicans threaten to withhold aid unless Moscow cancels a nuclear energy deal with Iran.
In recent days, a number of Republicans in Congress have said that Russia's $1 billion deal to build four nuclear reactors would speed Iran's quest for nuclear weapons and that they were prepared to use aid as a weapon to stop it. 
 The move reflects a growing sentiment in Congress that the Administration has been too solicitous of President Boris N. Yeltsin and too tolerant of uncooperative behavior by Russia on other issues as well, including its continued military siege of Chechnya, its failure to give a full accounting of its arms sales to Iran and its uneven efforts at political and economic reform.
But clearly the most contentious issue -- and the one likely to evoke the greatest response in Congress and among Americans -- is Russia's nuclear energy deal with Iran.
"I would like the message to be very clear: this deal threatens Russian aid, period," Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for foreign aid, said in an interview.
Mr. McConnell, who has charged that the Administration became "cheerleaders" for Mr. Yeltsin, added: "This is not the kind of behavior we expect of a country that purports to be an ally and aid recipient. This thing could really be a deal-breaker."
On Tuesday the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, issued a similar threat to "cut off all aid to Russia" if reports of its nuclear energy deal with Iran were true. "We cannot tolerate Iran getting weapons of mass destruction," Mr. Gingrich said in an interview with The Washington Times.
Even some Democrats who have staunchly supported aid to Russia predict that the nuclear deal could lead Congress to slash the $269 million aid request for next year.
"The political reality is that aid may well be cut off because of inexplicably stupid moves on the part of Russia," Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in an interview. "The Russians could try the patience of a saint."
For more than a year, the Administration has asked Russia repeatedly -- and to no avail -- not to complete plans to sell Iran nuclear power plants. The issue took on new urgency on Monday when Russia's Nuclear Energy Minister said that the deal had been concluded and that about 150 Russians were already working on a reactor site at Bushehr on the Persian Gulf.
The Administration has also failed to persuade Russia's leaders to end the offensive in Chechnya.
In addition, senior State Department officials are unhappy with a trip to Belgrade last weekend by the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, during which he advised the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, to demand that international sanctions be lifted before he made any concessions.
Finally, Mr. Yeltsin has given the United States an incomplete accounting of Russia's current conventional arms deals with Iran, contrary to a pledge he made to Mr. Clinton at a summit in Washington in September. Russia's refusal to halt its arms sales to Iran are delaying the an international treaty aimed at stemming the spread of weapons and arms-related equipment and technology to potentially dangerous nations.
The Administration finds itself in the awkward situation of defending aid to Russia even as Moscow is ignoring American protests.
In the first of two days of meetings today with Georgi Mamedov, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, the Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, focused less on the problem areas and more on the issue of the expansion of NATO, a senior Administration official said.
Despite tensions, the United States is eager to create a special relationship between NATO and Russia, including a high-level Washington-Moscow dialogue, senior Administration officials said.
In a subsequent meeting today with Mr. Mamedov, Lynn Davis, the Under Secretary of State for arms control, stressed the importance of canceling the Iran nuclear deal.
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry made the same point in a meeting on Tuesday with Russia's First Deputy Defense Minister, Andrei A. Kokoshin, explaining that the matter was urgent because of the Republican-dominated Congress.
The Russians have argued that they have every right to sell such technology to Iran, particularly because the United States and its allies have agreed to supply North Korea with nuclear technology free.

HEADLINE: 5 Americans Are Called Spies By France and Told to Leave

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22

 BODY:
 France has accused five Americans, including the former C.I.A. station chief here and his deputy, of political and economic espionage and asked them to leave the country immediately, French officials said today.
The other Americans who were asked to leave were two other C.I.A. agents, who are listed in diplomatic jobs on the roster of the United States Embassy, and a woman working as an undercover C.I.A. agent who lacks diplomatic status, according to an article published today in Le Monde and confirmed by diplomats. 
 The Americans were accused of trying to bribe high-ranking French Government officials into disclosing France's negotiating position on movies and entertainment in recent global trade talks, secrets about French domestic politics, and telecommunications.
The spectacle of one ally publicly demanding the withdrawal of another's diplomats for spying plunged relations between France and the United States into one of the strangest crises of their history.
Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, visited the office of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to discuss the affair this afternoon, American Embassy officials said. She emerged impassive after 30 minutes and said she would make no comment.
In an unusual joint statement, the French Interior Ministry and Foreign Ministry said that the French Government had never intended the affair to become public. But they said the American Embassy had been asked to withdraw the diplomats for activities incompatible with their status here.
The statement did not say how many diplomats were involved, and some French reports said there may have been as many as six.
In Washington, the State Department described the allegations as unjustified and said it was reviewing the incident. It spoke only of the accusations in the French press.
"We regard allegations in the French press, citing French Government sources, concerning purported official U.S. activities, as being unwarranted," a department spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, said.
"The handling of this matter in France is inconsistent with the approach that allies have taken to resolve sensitive matters in the past," she said. "There is no reason for expelling any Americans, nor is the French Government calling for it."
Other State Department officials, saying that the French planned no expulsions, added privately that the American officials would be moved out of France according to their regular rotations.
A spokeswoman at the American Embassy in Paris, asked how many of the four embassy diplomats were still in France, said only, "All of them are working or have worked at the embassy." She gave no further elaboration.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Balladur tried to treat the matter lightly. "The French people are friends of the American people and the French Government is a friend of the American Government," he said. "Events like that occur regularly on both sides of the Atlantic."
But seldom, if ever, have there been such spectacular sparks between allies, according to old C.I.A. hands and diplomats. Many said they could not recall anything to match the incident since the height of the cold war, when Moscow and Washington periodically cleaned out each other's spy networks. This time, the protagonists were officials who presumably dealt with each other regularly on such common threats as international terrorism and organized crime.
A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said tonight that the French Government had fed the spying story to the news media in a background briefing. He speculated that the main aim was to move the spotlight away from a wiretapping scandal that has embarrassed the French Government.
The French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, has been under fire this week for authorizing secret wiretaps, and the stir has set back Prime Minister Balladur's campaign to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in elections this spring.
"We're not speculating, but the issue may be related to Pasqua's political fortunes," the senior Administration official said. "In France, the speculation is exactly that, in relation to the timing and the handling of the incident."
The official said the French Government's background briefing with the news media about the accused spies was "totally unprecedented."
"We're declining to get into the substance of the allegations except to say they're vastly overblown," the official added.
Le Monde also speculated that Mr. Pasqua, who is in charge of the counterespionage service, would not be displeased by a report that distracted attention from the wiretapping scandal.
That friendly countries also spy on each other's economic and business secrets these days is taken for granted. It is also assumed that friendly diplomats occasionally have privately been asked to leave after getting into mischief.
Two years ago, French officials themselves were embarrassed by the disclosure of a 21-page Government document that targeted 21 American aerospace companies for industrial espionage. Yet a scandal of this dimension between allies has few, if any, recent parallels.
The French struck back this time, according to official accounts cited by Le Monde, because the Americans broke the rules of the game -- offering bribes, in 500-franc (equivalent to $100) bills, to at least three high-ranking officials since 1992.
"The clandestine research detected concentrated essentially on French domestic politics as well as on the broad economic and commercial policies of our country, in particular in the audiovisual domain and in telecommunications," according to a counterespionage report quoted by the newspaper.
Among the pieces of evidence gathered by the counterspies, the newspaper reported, were photographs of clandestine meetings between the C.I.A. agents and their French contacts, hotel registration papers and credit card imprints proving the use of false identities by American agents, and the serial numbers of 500-franc bills paid to one of the French officials.
The newspaper's report detailed three approaches made by the Americans. In the first, a woman "acting for the C.I.A. in Paris," approached an unnamed conservative Member of Parliament close to Mr. Balladur's Government.
He informed counterespionage officials of the approach and was told to go along with it to try to trap the Americans, the report said. He was later approached seven times "by a known C.I.A. officer coming from Brussels and operating under false identity," according to the report, and was offered bribes to disclose the French negotiating position on the global trade talks in 1992 and 1993.
France compromised in response to Washington's demands to lower agricultural subsidies worldwide, but only at the last minute, at the end of 1993. The United States agreed to drop its insistence that Europeans stop trying to keep American movies and television programs from flooding their markets, but it demanded on quotas and subsidies for European-produced entertainment.
The second approach, Le Monde said, was to an unnamed high official in the Ministry of Communications who was in charge of audiovisual policy. He, too, was offered bribes, the report said, for information about French strategy on audiovisual policy and on telecommunications. He, too, pretended to cooperate until very recently, the report said.
The third person allegedly recruited by the C.I.A., according to the report, was a technician, also not named, for the international network of France Telecom, the country's telecommunications network.
Until last Jan. 27, the report said, the technician pretended to work with the C.I.A., turning over "documents and technical details on the structures and international networks of France Telecom, in exchange for remuneration and valuable technical materials."
The previous day, Jan. 26, Mrs. Harriman was summoned by the Interior Minister, Mr. Pasqua, to his office. Mr. Pasqua told the American Ambassador what the counterespionage service had discovered, Le Monde said, and asked her to see to it that the five accused Americans left the country immediately.
Mr. Pasqua repeated this demand in a letter sent to Mrs. Harriman on Feb. 1, Le Monde said.
On Feb. 3, according to the newspaper, she replied to Mr. Pasqua that she would report the accusations to Washington. The Interior Minister summoned her again on Feb. 10, according to Le Monde, again asking her to get the accused diplomats out of the country soon.
Mr. Pasqua informed President Mitterrand of the affair on Feb. 18, Le Monde said. The newspaper's publication of the report today immediately replaced the scandal about the Government's authorization of wire taps.

HEADLINE: A Struggle to Deal With a $20 Billion Precedent

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
As the United States and Mexico argued about the last details of a $20 billion rescue plan last week, one of the Clinton Administration's top economic officials fielded the same question time and again in his travels through Brazil and Argentina: If Mexico's ills spread, is the United States prepared to bail out its other big trading partners?
Much like other Administration officials, from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Jeffrey E. Garten, the traveling Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade, hemmed and hawed a bit in response to the question. 
 "Of course, I told them Mexico was a very special case for us," Mr. Garten recalled replying, "because much more was at stake here than just trade. But honestly, no one can answer this question. And if we could you could never signal the answer in advance."
It is an uncomfortable question because it cuts to the heart of the emerging American post-cold-war role in the world. American troops have been stationed in Europe and Asia for decades as the guarantors of territorial security and protectors of United States interests abroad. But in Mexico, the United States has just stationed billions of dollars of capital and an elite unit of financial police, declaring that otherwise hundreds of thousands of American jobs might be lost and a financial panic could spread through emerging markets around the world.
It is compelling if unpopular logic. But it has left many in Washington wondering where to draw the line: What countries are now so vital to the new American economy that they cannot be allowed to fail?
Moreover, doesn't the Mexican bailout send an unwanted message to countries and those who invest in them around the world? Overborrow, overspend and fear not, because in the new international economy, everyone is so interdependent that there is always a bailout around the corner.
Not surprisingly, the message that the Administration is trying to send to the markets these days is a simple one: Don't count on it.
"Mexico was unique," Mr. Rubin said. The reason, of course, is the porous border with the United States. The financial turmoil in Mexico City, the White House kept reminding Congress, would be measured by the number of illegal aliens flowing into California and Texas. And then there are the 700,000 jobs the Administration contends are dependent on exports to Mexico, including 130,000 created in the last year.
Indeed, Mexico has virtually matched Japan as the second-largest market for American exports behind Canada. Through the third quarter of last year, Mexicans bought more than $51 billion in goods from the United States, compared with $51.7 billion by Japanese and $112 billion by Canadians.
Mexico had other special characteristics. More than most other big emerging-market countries like Argentina and China, it has been heavily dependent on short-term financing from abroad. That is the kind of investment that mutual fund managers can redirect with a few clicks on their computer keyboards, calling their money back to the United States or sending it elsewhere.
One lesson of the crisis is that it is safer to follow the example of countries like China and Indonesia, which have depended more heavily on foreign direct investment to build roads, factories and other necessary supports for economic growth. It takes a lot longer to move a car factory out of the country than it takes to get a short-term bond out.
And finally, as Mr. Rubin has said many times, Mexico has been the prototype economy, an exemplar of the way to privatize big industries, open markets and create a growing middle class eager to buy imports. If the prototype failed, he argued, it would discourage countries like Russia or even South Korea from following the same path.
But in one respect, Mexico was hardly special. It was one of the many emerging markets outside the United States, Europe and Japan in which Americans had dived headlong in recent years through mutual funds, lured by projections of huge profits and apparently unconcerned that they had only a vague idea of what made those economies tick.
Mr. Rubin feared that if investors decided to bail out of Mexico, they would bail out of everything that vaguely resembled Mexico in what he termed a "catalytic effect." There are suggestions that he was right. When Mexico's stock market declined, it took much of Latin America with it many days, and it was blamed, rightly or wrongly, for plunges as far away as Poland and Hong Kong.
That could have happened 20 years ago as well, of course. But as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, pointed out in recent testimony, now it can happen so much more quickly. "In today's world," he said, "Mexico became the first casualty, if I may put it that way, of the new international financial system."
Mr. Greenspan is among those warning that the bailout, which he heartily supported, could create what economists call a "moral hazard." That is, investors looking at emerging markets could factor in the prospects of a bailout if everything goes bad. That, in turn, could keep the markets from accurately assessing the risk of investing in, say, Argentina or Indonesia.
As a result, Mr. Greenspan urged that any bailouts must emulate the Mexican rescue and carry such high costs and rigorous terms that investors worry that they would pay a price, as well.
Now the bailout theory has a new wrinkle. Because this one cost the United States so much, there is a new drive to overhaul the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations so that the United States Treasury does not become the World Market-Emergency Fund. Here, too, the fear is that such an overhaul might encourage more countries to live at the edge, knowing that there are bigger institutions around to save their necks.
The issue will be among the key topics at the Group of Seven meeting of leading industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, this summer. But in the meantime, the United States is saying anew that no one should expect to be treated the way the Mexicans were.
"It would be very foolish if we didn't learn from this," Mr. Christopher said last week to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It was fortunate that the President had available $20 billion in a stabilization fund that he could bring to bear on this particular crisis."
But $20 billion does not grow on trees, he noted, and "the United States probably could not handle a second crisis like that."

HEADLINE: Still Married to Christ, and Never Happier;
As Fewer Women Become Nuns, Sisters Say the Calling's Rewards Have Expanded

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
Elaine Roulet smiled back in time at her own sense of girlish idealism as she recalled the white bridal gown of 46 years ago, when she followed the chapel aisle straight toward the perceived will of God.
"It was so exciting, so romantic, to walk down that aisle as a bride of Christ and come back as a nun," said the 63-year-old woman, a Sister of Saint Joseph, stylishly gray now in checked suit and earrings as she survives as one of the toughest and most adaptive in the modern Roman Catholic church's rapidly dwindling ranks of the sisterhood. 
 "You were enshrined in these wonderful robes and had all this mystery about you and felt and even smelled holy," Sister Elaine continued, finally laughing out loud at such innocent conceits as she sat a lifetime later in a Queens ghetto convent depleted of nuns but bursting with the lives of female ex-convicts and their children.
The nun savored a wisp of nostalgia as she conceded having saved some of the veil and wimple pins that once kept her bedecked securely in the perfect black-and-white order of the past. "There was such a purity about it," she said. "It was so uncomplicated, you know?"
"And now it's so complicated, but so much better," she added, happier as a nun than ever before even as she exemplified the bittersweet paradox of the modern sisterhood. Here she is, freelancing amid God's poor in a truly creative spiritual life that seems to be evaporating around her as fewer and fewer young women replenish the ranks.
Once the glory of the striving postwar second-generation wave of immigrants from Catholic Europe, the American church's sisterhood has been halved, to fewer than 100,000 nuns in the last 30 years. And it continues dwindling and aging: 97 percent of nuns are 40 or older and the median age at 65 and rising.
Yet those like Sister Elaine who have remained, prevailing in a continuing period of turmoil, and suffering what many of them consider gross sexism, report they have rarely been happier. The anomaly has been underlined in a study in the Feb. 11 issue of America, the Jesuit magazine, in which 9 out of 10 nuns surveyed registered strong satisfaction with their lives.
They did so even as they showed majority support for various proposals for change that are hardly at hand, including ordained women, married priests, elected bishops and greater tolerance of doctrinal dissent, according to a survey of 1,041 nuns by The Los Angeles Times.
Sister Elaine, the embodiment of the crosscurrents of individual joy and vocational extinction, is puzzled that so few young women are enlisting at a time when her generation is breaking beyond authoritarian walls to find creative peace.
She has been inducted in the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., for originating programs for the growing population of imprisoned mothers. She has built a chain of postprison church sanctuaries, called Providence House, for them and their babies by taking over parish buildings bedimmed since the simpler years of immigrant faith in the city.
"Our changed lives might be the only gospel some people will ever read," she likes to say, relishing the upheaval about her even as she fails as a walking advertisement for the sisterhood.
There were 65 other brides at Sister Elaine's novice ceremony in 1949. But now the order attracts at best one or two newcomers a year.
Its once-grand network of resources is dissolving, with the novitiate in Brentwood, L.I., being used for antipoverty programs.
"This is an unusual way for a group to face its own demise," said Sister Elizabeth Johnson, also of the St. Joseph order, commenting on the richness of the modern nun's life even as it fades. A professor at Fordham University, she was one of the first female theologians permitted to receive a doctorate by the church authorities in the liberalization decrees that capped the Second Vatican Council three decades ago with an often traumatic wave of change.
But in the view of another pioneer nun theologian, Sister Sandra Schneiders, those changes may have helped undo the real anomaly of the modern nunnery, "the false inflation" of vocations from the 1950's and 60's, when tens of thousands of Catholic girls entered the sisterhood.
Sister Sandra is a professor at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, Calif., who finds the novice shrinkage normal, not troubling, in the church's larger historical pattern, in part because so many options beyond the traditional sisterhood have opened for religiously inclined women in a church increasingly short of male clerics.
"To me the present situation is the more normal one," said Sister Sandra, who has spent 40 years as a member of the Immaculate Heart of Mary order of Monroe, Mich. "One reason why it looks disastrous is because we're still thinking of the ministry of religion being the staffing of large enterprises."
Some younger women are church rectors or wives of the new generation of married deacons, jointly involved in executive parish roles. Some are free to be canonical lawyers. One sister, Gloria Garcia, is a civil executive at the United Nations.
"The religious life has always been meant to be countercultural and prophetic," Sister Elizabeth said.
Sister Sandra added, however, that she constantly met gifted young women who seemed perfect for the changing sisterhood, but were repelled by a sense of sexism and "institutional oppression" in the church.
"They'll say, 'I'd love to be a Sister of Mercy, but I don't want to publicly be a Roman Catholic,' " Sister Sandra said. "The only way to change this is to address the oppression."
Sister Elaine, for all her feminist dedication, worries that there will not be enough hands-on nuns when the suffering and the poor cry out for help. "The idea of sisterhood means so much to me, especially when I hear my black women friends talk of being 'sisters,' " she said.
"I pray in the chapel every morning from 4 to 5 with Sister Margaret," Sister Elaine said of her life at the Presentation parish convent in Jamaica, Queens, one of the Providence House sanctuaries where needy women and babies outnumber the few nuns. "I light the candles, and Margaret gets the coffee."
"It's wonderful," she said of the morning routine of a liberated nun -- reading, poetry writing, swimming at a women's club and attendance at Mass before driving to her job running the infants' nursery at the women's prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
But she reminds herself not to neglect the deepest constant in her life as a nun, daily prayer, even if she seems compelled to be ever busier creating programs like a thrift shop or tutoring convict mothers.
"That mystery and romanticism of 1949 is still there for me," she conceded. "That uncomplicated early religious time had a clarity of purpose that stays with me," she said, describing her way of forging new programs based on an idea but no money. "Don't ask, just presume that after prayer, this is what God wants you to do. Refuse to think about all the complications."
Forty-four years ago, Sister Elaine was a young nun at a parochial academy for the wealthy, and she leapt at the chance to switch to what was called "a colored mission" in Brooklyn. "The poor have shaped my life," she said. "I knew right away where I belonged. The prisons have become the permanent housing of the poor."
After Vatican II, life in the convent fractured, with the iron-handed world of a mother superior who yielded to "team government," rapid change and a blur of departures. Sister Elaine jettisoned most traditions except her core religious vows, and a parochial-school passion for gold-paper stars that she still awards herself in her diary for maintaining her prayer regimen.
"I can't help it," she said. "I love ritual, love ringing the little bell in the chapel."
Sister Elaine smiled at her tinkling indulgence at the morning ritual, in which she and Sister Margaret make a near-silent litany of a mystical chant, "Be still and know that I am God."
It has been decades since Vatican II left Sister Elaine to slink off to the public library for a book on basic fashion to learn about makeup and scarves. "All of a sudden the veil was gone," she recounted. "There's something about what you wear -- prisoners in stripes, zoot-suiters with their key chains -- that's very important. The trauma was we didn't know how to dress. It's true that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, but earrings take a while."
A friend, Sister Pat Lucas, recently returned from eight years' frustration as the sisters' specialist in recruiting and encouraging novices. "A lot of us still out working on the margins are white middle-class women who are not attracting newcomers from the cultures and people we're working with," said Sister Pat, a 35-year veteran.
She is happier now in her new job as pastoral assistant at St. Leo's Church in Corona, Queens, one of the newer roles that amid the dearth of priests, offers more executive responsibility to nuns.
"I'm convinced religious life is going to continue to happen, but in a whole new way that can't yet be seen," said Sister Pat. She noted that her order was founded 350 years ago in France by six women in ordinary dress dedicated to just the sort of tangible charity that Sister Elaine pursues, not the extensive parochial-school teaching that American Catholics prized 40 years ago. "Maybe this is a moment of refounding for us; who knows?" she asked.
Sister Elaine said that she hoped so but that she prayed that the traditional identity of the nun would not become lost. "I think people see that for me, not having a family and not having obligations frees you to take on the sufferings of the world," she said as the convent rang with a baby's cry. "And that's not poetic. People know you have that freedom, and it's not a burden. It's just wonderful to be a guest in people's intimate lives."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Plan Is Hardly A Cure-All

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The $20 billion in American aid announced yesterday goes a long way toward resolving Mexico's immediate debt crisis, but by all accounts here it stops well short of addressing other serious problems afflicting the battered Mexican economy, which many economists believe is slipping into a recession despite the rescue.
Over the next four months, Mexican finance officials say they plan to use roughly half the $20 billion loan package signed in Washington to retire most of the outstanding short-term Government bonds that nearly forced Mexico into default. 
 The bonds, called tesobonos, are denominated in pesos but payable according to the exchange rate of the dollar when they mature, and have become far more costly as a result of the peso's devaluation. The Mexican Government wants to reduce their outstanding value from $30 billion two months ago to just $5 billion by the end of this year.
The other $10 billion from the United States will be held for contingencies, the officials say, including bailing out Mexican private banks that run into trouble paying off depositors.
That $20 billion directly from Washington is part of a larger package of assistance that includes $17.8 from the International Monetary Fund, $10 billion from major European nations, $3 billion from commercial banks, and $1 billion each from Canada and a group of South American countries. Mexican officials said some of the short-term money from the I.M.F. would be used to stabilize the peso's exchange rate and to assist the Mexican banks.
To regain control of its economy, Mexico must stabilize its wildly erratic peso -- which has dropped more than 40 percent against the dollar in little more than two months -- by raising interest rates to previously unknown levels and entice investors to hold more assets in pesos. That is part of the medicine prescribed by the United States and the International Monetary Fund.
The risk to Mexico's economy is that such harsh medicine could all but kill the patient, sending Mexico into a period of deep recession and prolonged inflation that would produce an epidemic of unemployment and business failures.
In a clear sign that the Mexican central bank would keep its promise to the United States and the monetary fund and keep interest rates high, the rates on benchmark treasury certificates, called cetes, were allowed to rise today to 59 percent -- the highest level in seven years. The 28-day certificate generally establishes the trend for consumer and business credit rates.
Interest rates had to soar to compensate for Mexican inflation now running above 40 percent on an annual basis, and to reward investors for the risk involved in holding peso assets. The central bank governor, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, has predicted that the high rates will lead to the peso's stabilization in "a matter of a few weeks," after which rates can be gradually lowered to a level the economy can live with.
But analysts and investors already burned by Mexico's peso devaluation on Dec. 20 and 21 seem unconvinced that the Government's recovery plan will work.
"If by 'work,' you mean to help stabilize the currency and bring down inflation in the medium term, then I'd say the chances of working are positive," said Alejandro Hernandez, an economist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. "On the other hand, the plan's impact on economic activity and employment are without a doubt going to be severe."
The degree to which the $20 billion pledged in assistance from the United States addresses only Mexico's debt problems was shown in a lackluster performance today on the Mexican stock exchange and a decline in the peso barely a day after the deal was signed in Washington.
The peso closed at 5.845 to the dollar, down from Tuesday's close of 5.605. Mexican stocks gained a modest 29 points, or 1.73 percent, and ended the day at 1,708.28, reflecting a lukewarm reaction by investors on Mexico's economic future.
In a speech in Mexico City today, President Ernesto Zedillo conceded that because the country's economic problems were worse now than at the beginning of the year, "the effect on every Mexican will be more harmful," and the previous emergency plan he announced on Jan. 3 would have to be adjusted.
Mr. Zedillo responded directly to criticism that by accepting the $20 billion, he had ceded a degree of control over Mexico's finances to the United States. The loan came with strict economic conditions, including a requirement that revenue from the state oil monopoly, Pemex, be channeled through an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"Those who think that in exchange for the financial backing, the economic policy of Mexico has been given to the authorities of another country are mistaken," Mr. Zedillo said.
The Government's emergency stabilization plan of Jan. 3 had been based on a peso exchange rate of 4.5 to the dollar and foresaw an inflation rate of 19 percent and economic growth this year of 1.5 percent.
However, with the peso remaining at 5.5 to the dollar or worse, inflation will be substantially higher and most economists expect to see a recession.
A document from the Finance Ministry, which discusses the use of the $20 billion from the United States, indicates that as soon as the first draw-down of the $20 billion becomes available in about a week, the Mexican Government will start using $2 billion to buy back tesobonos as they mature.
The central bank will continue to exchange the tesobonos held by private banks for other forms of debt.
Mexican officials hope that by the end of June, investors will have regained enough confidence in their country's economy that the remaining $10 billion from the American rescue package will not be needed.

Some analysts think now is the time to invest in Japanese stocks.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THESE are bleak days for the Tokyo stock market. Following a big fall after last month's earthquake, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks has been hovering at a low level of around 18,000. There are widespread fears that it may fall further in the coming weeks.
"Right now, sentiment is at it's very worst," said Jeff Bahrenburg, strategist in the Tokyo office of Merrill Lynch & Company. "Bearishness is at its extreme." A rally yesterday fizzled out at the end of the day as the Nikkei closed at 18,106.65, up 10.40 points. 
 But when things look worst, some analysts, like Mr. Bahrenburg, think it is time to buy. The market, these analysts argue, seems to be ignoring the fact that Japan's economy is recovering from a three-year recession and that corporate earnings are improving. Even if the market drops sharply in the next few weeks, they say, it should quickly recover and rise.
"In the long run you can't stop the fundamentals," said Tom Hill, head of research for S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan), who sees the Nikkei rising to 24,000 by March 1996. "I don't know what will happen in the next three or four weeks. What I do know is the market is undervalued."
 There are many good reasons for the current gloom in the market. Foreign investors, who buoyed stocks last year, have turned into net sellers. Selling pressure will increase in the next few weeks as Japanese companies cash in some holdings before the fiscal year ends on March 31.
Damages from the earthquake could still set back the nascent economic recovery, although many economists believe the rebuilding will stimulate growth in the long run. The quake also showed Japan to be a much riskier market than had been perceived before and showed the Japanese Government to be weak and ineffective.
Beyond the quake, the yen has been strong against the dollar in recent days, which threatens to hurt Japan's export-oriented companies. The strong American economy, which spurred increased exports of cars and computer chips from Japan, is cooling a bit.
And a scandal over the Government-backed rescue of two credit unions that had made huge amounts of questionable loans is drawing renewed attention to the mountains of bad debt held by Japan's banks and other financial institutions.
"The market depends not so much on short- and medium-term earnings power," said Alexander Kinmont, a strategist with Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. "It depends upon a sense of confidence that things are being done to clean up the mess" in the banking sector, he said.
When Sumitomo Bank wrote off a big chunk of its bad loans last month in an effort to clean up its books, the stock market soared in reaction. The current scandal is having the opposite effect, Mr. Kinmont said. He predicted that the Nikkei would not rise above 20,000 this year and might sink as low as 16,000. The index last surpassed the 20,000 mark in October and fell below 16,000 in November 1993.
Bulls agree that the market is ignoring earnings prospects, but say it won't stay that way forever, providing the buying opportunity. "The market is almost immune to fundamentals," said Kathy Matsui, vice president and chief strategist in the Tokyo office of Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It's almost numb." She predicted the Nikkei could reach 23,000 in the next year.
Demand in Japan for some products, such as cars, is improving. And capital spending is also showing signs of increasing after several years of decline. This week alone Matsushita Electric, Honda and Canon all reported sharply higher earnings for the December quarter as a result of cost-cutting and improved demand.
"We're at the threshold of a long period of growth," Mr. Bahrenburg of Merrill Lynch said, adding that the market could gain 50 to 60 percent in the next five years, with much of the increase coming in the next year.
"Selling the stock market now is like walking into a fully loaded mousetrap," Mr. Hill of Warburg said. "If you are lucky you might be able to steal the cheese but you're much more likely to find yourself decapitated."

Bonds Surge On Remarks By Fed Chief

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated that the central bank might be finished raising interest rates for the time being.
The yield on the closely watched 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to a five-month low. The bond rose 27/32 , to a price of 1014/32 for a yield of 7.53 percent, down from 7.61 percent on Tuesday. 
 Shorter bill rates were also sharply lower, but some market analysts said they thought the rally was overdone because the Fed could still raise interest rates again.
"What matters most for bond yields is inflationary expectations, and it's hard to imagine inflationary expectations rising in the face of an economy that is slowing," said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities.
"While it is true that the actual rate of inflation is likely to pick up over the near term, it is expected to be contained within acceptable limits," he added. "And while the Fed could certainly lift rates another notch in May, the market is beginning to get comfortable with the idea that we may be approaching the end of the Fed's tightening cycle."
Analysts started thinking that the Fed might not raise interest rates further after hearing Mr. Greenspan's semiannual report to Congress on monetary policy. He said there were signs that the economy "may finally be slowing" and suggested, "There may come a time when we hold our policy stance unchanged, or even ease, despite adverse price data, should we see signs that underlying forces are acting ultimately to reduce inflation pressures."
Mr. Greenspan's comment on cutting rates came just after the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, suggested on Friday that the Fed might be near the end of this cycle of tightening and even thinking about pre-empting cutting rates to avoid a recession. While Mr. Greenspan was not quite as explicit, traders said the the two together had made the possibility of no more rate increases for now more likely.
But there are still market participants who think the Fed needs to raise rates at least once more to slow the economy's rate of growth to 2.5 percent. Many economists say that is the fastest growth the economy can sustain without risking an increase in inflation.
"Based on Mr. Greenspan's words," said Jay Goldinger, market strategist at Capital Insight of Beverly Hills, Calif., "he didn't say they were going to ease and he didn't say they'd stop tightening. He said he thought that maybe the Fed would start to slow from its recent pace.
"I think," he added, "the market is way ahead of itself."
Mr. Greenspan himself noted that while the economy was perhaps slowing from its "torrid and unsustainable pace, the jury is out" on whether higher interest rates would contain inflation.
Riding yesterday's investor enthusiasm, $17.25 billion of new two-year notes sold well at the Treasury's auction. Traders said the auction showed good demand as the yield came in at 6.999 percent, only slightly above the 6.98 percent the market had expected. The yield was the lowest since Oct. 25, when it was 6.88 percent.
Tomorrow, the Government will auction $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.19 percent.
Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, said "bonds rallied because investors heard what they wanted to hear." He added, "They heard the Fed chairman confirm a slowing of the economy, but they ignored the caveat that the economy will continue to expand."
Mr Canelo said he thought that investors heard that inflation was reasonably well behaved, but did not pay much attention to Mr. Greenspan's comments that there were still significant concerns about capacity utilization and unemployment, which may suggest rising inflation.
The market only wants to hear that the Fed is done raising rates for now and maybe even never gain, Mr. Canelo said. "But that's a little extreme."
Following are the results of yesterday Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Hints at an End To Rise in Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said today there was evidence that the economy "may finally be slowing" and suggested that if it sank too fast the Federal Reserve would move quickly to cut interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan's comments in Congressional testimony, taken along with remarks by the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve last week, is the strongest indication to date that the Federal Reserve may be finished raising interest rates for the time being. 
 It can be difficult to interpret the Federal Reserve chairman when he testifies before Congress because he keeps his options open by not saying specifically what the central bank is going to do next. But the bond market rallied during and after his testimony, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 7.53 percent, its lowest since Sept. 2. [Page D1.]
"While the Fed could certainly lift rates another notch in May, the market is beginning to get comfortable with the idea that we may be approaching the end of the Fed's tightening cycle," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities.
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times in the last year, doubling short-term interest rates to 6 percent to head off inflationary pressures. The last increase was in January, when the Federal Reserve raised its target for the Federal funds rate by one-half of a percentage point. At the time, many analysts thought the Federal Reserve would still have to raise interest rates again later in the year because signs of economic growth were still strong. But since then both Government statistics and the slowdown in automobile production have indicated that the economy may be slowing.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that the Federal Reserve would consider lowering interest rates even if inflation continued to rise, if it suspected that over all the economy was slowing sufficiently.
"There may come a time when we hold our policy stance unchanged, or even ease, despite adverse price data, should we see signs that underlying forces are acting ultimately to reduce inflation pressures," Mr. Greenspan said.
He gave no indication that any relaxation was imminent, however, declaring at another point in his twice-a-year presentation to Congress on the economic outlook and Federal Reserve strategy that "the jury remains out" about whether the interest rate medicine will be powerful enough to keep inflation at bay.
The remarks about possible cutting of interest rates -- believed to be Mr. Greenspan's first such public comments -- came in the context of the Fed's having learned from experience that by the time new trends are unmistakably reflected in the traditional statistical gauges they have become too powerful to be countered easily.
It was a desire to mount a drive against inflation before any such price outburst occurred that prompted the Fed to begin raising short-term interest rates last February.
On Friday, Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman and one of two board members appointed by President Clinton, told an audience in Richmond that he and his colleagues should be as prepared to make a pre-emptive strike against recession as it did against inflation.
Mr. Greenspan seemed to concur today, stressing the need to be flexible in the making of monetary policy, which he called an "uncertain enterprise" that has become even more difficult in recent years as some traditional yardsticks for gauging policy have become less reliable.
What the chairman cited as "indications" of a slowing economy in recent weeks were slackened growth of jobs and retail sales and "some softness" in the interest-sensitive housing industry. He said, however, that growth continued, reporting that most members of the Federal Open Market Committee projected a rise in gross domestic product this year of 2 percent to 3 percent, little changed from the narrower range of 2.50 to 2.75 percent that they projected last July.
But while noting the "signal accomplishment" of holding inflation at under 3 percent for three consecutive years -- and having reduced it in each business cycle since the 1970's -- Mr. Greenspan found "reasons for some concern," particularly in coming months.
These, he said, "relate primarily to the fact that resource utilization rates have already risen to high levels" by recent standards, with the unemployment rate, for instance, only slightly above the average of the late 1980's, a time of significant price acceleration. He said the same held true in the industrial sector of the economy, where factories operated at 85.1 percent of capacity last month, just below the recent cyclical peak of January 1989.
And while Mr. Greenspan said that the pace at which the economy can grow without setting off sharp price increases may have risen "a few tenths of a percentage point annually or even more," last year's 4 percent growth was still far to high.
It was not clear whether Mr. Greenspan, who today cited "some indications that the expansion may finally be slowing from its torrid and unsustainable pace," had gleaned new data to change his views since last Wednesday when, addressing a banking convention in Honolulu, he said the evidence of slowing "remains mixed."
During a spirited question-and-answer period, Mr. Greenspan spoke on a number of other topics as well. He expressed profound disappointment at lack of Government action to address the growth of entitlement spending; agreed with Republicans who argue for abolition of the minimum wage; favored "sunset" provisions for all Government programs and agencies, including the Federal Reserve, and reaffirmed his long-standing interest in re-establishing a link between the dollar and gold.
When quizzed about whether the Fed believed itself handicapped in fighting inflation by requirements it pursue other goals as well, Mr. Greenspan said this was less of a problem than it once was because "vague" language and mounting empirical evidence have allowed it increasingly to cite price stability as necessary for other goals, such as high employment.
At one point, responding to a question about the risk of recession, Mr. Greenspan said with a sigh that monetary policy was a never-ending job, one whose outcome is never certain except in retrospect.
"It's like a luggage carousel at the airports," he suggested.

HEADLINE: The New Espionage Game?

 BODY:
In an odd way, the espionage contretemps between the United States and France that roared into view yesterday may be a sign of progress for the Central Intelligence Agency. If the French accounts are correct, at least the agency was spying on something that matters, specifically French efforts in 1993 to block an international trade agreement and to thwart the marketing of American movies and television shows in France. At a time when American national security is increasingly defined by economic interests, it is reassuring to see the lumbering intelligence apparatus in Washington turning away from the obsolete work of monitoring Russian military forces.
But the methods reportedly involved, including efforts to bribe French officials, were wrong. While it was clearly acceptable during the cold war to pay Soviet informants for secret information about Moscow's nuclear forces, it is not appropriate to bribe French officials for political or economic information. 
 No one should be shocked to discover that the C.I.A. may have been spying on an ally. Even in the bleakest days of the cold war, Washington collected information about political developments in NATO countries. There was always suspicion between Washington and Paris, rooted in de Gaulle's nettlesome independence. The French Government was chagrined two years ago when it was disclosed that Paris had targeted 21 American aerospace companies for industrial espionage.
Now it is Washington's turn to dance and dodge. The daily Le Monde, which broke the story, reported that five Americans, including the C.I.A. station chief in Paris, had offered bribes to French officials to obtain information about the French position at the trade talks and the Government's resistance to the import of American movies and television shows. Until the last minute, France threatened to scuttle the GATT trade agreement by refusing to reduce subsidies for French farmers.
It was undoubtedly not a coincidence that this story happened to become public just as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's presidential campaign was in danger of being derailed by disclosure of a questionable wiretapping operation authorized by Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. Nothing changes the subject faster than a juicy espionage case, especially one involving Americans.
How much financial and industrial espionage is appropriate for the C.I.A., and how the information should be used, are serious questions the Clinton Administration and Congress need to explore as part of their review of American intelligence operations. The C.I.A. owes Congress a full accounting of this mission, if the French accusations are true.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher, Then Eases On Fed Chief's Rate View

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied overseas yesterday but fell back in New York trading, after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, suggested that American interest rates had peaked.
The dollar ended little changed against most leading currencies, hovering at a 28-month low against the surging German mark. The mark advanced broadly as investors, seeking a haven from political and financial turmoil in Europe, continued to put funds in German banks and securities. 
 "The Deutsche mark is the currency of choice right now," said Tom Benfer, director at the New York foreign exchange desk of the Bank of Montreal. "I think it's more of a case of mark strength than dollar weakness."
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 1.4710 marks from 1.4700 marks on Tuesday, and to 1.2490 Swiss francs from 1.2430 francs. The dollar slipped to 97 Japanese yen from 97.05 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5883 from $1.5862.
Traders said the dollar rose in Asia and in early European trading on unconfirmed reports that the Bundesbank was buying dollars in an effort to stem the dollar's slide against the mark. The dollar has fallen 5.2 percent against the mark since the beginning of the year.
But the dollar plunged from its highs after Mr. Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, said there was evidence that the economy "may finally be slowing," and suggested that if it began slipping toward recession the Fed could cut interest rates.
The Fed has raised short-term interest rates seven times since February 1994 in an effort to prevent inflation from accelerating.
Higher rates make short-term deposits and assets more attractive, driving up the demand for a currency. Reinforcing such trends, investors tend to flock to the financial markets of a country whose currency is expected to rise, as the value of assets denominated in that currency will increase in relative terms.
That appears to be the case with Germany and the mark.
While United States rates currently are higher, favoring the dollar, "the market senses that Fed tightening is less likely and Bundesbank tightening more likely," said William Dudley, currency analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony came after a report on Tuesday in which the Bundesbank pointed to rapid economic growth in Germany and emphasized that it was prepared to raise rates to dampen price pressures.

HEADLINE: After the Strike: Fairness

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to issue an executive order that would forbid the hiring of permanent replacement workers by Government contractors has the whiff of politics. Mr. Clinton needs to shore up his support with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., now meeting in Florida. No surprise, then, that he flirts with intervening in the baseball strike and threatens to veto pro-management bills making their way through the Republican-controlled Congress.
There is logic, too, in using a Presidential order to get some movement on an economic issue that is important to both business and organized labor. Last year, the House passed a blanket ban against allowing companies to hire permanent replacements for striking workers. The measure died in the Senate, where Republicans and some Democrats rightly viewed it as too sweeping. Businesses have the right to stay afloat during a strike, just as workers have the right to seek other jobs. But that can be done in almost all strikes with temporary replacements. No one's career is ended; the damage to both sides is short-term. 
 But overly rapid moves to replace workers permanently raise troubling issues about labor law. Congress never intended that employees who have worked at their jobs for a lifetime would have to choose overnight between their unions and their careers. Yet that is how the practice has evolved since President Reagan crushed the 1981 strike by air traffic controllers. The use of replacement workers is legal, and at some point is defensible. But it needs to be fair and uniform.
To hire permanent replacements within hours of a strike violates the promise of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, the foundation of labor law. It established the right of workers to strike without the threat of being fired, or other employer retaliation. Permanent replacements, the Supreme Court has ruled, do not violate that right because strikers are first in line to fill job openings. But if replacements are permanent, there cannot be many openings -- creating a specious distinction between being fired and permanently replaced.
In this regard, an executive order that applies only to Federal contractors does not represent a long-term solution. The problem needs to be fixed through legislation. But the correction that Mr. Clinton has supported in the past -- blanket prohibition of permanent replacements -- is not the best way. An all-or-nothing approach is neither sensible nor required, and is sure to be rejected by a Republican-controlled Congress.
The important question is not whether employers should have the right to hire permanent replacements, but when. There is a sensible middle ground here, as proposed by Prof. Paul Weiler of Harvard Law School, that balances the rights of labor and management. He would outlaw the use of permanent replacements for, say, the first six months of a strike. By that time the outcome of virtually all strikes is known. Forewarned, strikers could reasonably decide between reclaiming their jobs or losing them.
Mr. Clinton can start moving the issue in a positive direction by issuing an executive order that allows Federal contractors to hire permanent replacements -- but only after the first six months of a strike have passed. This nuanced approach could serve as a model for a new law capable of winning bipartisan Congressional support.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Rises After Greenspan Supports a Link to the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Gold prices rose to their highest levels in more than three weeks yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that he favored restoring some link between the dollar and gold.
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has spoken favorably of the gold standard in the past and has shown enthusiasm for using gold prices as a barometer of inflation. While there is little chance of a return to the gold standard, which was officially abandoned 24 years ago, Mr. Greenspan's comments drew buyers to the moribund gold market. 
 In other commodity markets, cotton prices rose again but stopped just short of $1 a pound, and heating oil and gasoline prices advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities gained 0.31 point, to 235.74.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, gold for April delivery rose 90 cents, to $381.50 an ounce, after earlier reaching a high of $382.40, its highest since Jan. 27. March silver rallied 9.7 cents, to $4.835 an ounce.
Mr. Greenspan's comments give "this concept of gold in portfolios legitimacy," said Dinsa Mehta, vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, adding that a return to the gold standard would be "like legislating to believe in fairies."
Few analysts believe a return to the gold standard is likely. The gold standard was dropped and the Federal Reserve closed its gold window in 1971.
Cotton prices continued to rise on the New York Cotton Exchange. March cotton hit a session high of 99.95 cents a pound, before settling 1.31 cents higher at 99.79 cents.
Cotton prices have risen sharply on the prospect for shortages later this year created by booming exports of last year's record large United States cotton crop. Export sales have also been helped by poor crops in China, Pakistan and India.
The previous record high price was 99 cents in September 1973, the highest price for cotton since it began trading on the exchange in 1870.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Selig, Fehr Take Part In Civilized Exchange

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 22

 BODY:
Two days of "candid," "civilized" dialogue that culminated in a feast of corned beef, pastrami and tongue at Jake Levine's deli in Milwaukee today set the tone for the resumption of serious bargaining in the baseball strike next week.
It remains to be seen, though, if harsh charges leveled at the union by an owner who wasn't in Milwaukee undermine the positive tone Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, believes was established in his meetings with Donald Fehr, the union leader. 
 "I don't know what this means in the overall scheme, but it was rational, very civilized, very sensitive, I think quite candid," Selig said by telephone from Milwaukee. "I don't want to read too much or too little into it, but there was a candor in the past 24 hours that I have never seen before."
Can the meetings produce progress in the negotiations that are stalled on the issue of a luxury tax on payrolls? "I guess we'll know that about a week from today," Selig said.
Representatives of the owners and striking players scheduled a new round of talks to begin Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz.
However much good will and wishful thinking emerged from the sessions in Selig's hometown and led to three joint meals, climaxed by lunch at the delicatessen Selig owns, could be buried by the words of Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox.
Reinsdorf, who has been portrayed as a leader of the owners' hard-line stance by players and some people in management, was severely critical of the union generally and Fehr specifically in an interview published today in The Chicago Sun-Times.
Asked if there was any hope of saving the 1995 season, Reinsdorf said: "The only hope is if the players come to the realization that they are being misled by Fehr. My perception of him is that he is obsessed with the antitrust exemption and that he has no real interest in the welfare of his players. Donald Fehr has a pathological hatred for baseball owners."
Reinsdorf also said that he didn't understand why the union "is setting me up" as the person dictating the owners' policy, adding: "It's a good way of holding people together, if you have a common enemy. And for whatever reason, they've created me as that enemy."
Reinsdorf declined further interviews on the subject, but to a question posed through his secretary about whether or not his comments could undermine the talks, he replied, "Only if Fehr wants them to."
Selig declined to comment on Reinsdorf's comments, saying: "We've got too many issues to focus on. I'm not going to be distracted by any comments on either side. The only person I can hold totally accountable is myself and you don't read those comments from me."
The divergence in their verbal stances is interesting because Selig and Reinsdorf long have been viewed as the developers and leaders of the owners' labor strategy. It was they who, in 1992, asked then-Commissioner Fay Vincent to relinquish his authority in labor matters; and when he declined, they were the ones who led a move to oust him as commissioner.
Fehr was reserved in his reaction to Reinsdorf's comments. "Few things do more good for my credibility among my membership," he said, "than to be criticized in this fashion by Jerry Reinsdorf."
The Milwaukee meetings were attended by smaller groups than has been the case. Joining Selig, Fehr and Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, were Lauren Rich, a union lawyer, and two club officials, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox and Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies.
The negotiators still must traverse the great gulf that separates their positions on the central economic issue. The owners, who earlier tried to implement a cap on payrolls, want to levy a steep tax on payrolls over a certain threshold, and the players contend that such a tax will have the same effect as a cap.
Two weeks ago, Usery, at the request of President Clinton, proposed a 50 percent tax on the portion of payrolls over $40 million. The owners said they would accept it, but the players angrily rejected the idea, saying it was far too favorable to the owners.
Neither the Usery ideas nor any others were discussed in Milwaukee. "We agreed to stay away from the issues," Selig said.

HEADLINE: Money-Back Guarantee if Conditions Are Poor

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
It may seem odd to think of snow in terms of a money-back guarantee. But increasingly, ski resorts are marketing their slopes the way department stores deal in housewares. At most retail outlets, you have at least 30 days to return an item. At ski areas, you have about an hour.
A growing movement is afoot to give skiers their money back if snow conditions aren't right. In a winter like this one, with its mercurial ups and downs, skiers may want a refund. 
 "Ski conditions, especially in the Northwest, can be very changeable," said Bill Mullane, spokesman for Schweitzer Mountain Resort in Sandpoint, Idaho. "In one day, it might turn from sunshine to overcast, or be pouring rain. If people know that if they don't like it, they can get a ticket for another day, they're more likely to come here. My philosophy is suit up and show up."
Indeed, according to the National Ski Areas Association, an industry trade group, at least a dozen ski areas among the more than 500 that belong to its association have a snow guarantee policy.
Some resorts, like Stowe, Vt., are likely to refund a skier's ticket with a voucher if there is a complaint. But there isn't a guarantee policy. "We don't hype that," said Bob Gillen, Stowe's director of marketing. "We won't open a trail unless the snow is deep and skiable anyway. If it's open, it's good."
Schweitzer, which has had the program for five years, limits its refund policy to lift ticket vouchers. Of the 175,000 ski tickets sold at Schweitzer last year, about 5,000 came back as "snow checks." Skiers had an hour from the time printed on their ticket to decide whether they wanted to stay.
Loon Mountain in Lincoln, N.H., started a similar plan two winters ago. "I think we had a couple of bad weeks of weather," said Brenda Kneeland, guest service manager at Loon. "We still had good skiing, but people didn't want to believe it. The guarantee was our way of showing our confidence in the skiing."
At Loon, skiers have until 11 A.M. to decide. The mountain opens at 8 A.M. That essentially gives a skier three hours to test the snow. "It's a very generous program," Kneeland said.
Much of the confidence in refunding tickets comes from the ability to make snow when nature holds back. "If you're not making good snow, you're dead," Gillen said about the economics of a ski area. "Otherwise it's farming, it's not skiing. You might as well be betting on the commodities market."
The science has become precise, with resorts being able to lay snow almost anywhere they want it. "Right now, I can look out my window and not see a drop of snow," Kneeland said about a day in early February. "It looks like early October. But out my other window, there's three feet of snow. I look at it and say, 'How'd they do that?' "
In California, where heavy rains battered coastal communities in January, snow fell in the mountains. At the Boreal Ski Area northeast of San Francisco, management gives cash back to disgruntled skiers, despite the fact that snowmaking covers only 30 percent of the area's 380 acres.
"We don't really see it as a risk," said Sheila Walsh, director of marketing for Boreal. "We see it as a service. If people buy a $33 lift ticket and feel they got skunked, then we're happy to give them their money back. It's more important to make sure people had a good experience."
For Boyne Highlands, a ski area near Harbor Springs, Mich., management is looking farther down the road. "The kids are getting older, and we're trying to adapt," said Kathleen Ballard, a sales assistant, about the area's voucher guarantee. "In the past, we've catered to the baby-boomers. But now their children are getting older, so the policy that fit in 1960 doesn't fit in 1990."
 
MOGULS
 As many as 6,900 skiers are expected to participate Saturday in the 1995 Dyno American Birkebeiner, the nation's largest cross-country ski race. The event begins at Telemark Lodge in Cable, Wis., and finishes on Main Street in Hayward, Wis., a distance of 52 kilometers or about 32 miles.
More than 200 military veterans are expected to participate in the National Disabled Veterans Sports Clinic March 26-31 at Crested Butte, Colo. The learn-to-ski sessions are open to service veterans with spinal cord injuries, orthopedic amputations, visual and neurological impairments and other disabilities. Information can be obtained by calling (303) 242-0731.

HEADLINE: Look Who's Caring For the Caretaker

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
JOHN SCHNALL easily remembers the hands that raised him -- that baked the cookies, wiped away the tears and showed him how to pray. They were those, he said, of his "mother, father and best friend."
In fact, they belonged to none of those people, but rather to his nanny, Margaret Lauman, who lived nearly all of her adult life in service to his family. 
 "All the feelings that normally go to a mother went to Lauman," Mr. Schnall, 42, a freelance copywriter, said of the German woman he called by her last name. She came into his family's New York home in 1951, migrated with them to Florida and stayed there with them until the end of her life in 1988.
Those feelings are what inspired him, he said, to take Miss Lauman on a vacation to Hawaii in the 1970's, to fly to Florida to nurse her after she had a stroke and to continue to arrange for her care until the day she died. As far as family was concerned, Mr. Schnall said, "I would have chosen her over anyone at any point."
Mr. Schnall is one of a number of people who are seeking out a lifelong relationship with a former caretaker. In some cases, grown charges are the ones willingly assuming the burden of care, often in ways usually reserved for an aging parent, providing health benefits, help around the house or a place in the family home for the rest of their lives.
John Revson, a 52-year-old international trade consultant (and son of Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon), said about his childhood nanny, Katie Lowery, "If something ever happened to her, I'd take care of her forever, because she has given virtually her whole life to us." She now lives in retirement with Mr. Revson and his mother in Palm Beach, Fla.
Still others are seeking out childhood nannies years after the care-giver relationship has ended, the way they would a lost parent or estranged relative, assuming, perhaps naively, that the nanny remembers them just as wistfully. They frequently refer to their nannies as family members, albeit relatives with no apparent histories of their own.
Twenty years after women began flooding into the workplace, some two million children under age 5 are now cared for in their homes by someone other than a parent. The concept of "help" has come to include everyone from a daytime adult baby sitter to a teen-age apprentice to an au pair.
But it was only a few decades ago that a nanny's job was much more formally defined. The nannies of the 1940's and 50's worked well before 9 A.M. and long after 5 P.M., not just feeding, clothing and bathing their charges, but also seeing to their spiritual and emotional well being. They became intimate with children in ways their parents often did not (as these grown-up children are quick to remind parents in later years) -- giving advice, attending school plays and even doing the tucking in.
"My parents were nice enough people, but they were not equipped to handle children in any way," said Mr. Schnall, who remembers the cookies that Miss Lauman dutifully shipped off to him at summer camp.
Jean Lang, an economist in Washington, put it another way. "I just don't remember playing with my mother the way I did with Clemmie," she said of Clemmie Koopman, the nanny who played endless games of canasta from her rocking chair.
Given such depth of feeling, perhaps it is only natural that some adults should provide financial support for their former nannies as they grow old, while others stay close through weekly phone calls and frequent invitations to family gatherings, including weddings.
Carol Goralnik, an artist in St. Louis, oversees the care of Clara Sahm, 89, in and out of hospitals, doing her grocery shopping and often preparing her meals.
"Clara never married and has no children, so I serve as her surrogate child," said Mrs. Goralnik, 42, who has three children. "It isn't always fun. But she raised me and she's real important to me. She took care of me, and now I take care of her."
Those few who can afford it may even offer nannies an approximation of "lifetime employment," which may include bed, board and full health benefits.
"We are seeing that more and more people are looking into long-term benefits and retirement packages for their nannies," said Marla Sanders of Bethesda, Md., who owns several employment agencies throughout the country that place nannies. "People are starting to realize that they have to give back the love that was given."
Often, the nannies will remain with families as companions to parents who are alone, with minimal duties for which they are still paid full salaries, said Barbara Ettinger, a film maker who, with Jyll Johnstone, explored the relationship between nannies and their adult charges in the recent documentary "Martha and Ethel."
The film makers allowed the camera to wander through the lives and memories of their two distinctly different nannies -- Martha Kneifel, a German-born baby nurse who ruled the Johnstone roost with a wooden spoon, and Ethel Edwards, a Southerner who appeared to be the greatest source of affection for the Ettinger children.
Ms. Edwards still lives with Ms. Ettinger's mother. "It's odd," Ms. Ettinger said. "Ethel is still paid, but the relationship is no longer really professional. She and mom share the household duties."
Both film makers were approached after screenings of the film in various cities by people who strongly identified with relationships depicted in the film. "One woman told me that she had never known how to talk about nannies, because there is so much stigma attached to them," Ms. Ettinger said.
Part of that stigma may revolve around the inequity that exists in even the warmest of employer-employee relationships.
"There are lines of demarcation," said Elizabeth Clark-Lewis, a history professor at Howard University and the author of the book "Living In, Living Out: African American Domestics in Washington D.C. 1910-1940" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994).
"There is a genuine concern the employee has for her job, and that job entails rearing and nurturing these children," she said. "They care about them, but they are not under any illusions. There is an expected deference, and they know that."
While there may be many cases of genuine mutual affection, "the person on the non-nanny end tends to imagine that the relationship is a lot more meaningful and rich for the nanny than it really was," said Nicholas Lemann, the author of "The Promised Land" (Knopf, 1991), about black American migration between 1940 and 1970. "One tends to engage in this fantasy that the nanny is deriving deep pleasure out of being their servant."
In spite of the fact that nannies are loved as much as aunts, grandparents and sometimes even mothers, many adults who were their charges are often strikingly unaware of the lives of these women. Often, they cannot quite recall which states the women migrated from, how many children they have, whether or not they were ever married.
"It's weird, you don't really know about their other life," said Trisha Shiland, 33, of New York, whose nanny, Mattie Pelham, lived with the family for 20 years.
In some ways, Professor Clark-Lewis said, the employees are comfortable with that lack of knowledge. "It means that they put a limit on this unequal relationship," she said. "They don't want employers intruding on all aspects of their lives."
It may well be that the perceived intimacy on behalf of the charges is based on the ongoing demands and needs of the grown child -- which may now include care of an aged parent.
Elizabeth Johnson, now 84, spent six years caring for the five Frymier children in Pittsburgh. After 10 years without contact, one child, Sydney Frymier, now 45 and a clinical social worker in Chevy Chase, Md., sought out her former nanny and put her back on the payroll to care for the Frymiers' bedridden 78-year-old mother. "Elizabeth knows just what to do with her," Ms. Frymier said. "My mother would definitely be in a home if Elizabeth were not there."
For their part, nannies say they tend to remember families fondly because children were well behaved and the parents were kind.
Nina Mae Henderson spent 31 years in St. Louis with the family of Virginia Rice, who is now a multimedia designer in Washington. Ms. Rice, 45, called her "the rock of the family."
Miss Henderson, who still lives in St. Louis, seemed a bit startled that the care she gave Ms. Rice and her sister, Callie, should have such emotional resonance.
"I think a whole lot of the girls," Miss Henderson said. "I don't feel like I'm related to them, though. I love them in a sensible way."

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
Big-City Mores and Big-Band Swing

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

 BODY:
The Ohio Ballet, directed by Heinz Poll in Akron, remains the engaging company it has always been. Judging by the first of its two programs, anyone who ambles into the Joyce Theater this week stands a chance of having more than a good time.
The highlight of the troupe's opening on Tuesday night was a polished, lively revival of an important sociopolitical gem. Kurt Jooss, best known for his 1932 antiwar masterpiece "The Green Table," choreographed "The Big City" the same year. In a few cinematic strokes, the German choreographer painted a picture of human character engulfed by forces beyond any control. On the surface, this short ballet was a vignette about a poor youth losing his girl to a swell, who deserts her. But on the eve of Hitler's rise to power, Jooss's picture of class divisions and urban alienation in "The Big City" had a deeper meaning. 
 The German-born Mr. Poll trained at Mr. Jooss's school after the war and danced in Chile under the direction of charter members of Jooss's original company. Nonetheless, the rest of the program at the Joyce (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea) has none of the Expressionist style represented by Jooss and is more typical of the Ohio Ballet's eclectic repertory.
Lucinda Childs's "Trilogies," one of the local premieres, exemplified Mr. Poll's hospitality to experimental modern-dance choreographers. The second program will feature works by Charles Moulton and Laura Dean. "Trilogies" shows Ms. Childs extending herself with an unexpected use of a commissioned jazz score by Paul Schwartz and also remaining true to her signature style of meticulously repeated patterns.
Mr. Poll's choreography was represented by his new "Eight by Benny Goodman," a cliche-free big-band ballet in which Xochitl Tejeda de Cerda is a knockout as a torch singer, and by his 1974 Chopin double adagio, "Summer Night," danced outstandingly by Ms. Tejeda de Cerda, Yumelia Garcia and their partners, Kyongho Kim and David Shimotkahara.
The dancers, in fact, have never looked more mature and assured. Even "The Big City," which requires the kind of dramatic projection that Americans are rarely taught, was a tribute to their versatility, and especially to the principals. Luc Vanier, as the Workman, knew how to telegraph dejection through stillness. Head bowed to one side, hands in pockets, or leaning forward in a standard ballet position, he became a distilled image of heartbreak and yearning. Stephani Achuff, as the Young Girl, understood the differences in gait and phrasing. Innocent in her white beret, midinette appearance and scurrying steps, she seemed transformed not only by the evening dress she received from Paul Ghiselin as the top-hatted Libertine but also by the jazz age rhythms of her ballroom dances.
Jooss was dealing in stock characters. But in Europe in 1932, the working-class men really did wear caps, and their clothes set them apart from rich men in capes. Similarly, there is a touch of Kathe Kollwitz's drawings of working-class life in a remarkable and terse scene: four wide-eyed children (Kara Davis, Joe Roesner, Linda Hymes and Edward Augustyn), curve their backs to fit under the protective arms of their mothers (Amy Hayes and Susan Lodise) and reprovingly watch the Young Girl.
What is so stunning is the economy with which Jooss makes his points. The Charleston dancers in Hermann Markard's costumes are replaced in a filmic dissolve by a bal musette. This difference in social dances (the workers hold their women close and revolve across the floor while the rich folk are more frenetic and modern) tells the story of "The Big City."
The ballet, a must-see, looks just as fascinating as when it had a short-lived revival with the Joffrey Ballet in 1975. Anna Markard, Jooss's daughter, and Airi Hynninen have conveyed the spirit of Jooss's body language to the dancers, and Lois Rova Ozanich and David Fisher, live at two pianos, play Alexander Tansman's infectious atmospheric score. The neo-Romanticism of Mr. Poll's "Summer Night" gains mightily from Mr. Garcia's and Ms. Tejeda de Cerda's boldly projected arabesques and line. Ms. Childs, for her part, makes the dancers (the women are in toe shoes but don't always rise on point) look somewhat awkward as they snap into positions. But there is also a kaleidoscopic dazzle to the way she moves three quartets of dancers in color-coded costumes around in her stamina-demanding patterns, partnering and mirror dances.
"Eight by Benny Goodman" uses recordings from 1939 to 1946 in a suite. The company, mainly in formal dress, mixes ballroom and ballet. The whole thing is exhilarating.

HEADLINE: Bank Merger Is Challenged By Governor

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland today threatened to block the proposed merger of the state's two largest banks unless the banks took steps to soften the impact of the deal on Connecticut's economy.
The highly unusual move -- states traditionally rubber-stamp such mergers -- comes one day after Fleet Financial Group of Providence, R.I., agreed to purchase Shawmut National Corporation of Hartford and Boston. The $3.7 billion deal would create the nation's ninth-largest bank. 
 In this city, where both banks have large offices, the announcement has been greeted as grim economic news. It could mean as many as 1,200 layoffs for the banks' 7,844 Connecticut employees, along with the closing of as many as one-third of the banks' 250 branches across Connecticut. The new bank's headquarters would be in Boston.
"The state has a lot to say about whether this merger can take place," Mr. Rowland said at a news conference this afternoon. "We will be looking at it very, very carefully. We're doing all we can do within our authority to protect jobs."
The state will negotiate with the banks in the coming months to try to extract concessions and guarantees about jobs and local lending, Mr. Rowland said, declining to offer specific goals.
It is unlikely that the state could actually scuttle the deal, though it certainly could slow the approval process and force the banks into a costly legal battle.
The merger requires approval from various Federal departments and agencies, as well as from the State Banking Department. Bank officials said they are optimistic about their prospects.
Federal and state agencies must examine whether the merger would violate anti-trust provisions, economic impact requirements and other measures. The state uses the same guidelines as the Federal Government. If any branch of government rejects the merger, the banks may appeal the decision in Federal court.
Mr. Rowland held his news conference after he and legislative leaders from both parties held an hourlong meeting with the banks' two top executives, Joel B. Alvord of Shawmut and Terrence Murray of Fleet.
"They were shocked," the House Speaker, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat, said of the reaction of the two bank executives when they walked into a roomful of angry elected officials.
After the meeting, Mr. Alvord said the banks had looked into the legal ramifications of the deal before they announced it and believed it could not be halted.
Regarding the possibility of regulatory stumbling blocks, he remarked, "I feel confident that any such problems can be avoided through discussions."
But Mr. Rowland was clearly striking a tough bargaining stance. "No job loss is acceptable," he said, noting that the state had lost 200,000 jobs over the last seven years.

HEADLINE: Wright's Hometown Finally Sees Its Future

BYLINE: By RON McCREA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., Feb. 22

 BODY:
For more than half a century, this capital of the split-personality state that produced both the La Follette Progressive movement and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy has been passionately divided over Frank Lloyd Wright.
If many here in Wright's boyhood hometown recognized him as one of the century's great architects, there were plenty of others who reviled him as an autocrat, a womanizer and, perhaps worst of all, a habitual deadbeat whose real genius lay in bouncing checks and dodging bill collectors. 
 Wright, who lived here from age 11 to 19, planned 32 buildings in the city during his career. Of the nine that were built, eight remain, including a Prairie House, the Unitarian church and the first Usonian, Wright's prototype economy house for the American middle class, built for a newspaper reporter in 1936 for $ 5,000.
But one plan for Madison stood out not just for the ambition of its design but for the legendary battles it created. Monona Terrace, a project unveiled in 1938, was a grand vision of towers, fountains and terraces rising from the shores of Lake Monona in the shadow of the Capitol.
Time and again, Wright's admirers persuaded voters to approve bonds for the construction, only to be thwarted at every turn by equally dedicated Wright foes, largely businessmen who complained about the building's cost and despised Wright's politics.
Finally, last month, after 57 years of false starts, political sabotage and dashed hopes, construction teams drove the first pilings for the project that had bedeviled the architect through the final decades of his life.
The key to resolving five decades of hostilities lay in changing the building's purpose. Instead of the civic and cultural palace Wright had envisioned, Monona Terrace is being built as a convention center -- with the sudden, enthusiastic support of Madison's newly converted business interests.
Despite its newly defined function, the 4.4-acre complex, which is scheduled to open on July 4, 1997, will embody Wright's vision of "a great civic expression" that leaps the 60-foot bluff at the southeastern approach to the State Capitol and fans out over the Monona waterfront, linking the city's heart to one of its four lakes.
The 1938 design would have incorporated city and county government offices and chambers, a railroad station, courts and a jail. But the building now under construction follows the design Wright updated in 1958, by which time it had been redefined as a civic auditorium.
It will include a 68,000-square-foot rooftop garden park accessible from the street; spiral parking ramps at either end that strongly resemble his design for New York's Guggenheim Museum and 250,000 square feet of interior space, including a ballroom, an exhibition hall and an 8,500-square-foot auditorium.
In addition to stone and bricks and mortar, "there is all the water of Lake Monona to play with, to throw up as decorations in the form of columns and fountains," Wright told a Madison audience in 1941, promoting his plan for the second time.
Robert D'Angelo, the center's interim director, said: "At every level of the building there is floor-to-ceiling glass facing the lake. As you walk out, you enter a curved lobby that arcs over the lake front right at the waterline." Dinner cruises and garden receptions are planned for warm months.
Anthony Puttnam of Taliesin Architects of Phoenix, who worked on the original Monona Terrace plans as a teen-age apprentice, is now the project's chief architect. "It's a courageous building," he said of the 1997 version. "And in the context of Madison it is a very courageous building."
Much of the city's new-found courage may lie in the fading of old scars.
"Madison could dig into its pocket and pay something for the charm nature has given it," Wright fumed when challenged on the $ 17 million price of his 1938 civic center plan ($ 50 million less than the current project). "But maybe Madison can't look ahead 10 years. It is too provincial, backwater, smug and satisfied."
Mayor Paul Soglin says the Monona Terrace curse was finally broken by forging a new coalition of supporters. "In the past, if it was a Frank Lloyd Wright facility, the business community was against it," Mr. Soglin said. "If it was a convention center without a Frank Lloyd Wright design, the critical center of the city was against it."
By dusting off the Wright design and persuading George Nelson, a local broadcasting executive, to head the development commission, Mr. Soglin said, "You had the chief executives of utility companies and labor leaders working with art students and university professors to make this thing happen."
The most interesting player in the final act may have been Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a conservative Republican who is also leading state efforts to restore Taliesin, Wright's Spring Green estate 40 miles west of Madison. When Mr. Soglin proposed the project, Governor Thompson immediately offered $ 18 million in state funds to pay for the parking portion of the project.
"It was a tremendous partnership," the Governor said in an interview. "When we came forward, it was the anchor that said this was doable. When I came out for it, the business community said: 'Well, this can't be all bad. You got Nelson from the business community; you got Soglin, the Mayor, who's more on the Democrat side, and you got Tommy Thompson pushing from the conservative Republican side. That's a pretty formidable force.'"
Unlike previous attempts to build Monona Terrace, the current plan distributes the financing of the project's "guaranteed maximum price" of $ 67.1 million: $ 18 million from the state; $ 12 million from the city; $ 12 million from Dane County and $ 8 million from private donors. The remaining $ 17 million is to be raised over 20 years from hotel taxes.
The largest private contribution was a $ 3 million challenge grant from the William T. Evjue Foundation, named for the late publisher of The Capital Times, the city's afternoon newspaper, a longtime Wright champion in the Monona Terrace wars.
Despite legal action by some environmentalists to stop the project, work continues. Mr. D'Angelo said he had already booked a number of "major, major" conventions, some as far in advance as 2002, and florists, caterers and other vendors are already lining up for part of $ 15 million to $ 20 million in annual revenue that Monona Terrace is expected to generate.
"The money that the city will make off of this -- in the economy and the jobs created -- will be enough to pay every bill that Frank Lloyd Wright stiffed people for many times over," Mr. Nelson said. "People said he never paid his debts. He's paying them now."

HEADLINE: French Official Demands Inquiry on Spy Leak

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said today that he was shocked that France's accusations of economic espionage by the former C.I.A. station chief and four other Americans here had been leaked to the French press.
"I am scandalized that a delicate problem between us -- and this is not the first time that such a problem has arisen -- could be dragged out into the open this way," Mr. Juppe said. He called for a thorough public inquiry into how the daily newspaper Le Monde had obtained Government intelligence documents on the case. 
 Despite reports on Wednesday that France was insisting that the five Americans leave the country immediately, the former station chief was still in his office at the American Embassy today. French diplomats said that apparently none of the others had left either.
If there was ever any doubt that the revelations had more to do with the French presidential campaign than with a grave dispute between France and its traditional ally, the remarks by Mr. Juppe, a supporter of Jacques Chirac, Mayor of Paris, seemed to dispel it.
"There is no crisis whatsoever between France and the United States," the Foreign Minister said. "We had no intention to go public on this affair." The implication is that someone else did -- the chief of the French counterespionage service, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua.
Mr. Pasqua is the Cabinet's leading supporter of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's, whose lead in the presidential race is evaporating. Mr. Balladur is now running neck and neck with his fellow conservative Mr. Chirac and a Socialist, Lionel Jospin, in public opinion polls.
One reason for Mr. Balladur's loss of momentum was the disclosure early this week that he had approved a telephone tapping operation recommended by Mr. Pasqua on grounds that later turned out to be legally insufficient.
If there was any way to divert attention from the wiretapping scandal, partisans and nonpartisans agreed today, throwing the spotlight on the big power the French love to hate -- the United States -- was perhaps the obvious course.
"In an election campaign, diversionary maneuvers are part of the game," said Philippe Vasseur, another supporter of Mr. Chirac's in the presidential race.
It is Mr. Pasqua who has held most of the strings in the investigation since 1993. On Jan. 26, he took the unusual step of summoning Pamela Harriman, the American Ambassador here, to his office to discuss the allegations.
Usually it is the Foreign Ministry that deals with foreign diplomats, or the Prime Minister or the President, diplomats noted.
According to the report in Le Monde, Mr. Pasqua told Mrs. Harriman that his counterspies had caught her C.I.A. station chief, three of his embassy colleagues, and a fifth American red-handed in the act of trying to buy French economic and political secrets from high officials, and that she should see to it that all five leave France as soon as possible.
He followed up this demand with a letter Feb. 1, and with a second summons to his office on Feb. 10.
Mrs. Harriman apparently argued that her diplomats had just been doing their jobs, making contacts with French officials and gathering information on politics and the French position on trade issues, and that there was no reason to send them packing.
Mr. Juppe, the Foreign Minister, tried to sound relaxed about the accusations during a news conference at the Foreign Ministry today.
"What we have to do now is to continue to discuss this sensitive issue with our American friends," he said. "I am confident that we will soon find a way out."
The "recommendation" that the alleged C.I.A. staff members leave, he said, "was made in the spirit of trust that exists between our two countries."
"It was not intended to be made public."
Mr. Juppe refused to answer questions after making his statement, and Mr. Pasqua left today on a five-day tour of African countries.
Since the candidates the two support, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Balladur, are both members of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, the campaign battle between them has been particularly rough. The first round of voting on a President to succeed Francois Mitterrand will be April 23, with a runoff in May if no one wins more than 50 percent.
The news of the alleged American espionage pushed articles about Mr. Pasqua's telephone tapping operation off the front pages of French daily newspapers today.
Le Monde followed up with interviews with three of the unnamed French officials the Americans supposedly approached for information about French domestic politics, industry and trade matters. One of them, recalling conversations with one of the five Americans, told the newspaper:
"She was quite a bit older than me, and not very pretty. The banalities I told her about French politics, and France's concern about not being isolated in the negotiations on GATT, et cetera -- all that seemed to interest her passionately."
