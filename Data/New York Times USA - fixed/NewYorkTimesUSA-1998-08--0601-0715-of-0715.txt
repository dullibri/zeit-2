WITH SLOWING PC CHIP SALES, ZILOG WILL TRIM WORK FORCE

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Zilog Inc. said yesterday that it would cut 7.3 percent of its work force to cope with slowing sales of its specialty computer chips used in consumer electronics and personal computer products. Zilog said it would reduce its 1,650-member work force by eliminating 120 jobs at its manufacturing plant in Nampa, Idaho. Texas Pacific Group acquired Zilog and took it private earlier this year. The company eliminated 33 jobs in sales and at its headquarters last month to cut costs. Zilog, based in Campbell, Calif., said it would offer employees four to 10 weeks of severance pay, health benefits through December and assistance in finding new jobs.

Arizona Seizes License Of Camp for Delinquents

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Aug. 26

 BODY:
A boot-camp-style center for juvenile delinquents lost its license today after an Arizona state investigation found that its employees had contributed to the death of a teen-ager.
The director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Linda J. Blessing, said investigators had found that 17 employees of the camp, Boys Ranch, abused and neglected Nicholaus Contreraz, 16, of Sacramento, Calif. 
 The teen-ager collapsed and died on March 2 at a Boys Ranch unit in Oracle after being forced to do exercises. An autopsy concluded that he had a massive lung infection.
A Department of Economic Security report released today said employees had abused Nicholaus and accused him of faking fevers, exhaustion, vomiting and other symptoms of the infection.
The president of Boys Ranch, Bob Thomas, said he would appeal the license removal.
Ms. Blessing said Boys Ranch could regain its license if substantial improvements were made.
The employees accused in Nicholaus's death have been dismissed, laid off or resigned.

New York Recruiter Lands 7 Businesses

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
The New York City Economic Development Corporation announced yesterday that its business recruitment division had attracted seven new high-technology companies to the city over the last six months.
The companies that the division said it helped bring to the city are Hotelnet USA Inc., an international computer services company; Silicon Alley Telecommunications Corporation, Icom, Jenkins Professional Services Net, Absolute Reality, RTFM Consulting and Ecentric Consulting. 
 Hotelnet furnishes hotel guest rooms with computers that provide Internet access, word processing, games and electronic mail, among other services. The company occupies 1,400 square feet at 90 William Street, which is designed and equipped for growing information technology companies. It is a so-called Plug 'n' Go building, part of a program created by the city last year to encourage the growth of the new media industry. The program is a public-private partnership among the city, the Alliance for Downtown New York and the owners of several downtown buildings.
The business recruitment division, which was created in 1996, promotes the advantages of doing business in New York City and helps companies with available services and programs, like financing and tax incentives. NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Brooklyn's Irish: a Clear-Eyed Toast

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
With the cruel relish of a bleak Irish wit, Colin Quinn recalls for us the peculiar narrow-minded characters of his Brooklyn youth: J. T., the scornful druggie; Aidan, the venomous alcoholic; Margaret, the perpetual martyr; Jimmy, the judgmental do-nothing. Yet for all the dark and finely drawn characters he introduces in the course of his one-man show, the most surprising character on the stage of the Helen Hayes Theater is Mr. Quinn himself.
Given his prominent television comedy job, as the new anchor of "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live," you might have assumed that "Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake," which opened last night, would be a satirical spinoff of his late-night showcase. But if you were expecting a standup comic, a Seinfeldesque brush with Broadway, fuhgeddaboutit. What you get in Mr. Quinn instead is an honest-to-goodness seanachai. 
 A who? A seanachai, which is pronounced SHAWN-uh-kee: an Irish storyteller, a weaver of legends. At the foot of a set of steps, designed by Eugene Lee to resemble the stoops of Park Slope, Mr. Quinn spends a little more than an hour recreating the twisted universe of his late adolescence and invoking the small-town voices that echo on the insular blocks of the big city. He seems relieved to have blasted out of that universe, because the voices are harsh; there is not a scintilla of sentimentality in Mr. Quinn's admirably brutal, mostly unlovable portraits. But they certainly sound authentic, to the point where sections of "An Irish Wake" feel like documentary outtakes.
The strength of "An Irish Wake," which Mr. Quinn wrote with Lou DiMaggio, and which is directed by Bobby Moresco, is in its specificity and literacy. The vehemence of Aidan's attack on a boy who fails to bring him a proper Scotch and soda ("The little pimple-faced Judas has sold me out for 30 pieces of silver," Mr. Quinn declares in an Irish accent), the self-abnegating response of Margaret when a mourner stomps on her foot -- "No, it's O.K., honey, I'll offer it up" -- indicate a highly developed ear for the ironically funny detail, a pleasing awareness of the magnetic appeal of precision in language. He's a tale-spinner who chooses his words with the utmost care.
Still, there's the persistent sense of an assignment unfinished about "Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake," and it has more to do with Mr. Quinn the performer than the writer. Unlike other soloists who speak in multiple voices, like John Leguizamo and Anna Deavere Smith, Mr. Quinn is no chameleon. As is apparent in the roles he gets on "Saturday Night Live," he usually plays Colin Quinn. That's not a knock. He's extremely funny; his smart-alecky "Weekend Update" spots have reinvigorated that hoary feature. Although he makes no claim on the stage of the Helen Hayes to be an impressionist -- roundish and impish, he charts a neutral performance course in conjuring his neighborhood cronies, relying on subtler cues in the text to make the people come alive -- a bit of the mimic's craft here would not be amiss.
The trouble is, his characters are all specific in the same ways; it's difficult, at times, to figure out where one person begins and another ends. And the 39-year-old Mr. Quinn, who is a genial but not especially warm presence, makes the dangerous assumption that you arrive at the theater well-versed in the kinds of people and situations he knows so well; his shorthand discussions of the seven sacraments, around which he structures the stories, will mystify many a non-Roman Catholic. He provides so little context in this piece, in fact, it's as if you had been invited to a friend's office party, where everyone is telling jokes about people you've never heard of. You want to laugh with them, but mostly what you feel is left out.
The monologue is set on a day in 1976 when a beloved veteran of the neighborhood, Jackie Ryan, has died, and the community gathers for his wake. One by one, Mr. Quinn sizes up the working-class Irish characters who made up his world. The respect he pays them is that the portraits are unvarnished. These are people who fall easily into black moods, who complain and curse with equal fluency, who view love as a bitter pill and a life's progress as falling naturally into the regulatory path of the Catholic Church.
"Here you had a group of people who had spent their whole lives doing what they were told, kept their mouths shut, beaten by the nuns and told that sex was bad," one of the characters explains. "Then 20 years later, when our marriages were filled with silence, violence and bad sex, we blamed each other."
Mr. Quinn's people are ferociously devoted to their narrow ways; they are fatalistic and terribly hard on one another. And they're brawlers who lash out madly at ideas that frighten them. At Jackie's wake, his pal Jimmy notes, "There was the sober Jackie, who played stickball with the neighborhood kids, and there was the Jackie three beers later who chased an Econoline van with a broken-off car antenna, because he thought he saw a peace sign on the window."
The storyteller is not a benign presence. The stories he selects do not portray these people in the most favorable light. They are a carelessly nasty crew. Aidan hisses "Whore!" at the boy who serves him the wrong drink; J. T. has sex on the grave of his grandmother. What binds these souls is a duty to religion, a sneering mistrust of the rest of the world and a sense that the way things are is just the way things are. These are small stories about small people, and they get a bit swallowed up on a Broadway stage. Perhaps in more intimate surroundings, the clear-eyed Mr. Quinn's tormented characters would cast bigger shadows.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Modest Agenda

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas, is the author of "Created Unequal: The Crisis in American Pay."

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Today is the last day of the Federal Reserve's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. And to my surprise, they have been discussing economic inequality.
Why surprise? Because in March 1997 the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, declared to Congress that there was no relationship between Federal Reserve policy and the increase in the wage gap. 
 "It is a development which I feel uncomfortable with," Mr. Greenspan said. "There is nothing monetary policy can do to address that, and it is outside the scope, so far as I am concerned, of the issues with which we deal."
Have things changed? Has the Federal Reserve now decided that it can and should address inequality?
It ought to. Unemployment, most economists agree, is affected by Fed policies. And over a very long time, back to 1920 in my calculations, unemployment rates have affected pay inequality. When unemployment rises, so does wage inequality. And when unemployment rates decrease, wage inequality goes down too.
Indeed, from the early 1970's through the mid-1980's, and again in the early 1990's, the Federal Reserve's unstable and high interest rates produced high unemployment and drove wage inequality up.
The recent record is much better. Since 1995, Federal Reserve policies have kept interest rates largely stable and allowed unemployment to fall. As history predicts, these policies have finally started to close the wage gap between rich and poor. Last year, for the first time, Americans with the lowest incomes experienced the highest rates of wage gain.
Of course, a rising minimum wage helped. Still, Mr. Greenspan and his team can rightly take some credit for progress on the inequality front.
Unfortunately, that has never been the Federal Reserve's line. Recently the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a report giving an experts' consensus on why earnings inequality rose in the 1980's and early 1990's. It blamed the rise on technology, trade, the decline in unions, immigration and the then-falling real minimum wage. Unemployment was not even offered as an explanation.
But most economists long ago agreed that rising trade with poor countries plays only a small role, since wage inequality also increased in sectors in which products are not traded internationally.
And even many of those who blame technology have been forced to back off. They had blamed computers for the wage gap, but the spread of computers was much too late and the rise in inequality was much too early, for this technology to have been the prime cause.
Today, the Asian and the Russian crises clearly threaten the American economy and our low rate of unemployment -- and the progress we've made on the wage front.
But the Federal Reserve isn't concerned enough yet to act. Its main focus is still on the phantom threat of inflation. At its meeting last week, the Fed decided properly not to raise rates, but apparently didn't consider cutting them. And unless there has been a radical shift in view, the virtues of full employment won't be high on the agenda in Jackson Hole.
At their mountain retreat, the Federal Reserve should forget about technology, trade and immigration, and focus on the policies it actually controls -- interest rates and their influence on economic growth and employment.
And then, at its next policy meeting, the Fed should make a sharp cut in interest rates. That would be the right first step.

HEADLINE: Time To Get Serious In Africa

BYLINE: By Chester A. Crocker; Chester A. Crocker, a professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University, was Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As we sift through the wreckage from terrorist bombs in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, and mount retaliatory strikes against the bad guys, we are reminded once again of our uniquely American vulnerability to terrorism. But the current turmoil in Central Africa, where rival African alliances are fighting for and against Laurent Kabila's Congo regime, should also serve as a lesson. We must not let a natural preoccupation with our own physical security blind us to the need for realistic policies in Africa that will deter or check the spread of conflict and protect our growing interests in the region.
If you listened only to the prose from official Washington, however, you would miss this point. We are urged to think in terms of an African "renaissance," a term coined by Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's designated successor in South Africa, to capture the idealism of a new generation of African leaders. 
 Having devoted 12 days to a Presidential trip to the region in March, and with African trade legislation supported by both parties pending in Congress, the White House is at pains to move beyond the basket-case stereotypes and accentuate the positive in Africa. Our declared role is to engage with African nations as partners, not proxies or pawns, and to help bring them into the global mainstream.
Accordingly, we are stressing open markets as a way to forge economic links, we are promoting democracy and human rights, and we are trying to strengthen the ability of African countries to resolve their own conflicts. There is merit in some of this rhetorical repositioning. Africa is diversifying. From a history of authoritarianism and stagnation, the majority of African countries now have growing economies and liberalized political systems. The United States is poised like no other nation to enjoy the fruits of engagement with a successful Africa -- if such a thing emerges.
The problem is that 10 years after the Berlin Wall came down, the United States still has not decided how to attain these goals -- and ignores the bigger problems. State Department officials speak of the region's "remaining" conflicts as if they were an endangered species.
But nearly all of Africa's most important countries -- Algeria, Angola, Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Sudan -- are caught up in domestic strife or external conflict. The renewed fighting in Congo directly affects conflicts in six neighboring countries -- with potentially devastating consequences for the broader African region. There will be no African renaissance unless these conflicts are resolved and some new and reasonably predictable basis for stability and legitimate order emerges.
In this decade, the United States has tried to end conflict and to promote democracy in many different ways. We withdrew our support from cold war era autocrats, like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia, and tacitly encouraged their enemies and neighbors to seize power. But as we're seeing now in Congo, this led to factional strife over the carcass of the abandoned, "failed" state.
In Somalia, which was descending into clan warfare, we tried muscular humanitarian intervention in the form of United Nations-authorized peace enforcement. After 18 troops were killed, however, we spent much of the next five years discouraging, blocking and sabotaging proposals for robust military action in countries like Rwanda, where no other action could have stopped genocidal violence.
Instead, in Rwanda, we tried narrowly circumscribed humanitarian action, providing security for refugee camps in eastern Congo. This did nothing but make the problems worse, as Hutu militias, living off and among the refugees, mounted fresh attacks against Rwanda. In Angola, four years of diplomacy by the United States and peacekeeping by the United Nations have not yet brought an end to civil war.
In the mid-1990's, faced with a recalcitrant, Islamist regime in the Sudan engaged in terrorist alliances and a 40-year civil war, we encouraged the country's neighbors -- Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda -- to coalesce behind rebel movements and offered them token support like radios and boots. But however popular the United States posture of alignment against Khartoum may be, it has hardly proved to be a winning strategy, and now two of our allies -- Ethiopia and Eritrea -- are distracted from the Sudan front by their own border dispute.
Our African policy has advocated political reconciliation and negotiated solutions. Our envoys have crisscrossed the region when crises erupted -- a conspicuous demonstration of American concern. But we haven't had a strategic concept beyond supporting good guys, and we haven't followed up with anything more tangible that would give credibility to our rhetoric. Indeed, we have increasingly encouraged Africans to take the lead, which signals our own reluctance to do so.
Backing "African solutions" is fine where they have the possibility of leading to durable and legitimate outcomes. But the turmoil in Central and East Africa should remind us that the much acclaimed "new generation" of leaders in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa and Namibia may have sharply differing agendas. They have little in common apart from having gained power through struggle and having an inclination -- recklessly winked at by Washington -- to ignore established frontiers.
Admittedly, Africa is a messy and confusing place in which to engage in conflict management. It is not axiomatic that American leadership is appropriate in all cases, nor that it would be popular in Africa or at home. But that is not the point.
The point is that "African policy lite" isn't working very well. There have been few successes since Namibia, South Africa and Mozambique turned to peace and democracy earlier this decade.
Goodwill visits and innovative trade initiatives are not enough to assure Africa's economic turnaround. Enhanced stability and vigorous conflict management are prerequisites to a regional renaissance.
It is time to consider how we can make sure that all parties -- the good, the not-so-good and the downright awful -- take us more seriously and cooperate in making peace.
This will require leading by example, using all our considerable diplomatic resources to create a coherent way of controlling conflict. It means using our power to influence our closest allies and our most venal of enemies. In the final analysis, we should be on our side, backing our own concepts and principles.

HEADLINE: The Worldwide Stock Plunge

 BODY:
Panics are never pretty, and the one now going on in financial markets around the world is no exception. In virtually every stock market, prices fell sharply yesterday.
In recent years, plunges in world markets have often been halted in the United States, where individual investors have stepped in to buy because they were confident that stock prices would rebound. It appears they have been less eager to do so this summer, although there is no indication that there has been a lot of selling by such investors. 
 While the immediate cause of the panic is the default and financial chaos in Russia, it also comes at a time of growing economic weakness around the world. Recessions in Asia appear to be getting worse, and while the United States' economy has continued to grow, the Government reported yesterday that after-tax corporate profits were down in the second quarter from the same period a year ago. That is the first such decline since 1989, just before the country's last recession.
Over the past year there has been a gradual increase in concern among investors, which has shown itself in a flight to quality. The most established economies, in the United States and Western Europe, have until recently seen the prices of their biggest stocks rise, while shares of smaller companies did less well and other stock markets suffered. Now that flight to quality has turned into a stampede, and all stock markets look suspect to investors, while only the safest bonds seem attractive.
Whatever investors do in coming days, the important question is what will happen to the world's economies. Preventing a worldwide downturn will require a revitalized International Monetary Fund, and may require the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates in this country, despite its worries about inflation. With commodity prices at a 21-year low, inflation is not the major concern now.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE BANKS;
Republic Says Loss in Russia Will Erase Quarter's Profits

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Adding to anxiety about the risk banks are facing around the world, the Republic New York Corporation, considered one of the most conservatively managed banks in the United States, said yesterday that its losses in Russia would wipe out all of its third-quarter earnings.
Although Republic, which trades in some of the world's most exotic markets, was the only bank to disclose losses in Russia yesterday, it was hardly the only bank stock to suffer from the fears of shareholders. Investors, reacting to a confluence of real or expected economic downturns in several regions, have concluded that the financial risks facing banks in the near future are too worrisome. They fled bank stocks with a vengeance yesterday. 
 "It's like the entire world just got a margin call and everyone is stampeding out of emerging markets," said David Berry, a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "Everybody wants their money back at the same time. The 90's are over."
Banks were not the only companies feeling the heat. Shares of leading brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter sank yesterday, with losses in the shares of Lehman Brothers outpacing the group. Lehman plunged $7.25, or 12.6 percent, to $50.4375.
An individual close to Lehman's trading operation said the firm expected a "several million dollar" loss on a Latin American swap transaction involving the Russian ruble. This person said that emerging-markets turmoil might reduce third-quarter earnings by about 11 percent from the company's earlier projections. A Lehman spokesman declined to comment.
Republic said it planned to take a $110 million pretax charge in the quarter for losses related to a sharp drop in the value of short-term Russian treasury bills known as GKO's.
Republic, which earned about $119 million in the second quarter, also said it would take a charge of $45 million against reserves because of "current and anticipated Russian counterparty defaults." Republic declined to specify what that charge involved, but analysts said the language suggested losses on derivatives.
In a separate announcement, Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a private European banking unit that is 49 percent owned by Republic, said it would take a third-quarter charge of $65.9 million because of losses in Russia.
Republic is controlled by Edmond J. Safra, a legendary banker whose family has been involved in the industry for more than 150 years. It is also one of the trading houses favored by George Soros, one of the world's leading currency speculators. Mr. Soros's investment company announced yesterday that it had lost about $2 billion in Russia over the last year. Republic and Mr. Soros's company declined to comment on any trading Mr. Soros may have done through the bank.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Republic plunged $4.625, or 9.23 percent, to $45.50. Other bank stocks were also battered, continuing more than a monthlong slide born out of concern about economic problems in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Shares of J. P. Morgan plunged $13.1875, or 11.2 percent, to $104.75; Chase Manhattan fell $6.125, or 9.5 percent, to $58.125; Bankers Trust fell $8.3125, or 9 percent, to $83.8125; Citicorp fell $11.875, or 8.9 percent, to $122; BankBoston dropped $2.375, or 5.74 percent, to $39, and BankAmerica fell $3.875, or 5 percent, to $73.75.
The losses in Russia are an unaccustomed, though not unheard of, blow for Republic, the nation's 21st-largest bank, with about $60 billion in assets. Mr. Safra, 66, chairman of Safra Republic, owns 28.5 percent of Republic New York.
Although Republic maintains a traditional branch network in New York, its more intriguing businesses are in private banking, precious metals trading and financial services it performs for securities firms and highly volatile hedge funds. Many hedge funds, like those of Mr. Soros, have been battered recently in emerging markets like Russia, and their losses may have been felt by Republic.
"It's one thing for J. P. Morgan or Bankers Trust to make an announcement like this because they're usually much more active in those markets," said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with Tucker Anthony, a research and brokerage firm, in Portland, Me. "But Republic, and rightfully so, has always been perceived as far more cautious and conservative. For this to happen to them is a real shock."
But this is not the first time Republic's trading operation has suffered a setback. A Federal judge in New York recently forced the bank to pay more than $13.5 million to two wealthy Pakistani investors, who contended that the bank had mishandled trading accounts involving complex currency transactions.
Despite the disastrous effect losses in Russia are having on Republic's earnings, most of the largest American banks have ample cushions to absorb any losses there.
Citicorp and Chase, for example, each earned more than $1 billion in this year's second quarter and said they had $420 million and about $500 million, respectively, in exposure to Russia.
Analysts said J. P. Morgan, which earned $402 million in the second quarter, had exposure of less than $400 million in Russia, but it is also one of the world's biggest traders and underwriters of emerging-markets debt and could be more severely hurt by problems in other countries.
Bankers Trust, which declined to comment on its earnings outlook, may be one of the most vulnerable big banks in Russia. Analysts said the bank, which earned $164 million in the second quarter, had exposure in Russia of roughly $1 billion, including about $500 million to hedge funds.
Russia is only part of the mix when it comes to investor worries about economic developments overseas, and those worries are not likely to be put to rest until banks and other companies begin reporting third-quarter earnings in October.

HEADLINE: Eliminating Hidden Weapons;
Illusory Inspections in Iraq

 BODY:
The resignation of Scott Ritter, a top American inspector on the United Nations team charged with penetrating Iraq's deadly-weapons program, is the latest and most dramatic warning that the Clinton Administration and the U.N. are abandoning a firm approach toward President Saddam Hussein. Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. inspection team, and Mohammed el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have previously warned that the inspectors could no longer guarantee they had Iraq's weapons programs adequately policed. Now Mr. Ritter charges that the inspections designed to ferret out hidden weapons have become an illusion.
The United States has blocked aggressive inspections while it tries to build a consensus for firm action in the U.N. Security Council. But prolonged delay is dangerous, giving Iraq precious time to build biological or chemical weapons without being detected. Aggressive inspections must be resumed promptly, and if additional military forces are needed in the gulf region to lend credible support to the inspectors, they need to be provided. 
 From 1991 to last year, Washington fought off other nations' efforts to weaken the inspections. On several occasions when Iraq balked, America's threats brought it into line again. Now Mr. Ritter charges that American officials sought to stop him and others from carrying out sensitive missions and that Saddam Hussein has found a "witting partner" in the U.N. Security Council.
The Administration argues that a drop in political support for military intervention, both at home and abroad, has forced it to explore diplomatic options and seek support on the Security Council before considering the use of military threats and force. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has argued that Mr. Hussein is still losing the struggle because the economic sanctions on Iraq will remain.
But sanctions are not an end in themselves, merely a means to compel Mr. Hussein to cooperate. His willingness to live with sanctions is a measure of the importance he places on acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Sanctions and diplomacy cannot work unless backed by the threat of force -- if necessary, by the United States alone.
The Administration must not let its diplomacy drift into dangerous delay. Even a few more weeks free of inspections might allow Mr. Hussein to revive construction of a biological, chemical or nuclear weapon. As Washington contemplates an extended war against terrorism, it cannot give in to a man who specializes in the unthinkable.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
With Its Dollar Plummeting, Canada Raises Its Key Rate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 27

 BODY:
After weeks of hesitation, Canada's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point today in an effort to halt the slide of the Canadian dollar, which has lost more than 10 percent of its value against the United States dollar this year.
Despite the increase in the overnight lending rate to 6 percent, the Canadian dollar swooned again, to 63.34 United States cents in New York, from 63.79 cents on Wednesday, leading many analysts to question the effectiveness of the central bank's actions and to worry about its effect on the national economy. 
 "I don't think it will help at all," said Jeffrey Cheah, a financial market analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto. "Consumer confidence is already at very low levels because the currency is depreciating almost every day. This will just compound the lack of consumer confidence in Canada."
The stock market did not help matters either, with the Toronto Stock Exchange following the sharp decline of other markets. The exchange's index of 300 stocks fell 372.84 points, or 6.04 percent, to 5,799.46.
John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said the central bank had wanted to ride out current conditions, thinking higher interest rates were unnecessary because the Canadian economy was slowing anyway.
The Canadian dollar -- called a loonie because the dollar coin bears the image of a common loon -- has been battered by contraction in the commodities market and problems in Asia and Russia. On Wednesday, it suffered its biggest one-day loss in three years, falling 0.73 cent, to 63.79 cents, an all-time low.
"That's when the Bank of Canada said: 'Enough is enough. We go,' " Mr. McCallum said.
Canada's largest banks quickly followed suit and raised prime lending rates one percentage point to match the central bank's move.
In a statement released today, the Bank of Canada indicated that the continuing slide in the value of the dollar represented a diminishing confidence in Canadian investments.
"Today's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence, while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the present noninflationary expansion of the economy," the bank's statement said.
The rate increase was the first in more than eight months.
Like many other analysts, Mr. McCallum sees raising interest rates as a fairly useless move in the face of so many other problems around the world. "We're in the eye of a storm, with Russia crumbling and Asia suffering through difficult times," Mr. McCallum said. "These are forces beyond our control. If we try to resist with interest rate hikes, what we will get are negative effects on our economy."
Until now, the Canadian economy has managed to retain much of its strength despite the currency troubles. With practically no inflation and a federal budget surplus, analysts had expected growth to be relatively brisk this year, until today's announcement.
"We will be revising our G.D.P. estimates downward," Mr. Cheah said. "The interest rate hike is not going to have an immediate impact but will be most strongly felt three to six months from now."
The economic effect of the higher interest rates will be offset somewhat by the advantages of a cheaper dollar, which helps exports and tourism, Mr. McCallum said.
Many analysts expect the loonie to continue losing value, but how far it will slide is anybody's guess.

Big State, Big Dreams, Big Talk

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
I love NY as much as the next guy. But still I don't quite get it.
With Gov. George E. Pataki penning his memoirs and fund-raising around the country and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wowing Iowans, what was for months a matter of speculation -- and in some circles incredulity -- now seems all but irrefutable. New York has not one but two Republican leaders with dreams of the White House dancing in their heads. 
 As the goal of their itineraries has in recent weeks become more explicit, so, too, has their message.
"Our approach works for this city, this state," Mr. Pataki said recently, addressing a group of national Republican leaders gathered in Manhattan, "and will work for the people of America as well."
John H. Gross, the Mayor's longtime campaign treasurer, meanwhile, has described Mr. Giuliani's travels as an opportunity to spread the Good News across the land. "The purpose of the trips is to tell people the story of the successes in New York City and to help influence the Republican Party to accept his views on economic and social issues."
That both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani are so busy taking credit for the same list of accomplishments -- reviving the economy, lowering taxes, cutting crime and reducing the welfare rolls -- is, of course, a little awkward. One can only imagine how an audience in Des Moines or Concord, N.H., will sort out their competing claims. But in some ways, that's the least of it.
If voters in most parts of the country were presented with some of New York's vital statistics, they would probably have a hard time figuring out what all the fuss is about.
CONSIDER the following figures. According to the most recent Federal surveys, New York now ranks 39th among states in job growth. It is 25th in personal income growth. By contrast, its outstanding publicly financed debt -- $35 billion and rising fast -- is far and away the largest of any state's and translates, on a per capita basis, into the country's fourth highest debt burden.
In terms of taxes, New York's record is even less boastworthy. Though the rates have dropped recently, New Yorkers are, experts say, still paying a higher proportion of their income in combined state and local taxes than anyone else in the country.
Thus, while the New York economy has improved, that improvement hardly seems much to crow about. As Hal Hovey, the editor of State Budget and Tax News, put it: "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to be associated with a national economic recovery. By all these measures, New York is doing worse than other states." All in all, Mr. Hovey, who has spent a lifetime compiling such comparative statistics, ranks New York 35th in a cumulative measurement he calls "economic momentum."
New York's drop in crime stands up a lot better in state-by-state comparisons. Still, it, too, reflects a national trend that appears to be part demographics, part tougher policing and part mystery.
At the same time, many of New York's other intractable problems continue to seem just that. The succession of New York City schools chancellors has, for example, in no way altered the fundamental fact that few who can afford not to -- including the Mayor himself -- send their children to public schools in the city.
Just this week, the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, estimated that it would cost the city $90 billion over the next decade to repair its neglected infrastructure, a figure almost twice what it is actually planning to spend. And even as the welfare rolls in New York have been substantially reduced, the income gap in the state remains one of the highest in the nation, a disparity that is obvious to anyone who has walked 20 blocks in Manhattan.
So what motivates all the grand talk about what New York has to offer the rest of the nation?
The most generous account would be that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki have simply been carried away by their own enthusiasm. Many good things have occurred in New York during their tenure, and in overestimating the global significance of their accomplishments, they are, well, typical New Yorkers.
Less charitably, there is room to wonder whether the exaggeration is calculated, a deliberate misrepresentation of the state of the state driven by personal ambition. Such things, after all, do happen.
Remember the "Massachusetts Miracle," anyone?

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE EMERGING ECONOMIES;
Already-Shaky Markets in Latin America Drop Even Further

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stock markets in Latin America plunged yesterday, raising more doubts about whether the region will be able to survive the economic crisis that has swamped Asia and is now pulling Russia to its knees. Currency declines in Mexico and the fear of a devaluation in Brazil are also adding pressure.
The answer is not only important to the Governments and citizens of Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, who have fought back with economic reforms since the drubbing they took in the wake of the Mexican peso devaluation in 1994-95. 
 Latin America is also a region whose consumers are big buyers of American exports and if their pace slows down that will put another drag on the American economy.
Mexico alone is one of America's top three export markets and the peso's plunge to record lows is surely going to curb buying, as the weaker peso raises the cost of American goods. The peso has fallen 10 percent in value since the end of July.
"If emerging markets get weaker, that takes away a leg from under U.S. corporate earnings," said Christopher D. Alderson, head of emerging markets at Rowe Price Fleming in London.
In Brazil, the Bovespa index dropped 10 percent and is now down 39.5 percent since the end of July. In Mexico, the chief market index fell 6.1 percent and is off 34.6 percent since July 17, the day that the Dow Jones industrial average hit its recent record high. Argentina's Merval index fell 10.6 percent and the Venezuelan stock market index dropped 9.2 percent.
A lot of the equity selling in Latin America, analysts said yesterday, is being forced by the need of hedge funds to raise cash to pay off loans they took out to make big bets in Russia.
As fast as stock markets are falling, Latin American bond markets are keeping up, which is forcing interest rates higher. According to the J. P. Morgan emerging market bond index, the difference, or spread, between the rates on United States Treasuries and those on Latin American government bonds is 13 percentage points, putting rates on long-term Latin American bonds at more than 18 percent.
This surge in rates since the beginning of August will add to a country's borrowing costs and, more importantly, will make it harder for Latin American countries to roll over their current foreign debt as it comes due in the months ahead.
A lot of the focus in the near term will be on Brazil. Mr. Alderson said that Brazil has around $50 billion in short-term debt that has to be refinanced over the next several months. And as the time for rollovers approaches, international investors are likely to get more jittery.
Brazil is also critical to the outlook for all emerging markets because it is seen as the country that is the most vulnerable to a currency devaluation. The devaluation in Russia, which economically is less important than Brazil, has sent a shock wave through emerging markets. A Brazilian devaluation would probably do much more damange.
The rout in Latin America yesterday was mirrored in other emerging markets. In Eastern Europe, the stock market in Hungary plunged 14.4 percent, the market in Poland dropped 6.1 percent and the main index in the Czech Republic fell 6.8 percent. The RTS index in Russia plunged 17.1 percent and is off 84 percent for the year.
In Asia, the key emerging markets were off much less, falling in the 1 percent range. But that may have been because they were closed before the full brunt of the negative news from Russia yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: MARKET PLACE;
NoRefuge in Plunging Commodity Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
While global stock markets plunged, a major index of commodity prices, on products from oil to cotton, fell to its lowest level in 21 years yesterday. And that may be more worrisome for investors in the long run than yesterday's 4.19 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Each tick down in the price of oil, copper, cotton and gold puts more economic pressure on the nations where they are produced. And many of the major producers are the emerging-market countries experiencing deep financial crisis, like Russia, which is a leading exporter of oil and precious metals, or countries considered vulnerable, like Mexico, which is also a big oil producer. 
 Already, commodity prices have fallen 20 percent in the last year and heightened concern about the economies and markets of developing nations that began with Asian currency selloffs in the second half of 1997. "It's a flu, it's catching; it's dominoes," said William Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Not only is the psychology spreading, but the economic weakness is spreading."
Yesterday's drop in commodities came as markets around the world tumbled and Russia's economic crisis deepened. Millions of investors, seeking to flee the turmoil, rushed to the relative safety of United States Treasury securities, pushing long-term yields to their lowest level in 30 years or more.
For the American investor worried about the strength of the economy, which by all current signs is still strong, and corporate earnings, which have been weakening, so far the fall in commodity prices and the drop in interest rates have been good news.
The lower prices for commodities, while tough on emerging-market and other producing nations, have lowered corporate costs here and spurred consumer spending. And the damage that had been done to commodity producers in the United States has not had a big impact on the economy.
The fall in interest rates has also been positive for the economy, by bolstering housing and capital investment. Thirty-year mortgage rates have now been below 7 percent for more than two months. Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.34 percent, the lowest for long-term yields in three decades. The 10-year note's yield, a benchmark for home mortgage rates, fell to 5.06 percent, its lowest since 1967.
These forces have, so far, have more than offset the drag from the Asian economic crisis, which has led to a sharp drop in demand for American exports. And this is one reason the economy has slowed much less than many economists expected in the last six months.
But with the global economic and market turmoil spreading from Asia to Russia to Latin America, it appears less likely, some analysts said, that the positives of lower interest rates and low commodity prices would be sufficient to offset the drag from a global economic slowdown on American corporate profits.
Already, many economic forecasters who had bet on the offsetting effect from lower commodity prices and lower interest rates have been scaling back their economic forecasts for the second half of the year. And a steep fall in United States stock prices, which would dampen consumer spending, might force a further scaling back, which would not be good for corporate earnings.
"Unless you correct the problems" in Asia and Russia, said Richard Berner, chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, "the stimulus will be a minor offset."
The backwash from the Russian turmoil pushed the Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge Index of 17 commodities down 1.88 points yesterday, to 196.24, the lowest since December 1977, a year of sharp declines in agricultural prices that led to farmer protests.
The impact from the commodity price decline has gone beyond the emerging economies. In Canada, a major commodity producer, the currency dropped to another record low, forcing the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate a full percentage point, to 6 percent. The increase also helped send the Toronto Stock Exchange index down more than 6 percent.
Two forces have been pushing commodity prices lower and will continue to do so, several analysts said yesterday. One is the falling demand from Asian nations, which, for example, were major consumers of copper for new construction. The other is that countries in deep trouble, like Russia, are expected to sell what they can to raise money, adding to the supply in an already weak market.
William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch, said there had been big sales of platinum and palladium by Russia in Japan and sales of gold and silver in Zurich and London. The crisis, he said, "inspires them to sell as much as possible." The Government controls much of the country's precious metals.
The selling by Russia had an odd twist. Gold had been thought of for years as refuge in the time of political and economic crises, and a few gold bugs still hold that belief. But yesterday, the price of gold plunged, dropping to a 19-year low on the spot market in London at $276.55 an ounce, down $5.70.
Commodity selling is also coming from countries like Australia whose currency also fell to a record low yesterday. But because most commodities are priced in dollars, the weaker Australian dollar means that gold and other commodity sellers can reap nice profits when the sales are translated back into Australian dollars.
This all means that commodity prices -- and the pain that they are bringing to already troubled economies -- still have a way to go before they hit bottom. "I don't think we are there yet," Mr. Berner of Mellon Bank said.

Graphs: "From Bad to Worse"
Amid the turmoil in world stock markets, commodities prices have collapsed as well. Driven by the fear that there is no other safe place to put their money, investors have turned to the U.S. Treasury market, helping to push yields down to their lowest levels in years.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Washington Stands By, Keeping Its Head Down

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
When Russia was the heartland of what Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire, bent on spreading Communist dogma and power around the globe, the United States developed economic, military and diplomatic weapons to contain and eventually to help eliminate the danger.
Now Russia once again constitutes a threat to the rest of the world. Its inability to manage its economy has destabilized stock and currency markets from Moscow to Wall Street. 
 And the Russian Government itself is tottering, raising the possibility that Russia might turn away from its ill-starred experiment with democracy and return to its centuries-old tradition of authoritarian leadership. This, of course, is a nation that still maintains an enormous nuclear arsenal.
But there was no emergency mobilization in Washington, no metaphorical red light flashing at the White House, no public sense that the United States must take urgent steps to protect the interests of the industrialized nations.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright made only the briefest of comments, in an informal setting. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, held a news conference in which he answered a number of questions about Russia, but the announced topic of the session was anti-American terrorism in Africa.
Neither President Clinton, who was making a speech in Worcester, Mass., about crime, nor Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who was fishing in the West, dropped everything to rush back to Washington. Indeed, Mr. Clinton seemed a bit at sea when reporters called questions to him about reports that President Boris N. Yeltsin might resign soon.
That is not the way it was when the cold war heated up.
Vice President Al Gore was also out of town, as were most members of Congress. It is true that the Russian meltdown had the impertinence to happen in August, when Washington, Paris, London and Bonn become ghost towns, with politicians and bureaucrats taking to the hills or sunning by the seashore.
One larger truth here is that in the current Russian crisis, as in many other post-cold-war crises, there is not all that much the United States can do.
A second larger truth, also important, is the Monica Lewinsky matter.
For the record, the Administration has steadfastly denied, like all Administrations rocked by scandal, that the Lewinsky affair has in any way affected the workings of government. But individual government officials, high and low, tell a different story. For a month now, they -- and indeed much of Washington -- has been curiously detached from the ebb and flow of events worldwide.
"You put your head down, stay in your corner and hope none of this muck rubs off on you," a State Department official said last week. "It is not an atmosphere conducive to good staff morale or to creative policy making."
Priorities change in subtle ways. Little attention is paid, except by those directly involved in this fall's elections. With very few exceptions, such as medical care, domestic policy issues have fallen by the wayside.
Mr. Clinton's mind is focused, his aides have implied, not so much on affairs of state as on the urgent necessity to repair relationships with his wife and daughter and to rebuild his own political standing. Otherwise it is hard to believe that he would not have felt compelled to return to Washington from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to show that he was engaged in the Russian problem, however limited his options.
Traditionally, Presidents are loath to be seen relaxing, however unreasonable this may be, when great events are under way in the world.
As it happens, Mr. Yeltsin has been as badly weakened as Mr. Clinton has by recent events. Which raises the question: In that situation, is there any real point to carrying on with the summit conference scheduled for next week? A number of Russian scholars said they doubted anything could be accomplished, but Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, suggested that the meeting could provide "a critical opportunity for these two Presidents, who are hanging on the ropes, a unique opportunity to demonstrate to their countries and to the world that they retain the power of presidential leadership."
If so, that would be most welcome to Mr. Clinton, and not only because it would take people's minds off his sexual misadventures.
President Clinton and his aides have had to cope in recent weeks with a whole spectrum of frustrating issues where the United States, though by no means bereft of clout, lacks easy answers. Huff and puff as it might, Washington is no closer today than it was a year ago to ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. For all the allied promises to end ethnic cleansing, it continues in Kosovo. And anti-terrorism measures without number did not prevent the sickening explosion outside the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania this month.
Circumstances differ from case to case, of course. In some situations, building or maintaining alliances has proved difficult. In others, the United States has tried to work through international organizations whose attempted solutions failed. In still others, existing problems have been compounded by errors or ineptitude in American policy. But whatever the specifics, the new reality -- economic crises in Asia and Russia, nasty local wars, often fueled by generations of hatred, and strikes by terrorists -- have proved a lot more difficult to handle than seemed likely in the euphoria at the cold war's end.
It is, of course, a richly paradoxical situation: helped by its allies, the United States wins the cold war, develops an economy of unprecedented productivity, emerges as the world's only superpower yet finds itself less powerful than before, not more so -- if one measures power in terms of capacity to influence the course of events abroad.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW;
MARKETS JOLTED, DOW OFF 4.1% AS THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC SLIDE ADDS TO PRESSURES ON YELTSIN

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Stock market investors around the world, frightened by the depth of Russia's economic turmoil and its possibly contagious effect on Latin America, rushed for the exits yesterday in search of safer places to put their money.
In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.19 percent, or 357.36 points, to close at 8,165.99. The Nasdaq fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent. 
 With the Dow average now 12.5 percent below its July 17 high of 9,337.97, investors are well into what Wall Street calls a correction. Bear market territory -- defined as a stock price decline of 15 percent to 20 percent -- is at hand.
Investors struggled to absorb the full impact of Russia's economic woes -- its central bank has stopped supporting the ruble and has suspended payments on some debt. Institutions that had bought the country's debt saw the value of their holdings fall to around 10 percent of its worth just last week.
But the fear that the economic unraveling in Russia could spread to the emerging-market countries of Latin America acted as the greatest depressant on stocks worldwide. Indeed, investors everywhere wondered which economy would be the next to crumple.
Major markets fell, with the exception of Hong Kong. In Europe, key indexes fell 3 percent to 6 percent, with the DAX in Germany dropping 4.5 percent. Latin America's markets were punished even more, with Mexico's main index falling 6 percent and Brazil's nearly 10 percent.
Disappointment over Japan's inability to repair its broken-down economy drove the Nikkei 225 index down 3.04 percent long before trading began in the United States. Policy paralysis seems to have overtaken Japanese politicians, who appear unwilling to take steps to solve their country's well-documented economic and banking problems. The Nikkei has fallen 16.5 percent this year from its March high.
When the stock market opened in the United States, traders and money managers reported a flood of early selling, selling that continued in waves all day. Even though stock prices revived briefly several times, few, if any, buyers were willing to hunt for bargains. The market closed at its low, a sign of overwhelming market weakness and a sign of caution for the day. In percentage terms, the drop in the Dow was the largest since last October and the 15th-largest one-day decline since 1945.
Stocks of big international banks, which were down an average of 6.6 percent, were among the hardest hit on fears of Russia-related losses. But rampant selling ravaged even the most-favored stocks, such as Coca-Cola, General Electric and Microsoft, as well as the Internet darlings Excite Inc. and Amazon.com.
The suffering of the healthiest companies can be attributed in part to selling by investors who had to raise cash because of losses on their emerging-market investments. An investor who faces losses after borrowing heavily to make foreign investments that are plunging typically sells whatever he can. Often that means the biggest, most liquid investment. Or the investment that still shows a profit.
It is a vicious circle, said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in New York. "People are becoming increasingly risk averse, leading to lower equity prices, increasing pressure on emerging market economies. Absent right now is any mechanism to break that dynamic up." As a result, Mr. Dudley suggests that investors brace for more market declines.
The bad news started early. At 9:46 A.M., shares in the Republic New York Corporation, the parent of Republic National Bank of New York, were halted from trading. Minutes later, the bank announced it would take a $110 million charge in the third quarter for losses in Russian government bonds. The loss would virtually eliminate earnings for the period, the bank said.
Suddenly, it became clear that the ultimate impact of the Russian disaster was still unknown. If Republic Bank, known for its strong balance sheet and conservative lending practices, was hurt by Russia, what would happen to more aggressive lenders?
With that announcement, Republic Bank became the first domestic bank to enumerate its Russian losses. Market historians noted that Republic was also the first domestic bank, back in the mid-1980's, to reveal the extent of its exposure to lesser-developed country debt that later hammered Citicorp and many other American banks.
Investors in financial stocks yesterday found themselves in a nightmarish version of the child's game of hot potato. Exposure to Russia's ruble devaluation and debt is only starting to be defined. And since many of the losses will be taken by investors who bought or sold derivative securities, where the parties who took the other side of a given trade are not immediately identifiable, it could be weeks before it is known who is on the hook for what may be $100 billion in losses.
Some investors wondered why a country as economically inconsequential as Russia should play such a big role in world market turmoil. While Russia wields nuclear firepower, it accounts for just 1 percent of the world's trade, roughly equivalent to that of Denmark.
Analysts noted, though, that what happened in Russia could very well replay in the emerging markets of Latin America. When investors see their portfolios lose 90 percent of their value, as those holding Russian debt have, two things happen.
First, other emerging markets are likely to be dragged down as well, as investors revalue assets to what they see as the new economic reality. Then, as those assets are repriced, investors and lenders withdraw from the markets, cutting off companies' access to capital and making financing more expensive for governments.
Russia's default also made it painfully obvious that the International Monetary Fund is no longer ready or able to bail out countries in economic despair. Bailouts in Korea, Malaysia and Thailand had lulled investors into believing that the I.M.F. was effectively a guarantor of their investments.
So what investors are facing now is the very thing Wall Street fears the most: the unknown. The devil it knows, an imploding Russia in this case, is bad enough. The devil it doesn't know, what other economic disasters lie ahead, say, in Latin America, is considerably worse.
Indeed, all eyes are on Latin America. That's because a crisis in these nations would strike a severe blow to both American investors and corporations. Some 25 percent of Brazil's $300 billion in domestic debt, for example, is held by foreign investors. More important, around 20 percent of United States exports go to Latin America.
Even in the United States, the stock market carnage is worse than it first appears. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette reported yesterday that the average stock was down 38 percent from its high.
One money manager said that the selling was overdone and the result of investors in the past buying stocks only because they are going up. "People have been investing by the direction of earnings and not looking at value," said David Eidelman, at Eidelman, Finger, Harris & Company in St. Louis. "If earnings are going higher, they buy. But when they start to see earnings come down, they look at the direction not the value. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, these investors, so-called momentum players, know the price of everything and the value of nothing."
Contributing to the slide, brokerage firms asked investors who had borrowed to buy stocks to prop up their depleted portfolios with more cash, known as margin calls.
More than one professional trader said that yesterday's action in United States stocks was reminiscent of the beginning of the end of the great bull market of the late 1960's and early 1970's. These traders recalled that the 1973 bear market, which removed 45 percent from the Dow Jones industrial average, did not begin in earnest until stocks like Polaroid, Avon and I.B.M. crumbled.
This time, about 15 stocks -- including Dell Computer, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems -- had held up while the rest of the United States market had fallen. Yesterday, even these shares fell hard.

Bureaucratic Tangle Is Faulted in Air Crash
A crash of a commuter plane near Detroit last year, which took 29 lives, probably could have been prevented if the F.A.A. had put into effect the lessons learned from a similar crash two year earlier, Federal safety officials said.

HEADLINE: Second-Quarter Economic Growth Faster Than Estimated

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
The economy grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than previously estimated, even though it was weighed down by the strikes at the General Motors Corporation and slower exports to Asia.
Gross domestic product rose at a revised 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said today. That was higher than the initial estimate of 1.4 percent released on July 31, although it was still well below the first quarter's stellar 5.5 percent growth rate. 
 Growth in the final two quarters of the year will probably average no better than 2.5 percent at an annual rate, analysts said. "We have two forces clashing" -- strong consumer demand and the slowdown from the Asian turmoil, said James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association in Washington. "One is going to have to dominate over the other, and I think it's going to be Asia."
The estimate for second-quarter economic growth was revised because more complete figures showed higher consumer spending on services and a narrower June trade deficit, which offset slower growth in business inventories, analysts said. The report also showed that corporate earnings rose and inflation remained under control.
Gross domestic product measures the total value of goods and service produced in the country.
Even after the revision, second-quarter growth in gross domestic product was the weakest since a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter of 1995.
Exports fell 7.4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, the second consecutive quarterly drop. In the first quarter, exports declined 2.8 percent. Imports rose 10 percent after increasing 15.7 percent in the first quarter.
Taken together, the drops in exports and imports subtracted 2.1 percentage points from second-quarter economic growth.
Separately today, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing for jobless claims unexpectedly fell by 6,000 last week, to 297,000. That surprised analysts, who were forecasting a rise of 1,000, and suggested that employment growth had yet to slow.
What happens next to the economy will depend in large part on the spending patterns of consumers. An abundance of jobs, low interest rates, low inflation and falling import prices have so far kept consumers in a buying mood. But a slump in stock prices since the middle of July, along with an intensifying of economic problems overseas, contributed to a decline in consumer confidence this month.
"We're still seeing evidence of strong consumer spending, a booming housing market, and we're going to get a rebound from the G.M. strike," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. Offsetting those positives will be weakness in exports and an increase in imports, he said.
Inflation was subdued in the second quarter, today's G.D.P. report showed. The price deflator, a measure of price increases, grew at a revised eight-tenths of 1 percent, at an annual rate, in the quarter, down from an initial estimate of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The economic slowdown from the first quarter took a toll on corporate profits. Second-quarter after-tax earnings, reported by the Commerce Department for the first time today, increased three-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Youth March Organizer, Celebrating Ruling, Taunts Giuliani

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
One day after a judge ruled that the Million Youth March could proceed next weekend in Harlem, the chief organizer attacked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for trying to block the event, calling him "an ordinary cracker" who "chose to ignore the law."
In a speech before reporters and about 20 supporters of the march, the organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, said he wanted young black people who attend to be courteous and respectful. He said that above all, the march would be a show of "love and unity among black people." 
 But Mr. Muhammad took every opportunity during his 30-minute speech to bait Mr. Giuliani, who has condemned him in recent weeks for making numerous anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks.
"There's no need to be afraid of Rudy Giuliani any longer," Mr. Muhammad said, speaking at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem. "This cracker knows the law, but he chose to ignore the law."
Mr. Giuliani was uncharacteristically silent after the speech, refusing to discuss it during an afternoon news conference at City Hall. But the city pressed on yesterday in its battle to stop the march, asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn the decision that Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court made on Wednesday. A panel of three judges will hear arguments in the case on Tuesday, said Florence Hutner, an assistant corporation counsel for the city.
Earlier this year, the city rejected Mr. Muhammad's request for a permit to hold the march in Harlem on Saturday, Sept. 5, saying the neighborhood could not safely accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend. The conflict between the city and the organizers has since become increasingly bitter, with each side accusing the other of racism and the organizers finally suing the city last week.
Lawyers for the march organizers argued in court that the city's refusal to grant them a permit was unconstitutional, and Judge Kaplan agreed. In his ruling, he said the city's rules for weighing permits for street events were too broad and its decisions too arbitrary. He said that the city had considered Mr. Muhammad's application "on an ad-hoc basis" and that the city was not "free to impose a ban like this without a persuasive showing" that the event threatened public safety.
Mr. Muhammad and other organizers have billed the march -- actually a stationary rally along Malcolm X Boulevard -- as an opportunity for black youth to unite and hear speeches about issues that affect them, like police brutality, racism, unemployment and drug abuse. They have invited young black people from around the country, but they now say attendance will be nowhere near the one million people originally expected.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Muhammad praised Judge Kaplan for ruling that the city's actions had violated the Constitutional rights of the march organizers. But he went on to say that he did not believe in the United States Constitution, and that it was not "worth the paper it's printed on."
He also criticized black politicians who have expressed reservations about the march. Several black lawmakers from Harlem, including State Senator David A. Paterson and United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, have questioned why the organizers did not consult with Harlem residents before planning the event, and whether it will be safe.
"Stand up, be strong again," Mr. Muhammad said, addressing black elected officials who have criticized the march, none of whom attended the speech. "Stop flip-flopping on the side of the youth one day, then against them the next."
Senator Paterson issued a statement yesterday asking the march organizers to avoid making "bigoted" remarks about other racial and ethnic groups at the event and to focus instead on the problems facing black youth.
"I don't want it to be a contest to see who can make the most inflammatory statement in the most creative way," Mr. Paterson said.
But Mr. Muhammad shrugged off the request, saying after his speech that he could not make such a guarantee. "How are we going to prepare our youth," he said, "if we don't tell our youth who are our oppressors?"
In one of his attacks on Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Muhammad said the Mayor "never would've told Jewish youth in Crown Heights they couldn't march."
"He never would've said it to Jew mothers, or Jew youth," Mr. Muhammad said. "He never even would've tried it."
Although Mr. Giuliani would not respond to the speech, he did speak out against the march earlier in the day, at a news conference in the Bronx. "For the life of me, I can't figure out why people would voluntarily join a hate march," the Mayor said. "The person running this march has said the most hateful things that I have heard in this city in maybe a couple of decades."
At the same news conference, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the march would severely strain police resources, since it falls on the busy Labor Day weekend. The West Indian Day Parade alone, scheduled to take place in Brooklyn on Labor Day, will require the supervision of at least 3,000 officers, he said. Mr. Safir said that the Police Department had started planning for the march, but that he did not yet know how many officers would be needed.
Because many officers are on vacation that weekend, it will be difficult to find enough to cover two major events, even though they are on different days, he said.
"If we're forced to deal with the march, we'll deal with it," Mr. Safir said. "But we're going to have to bring in all hands. We're going to have to bring in people who are off on overtime, and it's going to be a great cost to the city."
Mr. Muhammad issued a warning to the Mayor and the police force in his speech, saying violence could erupt if police officers mistreat anyone at the rally. "We could have one fool on the police force who could ignite the collapse of New York City," he said. "Mayor Giuliani, make sure you have no riots by police officers that day, because it could be catastrophic for the city."
But he also urged young people planning to attend the march to be "slow to anger, and not that quick to judge."
"If someone steps on your toe, apologize to him first," Mr. Muhammad said. "Keep smiles on our faces. Hug each other with tight embraces. Let's have a day of networking, organizing and galvanizing."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Japan Stocks Fall 2%, but Rebound From a 12-Year Low

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Stock markets around Asia nose-dived in early trading today, as investors feared that the deep Russian economic crisis would hinder economic growth in the West and slow a recovery in this region.
The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues at one point plunged during morning trading to its lowest level since March 1986, down 621 points, or 4.3 percent, to 13,792.76. It then recouped much of those losses, to stand at 14,128.97 at the midday recess -- down 284.82 points, or nearly 2 percent, from Thursday. 
 Elsewhere, the key index in Singapore was off three-tenths of a percent, to 908.24; down 2.87 percent, to 305.55, in South Korea, and down 2.86 percent, to 2,487.40 in Australia.
"The most basic thing is not to panic," the Japanese Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said at a regular news conference this morning. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he hoped that Russia's problems would not have a major impact on the world economy.
The Japanese yen strengthened against the dollar, trading here at 140.6, as currency traders sold dollars in reaction to the sharp fall in New York stocks on Thursday.
This morning's early panic in Asian markets subsided a little in later trading. Funds linked to the government in Taiwan helped lift stocks there from lows, and institutional investors in Singapore began buying after an early selloff by retail investors.
In Hong Kong, monetary authorities again intervened to buy stocks. Still, at midmorning, the benchmark Hang Seng index was down 66.37 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, at 7,856.60.
Asian countries have been highly sensitive to troubles elsewhere because of the impact that outside economic shocks could have on fragile economic recoveries here. South Korea announced on Thursday that its economic growth for the second quarter ended on June 30 contracted by 6.6 percent on an annual basis.
Japan, too, is struggling to deal with an overwhelming banking crisis that has engulfed the nation, and Hong Kong is battling an economic contraction and a spike in interest rates.
"I'm sitting here watching the world falling to pieces," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities Japan. Referring to governments in the region, he added, "The question is, what can they do?"
Investors in Asia are worried that exports, the bright prospect for the struggling economies here, may subside if markets in Europe and the United States suffer from a fallout from Russia. Western economies are sensitive to the Russian debt crisis through their commercial debt exposure and through investments in the capital markets, with Germany, Moscow's biggest trading partner, most directly exposed.
In addition, a weakening in Western stock markets could mean that Western buyers of goods would have less ability to absorb exports from Asia.
So in Tokyo, the shares of export manufacturers were hard hit, with even the favorite stocks like the Toyota Motor Company and the Sony Corporation tumbling. Some banking stocks had no buyers.

HEADLINE: President Goes Forth, To Mixed Reception

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WORCESTER, Mass., Aug. 27

 BODY:
Wading into a public arena for the first time since he admitted 10 days ago to having had an affair with a White House intern, President Clinton today received a strong vote of confidence for his public policies but a mixed review of his personal conduct.
Mr. Clinton left his wife and daughter back at the First Family's vacation retreat on Martha's Vineyard and flew to this Democratic stronghold this morning to give a speech on school safety that his advisers hoped would help refocus the nation and the news media away from his sex life and onto policy matters. 
 He attracted a Presidential-campaign-size crowd, including hundreds of onlookers packed along a motorcade route of nearly six miles from the Worcester airport to the historic Mechanics Hall, where he addressed an audience of 1,200 people and never referred to his personal situation.
The speech was delivered before news of the plunging stock market and the precarious situation of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, although Mr. Clinton had no comment on either development after it had become clear that both were dominating the day's events. While meant to highlight school safety, the talk, which sounded more boilerplate than urgent, grazed over an assortment of policy items, including the economy, terrorism, Social Security, school construction and health care.
Mr. Clinton's sudden decision on Monday night to make Worcester the city of his post-confession debut sparked a burst of hometown pride. And those who heard his speech gave him sustained applause and standing ovations.
Representative Jim McGovern, the freshman Democrat who invited Mr. Clinton here months ago, declared from the stage at Mechanics Hall: "This is not a city of fair-weather friends. A friend from Worcester is a friend for life, and you, through your policies, Mr. President, have been a true friend of Worcester."
But behind the bunting and the resounding applause, many were careful to distinguish between the President's policies and his personal conduct. And signs along the motorcade route were mixed. While some said, "We support you," "We're proud of you, Mr. President" or "We're still with you, Mr. President," others ordered him to "Resign now!" or simply said, "Liar!" One placard offered a "Scarlet A."
Mary H. Whitney, the 63-year-old Democratic Mayor of nearby Fitchburg, who attended the speech after being called by the White House advance staff, said, "I have the highest respect for the office of President." But she added that the person in the office should be a role model for the nation and that Mr. Clinton "is not my kind of role model."
Another loyal Democrat refused to attend: Connie Lukes, a Worcester City Councilwoman, boycotted the event, condemning Mr. Clinton and saying, "The emperor has no clothes."
Senator John F. Kerry, part of the official delegation that greeted the President at the airport and traveled around with him, grew slightly testy when reporters pressed for his reaction to Mr. Clinton's personal situation.
"I don't have anything to say," the Senator replied, an uncharacteristic response from a politician who so enjoys the public eye that he is routinely referred to as John (Live Shot) Kerry.
"I support what the President is doing" on school safety, Mr. Kerry said.
Among those things, announced by Mr. Clinton today, is the distribution of a Government guide to every school in the country to help teachers and parents recognize children who may be prone to violence. According to the guide, such signs include social isolation, bad grades and "inappropriate access" to firearms.
Throughout the day, Mr. Clinton appeared by turns drained and relaxed. He shook nearly every hand in sight. And he apparently felt no need to rush back to Martha's Vineyard, lingering for more than 1 hour 45 minutes with Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Democratic politicians at Scano's Restaurant here, where he shed his suit jacket and downed a "steak bomb" submarine sandwich with french fries.
The restaurant's owner, Mary Scano, a former member of the City Council, strongly supported Mr. Clinton. Asked about his admission of an improper relationship that he had denied for seven months, Ms. Scano said: "So he lied. I lie. When I was on the Council, I lied."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: IN WASHINGTON;
From the U.S.: No New Answers, No New Money

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 27

 BODY:
With Russia in economic free fall and only four days before a planned summit meeting between President Clinton and the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, Clinton Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton would go to Moscow with words of encouragement but no new money.
American officials were hastily rewriting the summit script even as they scrambled to devise a longer-range plan to prepare for a Russia without Mr. Yeltsin, who has been the focus of American policy for years. 
 While the Administration talked of credible fiscal policies for a new Russia, the United States seemed to be watching the events from the sidelines and with a hesitation that contrasted with the quickly offered monetary aid and statements of assurance during earlier, and less serious, crises in Russia.
American officials say they have no new answers to Russia's political and financial crises, and no new money to provide beyond what the International Monetary Fund has already pledged, and Mr. Clinton has already told Mr. Yeltsin that.
"We will not hit the ground with a bag of tricks," a senior official said today.
Highlighting this sense of uncertainty, another senior official for the first time suggested that the summit meeting might be delayed or canceled, after days of insistence that it would take place as scheduled despite the lack of a functioning government in Moscow.
The official, describing the situation in Russia as "extremely fluid," said the Administration was watching news reports with one eye and the financial ticker with the other. As rumors of Mr. Yeltsin's imminent resignation swirled, the value of the Russian currency tumbled and the United States stock market took a 357-point hit.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, repeated the Administration position that the United States-Russia relationship was built on policies, not personalities. Echoing Mr. Clinton's comments to Mr. Yeltsin in a telephone call on Tuesday, Mr. Berger urged the Russian President and his Acting Premier, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to continue on the path of economic reform laid out by the previous Government of Sergei V. Kiriyenko, whom Mr. Yeltsin sacked on Monday.
"I think the composition of the Government is obviously for the Russians to decide," Mr. Berger said during a briefing on the capture of two suspects in the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Africa. "What we were -- what we are concerned about and would be -- are extremely interested in is the policy direction that the new Government takes. Does the new Government stay essentially on course with respect to economic reform and with respect to democracy, or does it change course? If it changed course in any kind of fundamental way, that would be of serious concern to us."
Mr. Berger was the only senior American official to address the Russian crisis on the record today, a sign that the Administration was mystified by developments in Moscow and uncertain what to say about them.
Mr. Clinton ignored shouted questions about Russia from reporters during a visit to Worcester, Mass., for a speech on education policy, and later lashed out at staff members for not adequately briefing him on the situation or preparing him for questions on it.
But one White House aide said it was unlikely that Mr. Clinton would have said anything today on the unraveling situation in Russia in any case, for fear of roiling financial markets and adding to the instability in Moscow. "Anything you say, the words get parsed beyond all belief," the official said. "You say something and it gets picked apart, and it means whatever investors want it to mean."
Mr. Clinton received a detailed briefing book for the meeting at his vacation home on Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday night, but it was not clear whether he had read it. Glyn T. Davies, the executive secretary of the National Security Council, flew to the island earlier this week to help prepare Mr. Clinton for next week's summit meeting and to brief him on developments in Russia.
Mr. Clinton spoke with Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, late this afternoon about the Russian crisis and Mr. Clinton's visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland next week, immediately following his two days in Moscow. The two leaders agreed that continued economic reform in Russia is "vital," a British spokeswoman said.
Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, returned early to Washington from a vacation to oversee economic preparations for the summit talks.
Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, was in Moscow in a series of urgent last-minute meetings to try to salvage some concrete results from next week's meeting and to gauge the climate for United States-Russian relations in months to come.
Mr. Yeltsin's departure could certainly scotch plans for the meeting, but American officials discounted reports that he was preparing to step down. "Obviously, the situation is tumultuous and day-to-day," one Administration official said. "We've heard the rumors, but no one has given us any hint as of yet that there is a change" in Mr. Yeltsin's status.
"It's still our expectation that the summit will go forward and be productive," the official said.
In a sense, the impending summit meeting is a gift for American officials. It gives them a short-term event to focus on and allows them to put off for another day the far more difficult question of how to deal with a foundering and virtually bankrupt nation in possession of thousands of nuclear weapons. Discussion of those questions has been put on hold, one official said, until it is clear who will be running Russia next week -- and after.
Also unclear is whether the I.M.F. will deliver the next $4.3 billion payment of a loan package, due Sept. 15. The payment depends on Russian legislative action to reform the tax and pension systems, votes that look increasingly unlikely. The Duma, the lower house of Parliament, must first confirm Mr. Chernomyrdin as the Prime Minister, and the debate could be contentious and long.
"We cannot save Russia, only Russia can do that," a senior official said.
"The President can't calm the markets," he said. "The markets will be affected only by clear evidence of Russian seriousness of purpose, from Yeltsin to the Duma, to fix the problems and insure that foreigners get a fair shake. But Clinton can engage Yeltsin in a discussion of the political imperatives of handling the economics."
In a telephone call to Mr. Yeltsin on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton pushed him in that direction, an official said. "Both Presidents reaffirmed the importance of a clear, decisive strategy for tackling Russia's economic crisis," said Barry Toiv, the deputy White House spokesman. "President Yeltsin stressed that this will be the top priority of the new Russian Government."
Senior American officials, in a sign that they believe the Yeltsin era is all but over, see the summit meeting as a way to begin to build bridges to the next generation of Russian leaders. Mr. Clinton's main public address of the two-day summit -- a speech next Tuesday to students and young business leaders -- is an explicit effort to speak over the heads of Russia's current leaders to its people.
Mr. Clinton will speak about the evolving relationship between the countries and offer sympathy for the pain of the transformation Russia is suffering, an official involved in summit preparations said.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to meet a dozen or more parliamentary and regional leaders, another effort to engage with a new generation of leaders not tainted by the Communist era or the difficult transitional years of Mr. Yeltsin's presidency.
Critics of American policy in the United States and in Russia have often questioned what they call Mr. Clinton's overly close relationship with Mr. Yeltsin, ignoring other potential Russian leaders. Administration officials respond that Presidents deal with Presidents, that Russia has only one President at a time, and that American officials are in contact with Russian politicians at all levels.
Peter Reddaway, a Russia scholar at George Washington University, said he thought Mr. Clinton should cancel his trip, in part because there will be no one of real authority to engage, and in part because Mr. Clinton may be greeted with "nasty demonstrations or comments" from Russians who resent his close relationship with Mr. Yeltsin, whom many Russians revile.
"It would be foolish to undertake any initiative, political or economic, in this volatile situation," Mr. Reddaway said. "You can't have a serious negotiation because there's no real government."

HEADLINE: Cablevision to Buy 20 Movie Theaters in Region From Loews Cineplex

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Moving to grab a bigger piece of the region's movie theater market, Cablevision Systems Corporation announced yesterday that it would buy 20 theaters in the region, including the Ziegfeld and a dozen others in Manhattan, from Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation as part of a package worth $91.7 million.
The package includes two transactions: one for $85 million in cash for the 13 Manhattan theaters and 11 in Chicago, and another for $6.7 million in cash for 7 theaters in Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
 The acquisitions represent Cablevision's second purchase of a theater chain in the last two weeks. On Aug. 13, Cablevision paid $160 million in cash and stock to Clearview Cinema Group Inc., of Chatham, N.J., which has 45 theaters in suburban New York and New Jersey.
At the same time, the transactions reflect a recent push by Cablevision, based in Woodbury, N.Y., to make as much of a splash as possible in the business of local entertainment -- be it movies, television or sports.
Already, Cablevision offers cable service to more than 3.4 million customers in New York, Boston and Cleveland, and it owns a controlling interest in Radio City Entertainment, Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and the MSG Network, among other properties.
"A marketwide presence in movie theaters extends Cablevision's ability to offer metro area consumers a choice of live, film and televised entertainment," James L. Dolan, Cablevision's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Last fall, the Sony Corporation agreed to merge its Loews Theaters unit with the Cineplex Odeon Corporation to create one of the world's largest movie theater companies, Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation, with more than 400 theaters nationwide and annual revenues of about $1 billion.
But after the Justice Department and the New York State Attorney General's office raised concerns that the combined theater chain might monopolize the market in Manhattan, the company agreed to sell about 14 of its movie theaters there.
Cablevision, meanwhile, has increasingly diversified its interests as part of a strategy to rely on a grab bag of entertainment and media forums to promote its products.
These include an alliance with the At Home Corporation to deliver high-speed Internet service through its cable systems and Cablevision's recent purchase of Nobody Beats the Wiz, the electronics retail chain.
But the movie theaters are an even more alluring opportunity, perhaps, to pump up Cablevision's brand name -- and the more movie theaters, the more powerful the leverage.
So yesterday's transactions fit neatly into the long-term strategies of both Loews and Cablevision, said Christopher Dixon, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber.
"It's consistent for both companies," Mr. Dixon said.
"The theater business is all about the ability to create scale economies. That means you need to have a fairly large number of screens so that you can be assured that the studios will pay attention to you," he said.
Economies of scale are particularly important in the movie business.
While the number of movie screens has almost doubled to 31,000 nationwide since 1949, the number of people going to the movies has actually stayed the same, Mr. Dixon said.
Yesterday's agreement is still subject to approval by the Justice Department. But if approved, the movie theaters would be managed by Cablevision's Madison Square Garden unit, which is run by David W. Checketts, the president and chief executive.
In Manhattan, the group of 13 theaters, with a total of 35 screens, includes such marquee names as the Beekman and the Waverly.
Cablevision officials added that they expected to sell the Chicago movie theaters in order to concentrate on the New York region.
Mr. Dixon said the deal would have little effect on moviegoers; after all, few people probably knew that the Ziegfeld was run by the Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation.
But if Cablevision has its way, it may be able to offer its cable customers discounts on movie tickets, or combine the sale of tickets for sports events with movie ticket discounts.

3M SAYS IT WILL CUT 500 MORE JOBS BY THE END OF 1999

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 4,500 jobs by the end of next year, 500 more than the company announced in late July. The job cuts, which will reduce the 3M work force to about 71,000, are aimed at improving productivity. The company, based in Maplewood, Minn., also announced previously that it would consolidate some manufacturing operations worldwide. The company announced the additional 500 job cuts yesterday during a meeting with financial analysts. 3M expects to take a pretax charge of as much as $500 million for the revamping. The company's shares closed at $73.8125, down 31.25 cents, after hitting a 52-week low earlier in the day.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE WEST;
Europe Gets A Bit Jumpy Over Russia

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 27

 BODY:
With the monetary crisis in Russia creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in European capitals today that the crisis could throttle economic growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to democracy.
But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight of his life for re-election a month from now and with President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive action during the United States-Russian summit meeting planned for next week in Moscow. 
 Indeed, Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the I.M.F., raised eyebrows with an interview Monday with the German daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that was sharply critical of inaction by the Group of Seven earlier this month when Russia was forced to stop supporting the value of the ruble against foreign currencies.
"It was clear to me that the situation was untenable after the G-7 didn't rush to Russia's aid," the newspaper quoted him as saying. "I'm not sure Chancellor Helmut Kohl would not have behaved differently if the elections were taking place two years instead of weeks from now."
Mr. Kohl, campaigning in Berlin today, spoke by telephone with President Jacques Chirac of France, German officials said, and planned to call Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
Public advice from European political leaders to President Yeltsin and his Prime Minister-designate, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was the same today as it has been all along: Without radical changes in the Russian financial and economic system, more Western help will not work, they said.
"It won't be possible to mobilize German and international aid without reforms," Mr. Kohl said. "Without sensible reforms, it won't turn out well."
European officials tried to reassure investors in their own financial markets today that Russia's economy was too small for a collapse to do serious damage to their own much larger economies.
The real concern of European leaders here is not about economic stability but political stability in Russia, which is still a nuclear power with an army bigger than all European armed forces put together. And all European leaders, for years, have backed Mr. Yeltsin as the bulwark of his country's commitment to democracy.
Fear that this commitment could come unraveled, some financial analysts suggested, also might explain the panic in European markets today. "Sidelining of Mr. Yeltsin Prepared," the French newspaper Le Monde reported today.
And after the stock market in Paris fell more than 4 percent, Peter Thorne, an analyst with Banque Paribas, said today, "Russia obviously has nuclear weapons, and I think the psychology is that Russia is more important than it really is."
French officials, just emerging from their annual August vacations, said something needed to be done to reinforce the International Monetary Fund, which is providing Russia with a $22.6 billion rescue package. Much of the latest installment of that money was spent by Russia's central bank in a failed attempt to defend the ruble.
Mr. Chirac, in a speech to French ambassadors from around the world, said Wednesday that the fund needed a decision-making political body at the ministerial level to strengthen its ability to deal with crises. International aid would only succeed, he said, "if the necessary internal reforms supported by President Yeltsin are resolutely put into effect by the new Government of Mr. Chernomyrdin."
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Finance Minister, said the same thing today after a meeting here with his German counterpart, Theo Waigel.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he and Mr. Waigel were considering sending a letter to Mr. Chernomyrdin, who is widely seen in Europe as likely to go slow with the kind of fiscal and financial changes Western experts say it will take to nurse Russia's economy back to health.
Some economists wondered openly today why the Group of Seven industrial countries, led by the United States, had not taken a more active role in managing the crisis.
"For too long, Russia has been pretending to observe the conditions imposed by the I.M.F. and the I.M.F. has been pretending that it was doing so," Christian de Boissieu, an economics professor at the Sorbonne, told Le Monde. "The G-7 should take over," he said. The Group of Seven includes the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan, Britain, France and Italy.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK;
Studying How the Defeat of Heat Changed Nearly Everything

BYLINE: By Janny Scott 

 BODY:
Raymond Arsenault stumbled into his scholarly sideline back in 1982 when he was invited to speak on a panel on climate and history. "Just tell them about air-conditioning," his wife, a seventh-generation Floridian, suggested facetiously. And so began Mr. Arsenault's great air-conditioning adventure.
He turned his conference paper into an article, "The End of the Long Hot Summer: The Air-Conditioner and Southern Culture," which was published in The Journal of Southern History, then syndicated, then anthologized, then reprinted so often it has become the journal's most requested article for the last 15 years. 
 "I'm known jokingly among my friends as 'the air-conditioner man'," said Mr. Arsenault, a professor of history at the University of South Florida, who could be found recently discussing the cultural history of air-conditioning on ABC's "Nightline." "I feel like a typecast actor sometimes."
Air-conditioning, as it turns out, is a rich topic, something so ubiquitous and so easily taken for granted that it seems to have occurred to few scholars to examine its impact on everything from industrialization, migration patterns and public health to architecture, family life, the environment and attitudes toward nature.
"It's one of my favorite subjects," said Richard P. Nathan, a political economist and director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "The civil rights revolution and air-conditioning are the two biggest factors that have changed demography and a lot of our politics in the last 30 years."
From the installation of the world's first air-conditioning system in a Brooklyn printing company in 1902, through its march through industrial plants, then movie theaters, then government buildings, hospitals, hotels and finally homes, air-conditioning was catapulted in the public perception "from luxury to amenity to necessity," as Mr. Arsenault recently put it.
The population of the South grew dramatically, as mortality dropped and in-migration grew. Air-conditioning proved crucial to the industrialization of the region. It improved productivity and encouraged economic growth, Mr. Arsenault concluded. It encouraged urbanization, in part by helping make skyscrapers and high-rise apartments more feasible.
At the same time, Mr. Arsenault wrote, it "weakened the bond between humanity and the natural environment" and "impinged upon a rich tradition of vernacular architecture" by making it possible to build inexpensive tract homes after World War II without the high ceilings, long breezeways, open porches, transoms and other features that once kept people cool.
For years Mr. Arsenault's 32-page article, replete with footnotes citing such sources as Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration News, has stood as the most comprehensive scholarly attempt to explore the history of air-conditioning, the growth of the industry and air-conditioning's impact on society and culture.
Now, Gail Cooper, a historian of technology and an associate professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., has published "Air-Conditioning America: Engineers and the Controlled Environment, 1900-1960" (Johns Hopkins, 1998), a study focusing on the engineering effort to create an "indoor climate."
In addition, the National Building Museum in Washington, which takes as its mission the celebration of American achievements in "the built environment," intends to open next May what is being billed as the first major exhibition to explore the transformative power of air-conditioning.
Ms. Cooper, who is 44, grew up with air-conditioning in California's Central Valley and remembers crawling out of her crib and into the hall to sleep on the floor under the air-conditioner. Now she lives in an 1890's house in the historic district of Bethlehem, where her summers are filled with ceiling fans, iced drinks and occasional escape to the movies.
"I see it as a complex subject," Ms. Cooper said. "I tried to describe how users feel: sometimes they love it; sometimes they don't." As for herself, she works in a windowless office. "It's the kind of room that is only possible with air-conditioning," she said. "I think a lot of people do miss windows."

HEADLINE: Even a Jihad Has Its Rules

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi financier linked to the recent bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, has justified his call to kill Americans by citing Muslim holy law. "Allah ordered us in this religion to purify Muslim land of all nonbelievers," he said in an interview with ABC in May.
Libya, Iraq and militant Islamic groups have also applauded the bombings. Meanwhile, leaders in the Arab-American community and Islamic specialists have argued that such terrorists have distorted Islam's traditional teachings. And in a speech last week, President Clinton made a point of drawing a distinction between Muslim extremists and traditional Muslims -- the "hundreds of millions of good, peace-loving people all around the world," as he described them -- who condemn the killing of noncombatants in terrorist attacks. 
 But just what does Muslim holy law say about these kind of terrorist attacks?
Islamic holy law, or sharia, is based on the Koran and the precepts and practices of the Muslim prophet Mohammed and his seventh-century companions.
Islam, of course, is open to many interpretations. But several Islamic scholars who live in the West say that Mr. bin Laden has justified his jihad, or holy war, against the United States by a highly unorthodox, though increasingly common interpretation of Islamic law and political tradition.
Following in the tradition of other 20th-century radicals, like Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian militant theorist executed in 1966, Mr. bin Laden argues that a war against the United States is obligatory because of American "crimes" against Islam.
These are often listed as America's presence on sacred Saudi Arabian soil, support for rulers throughout the Middle East whom the radicals say are "un-Islamic" and corrupt, Washington's "blind support" for what is characterized as Israel's "theft" of Muslim land and persecution of Palestinians, and supposed American indifference to the suffering of Bosnian Muslims. During his May interview, Mr. bin Laden made a point of saying, "After World War II, the Americans became more aggressive and oppressive, especially in the Muslim world," adding, "We do not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in this fatwa."
Many Islamic scholars, however, argue that the holy war Mr. bin Laden has declared violates not only the elaborate regulations of Islamic law as traditionally accepted but also Arab tribal custom.
Peter J. Awn, professor of religion and Middle Eastern studies at Columbia University, said that according to classical Islamic law, a jihad must be fought for the ultimate good of the Muslim faith. "It cannot be used simply for economic or political gain," Professor Awn said.
According to mainstream Muslim jurists and scholars, there are four kinds of legitimate warfare in Islam, including wars against infidels and apostates, which are both jihads; all must be declared and conducted by the Muslim ruler of a state, or failing that, Islamic wise men. Mr. bin Laden, of course, is not a leader of a state. Nor is he a qadi, a judge, or a mufti, a Muslim legal scholar, Professor Awn added, and thus, is unqualified to issue what his supporters call fatwas, his religious rulings or opinions justifying the anti-American campaign.
Quadir Amiryar, a political scientist at George Washington University, agrees with Professor Awn and notes that many of those who issue "fatwas" don't follow the procedures that Islamic law requires.
He also argues that spreading Islam "by the sword" is traditionally considered a last resort. While it might have been justified during the invasion of Afghanistan, he said, "that justification evaporated with the departure of the Soviet Union." True, many Muslim clerics in the Middle East and elsewhere have interpreted Muslim law to justify terrorism, but Professor Amiryar argues that those calls for jihad often stem from frustration with their own leadership: "They are using these Islamic concepts in other contexts which were originally not intended."
In his 1996 book on jihad, Rudolph Peters, a Dutch scholar, argues that while the umma, or Muslim community, has a duty to "expand the territory of the state," the doctrine of jihad forbids, among other things, the killing of noncombatants like children, women and old people. Thus, it would appear that even if Islamic law were stretched to consider women and children at the American Embassies combatants, the hundreds of Africans, many of whom are Muslim, who were killed near those embassies could not be considered combatants.
Muslim law also provides that ambassadors and their missions be respected as long as they do not engage in espionage. (That's why the Islamic Government in Teheran insisted on characterizing the American Embassy where hostages were seized in the 1970's as "a nest of spies").
Professor Peters says a "war against unbelievers may not be mounted without summoning them to Islam or submission before an attack." In other words, people should be given a chance to embrace Islam as their faith before they are killed.
Mr. bin Laden's defense of and reported ties to Egyptian and Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli and American targets are also questionable under traditional Islamic precepts, scholars say. Islamic holy law forbids suicide. According to the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed, which believers claim are divinely inspired, the punishment is eternal repetition of the act by which a person dies. So if a man hangs himself, he'll spend an eternity choking.
But as Professor Awn points out, Islam endorses martyrdom -- fighting, and if necessary, dying for one's faith. And one Muslim's suicide might be another's martyrdom.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Declines For First Time in Two Years

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Consumer spending fell in July for the first time in more than two years as the strikes at the General Motors Corporation took a toll on auto sales. Analysts said falling stock prices could cause spending to weaken further.
The Commerce Department said today that spending declined two-tenths of 1 percent last month, in contrast to June's increase of six-tenths of 1 percent. The spending decline came even though Americans' incomes rose half a percent in July, exceeding June's rise of three-tenths of 1 percent -- a sign that jobs remained plentiful. 
Also today, figures compiled by the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment weakened in August, falling to 104.4 on the university's index of sentiment from 105.5 in July. Because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services, any sign that consumers are not in a buying mood could be a signal that economic growth will slow.
"The strength of the stock market gave us some pretty spectacular spending numbers in the first half of the year," Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York, said. "Now we're seeing confidence dented and spending weakened. The blow to the stock market is going to have the opposite effect in the third quarter."
July's drop in spending, the first since a decline of six-tenths of 1 percent in June 1996, reflected a decline in auto sales, the Commerce Department said. General Motors' sales decreased 38 percent last month because of two strikes that started in early June and shut down 26 assembly plants. By July, dealers were reporting shortages of some popular models.
In a sign consumer spending has some life left, consumption of nondurable goods rose 3.7 percent in July.
The report from the University of Michigan was in line with the findings of the Conference Board, which said earlier this week that its index of consumer confidence fell to 133.1 in August from 137.2 in July.

HEADLINE: Taking Action on Patients' Rights

 BODY:
The Senate will not have much time to approve legislation on patients' rights when it returns next week from its August recess. Its chances of enacting something worthwhile will be slim if Republicans and Democrats insist on turning the stalemate into a campaign issue with which to hammer each other. The blame strategy, however, could backfire with voters who want protection from unfair health insurance practices.
The House has already passed a bill that would guarantee emergency care coverage, allow consumers to appeal denials of coverage to an independent panel and permit women direct access to gynecologists and obstetricians, all of which the Democrats want. But President Clinton is likely to veto this plan because it expands medical savings accounts, a provision strongly opposed by the Democrats, and it does not change existing law that bars consumers from suing federally regulated health plans for damages related to the denial of benefits. The Senate Republican bill, sponsored by Don Nickles of Oklahoma, is unacceptable because it would apply only to the 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers. 
 The Senate Democratic plan offers broader protections and would apply to an estimated 150 million privately insured individuals. It would also allow people to sue for damages when benefits are denied. But the Republicans look on any open-ended right to sue as a poison pill that will drive up insurance costs.
There is a workable, bipartisan compromise bill that could end this political standoff. Sponsored by Senators John Chafee, Joseph Lieberman, Bob Graham, Arlen Specter and Max Baucus, the plan adopts nearly all the protections favored by the Democrats and does not expand medical savings accounts. In benefit denial cases, it would allow suits in Federal court for recovery of economic damages and attorneys' fees only. While this would not allow compensation for pain and suffering or punitive damages, it is a step in the right direction and substantially better than the current law, which allows practically no recovery at all.
The measure also contains an important enforcement provision that no other bill offers. It authorizes the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services to levy fines upwards of $250,000 against health plans that fail to comply with the requirements of the bill. That would include failure to provide benefits specified in the bill, as well as failure to meet disclosure and other obligations. This plan deserves the White House's support.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: IN NEW YORK;
Russian Emigrants: Mixed Views on the Old Country

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
She only arrived in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, from Moscow two weeks ago, but Natalia Kuznetsova has followed the crisis at home by telephoning friends. She knows that the banks are closed, that the stores are closed, that the ruble is practically worthless. Her friends tell her they pass the days drinking vodka.
But even as Ms. Kuznetsova in one breath compares daily life in Russia to a war, in the next breath she smiles and shrugs at the financial and political upheaval in Moscow that has rippled across the world. She said she hoped to stay in the United States for a year or longer, but the thought of returning home did not bother her. 
 "We had the same situation 5 years ago, 10 years ago," said Ms. Kuznetsova, who at 26 spoke with the resignation of someone older. "It's a normal situation in our country."
In Brighton Beach, the neighborhood that for two decades has absorbed layer upon layer of emigrants from the old Soviet Union, the news from Russia was greeted with alarm, but also with apathy. For every person who rushed to wire money to relatives in Russia, others claimed they could care less about life there. People who still own property there, or conduct business, stayed in close contact with friends, monitoring the latest changes. And still others considered the crisis about as realistic as the televised Russian soap operas playing at some of the stores on Brighton Beach Avenue.
"It's a great play by the Government to get money from the international financial system and to steal their money," scoffed Gennady Grigorovich, owner of Cafi Paris restaurant on Coney Island Avenue, an Ukrainian immigrant who has lived in Brooklyn for 20 years.
A few people at Cafi Volna on the Brighton Beach boardwalk watched Boris N. Yeltsin announce yesterday on Russian television that he would remain as President until 2000. Not long after the speech, the channel was quickly changed to the Weather Channel to follow a more immediate problem, the path of Hurricane Bonnie.
"He's going to stay?" asked Sopha Liebanov, manager of Feminik, a women's clothing storea few blocks away on Brighton Beach Avenue. "I don't think so. It doesn't matter if it's Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin. They stole all the money and put it in their pockets. The people don't work and everything is closed. They expect credits from America."
Ms. Liebanov blamed those in Brighton Beach who shrugged off the crisis, saying that many immigrants have lived in Brooklyn for so long that they have forgotten the hardship of their old lives. "The people don't understand," she said. "They think, 'It's so far, so who cares?' "
Boris Talis, executive director of Brighton Beach District Management Association, a coalition of local businesses, said several Russians visiting the United States on business have rushed back in the last two days as the fiscal crisis has deepened. As for Brighton Beach merchants, Mr. Talis said the crisis has had "no effect, only morally. This is a sad story. Nobody knows what can happen in the next three or four days."
Alexy Dementyev, a clerk at United Air and Parcel Service on Coney Island Avenue, said that on Thursday customers wired a total of about $10,000 to relatives in Russia and other former Soviet states, a significant increase. But he also said that the money may not be bringing much help.
"Western Union in some cities are paying in rubles," Mr. Dementyev said. "That's not very convenient because the exchange rate is not too positive. Nevertheless, people are sending."
Three years ago, Irena Chikantseva and her husband, Andrey Ahramov, came to Brighton Beach from Moscow and opened a gift store. They still own a four-bedroom apartment in downtown Moscow, but they said they can no longer find anyone able to pay the $2,000 monthly rent. Besides the financial crisis, the couple say that rising crime has kept the apartment empty; the last tenant moved out because the building had no doorman. Now, the couple regularly call friends and family in Moscow.
Ms. Chikantseva's sister in Moscow, whose son is approaching draft age, worries that the instability could lead to another war like those in Chechnya and Afghanistan. Mr. Ahramov's mother lives in Moscow, surviving on a pension, but he said she was not alarmed, perhaps because crisis is nothing new to the older generation.
"Nobody can fix the situation," Mr. Ahramov lamented.
At a barber shop, a Russian barber waved off questions, unimpressed with the latest crisis at home.
"It's life," he said. "People suffer."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Prices Move Up Slightly as Flight to Treasuries Continues

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday, extending a rally sustained by investors fleeing turmoil on world markets. Some profit taking, however, held back the gains.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32 , to 102 17/32 . The bond's yield -- an important benchmark for consumer and corporate interest rates -- slipped to 5.33 percent, from 5.34 percent on Thursday. (Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.) For the week, the yield fell 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. 
 The yield on the 10-year note dropped to 5.05 percent yesterday from 5.06 percent on Thursday -- down 23 basis points for the week.
For most of the session, Treasury prices inversely tracked United States stocks, rising when share prices fell, as traders and investors focused on developments in Russia.
"The crisis is moving a little bit closer to home," said Bill Kirby, co-head of government securities trading at Prudential Securities in New York, "It's not in the whites of our eyes yet, but it looks like there's going to be some slowdown, and Treasuries are seeing the flight to quality."
Some market participants are beginning to speculate that the weakness in the stock market might cause Federal Reserve policy makers to consider cutting interest rates. But many analysts say the Fed will need to see a slowdown in the domestic economy before it will cut rates.
The Fed will "have to believe the situation is really critical" to cut rates between meetings, said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Nationsbank. "We do think ultimately they will, and maybe the urgency did increase, but Fed policy needs to be guided by the domestic economy." Fed policy makers next meet on Sept. 29.
The members of the Fed are meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., at an annual conference.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole, told the conference that rates were low enough that the Fed could afford to bide its time on adjusting monetary policy. Traders thought this was significant because Mr. Poole had voted to raise rates at the Fed's policy meeting in May.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE INVESTORS;
In New York, a Mixture of Denial and Optimism

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The only way Dunstan Connell could have been more emphatic would have been if he had borrowed Alfred E. Neuman's shibboleth from Mad magazine: What, me worry?
"This?" Mr. Connell, a clerk for Charles Schwab & Company who works at the New York Stock Exchange, said as the Dow Jones industrial average was seesawing yesterday between a gain and a loss. "It's not a big deal." 
 He enumerated the milestones of his career. "I was down here for the crash," he said, as everyone on Wall Street refers to Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508 points, or 22 percent. "I was down here last year," when the Dow fell 554.26 points, or 7.2 percent, on Oct. 27.
"We've been through this before," he said. "Even Thursday wasn't that bad."
From the fashion industry's workrooms on Seventh Avenue to the exercise bicycles in private midtown clubs to the carpeted waiting rooms in storefront brokerage offices, New Yorkers watched as the markets dipped and climbed and dipped again yesterday. By the time the Dow finally settled at 8,051.68 -- down 114.31 points, or 1.4 percent -- most still seemed unworried by Wall Street's sudden turn toward bear market territory.
Like millions of other American investors who have ridden the stock market like a roller coaster the last few years, investors and stock market employees interviewed during the day acknowledged some queasiness about where the market was headed -- if not yesterday, then next week. But no one seemed to be using the p-word.
"I don't see anybody panicking," said Dean Rasi, a clerk at the New York Stock Exchange. "Some brokers are having a hard time. I hear them talking. You can hear guys go, 'This is killing me, this is killing me,' trying to rush their orders."
Other stock exchange workers reported hearing an unaccustomed edginess in brokers' voices, an unfamiliar uncertainty. But many small investors still sounded confident. Some said they had shifted their money into cash or money market funds, but most said they were not selling out. Not yet, anyway.
"I've inherited a lot of my stocks, and if you inherit blue chips, you hang onto them," Anne Murphy, a costume designer, said, smiling brightly yesterday afternoon in Bryant Park in New York City. "I figure it's all going to balance out. We went up so much last year, so if it went back to where it was a year ago that wouldn't be so bad."
Robert Banks, an engineer in St. Louis who specializes in high-definition television sets, was even more upbeat. Despite the economic meltdown in Russia and the tremors in Asia, he said the stock market was still a healthy outpost.
"I'm not all that concerned," he said early yesterday afternoon, when the Dow was down about 61 points. "Right now, our economy is strong. The rest of the world looks to us, so you have to be careful of knee-jerk reactions."
Staying the course has been a motto for many small investors throughout the long bull market of the 1990's, which many Wall Street analysts date to October 1990. It was the small investors who "bought the dips." They went bargain-hunting. They ignored all the noise about Asia and currency collapses. After all, last October's 13.2 percent drop in the Dow, the worst in the 1990's, was followed by a 30 percent rally.
Leonard Soriano of Trenton, who gave up managing health clubs to manage his portfolio from home, was convinced that pattern was still intact. "It can only go up," he said. "It will go down, but in the long term it's always gone up."
But yesterday he was selling. "I'm in front of my computer right now, trying to get out of stuff," he said. "I'm ready to jump off the Empire State Building, but they don't do that anymore," he added with a chuckle. "My net worth is down 50 percent in the last few weeks."
Mr. Soriano said he was "not trading money I need." He also said he had started to put aside cash as a cushion if prices tumbled more than they already had.
Like Mr. Soriano, millions of other investors are more attuned than ever to the stock market's every gyration. Labor officials talk about how even union halls have big-screen television sets tuned to CNBC and how the buzz in the room stops as the closing bell nears.
But perhaps nothing has brought the market closer to small investors than the Internet. Omar Wasow, who monitors on-line chat rooms for MSNBC, said yesterday that the chatter remained almost universally optimistic about the market's long-term prospects.
"I was really astonished, given the leading, critical questions I asked, that people were not concerned," Mr. Wasow said. "One person I talked to said you've got to be in it for the long term, and that sort of echoed the general consensus."
Among those in one Internet chat room Mr. Wasow plugged into was someone identified as Crabtown, who said that baby boomers could sustain the stock market through 2005, when boomers begin to retire and cash in their holdings. Crabtown, with the characteristic bravado of the 90's investor, predicted that the Dow would hit 15,000 before then.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE OUTPOST;
It's a Dark and Stormy Night . . . and Here's Hong Kong Trying to Line the Clouds With Silver

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Amid the battering of stock markets around the world this week, Hong Kong has seemed strangely stable -- an oasis of calm at the eye of the storm. But appearances are deceiving.
In a climax to an unprecedented two-week-long direct intervention in the stock market, Hong Kong's government spent at least $8 billion today on a buying spree to prop up shares and foil speculators it accuses of manipulating its market. 
 On Thursday, an earlier round of intervention had managed to push the Hong Kong stock market up while every other market around the globe was down. Today, for all the money spent, the benchmark Hang Seng index still declined 93.23 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,829.74.
Hong Kong has always been unusual in Asia, a rare outpost of free markets in a region of state-managed capitalism. The government, while committed to a fixed exchange rate with the United States dollar and prepared to support the property market the way South Africa's DeBeers regulates the price of diamonds, historically has gone to great lengths to avoid meddling in its markets.
So, in a city where tracking the Hang Seng is a favorite parlor game, today's wild ride -- by far the market's biggest trading volume ever -- left people slack-jawed. At moments during the morning trading session, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange seemed less a market than a giant clearance sale, with the government buying everything in sight.
"They did this at a time when there is gloom around the world," said Glenn Lesko, the director of regional sales and trading at ABN Amro Securities in Hong Kong. "I think they ran into far more sellers than they expected."
Government officials, however, claimed victory. They said the intervention had stabilized the Hang Seng, even as markets across Asia, Europe and the United States were plummeting because of fears about the financial turmoil in Russia and other emerging markets. That stymied traders who had taken short positions on shares and futures contracts on the bet that the Hong Kong market would tumble.
For Hong Kong, today's action was the boldest step yet in a costly effort to erect a wall between itself and the financial typhoon raging around it. Although Hong Kong has already been whipsawed by the Asian crisis, the territory's leaders are determined not to be sucked into an even more calamitous vortex of currency attacks followed by a stock market collapse.
Traders estimate that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has spent at least $12 billion since it began buying shares and futures contracts on Aug. 14. Nonetheless, Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said the government was ready to continue intervening. Hong Kong has already spent more than 10 percent of its $100 billion in foreign reserves on the effort.
Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong, held open the possibility that China might support Hong Kong's campaign, with its $140 billion worth of reserves. "The central Government has said many, many times openly that they are very willing to support us if there is a need to do so," he said.
In fact, Hong Kong seems determined to drive out the currency traders, even if it means intervening indefinitely. It is unclear, however, whether the government has an end-game strategy. And at today's rate of buying, it will run out of reserves in about 13 trading sessions.
Hong Kong's tough stance came in the wake of more bad economic news. The government released data confirming that Hong Kong had slipped into a recession in the second quarter, as the economy contracted 5 percent. It also projected that the economy would shrink 4 percent in 1998 -- the first full year of contraction since Hong Kong began keeping records in 1961.
But it was the government's intervention that had analysts rattled. Several said the stock market would plummet as soon as the government stopped supporting it. And some argued that Hong Kong was squandering both its reserves and its reputation as the freest market in Asia.
"In the short run, if you pour billions of dollars into stocks, you can pump up the market," said Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "But in the long run, this is doomed to fail because it convinces speculators that Hong Kong can't take the pain."
Indeed, no less prominent a currency trader than George Soros seems to view Hong Kong's intervention as a quixotic effort. Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of Mr. Soros's Quantum Fund, said in an interview on Thursday with CNBC: "No matter what they do in their market, when they wake up on Monday morning, they're still going to be in a depression."
Hong Kong may not stop at simple intervention. Sir Donald announced that the government was considering measures to curb "manipulative practices." These could include restrictions on the short-selling of stocks and increased disclosure requirements in the trading of index futures.
Hong Kong would not be the first Asian market to place restrictions on certain kinds of trading. Japan, Korea and Malaysia all do it, just as they intervene in their markets. But Hong Kong has long prided itself as the New York of Asia -- a market where Wall Street openness meets Chinese entrepreneurialism.
As it happens, some analysts believe the government has been forced to act by Hong Kong's most prominent entrepreneurs -- the property tycoons -- who have seen their share holdings decline in value by 50 percent since last year. Two months ago, the government announced it would suspend sales of land, in an effort to halt the downward spiral of property prices.
"The irony is that the government is taking the people's money and using it to bail out the property developers," said Marc Faber, an investment adviser and managing director of his own brokerage firm.
Sir Donald dismissed the suggestion that the government was putting Hong Kong's reserves at risk. He noted that the Hang Seng index has risen 1,200 points since the intervention began, which means that the government's owns more in shares than it did in cash before it began buying.
Still, the government's buying spree has put it in the uncharacteristic -- and potentially awkward -- position of being a major shareholder in many blue-chip Hong Kong companies.
Sir Donald said he was not concerned about owning large stakes in Hong Kong companies, nor about the potential negative effect of dumping those positions on the open market once the intervention was over.
Hong Kong's battle with the currency traders has mutated from a guerrilla skirmish into a full-scale war of attrition. Several traders said the government had recruited an unidentified expert to help it plot moves to thwart even the shrewdest of hedge funds. Beyond buying blue-chip shares like HSBC Holdings and Hong Kong Telecom, the government has taken a complex set of long and short positions on August and September index futures contracts.
Beyond the mechanics of the market, Hong Kong's intervention has rekindled a debate about how much governments can -- and should -- intervene to protect themselves from the vagaries of the global marketplace.
Ronnie Chan, a prominent Hong Kong property developer, said the government had an obligation to protect its citizens from a wave of speculation that was threatening to swamp the stock market and the local economy.
"The total annual output of Hong Kong is dwarfed by the daily capital flow of the markets," Mr. Chan said. "At will, the market can destroy an economy overnight. Is Hong Kong being destroyed? No. But is it suffering hugely? You bet."
In Hong Kong's case, however, the debate is complicated by the fact that it has set itself up as a mecca for global capital. Last year, the Hang Seng index rocketed to 16,000 points as foreign investors poured money into shares of "red chips" -- Chinese companies with publicly listed Hong Kong subsidiaries.
The Hong Kong dollar is another example of the territory's supposed openness to the global economy. The currency is pegged to the United States dollar at a fixed rate. The price for preserving that link at a time when most Asian countries devalued their currencies has been a spike in interest rates, which drove down property prices and the stock market.
Until this summer, Hong Kong had seemed ready to absorb those blows. But then in June, the government announced it would stop selling land. And two weeks ago, it waded into the stock market. After today, some market experts began talking about the "nationalization" of Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: In Clinton's Remarks: A Focus on Interdependence and Forgiveness

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from comments President Clinton made yesterday at Union Chapel in Oak Bluff, Mass., at a ceremony on the 35th anniversary of the "I Have a Dream" speech by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:
The summer of 1963 was a very eventful one for me: the summer I turned 17. What most people know about it now is the famous picture of me shaking hands with President Kennedy in July. It was a great moment. But I think the moment we commemorate today, a moment I experienced all alone, had a more profound impact on my life. 
 Most of us who are old enough remember exactly where we were on Aug. 28, 1963. I was in my living room in Hot Springs, Ark. I remember the chair I was sitting in. I remember exactly where it was in the room. I remember exactly the position of the chair when I sat and watched on national television the great March on Washington unfold.
I remember weeping uncontrollably during Martin Luther King's speech. And I remember thinking, when it was over, my country would never be the same and neither would I.
There are people all across this country who made a more intense commitment to the idea of racial equality and justice that day than they had ever made before. And so in very personal ways, all of us became better and bigger because of the work of those who brought that great day about. There are millions of people who John Lewis will never meet who are better and bigger because of what that day meant.
And the words continue to echo down to the present day, spoken to us today by children who were not even alive then. And, God willing, their grandchildren will also be inspired and moved and become better and bigger because of what happened on that increasingly distant summer day.
What I'd like to ask you to think about a little today, and to share with you -- and I'll try to do it without taking my spectacles out, but I don't write very well and I don't read too well as I get older -- is what I think this means for us today. I was trying to think about what John and Dr. King and others did and how they did it, and how it informs what I do and how I think about other things today.
And I want to ask, you all need to think about three things . . . .
No. 1, Dr. King used to speak about how we were all bound together in a web of mutuality, which was an elegant way of saying, whether we like it or not, we're all in this life together. We are interdependent. Well, what does that mean? Well, let me give you a specific example: We had some good news today. Incomes in America went up 5 percent last year. That's a big bump in a year. We have got the best economy in a generation. That's the good news.
But we are mutually interdependent with people far beyond our borders. Yesterday, there was some more news that was troubling out of Russia, some rumor, some fact about the decline in the economy. Our stock market dropped over 350 points. And in Latin America, our most fast-growing market for American exports, all the markets went down even though, as far as we know, most of those countries are doing everything right. Why? Because we're in a tighter and tighter and tighter web of mutuality.
Asia has these economic troubles. So even though we have got the best economy in a generation, our farm exports to Asia are down 30 percent from last year. And we have states in this country where farmers, the hardest-working people in this country, can't make their mortgage payments because of things that happened half a world away they didn't have any direct influence on at all. This world is being bound together more closely.
So what is the lesson from that? Well, I should go to Russia because, as John said, anybody can come see you when you're doing well. I should go there. And we should tell them that if they'll be strong and do the disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country, their economy, and get through this dark night, that we'll stick with them. . . .
The second thing. Even if you're not a pacifist, whenever possible, peace and nonviolence is always the right thing to do.
I remember so vividly in 1994 . . .I was trying to pass this crime bill, and all of the opposition to the crime bill that was in the newspapers, all the intense opposition was coming from the N.R.A. and the others that did not want us to ban assault weapons, didn't believe that we ought to have more community policemen walking the streets, and conservatives who thought we should just punish people more and not spend more money trying to keep kids out of trouble in the first place. And it was a huge fight.
And so they came to see me, and he said, "Well, John Lewis is not going to vote for this bill." And I said, "Why?" and they said, "Because it increases the number of crimes subject to the Federal death penalty and he's not for it. And he's not in bed with all those other people, he thinks they're wrong, but he can't vote for it." And I said, "Well, let him alone. There's no point in calling him" because he's lived a lifetime dedicated to an idea and while I may not be a pacifist, whenever possible, it's always the right thing to do to try to be peaceable and nonviolent.
What does that mean for today? Well, there's a lot of good news. It's like the economy: the crime rate's at a 25-year low, juvenile crime's finally coming down. . . .
Half a world away, terrorists trying to hurt Americans blow up two embassies in Africa, and they killed some of our people, some of our best people -- of, I might add, very many different racial and ethnic backgrounds, American citizens, including a distinguished career African-American diplomat and his son -- but they also killed almost 300 Africans and wounded 5,000 others.
We see their pictures in the morning paper, two of them who did that. We were bringing them home. And they look like active, confident young people. What happened inside them that made them feel so much hatred toward us that they could justify not only an act of violence against innocent diplomats and other public servants, but the collateral consequences to Africans whom they would never know? They had children, too.
So it is always best to remember that we have to try to work for peace in the Middle East, for peace in Northern Ireland, for an end to terrorism, for protections against biological and chemical weapons being used in the first place.
The night before we took action against the terrorist operations in Afghanistan and Sudan, I was here on this island up till 2:30 in the morning trying to make absolutely sure that at that chemical plant there was no night shift. I believed I had to take the action I did, but I didn't want some person who was a nobody to me, but who may have a family to feed and a life to live, and probably had no earthly idea what else was going on there, to die needlessly. I learned that, and it's another reason we ought to pay our debt to the United Nations, because if we can work together, together we can find more peaceful solutions. Now I didn't learn that when I became President; I learned it from John Lewis and the civil rights movement a long time ago.
And the last thing I learned from them on which all these other things depend, without which we cannot build a world of peace or one America in an increasingly peaceful world bound together in this web of mutuality, is that you can't get there unless you're willing to forgive your enemies. I never will forget one of the most -- I don't think I have ever spoken about this in public before -- but one of the most meaningful personal moments I have had as President was a conversation I had with Nelson Mandela.
And I said to him -- I said: "You know, I have read your book, and I have heard you speak. And you spent time with my wife and daughter, and you have talked about inviting your jailers to your inauguration." And I said, "It's very moving." And I said: "You're a shrewd as well as a great man. But come on now, how did you really do that? You can't make me believe you didn't hate those people who did that to you for 27 years?"
He said, "I did hate them for quite a long time. After all, they abused me physically and emotionally. They separated me from my wife, and it eventually broke my family up. They kept me from seeing my children grow up." He said, "For quite a long time, I hated them."
And then he said: "I realized one day, breaking rocks, that they could take everything away from me, everything, but my mind and heart. Now, those things I would have to give away, and I simply decided I would not give them away."
So as you look around the world, you see -- how do you explain these three children who were killed in Ireland or all the people who were killed in the square when the people were told to leave the City Hall, there was a bomb there, and then they walked out toward the bomb?
What about all those families in Africa? I don't know. I can't pick up the telephone and call them and say, "I am so sorry this happened." How do we find that spirit?
All of you know I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness. And I ----. It gets a little easier the more you do it. And if you have a family, an Administration, a Congress and a whole country to ask, you're going to get a lot of practice.
But I have to tell that in these last days it has come home to me again, something I first learned as President, but it wasn't burned in my bones -- and that is that in order to get it, you have to be willing to give it. And all of us -- the anger, the resentment, the bitterness, the desire for recrimination against people you believe have wronged you -- they harden the heart and deaden the spirit and lead to self-inflicted wounds.
And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged. And I heard that first -- first -- in the civil rights movement. "Love thy neighbor as thyself."

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Beware The Ides Of August

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Frank Rich is on vacation.

 BODY:
Which do you think is scarier? Is it that Scott Ritter, the top U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, quit his job, accusing the U.S. and the U.N. of surrendering to Saddam Hussein? Or is it the story told by Russian economists about a Russian soldier behind the Urals who drove his army tank to City Hall to demand months of back pay? The soldier said he drove the tank not because he wanted to blow up the municipality but because he didn't have any other way to get there and couldn't afford cab fare. Or is it reading The Washington Post, where a State Department spokesman, James Foley, was quoted as saying that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright couldn't possibly be going soft on Iraq because, after all, "Saddam Hussein has called Secretary Albright a snake and a witch, among other things"?
What these disturbing stories suggest is that the basic pillars that have stabilized the post-cold-war world are all either shaking or crumbling. And that's scary. 
 Pillar number one was the notion that Russia had made an irreversible leap from Communism to free-market capitalism, that it was basically on the right track, albeit bumpy, that Boris Yeltsin was basically the right man for the job, and that a little U.S., German and I.M.F. money could grease the way.
Today, financial experts are at a loss as to how to deal with Russia, whose future is anything but certain. Russia's crisis is primarily a governing crisis. Russia lacks the institutions to properly manage a modern economy linked to today's fast-paced global market, and the legitimacy of free markets there is still shallow. If Russia goes bad, it's going to go really fast, and if it gets better, it's going to take a really long time.
The second pillar was America's defeat of Saddam in the gulf war. That defeat resonated around the world. Those who supported Saddam, like Yasir Arafat, had to literally apologize to their neighbors after the war. Those who went on supporting him looked like fools, tilting against a Pax Americana. Arab moderation spurred Israeli moderation. But today the Arab center, not just the extremes, is again reconciling with Saddam. The Clinton team says it has no allies anymore to confront Saddam and no domestic support, and it's right. But neither did George Bush when he built the anti-Iraq coalition.
The third pillar was the American economic model -- that liberal, open, deregulated markets, with lots of free trade, will produce steadily rising stock markets around the world. That model is now facing its biggest challenge across the globe today, where investors and workers in every emerging market are discovering that while the American model may be the best thing going, it is much more difficult to reproduce than first thought.
"American credibility is being tested in every one of these areas," notes Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, "and the stability of the world will depend, in part, on whether we pass that test."
Which brings us to the fourth shaky pillar, the leaders who made this post-cold-war world. They are vanishing: Yitzhak Rabin was shot. Bill Clinton shot himself. Boris Yeltsin lost his way. Helmut Kohl lost his mandate. Japan is home alone. Who would have predicted that today's most stable leaders would be China's President, Jiang Zemin, and its Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji?
America is a superpower, but it's not omnipotent. It needs to decide where it can make a difference, where it can only coach and where it is just copping out. In Iraq, it is just copping out. In Asia the U.S. can make a difference by encouraging governments there to broaden their social safety nets to catch some of those brutalized and unemployed by the latest economic meltdowns, so this transition to real free-market capitalism is not derailed. In Russia, the U.S., Germany and the I.M.F. can offer aid, but only if the Communist-led Duma passes all the necessary reforms and Russia's greedy capitalist oligarchs are broken.
It's ironic: A strong Russia under Stalin could never bring the West to heel, but a weak Russia under capitalism can, if the West doesn't insulate itself. Which is why Bill Clinton needs to right himself fast, so that he is not just occupying the Presidency but exercising it. America needs a President. The world needs one even more.
Dear reader, this is my last regular column until January. I am taking a four-month sabbatical to finish a book about the post-cold-war world.

HEADLINE: Judge Deals a Blow To City's Campaign Against Sex Shops

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
A state judge dealt a blow yesterday to the Giuliani administration's efforts to curtail the sex industry, ruling that Show World, a midtown Manhattan pornography emporium, and two other adult video stores could stay in business as long as no more than 40 percent of their floor space and inventory were dedicated to adult entertainment.
The ruling by Judge Stephen G. Crane of State Supreme Court in Manhattan breaks a long-running series of legal victories on the issue for the administration and suggests that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani may achieve only a muted victory in his crackdown on sex shops. The city said it was considering appealing Judge Crane's ruling, and it vowed to continue trying to shut sex shops. 
 While several strip clubs have already been shut down under the new law, yesterday's court ruling indicates that some adult video stores may be able to remain open by selling nonsexual merchandise in their front portions and constructing back rooms for adult entertainment.
In trying to comply with the new zoning restrictions, Show World, a 20-year-old, three-story business on Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, took advantage of vague language in the new law that defines an adult establishment as one devoting a "substantial portion" of its stock or floor space to adult entertainment.
Citing the City Department of Buildings's interpretation of "substantial portion" as more than 40 percent, Show World and other video stores replaced more than 60 percent of their "triple X" videos, "peep-a-live" booths and other sex merchandise with luggage, cameras, N.Y.P.D. T-shirts and classic films.
Lawyers for the city argued that the changes were a subterfuge by the stores to evade the new law, which bars adult video stores and strip clubs from operating in residential areas or within 500 feet of a school, house of worship or another sex shop.
But in his opinion Judge Crane ruled that the changes made by Show World and the two other businesses, NRS Video and Les Hommes, were substantial and had made them legally "nonadult businesses."
It remains unclear whether sex shops that eliminate more than 60 percent of their lucrative pornographic merchandise can remain economically viable, particularly in high-rent areas like Times Square, a city official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. "It's not just the zoning regulation that's at play here," the official said. "There are the forces of the marketplace. We'll see how long businesses will be able to be economically viable."
But Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex shops affected by the law, said yesterday that he believed that the profit margins of the shops might shrink if they eliminated most of their sex-related inventory, but predicted that many would remain open.
Scott Wexler, Show World's controller, said yesterday that the business had been forced to end all strip shows and lay off 20 people, including the dancers, since changing its inventory. "We're not operating in the red, but our bottom line has definitely been hurt," he said. "We're confident we'll be able to keep going."
For several reasons, Show World appears to be in a better position than smaller adult businesses. Show World's owner, Richard Basciano, owns the two 12-story buildings Show World is located in, and therefore has little to fear in terms of rising rents. The buildings have 50 other commercial tenants and 24 residential tenants to pay the $500,000-a-year property tax bill, Mr. Wexler said.
The owners of NRS Video, at 414 Eighth Avenue near 31st Street, did not return a call seeking comment. Les Hommes, at 217 West 80th Street near Broadway, does not have a listed telephone number.
Steven M. Fishner, the Mayor's criminal justice coordinator, said the ruling would not affect the city's enforcement of the law.
"To date, 13 illegal establishments are closed due to court orders and more than 20 others have voluntarily closed their doors," he said. "Judge Crane's decision applies to today's case only, and it does not present a legal impediment to future enforcement of the zoning law."
In his 23-page ruling, Judge Crane said the law explicitly mentioned only two criteria for judging whether a business is "adult," stock and floor space. He rejected the city's attempt to consider other issues like revenue. He said that having less than 40 percent of floor space and stock devoted to adult material did not automatically make a business "nonadult." But, citing such factors as Show World's investment of more than $100,000 in renovations, he concluded that the store appeared to have made good-faith efforts to comply. His decision suggests that if a video store makes major, permanent renovations to abide by the law, it may be able to remain open.
Judge Crane's ruling also suggested that the city's decision in these cases not to follow the typical procedure for closing businesses violating zoning laws may have backfired.
City officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that in most zoning violation cases, the city first informs a business that it is violating zoning laws and then discusses with it how it might comply. Mr. Fahringer said in court earlier this week that he had offered to meet with city officials after the law took effect on July 22 to discuss how the shops could comply with the new law, but was rebuffed.
Instead, city officials asked judges to padlock strip clubs and adult video stores under the city's nuisance abatement law -- the process normally used to close operations like crack houses. In his ruling, Judge Crane said the city must meet a higher standard of proof when trying to close stores under the nuisance abatement law than under the zoning law. He called the city's failure to respond to Mr. Fahringer's offer "unfortunate."
But a city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that using the more aggressive legal approach was appropriate, and vowed it would continue.

Yeltsin Tells Russia He Will Stay in Office
Boris N. Yeltsin asserted on Russian national television that he would serve out his term as President and that, for him, resignation was impossible. But rumors and reality alike suggested that his presidency, if it did last, was rushing toward figurehead status. A1 

President Clinton promised that the United States would help Russia's leaders and its people "get through this dark night" of economic and political chaos if Moscow would do "the disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country." A6
 
Mr. Yeltsin's staged interview on the Government-owned television network was not much of a success at restoring public faith in his ability to govern. A6
 
Senior Clinton Administration officials wondered who they would face across the conference tables in Moscow at the summit meeting next week. Mr. Clinton's aides began rewriting his planned remarks on the future of United States-Russian relations. A7
 
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund threw his support behind what he described as the efforts of Russia's Acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to resurrect an austerity plan. A7
 
Questions on Sudan Attack
Some statements made by Clinton Administration officials to justify the missile attack on what it called a chemical weapons plant in the Sudan have proven to be inaccurate, misleading or open to question. A1
 
The Government's case against Osama bin Laden, the leading suspect in the embassy bombings, emerged in sharper detail as Federal agents brought a second suspect to New York to face charges. A4
 
Gingrich Questions Iraq Policy
Speaker Newt Gingrich said the resignation of a senior American weapons inspector in Iraq had raised "disturbing questions" about President Clinton's policy and suggested that Mr. Clinton had misled Congress about his commitment to uncovering the extent of Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. A5
 
Proposal for Islamic Rule
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan proposed a law to create an Islamic order and establish a legal system based on the Koran. A2
 
Congo Forces Gain
Government forces continued to assert control over fringes of the capital, Kinshasa, after two days of heavy shelling and gunfire. Fighting with rebels was confined to a few pockets, and life on the capital's streets was closer to normal. A3
 
Suspect in Club Bombing Freed
The police in South Africa hunted anew for the bombers of the Planet Hollywood restaurant after releasing a South African man for lack of evidence. The explosion killed one person and injured 27 others. A4

Northwest Pilots Strike After Contract Talks Fail
More than 6,000 pilots at Northwest Airlines walked off the job just after midnight, shutting down the country's fourth-largest airline. President Clinton, who ordered striking pilots at American Airlines back to work last year, decided not to repeat the move. A1
 
Clinton Talks of Forgiveness
President Clinton, speaking with emotion to a group of ardent supporters on Martha's Vineyard, said he had been wrestling with the process of forgiveness -- both as a seeker of it from his family and the nation, and as one who extends it to his enemies. "And so it is important that we are able to forgive those we believe have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged," the President said, apparently in references first to Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and then to his wife and the nation. A1
 
Monica S. Lewinsky and Betty Currie, left, President Clinton's secretary, have given grand jury testimony that differs on the matter of who asked Mrs. Currie to retrieve gifts that the President had given Ms. Lewinsky, lawyers familiar with their accounts said. Meanwhile, Bruce Lindsey, one of Mr. Clinton's closest and longest-serving advisers, testified again before the grand jury. A10
 
Storm Moves Up East Coast
The storm Bonnie, alternating in strength between a tropical storm and a hurricane, moved on a course that took it well out to sea, sparing the New Jersey shore and Long Island the high winds, tidal surges and flooding that many people had feared.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: IN WASHINGTON;
Gingrich Opposes Summit, but President Vows to Press On

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said today that President Clinton's plans to visit Moscow next week to meet the faltering President Boris N. Yeltsin were "imprudent" and should be canceled.
While some prominent legislators from both parties urged Mr. Clinton to proceed with the summit meeting, Mr. Gingrich added his own influential voice to those who have criticized the meeting, which comes in the midst of economic and political upheaval in Moscow. 
 "These are two weak Presidents trying to prop each other up," Mr. Gingrich said in a telephone interview today. "Who knows what kind of promises they'll make to each other, what they'll agree to? I think it's very imprudent for him to go."
But Mr. Clinton was undeterred by such criticism. In a speech on Martha's Vineyard about the importance of friendship in difficult times, he vowed to press ahead with the meeting and with an effort to help Russia if the new Government does "the disciplined, hard things they have to do to reform their country."
Defending his trip, Mr. Clinton said, "Anybody can come see you when you're doing well." He delivered his remarks shortly after Soviet television broadcast an interview in which a puffy Mr. Yeltsin announced that he would not resign.
Mr. Clinton received support for the summit meeting from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who said the India-Pakistan nuclear confrontation was reason enough for Mr. Clinton to go to Moscow. The Russians can help with the Indians, he said, "and we've not had that conversation with the Russians." A mutual collaboration to make South Asia stable "would cost a lot of money, but it's worth the world," he said. "That alone would be a good morning's discussion."
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, also said that Mr. Clinton is right to go. "To cancel now would be a further blow to what little credibility Yeltsin has remaining," he said. "The President should obviously tell Yeltsin to get a grip on his country and recognize that we can't pour good money after bad without evidence of reforms."
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said Mr. Clinton should stress the American desire for a prosperous Russia, fully integrated in the world. "There is a sour mood about Russia in Congress today, principally because of their missile and nuclear help to Iran," Mr. Hamilton said. "We have to engage Russia and build bridges when possible, but also draw red lines about acceptable behavior."
In a theme echoed today by his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, the President said the United States had to stand with the Russian people in their time of difficulty and be willing to help if the Russians themselves made the hard sacrifices required to get their house in order.
As Mr. Berger put it, "Although the key political and economic choices are up to the Russian people themselves, we need to engage actively, even -- or especially -- in a time of crisis."
Mr. Berger said that Mr. Clinton would urge Russians to hold fast "to the basic objectives of democracy and economic reform in the face of new challenges."
"The Russian people should know that, particularly in times of difficulty, the United States and the West will not turn away from cooperation," Mr. Berger said. "As they do the things necessary to restore stability and progress, we are prepared to support them."
Mr. Clinton's officials, struggling with themselves to prepare for a summit meeting in a land undergoing a political and economic earthquake, had encouraging news today.
The acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, told Clinton Administration officials privately that he has made no deal with the Russian Parliament that will undermine the general course of economic reform, senior American officials said.
Although members of Mr. Chernomyrdin's own party are saying "worrisome things" about a more Soviet-style state control over parts of the economy, one official said, Mr. Chernomyrdin "tells us he hasn't struck any deal on the policy stuff." At least not yet, the official acknowledged.
He spoke after a half-hour conference call with Mr. Clinton, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who is in Moscow, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Mr. Talbott emphasized that Mr. Yeltsin would not resign, that Russian officials of all stripes wanted Mr. Clinton to make the trip, and that the streets themselves were calm.
"They're not sacking kiosks to get crackers," the official said. "It's not like Clinton's walking into a maelstrom."
Mr. Chernomyrdin has been negotiating with parliamentary leaders, including some from the Communist Party, on a broad economic and political strategy for recovery. Mr. Chernomyrdin, who controls Parliament's second-largest faction, needs wider support to be confirmed as Prime Minister in a vote expected on Monday, as Mr. Clinton leaves Washington for Moscow.
But Mr. Chernomyrdin also needs Parliament to pass legislation to reform the tax and pension systems, at least if Moscow expects the next $4.3 billion installment of aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Senior officials said they remained deeply concerned that the Communists would demand a high price, and that Mr. Chernomyrdin may have to give some ground to the call for stricter state controls on the economy and the printing of more rubles to stimulate industry and pay workers, driving up inflation and further undermining the value of the ruble.
"Chernomyrdin can go pretty far toward the Communists," said another senior official. "We understand that he needs to stabilize the situation in terms of public reaction. He needs a coalition. That's the concern: he needs their support and they'll make him pay for it. But he's a lot smarter than they are."
Still, the official said, Washington had no real options. "We're prepared to be generous in our interpretation of what Chernomyrdin can put together," he said. "But frankly, we don't have any choice. We don't have any alternatives, nor is anybody asking us right now."
Mr. Berger conceded that Mr. Yeltsin's firing today of the reformers Anatoly B. Chubais and Boris Nemtsov was "not encouraging," but he continued to emphasize that the policies of any new Government mattered more than its personnel.
Mr. Berger and other officials continued to press their theme of fundamental Russian responsibility for the country's troubles and for their solutions. But Mr. Summers also emphasized that the I.M.F. would be prepared to be flexible, but dependent on the pace of reform. "That has to be put in the context of Russian economic policy, which is what we're waiting to see," Mr. Summers said. "And at this point, we don't have a Russian economic team, we don't have a Russian economic plan."
And Mr. Berger said important foreign policy and security issues could still be discussed, including nuclear stockpiles, the protection of fissile material, and Russia's policies toward Iraq, Iran and the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo.

GLUT FORCES CHIP-EQUIPMENT MAKER TO CUT STAFF BY 20%

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Ultratech Stepper Inc., a maker of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment based in San Jose, Calif., said yesterday that it had cut 120 full-time positions, or about 20 percent of its work force, in a move to reduce costs. The company also said it would require all employees to take two days off a month for the rest of the year. Ultratech linked the cuts to a worldwide glut of computer memory chips and uncertainty over Asia's financial turmoil, which have injured its operations. Costs associated with the moves will lower earnings for the third quarter ending Sept. 30, Ultratech said. In the quarter a year ago, Ultratech earned $5.4 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $36.8 million.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE LENDER;
I.M.F. Chief Endorses Chernomyrdin's Goals

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, threw his support today behind what he described as the attempts of Russia's acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to resurrect an austerity plan for Russia.
"He accepts the challenge," Mr. Camdessus said, in his first public comment after a hastily arranged meeting with Mr. Chernomyrdin in Ukraine on Wednesday night. "Mr. Chernomyrdin has told me that he recognizes the validity" of the monetary fund's program for restoring the Russian economy. 
Mr. Camdessus and his chief deputy, Stanley Fischer, also suggested, at a news conference at the fund's headquarters here, that if the Russians failed to embrace the fund's approach, it would be fruitless for the fund or the major industrial nations to lend more money in an attempt to support the ruble and the Russian economy.
When the ruble began to slide in value earlier this month, "we had to decide how much further to go, once it was clear" that foreign lenders would no longer roll over short-term loans to Russia, Mr. Fischer said.
"The I.M.F. and its major shareholder decided that it would take more resources than were available," he said. The fund's major shareholder is the United States.
Mr. Camdessus's remarks seemed clearly aimed at giving Mr. Chernomyrdin public backing as the Prime Minister tries to persuade a recalcitrant Parliament to reject "populist" inflationary policies in favor of the conditions that the monetary fund has attached to a recent loan agreement. The fund is pushing Russia to move to a balanced budget, restrain borrowing and greatly improve its tax collections.
President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed to those terms last month and in return received $4.8 billion in loans from the I.M.F. to support the ruble. Another $4.3 billion loan was promised for late September, and it will be forthcoming, Mr. Camdessus said today, but only if the Russians show progress toward meeting the fund's conditions for the credits.
Mr. Chernomyrdin "indicated that he understood the severity" of the financial crisis in his country, Mr. Camdessus said, "and that the Russian Government was prepared to take the needed action in close consultation with the political parties and Parliament."
A political uproar over the monetary fund's terms played a role in Mr. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his reformist Prime Minister, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, last Sunday and reappoint the more centrist Mr. Chernomyrdin, who had been the previous Prime Minister.
Mr. Camdessus and Mr. Fischer said they were operating in concert with the seven major industrial countries -- known as the Group of Seven, or G-7 -- that are the fund's major contributors.
Mr. Fischer was quoted in German and British newspapers in recent days as having criticized those nations for failing to provide additional money for Russia as several of them, particularly the United States, had for Mexico in 1994.
But today he suggested that he had been misquoted. "There was no disagreement between the fund managers and the G-7," Mr. Fischer said, "that the resources needed were more than were available to deal with the problem."
In a separate effort to reassure the financial markets, this time about Latin America, Mr. Camdessus announced that the monetary fund had invited the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Western Hemisphere to a meeting here late next week. The meeting, the first of its kind, will try to organize "regional surveillance," in which countries help each other maintain market-friendly economic policies.
Acknowledging that the fund's available money, depleted by the Asian and Russian crises, was unusually low, Mr. Camdessus insisted that the I.M.F. would not cut its assistance programs. The remark seemed aimed at getting member countries to come through with an $85 billion infusion -- including $18 billion from the United States, an amount that the Clinton Administration favors, but many in Congress oppose.
"If at some point we run out of resources," Mr. Camdessus said, "the international community will have to face its responsibilities and decide whether countries that are helping themselves should be abandoned by the international community."
The fund now has in the bank only about $13 billion not already committed to lending programs or to other commitments, fund officials say, one of the lowest levels in its history. The $13 billion does not include about $10 billion already earmarked for Russia but not yet disbursed.
The $4.3 billion loan scheduled for late September would come out of that $10 billion. That would leave $5.7 billion for future lending. Since 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has received a total of $21 billion in loans from the monetary fund and has made repayments on time, fund officials say.

HEADLINE: Let Russia Slow Down Its Reforms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You urge President Clinton to make it clear to Russian leaders at next week's summit meeting "that moving forward with economic reforms is the best prescription both for healing Russia and for maintaining strong American support" (editorial, Aug. 25). But 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin hasn't pursued any "economic reforms."
Mr. Yeltsin has done everything to keep himself in power. He has used the immense prerogatives of his office to let industries collapse and give his magnate allies a free hand to avoid taxes, privatize huge properties and invest profits abroad. He has lowered inflation by not paying millions of workers and driving up the number of starving and unemployed.
The West must disown Boris Yeltsin and help Russia find a way to saner economic policies and a more truly representative form of government.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE EUROPEANS;
Russia Told to Implement Tough I.M.F. Reform Plan

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The Finance Ministers of four economically powerful Western European countries warned Moscow today that the only way out of its current crisis was to make the tough economic changes long urged by the International Monetary Fund.
A letter by the four ministers -- from Germany, France, Italy and Britain --to Russia's acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said those steps included enforcement of tax laws that were now widely ignored, and a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation in check. 
 None of the countries offered Russia any emergency bilateral assistance, emphasizing instead that the I.M.F. would be the lead agency for dealing with the crisis.
The letter from the four European members of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies was part of a concerted European effort to urge Mr. Chernomyrdin not to give in to pressure from the Communist opposition in Russia and drop unpopular economic programs.
"A return of confidence in financial markets will be possible only if Russia proceeds with its reform program in close relationship with the International Monetary Fund," a statement on the letter issued by the French Finance Ministry said.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain spoke on Thursday with President Clinton, who plans to visit Russia next week, and officials in London said they had agreed on what Russia needed to do.
"The program and plan that has been put together over a long period of time by the international institutions does genuinely offer the only way out of this," Mr. Blair said during a visit to Scotland.
A high-ranking French official, however, said that the United States-Russian summit meeting would probably be "useless."
President Clinton is so weakened by the admission of having had an intimate relationship with a White House intern and Mr. Yeltsin is so stricken by Russia's economic and political turmoil that neither seems able to agree on a solution to the crisis, the official, who refused to be identified, said.
The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, said in Munich today, "Russia needs, like any other country, to work closely with international financial institutions, but Russia must solve its own problems."
He said that Germany and France would work together to try to help, but stressed that bilateral financial aid to Moscow from Germany, which has already lent or donated tens of billions of dollars in gratitude for Russia's agreement to its unification in 1990, was "out of the question."
As news accounts from Russia indicated that Mr. Chernomyrdin may be preparing to strengthen state control of the economy and let inflation run, authorities in Bonn and Paris expressed continuing concern about economic and political developments in Moscow.
"The finance ministers agree it is vital to strengthen the foundations of public finances with a fair tax system and to adopt measures to restore the stability of the financial system," the German Finance Ministry said. "It is also decisive that the Russian central bank is able to pursue an independent, stability-oriented monetary policy."
Mr. Waigel told the German financial daily Handelsblatt: "Turning up the printing presses is never a wise solution. Inflation is no way to escape the financial crisis. There is no way around rapid implementation of structural reforms."
The French Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said: "It is clear that the solution is in the hands of the Russian Government. We appreciate that financial assistance from us is necessary, but not sufficient. In particular, the Russian Government has to put fiscal reforms in place."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE POLICY MAKERS;
Fed's Focus Is Said to Shift To Possibility of a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 28

 BODY:
The latest round of global financial turmoil is forcing the Federal Reserve to shift its sights from guarding against inflation through higher interest rates to the possibility that it might have to reduce rates to head off an economic downturn, central bank officials and economists said today.
Although it has left rates unchanged for nearly a year and a half, the Fed has consistently seen inflation, stemming from strong growth and low unemployment, as a greater threat than recession at home or a financial meltdown around the world. But the stock market's slide and the continued deterioration of most developing economies -- both of which accelerated this week amid Russia's crisis -- mean that the Fed will almost certainly not raise rates anytime soon and may seriously debate cutting rates in coming months, officials and economists said. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, made no substantive statements about the markets or monetary policy at a presentation here today on income inequality. But Fed officials, as well as economists who held informal discussions with them here during a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said recent events would inevitably reshape the debate in the Fed's policy-making panel.
One indication of the change in thinking came from William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who earlier this year was pushing for a rate increase. At the beginning of July, Mr. Poole dropped his call for a rate increase, and he told reporters here today that the best option for the Fed now was to wait and see how much the domestic economy was being hurt by what was happening around the world.
"Given what's been going on in the markets, there is more reason than before to wait and see how things play out," Mr. Poole told the Reuters news service.
Economists said, though, that any backing away from raising rates would still leave the Fed a long way from cutting them. "Clearly the events of the past few days make easing by the end of the year a possibility, though I wouldn't put it higher than 50 percent," said David Hale, chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments.
Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, said that the fallout from the situation in Russia "can only push the spectrum of the debate in the dovish direction," but he said the most likely course would be for the Fed to hold rates steady unless Wall Street was plunged into a crisis.
As recently as its policy-making meeting on July 1, most Fed officials "felt that the risks continued to point on balance toward rising inflation," according to minutes of the meeting released last week. At that meeting, the Fed voted to keep a formal policy tilt toward raising rates. Minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting, on Aug. 18, will be released after the next Fed meeting, on Sept. 29.
But with conditions worsening, some Fed officials suggested that their assessments of the outlook were changing. The selloff in the stock market, they said, could be expected to help rein in demand as consumers grew less confident.
"Financial-market weakness will only underscore expectations of weakened growth and reassure policy makers of the remoteness of inflation as a risk," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
Moreover, the market reaction to Russia's woes has effectively brought about a severe tightening of credit conditions for nearly all developing nations, as investors are demanding sharply higher premiums over safe investments like United States Treasury bonds before they put their money just about anywhere outside the United States and Western Europe. Many investors suffered heavy losses in Russia and are wary of taking another hit.
The lack of credit and investment capital, as well as the continued turmoil in the markets, could bring a further slowdown to regions like South America and put further pressure on important economies like that of Hong Kong, where officials are battling a sharp slide in the stock market and pressures for a devaluation of the currency.
The implications for the United States of mounting problems in other countries, even apart from the effect the turmoil is having on the financial markets, could be considerable. Mexico and South America together, for example, account for nearly 20 percent of American trade, and a downturn there could have a pronounced impact on American jobs and corporate profits.
But Fed officials said they were by no means convinced that the economy would stall or even slow to a noninflationary pace. Although growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the second quarter after surging to a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, one Fed official noted that the average for the first half, at 3.4 percent, was still quite strong.
With unemployment remaining extremely low, there are also tentative signs that wage increases are beginning to bite into corporate profits, putting pressure on companies to raise prices and set off inflation.
There was widespread agreement among the experts here that one thing American monetary policy could not do was help Russia in any meaningful way. The loss of confidence in Russia among international investors is so profound that it will take wholesale changes there to woo them back, in this view.
E. Gerald Corrigan, a managing director of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said Russia's best course would be to make up for its mistake in unilaterally limiting debt repayments and try to negotiate with its creditors as a first step toward restoring stability and credibility.
"Russia and Russia alone must take the first steps to get this process back on track," Mr. Corrigan said.
But other economists said a rate cut could help economies like Hong Kong's, where the currency is tied directly to the value of the dollar and would therefore benefit from any reduction in dollar interest rates.

HEADLINE: Let Russia Slow Down Its Reforms

 BODY:

To the Editor:
President Boris N. Yeltsin's dismissal of the new pro-reform Government and the reappointment of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, whose ties to the industrial oligarchy are well established, point to yet another old aspect of Russian history (front page, Aug. 24). 
 The young reformers Sergei V. Kiriyenko and Boris Nemtsov, who are Jewish, have been sacked.
In times of crisis Russia returns to its historically unifying principles of nationalism and xenophobia and finds Jews or foreigners to blame for its failures. Alas, Russia is again on the brink of political and economic convulsions.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE BANKS;
BankAmerica and 2 Other Big Banks Suffer Russia Losses

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Adding to the list of American companies battered by economic turmoil in Russia, three more large banks reported trading losses there, but provided mixed signals about whether financial downturns elsewhere might lead to more widespread losses.
As the Russian crisis deepens, volatility in more economically significant countries like Brazil and Argentina is also eating into the profits of some financial concerns doing business there. Indeed, some analysts say there is now ample evidence that the current raft of financial problems extends far beyond Russia's toppling economy. 
 "That's the most important issue -- that markets are starting to overrun governments' abilities to contain them in many parts of the world -- and nobody wants to talk about them because it's a confidence game of sorts," said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. "Banks and businesses don't want to create uncertainty that causes people not to repay one another."
Still, some analysts said they have yet to see signs indicating that serious losses will appear elsewhere in the world.
"The market's concern and what Moody's is concerned about is exposures in places like Latin America," said Gregory Bauer, a managing director and banking analyst with Moody's Investors Service in New York. "The banks are well positioned now to deal with potential losses."
Nonetheless, the debris from trading problems is piling up.
BankAmerica, the fifth-largest bank in the United States, said yesterday that it had trading losses of $220 million on a pretax basis over the last two months, largely as a result of soured trades in Russia. Given reports earlier this week of other companies' losses in Russia, many analysts and investors had been bracing themselves for BankAmerica to report a similar loss, so the figure did not come as a complete surprise.
But BankBoston, the 17th-largest bank in the country, announced a $30 million pretax trading loss, only $10 million of which was related to Russia. Most of the rest of the figure was a result of trading losses in Brazil and Argentina, according to the bank.
Although BankBoston is not in the top tier of large American banks doing business abroad, it has one of the oldest and largest United States banking franchises in South America and is something of a proxy for conditions there. And the announcement of its trading losses is the first solid indication this week that American companies may start to accumulate losses in that region.
Yet J. P. Morgan -- a more important bellwether for the well-being of emerging markets than BankBoston -- indicated yesterday that it might be faring well in South America and elsewhere, even as it too suffers trading losses in Russia.
Morgan, the nation's fourth-largest bank, announced yesterday that its exposure in Russia was $160 million, well below the exposure of $400 million that analysts had estimated the bank had. A Morgan spokesman said the $160 million figure was the result of trading losses the bank incurred in Russia, but declined to specify the size of the losses or what the bank's exposure was before the losses occurred.
Morgan said that its trading revenue so far in the current quarter was $300 million, which includes "losses from write-downs of Russian trading assets, partially offset by gains in other emerging markets, and lower revenues from trading activities in developed markets." Morgan's trading revenue is on track to fall well short of the $920 million it hauled in last quarter.
Yesterday's news followed disclosures of big Russian trading losses this week by Credit Suisse First Boston, the Republic New York Corporation, and the speculator George Soros's group of hedge funds.
Investors continued to punish bank stocks yesterday. Shares of BankAmerica fell $4.125, or 5.6 percent, to $69.625, while BankBoston's stock dropped $3, or 7.7 percent, to $36, a new 52-week low. J. P. Morgan, which released its statement after the stock market closed, saw its shares beaten down 6.7 percent, to $97.75. Among other banking stocks, Bankers Trust dropped 5.3 percent, to $79.375; Citicorp fell 4 percent, to $117.125, and Chase Manhattan fell 2.8 percent, to $56.50.
Large American banks have relatively little exposure in Russia given their size -- about $7.68 billion, according to Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. By comparison, the largest American banks have $25.7 billion in exposure to Brazil, $17.3 billion to Mexico, and $16.2 billion to Argentina, according to Brown Brothers. And in Latin America as a whole, the exposure is a whopping $98.9 billion.
Some analysts noted that even if banks face mounting losses around the globe, they are not the same companies that were brought to their knees a decade ago by shoddy lending practices to foreign governments and domestic real estate operators.
"Back in the 80's, these banks had less equity, less reserves and less earnings power than they do now," said James McDermott, chief executive of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., the bank research firm in New York. "Banks now have much more ability to withstand pain. They may be exposed to earnings shortfalls, but this is not a large, systemic economic threat."
BankAmerica said its exposure in Russia had been reduced to $100 million from $412 million on June 30, primarily because of the trading setbacks. BankAmerica's Moscow operation has been plagued by large accounting snafus. Recently, the bank was forced by what it described as an accounting error to restate its exposure in Russia at the end of the second quarter to $412 million from $668 million.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE STUMBLING GIANT;
A Lot of Talk About Russia, but the Numbers Shout Japan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF and SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 28

 BODY:
One statistic stands out to explain the importance of Japan, along with its misery:
When trading ended today at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in value by $241 billion -- a sum that exceeds the size of the entire annual output of the Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of erasing Russia from the world map for a year. 
 Japan is so monumental as to be critical to the prospects of the international economy, but for all its tremendous underlying strengths it is for now an economic mess -- one incomparably larger than Russia's.
A month after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, vowing "to deal with each issue in a dramatic, speedy way," Japan remains firmly in recession and largely paralyzed politically and economically.
The stock market fell 3.5 percent today to its lowest level since 1986, while long-term bond yields tumbled to 1.07 percent. They are the lowest long-term interest rates in recorded history, having recently fallen below the previous record low rate of 1.125 percent offered by the Italian city-state of Genoa in 1619.
The markets are tumbling because for all Mr. Obuchi's pledges, Japan is in even greater political gridlock than usual. Mr. Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has never been described as energetic, except by itself, but these days even its modest plans to revive the banking system are being blocked by opposition parties in the Diet, or Parliament.
The upshot is that the six bills that represent the centerpiece of Mr. Obuchi's plans to revive the economy remain stuck in numbing Diet hearings. Officials acknowledge that it will be difficult to win passage of the bills by the time Mr. Obuchi meets President Clinton for a mini-summit meeting in New York planned for around Sept. 21, and the delays and stalemate are further dispiriting the markets here and around the world.
In short, expectations of Mr. Obuchi were low, and he has met them.
"In the long term, the Japanese situation is in some ways even worse than the Russian situation, particularly given the size of the Japanese economy and the seeming inability to take really serious action," said M. Y. Yoshino, a Harvard Business School professor who is an expert on Japan and is now visiting Tokyo.
Professor Yoshino noted that for all the vast scale of the bad bank debts in Japan -- perhaps five times the size of the entire Russian financial market before its collapse -- there is little move toward dramatic restructuring to restore economic growth.
A banking analyst at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo, James Fiorillo, penned a bit of verse that captures the mood here. It begins:
'Twas the night before crisis
And behind the Diet border
Not a creature was stirring,
To restore financial order.
Mr. Obuchi and his aides have been defending their conduct, but the defenses have only added to the impression that the Government does not have the same sense of urgency as the rest of the world.
Today, for example, Mr. Obuchi was scolded in Parliament by a prominent economist, Yoshio Suzuki, who accused the Government of adopting economic measures that were -- he switched to English -- "too little, too late."
Mr. Obuchi, who by all accounts is an exceptionally friendly and genial man, grinned and replied that if anything, his efforts had been -- here he switched to English -- "too much, too fast."
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters after stocks tumbled today: "This isn't something to panic about. With the passage of time, the market will stabilize again."
Perhaps Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Obuchi are trying to reassure the public, but to some it comes across as complacency. Officials have been reassuring ever since Japan's "bubble economy" burst in about 1991, and yet declining asset values have steadily erased more than $5 trillion in wealth, equivalent to wiping out half the entire value of all the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Right now, this is the worst scenario," warned Masaru Takagi, an economist at Meiji University, referring to the plodding approach by the Government and the stalemate in Parliament. Professor Takagi estimated that there is a 50 percent chance the Obuchi Government will collapse and be forced to call fresh elections, delaying any further moves to revive Japan's economy.
"There is no time to waste, so we must avoid a general election this year," he said.
Opposition parties, however, seeing blood in the water, are circling eagerly and insisting that this is just the time for general elections to break the deadlock, instead of waiting for two more years until elections are due.
"General elections should come fast," said Mr. Suzuki, the economist, who is now a member of Parliament for the opposition Liberal Party. "We're now in a standstill, and in that case no bills may pass the Diet, and economic and financial crises may occur."
Paradoxically, Mr. Obuchi's Government is weak in part because of constant complaining by critics at home and abroad, especially in the United States Treasury Department, who want Japan to act far more decisively to address its economic problems. But the criticism has so weakened the Government that it is less able than ever to push through economic measures.
A weakened Japan is a global problem because it exacerbates the Asian crisis, and because the plummeting yen has been squeezing China, South Korea and other countries. President Jiang Zemin of China this week appealed again to Japan to do more to help its economy, and many experts fear that China may eventually be pressured to devalue its currency, setting off a new round of devaluations and financial crises around Asia.
All that has added to the demands on Mr. Obuchi to be more aggressive in tackling Japan's problems.
"Some substantial initiative needs to be taken by the Government," said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo University. "It is the responsibility of the Government, or it can be the end of the Obuchi Government."
The opposition usually does not matter much in the Japanese Parliament, but the main opposition leader, Naoto Kan, has crafted a broad and relatively unified front that has blocked the Government's proposals and offered its own. Some economists think Mr. Kan's financial plan is better than the Government's, because it insists on more bank disclosure, but there are also criticisms that Mr. Kan is playing politics with Japan's economic recovery.
"The opposition sees a chance to force the Government down, even if it happens to bring the economy down," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Barings Securities Japan Ltd. "Politicians are oblivious to things in the real world, it's pretty clear."
Mr. Obuchi clearly wants to have the bills passed by the time he meets Mr. Clinton, and one Cabinet official said the Prime Minister would meet opposition leaders soon to work out a compromise. The fall in global markets may increase the pressure on both sides to work out a deal.
"If we were not a parliamentary democracy, of course we would be able to make progress on many issues, but that's not the case," said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Mr. Obuchi. "If you call this paralysis, that could be one reason."
Asked if he thought the West was too impatient for results, considering that Mr. Obuchi has been in office for only one month, Mr. Saiki scarcely paused.
"Not just the West," he said glumly. "Everyone is a bit impatient."
Mr. Obuchi has taken some steps that are significant, even if they are less than his critics seek. He froze a fiscal austerity law, laying the groundwork for continued fiscal stimulus packages, and he prepared new budget guidelines and convened an economic advisory panel with coming up with creative ways to revive the economy.
Yet one indication of Mr. Obuchi's weakness and the perception that he will not survive long is that he has had trouble recruiting people. Sadako Ogata, the highly regarded United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, turned down an invitation to be foreign minister, one official said, and several prominent business leaders reportedly declined to serve on the advisory panel.
Whatever happens in Parliament, the situation is not entirely bleak. Above all, before Mr. Obuchi took office the Parliament had already passed a huge stimulus package, which will trickle through the economy this fall and generate some growth.
Though almost no one expects Mr. Obuchi to dramatically liberalize the economy, the stimulus itself and some associated tax cuts will lend a healthy boost.
Moreover, much of Japan's economic problem arises from a nearly universal gloom that makes everyone reluctant to buy or invest. That psychology is impossible to predict, but some optimists believe that the fiscal stimulus could restore growth, change the public mood, and bring the economy to life. That, if it happened, should revive the property and stock markets, and many bad loans would become good again.
"The pessimism," said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, "has been going too far."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: THE SUMMIT MEETING;
Frazzled Clinton Team Set To Fly Into Heart of Storm

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The scramble was on again today among President Clinton's already seriously scrambled aides.
Three days before they are scheduled to leave for a summit meeting in Moscow, senior Administration officials wondered what Russians they would wind up facing across conference tables. Mr. Clinton's aides began rewriting his planned remarks on the future of United States-Russian relations. 
 "You've got an economy collapsing and a President on the verge of resignation, and we're about to go there for a summit," one Administration official said this afternoon, referring to Russia and Boris N. Yeltsin. "Of course they've been going crazy at the White House."
Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser, gave a more measured assessment: "Well, I think that, obviously, one needs to make adjustments as the situation changes."
While Presidential trips abroad generally have the subtlety and delicacy of hurricanes, they are planned with the unstinting fussiness of Chinese operas.
The thick book laying out the President's schedule times his movements down to what minute he will enter which elevator past the startled maintenance staff in what dank basement (unless Mr. Clinton rewrites the official schedule as he goes).
Before the President went to Africa last spring, aides were dispatched as much as a month earlier to haggle over access and camera angles. With prompting from the Administration, Botswana even rushed a new cellular telephone system into service just ahead of Air Force One's arrival.
But this time, the only thing that some weary Presidential advisers seemed certain of was that the news media would blame the White House for Russian turmoil.
"It's our fault," one Administration official said, his sarcasm matched only by his exasperation. "If we'd been focused we would have improved the Russian tax collections system. Why argue with you guys anymore? Terrorism? Our fault."
The basic elements of the trip are unlikely to change, several officials said today. The prechewed matter dispensed on Presidential visits was prepared during weeks of talks. The Presidents will issue joint statements on weapons proliferation, Kosovo, Caspian oil reserves and the Persian Gulf. And Mr. Clinton's major stops -- including a joint news conference with Mr. Yeltsin, a speech, and a visit to a school -- are unlikely to be adjusted.
But the all-important tone of the trip, along with some of the President's meetings and his precise words, may be debated right up until he lands in Moscow on Tuesday morning -- or even longer.
"What the President says in public, where he goes, whom he meets with -- that's more of what we're reviewing right now," an Administration official said. "You want to project confidence and our ability to get the job done, but the fact is it's fluid."
The White House has been a busy place this August. For the most part, one set of aides has handled the biggest scandal of President Clinton's career -- his acknowledgment of an intimate relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky -- while another set managed the biggest counter-terrorist strike of his Presidency, the cruise missiles launched last week at Afghanistan and Sudan.
But there has been some crossover, including, of course, the President himself. Mr. Clinton will leave for Russia on Monday afternoon after what appears to have been one of the least restful family vacations imaginable.
Along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, President Yeltsin is the only major non-Communist leader who was serving when Mr. Clinton was first elected in 1992. It is a shaky trio. Mr. Kohl is facing a tough re-election campaign this year, and Mr. Clinton turned a stop in Germany in May into a virtual campaign swing for his old friend.
The President has built an affectionate and trusting relationship with Mr. Yeltsin, his aides say. But even before this week's furor he had planned to hedge American bets in Russia. On Wednesday, he meets with leaders of the Russia's Parliament and regions. That meeting, Mr. Clinton's aides said today, now takes on new significance.
Administration officials said that aides will probably have to rejigger key points and questions that Mr. Clinton should raise with Russian presidential hopefuls like Aleksandr I. Lebed, a former general who is now governor of a Siberian region.
Indeed, the two-day summit meeting is starting to shape up as almost an intelligence-gathering mission, since the status of the Russian Government is so unclear. While Mr. Clinton will meet with Mr. Yeltsin, several Cabinet members will also sit down with their counterparts -- whoever those may be.
"It's very rare that the senior leadership of the United States is going into a crisis environment," an official said, glimpsing the bright side and calling it "a real opportunity for senior policy makers to get a first-hand look."
One adviser to Mr. Clinton said that, with Mr. Yeltsin's rejection of resignation today, summit planning had settled down. "We're sort of more on track today than we were yesterday," he said. Besides, he argued, the Administration had never expected the trip to Russia to be routine.
"It's not like a completely stable situation went completely unstable," he said. "There's been uncertainty on several fronts all along."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW;
Dow Off by 114 More Points, Ending Worst Week Since '89

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply again yesterday, as continued fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness closer to home produced the worst week for the American stock market in nine years.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 114.31 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 8,051.68. For the week, the Dow industrials were down 5.6 percent. Not since the so-called mini-crash of October 1989, when the Dow fell 7.8 percent, has the bellwether index fallen so far so fast. 
 The decline yesterday was a mere shadow of the 4.1 percent drop on Thursday. But a stream of global losses continued yesterday, with financial markets in Asia and Europe particularly hard hit.
In the course of the last week, American investors have begun shifting their attention away from Russia and other foreign economies to the weakening outlook for corporate profits at home.
Those concerns showed up yesterday in the loss in the Nasdaq composite index, which is chock-full of the computer and Internet stocks that are enormously popular with individual investors. Traders aggressively sold shares of Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Yahoo and Amazon.com, stocks that have been among the biggest gainers of the year. The Nasdaq index fell 46.73 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,639.68, and finished the week 8.8 percent lower.
Despite the recent losses, most investors in these technology stocks are sitting on enormous gains: Amazon.com, for example, is still up 251 percent this year.
Some investors, and a few analysts on Wall Street, are beginning to worry, though, that profits for these and other American companies might not grow as much as expected next year.
"The problem is not just in Asia anymore," James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis, said. "Look to the north and south," where the Canadian and Mexican economies are struggling. That could more directly affect the profits of American companies, he said, keeping profit growth below 5 percent annually for the next few years after investors have come to expect growth of 10 percent or more. Others are even less optimistic. "We see no real earnings growth in 1998 or 1999, and we're uncertain about the year 2000," Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial Advisors, said. With that outlook, it is hard to justify current market prices, much less the far higher valuations of just a few weeks ago.
Since closing at a record high on July 17, the Dow industrials have lost 13.8 percent of their value, exceeding the 13.3 percent decline from August through October of last year. The major stock indexes are still showing gains for the year -- the Dow is up 1.8 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 5.9 percent.
But individuals who invest through mutual funds are more likely to be in the red. According to Lipper Analytical Services, the average general stock fund was down 2.8 percent from the beginning of the year through Thursday, meaning the recent plunge has started to eat into the profits accumulated over the last three roaring years.
The stock market attempted to rally yesterday. In the first half-hour of trading, the Dow industrials jumped more than 78 points. But in 15 minutes, they lost all that and more, as sell orders flooded in. The rest of the day, virtually any rally in share prices was met with further bouts of heavy selling.
Some market analysts continue to be optimistic, chief among them Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs & Company. In a note to clients yesterday, Ms. Cohen said that the recent declines in equity prices "have been more closely linked to changes in sentiment than changes in the fundamental backdrop in the United States." She added that the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which fell 5 percent last week and is 13.4 percent below its high, "is now 7 percent to 10 percent undervalued."
She now favors technology and financial services stocks, which suffered sharp blows again yesterday. Information is beginning to dribble out about the exposure of banks and securities firms to losses in foreign markets from loans, securities trades and complex financial contracts known as derivatives.
The BankAmerica Corporation and the BankBoston Corporation each reported heavy losses from the trading of domestic and international assets. BankAmerica said it had lost $220 million this quarter, primarily because of Russia, leaving it with trading profits of $315 million for the year. BankBoston said its international and domestic trading operations had lost $30 million in this quarter, with only one-third of the loss related to Russia. Having focused on Russian losses until now, investors in financial stocks began to fret more about losses in other locales, including Latin America.
Worries about the Russian economy, and its possible ripple effects through much of the developing world, continued to weigh on foreign markets as well yesterday. Share prices fell more than 2 percent in Britain and 1.7 percent in Germany, while Japan's Nikkei index slid 3.5 percent and finished the day below 14,000, at its lowest level in 12 years.
But Latin American markets, which have been swamped by selling in recent weeks, took a breather. Mexico's major stock market index gained 3.2 percent, and Brazil's rose nearly 2 percent -- small gains, but important for markets that have lost more than one-third of their value since January.
Investors worldwide generally sought safety, and in the United States they snapped up shares of electric utilities, telecommunications companies and others that pay high, steady dividends. Shares of Consolidated Edison, for example, rose 1 3/16 , to 47 13/16 , their highest level in a year, as the Dow Jones utilities average rose nearly 1 percent.
The utilities index, in fact, has gained 3.9 percent since the beginning of January, more than twice the gain in the Dow industrials.
Stocks of regional telephone companies also rose yesterday, with Ameritech, BellSouth and Bell Atlantic among the winners. Bell Atlantic gained $2, to $45 3/16 .
The biggest losses were among the technology stocks that have a fervent following of individual investors. Dell Computer fell $6 5/16 , to $118 3/4, while Cisco Systems dropped $4 7/16 , to $94 11/16 ; meanwhile Amazon.com dropped $13 7/64 , to $105 57/64 , and Yahoo lost $8, to $831/16 .
Investors who have held those stocks for the year may be wincing at the latest declines but reminding themselves of their nice gains. And in general, the market's drop in recent weeks is still not considered severe by many Americans.
"We're not yet even back to where we started the year," Mr. Paulsen of Norwest said about the latest decline. "People are saying, 'Oh, isn't that interesting.' If we got down another 15 percent, to where their net worths were back to where they were in 1996, they may begin to worry."

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE HEMISPHERE'S CRISIS;
Even as Latin Markets Plunge, Drastic Remedies Are Avoided

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 28

 BODY:
The recent panic in world markets has weakened Latin American currencies and drastically reduced the wealth of many Latin corporations, raising prospects that governments in the region may be forced to take Draconian measures to contain the crisis.
Financial authorities in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina and other nations have allowed interest rates to rise, spent billions of dollars of reserves to support their currencies, and tinkered with other limited steps. But, perhaps hoping that market calm will eventually prevail, they have avoided more drastic steps such as aggressively squeezing cash out of circulation, analysts said. 
 Today, the Mexican peso crossed an unwelcome threshold, dropping in value to settle at a rate above 10 to the United States dollar.
"The Latin countries are using their second-stage defenses, hoping that these external shocks won't last very long," said Luis R. Luis, a managing director at Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston. "They want to avoid having to impose really Draconian monetary policies. But if this continues, they're really going to have to jack up the interest rates."
Most Latin markets got a breather today after a week of panicked trading that saw foreign investors flee from the region and local traders cash out of equities to buy dollars.
Mexican stocks, which have fallen by more than half in dollar terms since the beginning of the year, rose 3.22 percent, with confidence bolstered in part by a more modest rise in Brazil's larger stock market.
Argentina's benchmark index rose nearly 1 percent; the Chilean and Peruvian markets were off slightly. Venezuela, the sick man of the region, was the exception -- its stock index plummeted 4.52 percent.
But gloom among investors and business executives across Latin America continued to deepen. Fears persist that the collapse of the Russian ruble could play out here, either with a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or, in what would be far worse, the Brazilian real.
Adding to the uncertainty was a belief that the International Monetary Fund, short of cash, is sitting on its hands, even though several Latin American economies are floundering. The fund has invited Latin finance ministers to meet next Thursday in Washington to discuss joint responses. Finance Minister Pedro Malan of Brazil and Economy Minister Roque Fernandez of Argentina have said they will attend. Mexico's Treasury Secretary, Jose Angel Gurria, and several others have not yet announced their intentions.
But because the I.M.F., after financing Asian and Russian rescue packages, has less than $10 billion available for new bailouts, its call for a meeting has aroused little hope.
Some analysts are starting to criticize what they see as a listless reaction to the financial chaos in Latin America by the Clinton Administration, too. "The U.S. is keeping monetary policy tight enough to slow our economy even though most developing economies sink," said David R. Malpass, chief international economist at Bear, Stearns. "I'm still hopeful that the U.S. will become more engaged, to calm things down and allow Latin America a rebound."
Since Asian financial crises broke out last year, international investors have become increasingly leery of emerging markets in general. And Russia's troubles have led to a hemorrhaging of capital out of Latin American securities.
In Caracas, where investors fear similarities between conditions in Russia's and Venezuela's oil-dependent and ill-managed economies, stocks are off 66 percent for the year in local-currency terms. Mexico's main stock index is down 40 percent, and if losses from the peso are taken into account, 51 percent. Brazil is 34 percent lower; Argentina 47 percent, and Chile 35 percent.
Authorities in the three largest Latin economies have confronted the crisis with relatively modest initial tactics, apparently hesitating before taking more painful steps, analysts said.
In Mexico, where the currency floats freely, the peso has dropped by 8.9 percent since the ruble's devaluation, settling here today at 10.020 to the dollar. Officials have attempted to slow the peso's decline by auctioning dollars, $200 million at a time, several times since the crisis began.
The Mexican central bank has also removed increasing amounts of currency from circulation as a way of indirectly raising interest rates. On Wednesday, it raised reserve requirements for commercial banks. In response, interest rates jumped to 27.2 percent on the 28-day Treasury notes that are used as a market reference, from 22 percent.
Still, Mexican rates are far below the 50 percent-plus levels reached in the peso crisis of 1994-95, when businesses were strangled and the economy plunged into a two-year recession.
In Brazil, where the currency trades within a fixed band and is under assault by speculators who consider it overvalued, the authorities have also defended its value. But there, too, they have acted with less vigor than during the previous crisis, a speculative attack last October.
As in October, Brazilian authorities have freely sold foreign reserves to defend the real. So far this month, economists estimate that some $8.5 billion of the country's $70 billion in foreign-exchange reserves have been sold to prop up the real. And the authorities have made it easier for Brazilians to borrow money abroad.
But in contrast with the moves last fall, the central bank has not yet raised interest rates from the current 19.75 percent, although offshore rates, set by commercial banks, have soared to 36 percent. Last fall, the authorities in Brasilia doubled official interest rates, to 41 percent, to defend the real.
The tactics in Brasilia are being watched closely in Buenos Aires. "The largest risk for Argentina is that the next victim could be Brazil," said Luis R. Secco, an economist with Estudio Broda, a consulting firm.
The Argentine peso is freely convertible with the dollar, and the central bank has $23.7 billion in foreign-exchange reserves. So far, authorities have made no changes in policy in reaction to the crisis, Mr. Secco said, adding, "Our authorities are viewing this calmly."
The opposite is true in Venezuela, where economists estimate that the bolivar may be overvalued by at least 30 percent and the budget deficit has ballooned as oil revenue plunged this year. The authorities have made deep spending cuts, allowed interest rates to soar above 100 percent, and last week sold nearly $500 million of the country's $14 billion in reserves. Nonetheless, fears of a devaluation are increasing.

HEADLINE: NORTHWEST PILOTS STRIKE AS TALKS FAIL ON CONTRACT

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Saturday, Aug. 29

 BODY:
More than 6,000 pilots at Northwest Airlines walked off the job last night, shutting down the country's fourth-largest airline in a strike that may cripple much of the Midwest.
"No Northwest pilot will fly until further notice from me," said Steve Zoller, the 747 captain who is chairman of the master executive council of the pilots' union, which reviewed Northwest's offer. 
 Despite 12 days of nearly nonstop negotiations under the direction of a Federal mediator, Northwest and the Air Line Pilots Association could not bridge their differences and reach a tentative contract.
President Clinton, who ordered striking pilots at American Airlines back to work last year, decided not to repeat the move.
In a statement, the White House said: "The President has decided not to exercise his authority to intervene and he urges the parties to stay at the table, work hard and resolve their differences. This dispute has dragged on for almost two years now and both sides should redouble their efforts to reach an agreement as soon as possible. They owe that to each other and to the American public."
Mr. Zoller said that the pilots union was fully committed to reaching a settlement. "After two years of negotiations, Northwest management has still not lived up to their responsibilities," he said. "I can assure you that our pilots would rather be in the cockpit than walking a picket line."
The union told all pilots to stay where they were until noon today. This appeared to be a sign that negotiations could resume soon, since it would take much more time to restart the airline if the pilots returned to their home bases.
Northwest said it was willing to keep negotiating. "We are committed to staying at the bargaining table for as long as it takes to get an agreement," said Donald J. Foley, vice president for communications for Northwest.
The strike grounded 1,700 of Northwest's daily flights and nearly 1,000 more flown by its two commuter affiliates, Mesaba Airlines and Express Airlines. Northwest is also one of the largest American carriers serving Asia with 119 international flights.
On Friday, many Northwest passengers were worried and confused as today's strike deadline of 12:01 A.M. Eastern time approached. Northwest canceled 170 of its flights on Friday, and some passengers were forced to seek other flights. Still, there were no signs of panic.
"Between Hurricane Bonnie and the threat of a Northwest strike, I figure I'm playing double jeopardy," said Tammy Wangler of Fargo, N.D., who was waiting Friday at the Hector International Airport in Fargo to board a Northwest flight to Raleigh, N.C.
A main sticking point in the negotiations between Northwest and the pilots, according to both sides, was the pilots' pay.
Northwest was offering a wage increase of 10 percent over the life of a new five-year contract, which it said would bring the pilots in line with their counterparts at American Airlines, which is the country's second-largest carrier.
But the pilots, many of whom earn more than $200,000 a year, wanted a 15 percent increase and a onetime payment of $25,000 each to make up for the sacrifices they made in 1993, when they took a 15.5 percent pay cut, along with other Northwest union workers, to bring Northwest back from the brink of bankruptcy.
"We shared the pain to help our airline survive, and now we want to share in the success we helped create," Mr. Zoller said last week.
Northwest officials said that the pilots received 14.4 million shares of stock, or 18 percent of the company's stock, in exchange for their wage cuts. They say those shares are now worth more than $500 million.
"We acknowledge that they deserve a raise," said Mr. Foley.
"That has never been the issue," he said. "The question is: How much can the No. 4 airline afford?"
Late Friday evening, Northwest disclosed its latest pay offer to the union that would give pilots 4.5 percent more money than pilots at other big airlines by the year 2000 and 7.7 percent by 2002. The company said it would also provide profit-sharing of up to 5 percent of each pilot's pay and a lump-sum payment equal to 3.5 percent of annual pay. It also said it would make changes in its two-tier pay scale, in which beginning pilots make 40 percent less than experienced ones, reducing the time needed to go to the higher tier to three years from five.
It was unclear how much of an increase the latest offer was over Northwest's initial offer of a 10 percent pay increase.
Another big issue in the contract negotiations has been job security. The airline also said that its latest offer included a no-layoffs proposal. The pilots union had been concerned about their status under a proposed alliance with Continental Airlines. It was also concerned about losing jobs to regional airlines allied with Northwest and to foreign airlines like KLM that also have an alliance with Northwest.
But the airline's proposal on job security failed to satisfy the pilots union. Paul G. Omodt, a spokesman for the pilots union, said, "We are not going to give away our jobs."
Five other unions, representing the lion's share of Northwest's workers, including flight attendants, maintenance workers and reservation clerks, are also negotiating new contracts and have pledged to support the strike. Two of those unions, the International Association of Machinists and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, also received stock in Northwest in 1993 in exchange for wage cuts and have representatives on the company's 15-member board.
Northwest executives have been concerned that if they give too much to the pilots, they will have to do the same for other workers, leaving the airline with higher costs than its larger competitors.
But the unions point out that such concerns have not stopped company executives, led by president and chief executive John H. Dasburg, from enriching themselves with tens of thousands of stock options worth millions of dollars. Mr. Dasburg alone sold stock worth $19 million earlier this year.
The strike came as a blow to several upper Midwest states, including Michigan, Minnesota and north and South Dakota, that depend almost exclusively on Northwest for their jet service.
Northwest flies about 80 percent of the seats available in Detroit and Minneapolis-St. Paul, the country's 9th and 13th busiest airports. In many smaller cities in Michigan and the Dakotas, Northwest is the only airline offering service.
Governors in seven Midwest states and Tennessee had appealed to President Clinton to intervene to prevent a strike. But an equally influential group of Senators, Congressmen and union leaders, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and House Democratic leader Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, urged the Mr. Clinton not to interfere.
Officials and travel agents in Minnesota, Michigan and other states said that there was little they could do to prevent the damage.
"Obviously, there is a great deal of concern in communities like Minneapolis and Detroit because the impact of a strike takes away 80 percent of the lift in the marketplace," said Brent Garback, the chief executive of Total Travel management, one of the largest corporate travel agencies in Michigan. "There aren't enough seats to be had for people to wander over to an another airline. From an economic standpoint a strike is devastating to the community."
Mr. Omodt added that after a few days of adjustment other airlines would begin sending in more planes.
However, carriers such as Trans World Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Airlines and others said that they did not have enough spare airplanes to make up for the loss of Northwest service in the upper Midwest. The airlines have said that they will accept tickets from Northwest passengers only if seats on their planes are available.

To the Editor:
California bashing is a favorite Book Review hobby, of course, and must be comforting. But I can't let you get away with "the state's colleges and universities have evolved into economic aeries for the privileged children of the upper-middle-class taxpayer" (from Jack Hitt's June 14 review of "Cold New World: Growing Up in a Harder Country," by William Finnegan). 
 The University of California may not be free anymore, but with tuition nearing $5,000 a year it's still one of the greatest bargains in education; the California State universities are even cheaper, and the community colleges, at $13 a credit, are within reach of everybody. When black enrollment declined after affirmative action was canceled, the spaces did not go to rich white kids. A large portion went to young people of Asian heritage, many if not most coming from modest homes.

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill 

 BODY:
Like thousands of families across the country, members of the Lounsberry clan gather every few years to eat fried chicken and potato salad and to tell each other stories. The story they like to tell best is the one about the freelance photographer assigned to the cover their gathering for an upstate newspaper.
As the photographer trained his lens on the nearly 300 people gathered in front of him, something about the scene, not to mention the names on the name tags -- Corabelle Lounsberry, Albert Lounsbury, Jim Lounsbury -- made the middle-aged man shiver. 
 The journalist was named Lonsberry, you see, and he hadn't spoken to his family since he fled Texas for Canada to avoid the draft, some 25 years earlier. Yet there he was on a routine assignment trolling name tags and chin lines for the family he had left behind.
Today, Bob Lonsberry, a talk-show host for WHAM radio in Rochester -- and an army veteran -- gets a big kick out of being mistaken for the draft dodger in that story. "That's the great thing about oral history," he laughs. "It always contains a shred of truth. I am a journalist, and it was hot outside that day. "
Otherwise, the story that's made the rounds is a complete fiction -- Lonsberry was there as one of the family. But it's fiction based on a family truth: after the Revolutionary War, the clan that descended from Richard Lounsberry -- who migrated to America from Yorkshire, England, in the mid-1600's -- split along political lines, and the Loyalists moved to Canada.
In a large old family, Lonsberry explains, no one is merely an individual. "Everyone is always moving the story line along."
Since World War II, American families have scattered across the country in search of economic opportunity. Sociologists believe that this splintering has resulted in an intense longing for connection, and the proof of this is the current fascination with genealogy -- and the explosion of family reunions.
Family reunions number about 200,000 formal celebrations a year, according to Tom Ninkovich, the founder of Reunion Research in Auberry, Calif. His surveys show that at least eight million Americans attended a family reunion in 1996, which would account for hundreds of millions of dollars spent on travel, lodging and meals, to say nothing of film.
Jennifer Crichton, the author of "Family Reunion," a sourcebook for planning reunions, says that food is central to the ritual. "Reunions are about establishing a sense of continuity," she says. "Food is the easiest and most powerful way of creating a connection between generations."
The meals served at a typical reunion range from fancy sit-down dinners constructed from heirloom recipes to a barbecue of hot dogs and toasted marshmallows. One thing is certain, however. Heroic quantities are de rigueur.

HEADLINE: Hun Sen Stages an Election

BYLINE: By Tina Rosenberg; Tina Rosenberg, a member of the Times editorial board, writes on international affairs. Her last article for the magazine was about the Bosnia war-crimes tribunal.

 BODY:
Life has changed for the big men of small countries. Gone are the days when a thuggish third-world leader could find a superpower to support him, if only because the other didn't. Thirteen years ago, when Hun Sen first became Prime Minister of Cambodia, it was as the puppet of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and they were not particularly bothered by political killings or a lack of elections. (The United States was equally indifferent to the corruption and abuses of Lon Nol, the Cambodian dictator it supported in the early 1970's.)
But with the cold war over, things changed. The United Nations moved in; an election was held in 1993 and, until last year, Hun Sen ruled Cambodia in coalition with his co-Prime Minister and political rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. In July 1997, however, Hun Sen staged a military coup, ousting Ranariddh and killing at least 41 of the Prince's military and political allies. This violated the rules of the post-cold-war world, which call for democracy -- at least in a small and poor country. Largely at the urging of Congress, Washington cut off foreign aid to his Government (it continued to help finance Cambodia's buzzing civil society) and stopped the United Nations from awarding him Cambodia's U.N. seat. The Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, which had been considering Cambodia for membership, abruptly froze its bid. 
 These slights were a problem for a man who craved respect, got half his budget from foreign aid and had been cut off by the International Monetary Fund because of corruption. The solution was an election. He held it on July 26 -- and apparently got everything he wanted. International observers took note of the killings of activists from opposition parties, of Hun Sen's monopoly over television and radio, of his control of the electoral machinery, of his party's bribes and widespread intimidation of voters. And they approved the election anyway. The speed and enthusiasm of the world's embrace raises troubling questions about whether it is democracy or merely its appearance that the world demands, and whether the international rules are any less cynical today than during the cold war.
I came to Cambodia to watch the election and to interview Hun Sen, an interview suggested and arranged by his American lawyers and his public-relations adviser. Bretton Sciaroni, an American working in Phnom Penh as a lawyer for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, or C.P.P., said that Hun Sen's P.R. makeover began following the July '97 coup. "After the fighting last summer, they the C.P.P. couldn't get their side of the story out," he said. Sciaroni was once a lawyer in the Reagan White House. Now he was standing in a schoolyard on election morning, waiting for Hun Sen to vote. "My conservative brethren don't understand my involvement with the C.P.P.," he said. "I would argue the C.P.P. is more pro-free enterprise." There was a pause. "But ideology has nothing to do with it. It's all power." A succinct description of what drives Cambodian politics.
Sciaroni wrote a long paper giving Hun Sen's side of the coup. To help in Washington, he hired James C. Stearns, a lawyer with Porter, Wright, Morris & Arthur. Stearns, in turn, brought along the law firm of Arnold & Porter and David Morey, a corporate strategist. A letter filed with the Justice Department's foreign-agent registry says these consultants will get a total of $550,000 for five months' work, ending next month.
They held dinners in Washington for visiting C.P.P. officials and supporters of Hun Sen. "We're advising them on free elections," Morey told me over lunch in Phnom Penh. One of Morey's associates said, "We are working with Hun Sen on human rights." Speaking of the time I would have to meet with Hun Sen, Stearns said that his advisers were rearranging his campaign schedule so I could see him "with his best foot forward."
The client is a p.r. challenge. Since the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975, Cambodia has suffered under an assortment of dreadful Governments, and Hun Sen has been in all of them. He was still a teen-ager, a peasant's son, when he joined the Khmer Rouge guerrillas nearly 30 years ago. In 1977, while a midlevel officer, he fled to Vietnam. Two years later, when Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge and installed a Government in Cambodia, Hun Sen, all of 27, was its Foreign Minister. In 1985, at 33, he became Prime Minister.
Hun Sen's Government was infinitely better than the psychopathic terror of the Khmer Rouge. It was, nevertheless, a brutal Communist dictatorship that used assassination and torture to still its critics and controlled the country through a network of party-appointed village chiefs. The Khmer Rouge guerrillas continued their civil war. To Washington's undying shame, it supported the Khmer Rouge claim to be the legitimate Government of Cambodia and encouraged China to give the guerrillas aid -- because they were fighting a regime aligned with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
In 1991, Washington, Moscow and Beijing brokered a peace deal that put an end to the 13-year civil war. The United Nations moved in with a huge and ambitious peacekeeping operation. It spent more than $2 billion to organize elections in 1993 and try to restore democracy. The C.P.P. lost to Funcinpec, the royalist party led by Prince Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen then claimed he had been cheated and threatened to continue the civil war unless he got a share of power. The United Nations caved in; neither the United States nor anyone else had the stomach for battles between U.N. and C.P.P. troops. So Hun Sen retained his control. It was an important lesson in the pliability of the international community.
Over the next few years, Hun Sen learned how easy it was to manipulate the outside world. The U.N. did not demand that the C.P.P. loosen its control of the army and political structures. Hun Sen's influence was boosted by the incompetence of Prince Ranariddh, whose only talent for leadership seemed to be enjoying the perquisites of power.
But two events in 1997 shattered the world's complacency with Hun Sen. One was the coup. The other was a grenade attack on a peaceful political rally in Phnom Penh, killing 16 people and narrowly missing Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most ardent critics. Witnesses saw Hun Sen's bodyguards protect the suspects. The only investigation -- by the American F.B.I. -- was halted prematurely and the results have never been released. Even a number of Hun Sen's supporters told me they believed the bombing was the work of those close to him.
My interview with Hun Sen took place on Election Day in his new house, a huge peach-colored stucco mansion about 10 miles from Phnom Penh. The sitting room was decorated in ornate Louis XIV style, with white sculpted chairs, crystal chandeliers, marble floors, flowered rugs and cabinets full of expensive-looking silver bowls and sculptures. The grounds featured Versailles-style gardens, fish ponds and coconut groves. He has another house in town.
The cabinet behind his office desk displays honorary degrees from American schools -- one, I later learned, from an unaccredited correspondence school. There were also pictures of his children, who by fall will all be studying in France and America, one of them at West Point. Sciaroni, Morey and Stearns sat with us.
Hun Sen was well briefed. His answers were direct and well organized, mercifully absent the hourlong monologue that normally kicks off an interview with him. He stuck to his message: Hun Sen, democrat.
I brought up Washington. "We agree with each other on democracy, pluralism and respect for human rights," he said, smiling. The grenade attack on the Sam Rainsy rally, he implied, was carried out by a member of the royalist party, Funcinpec. Asked about the coup, he took out two maps from his desk and went through an intricate account of provocation by Ranariddh and the Khmer Rouge. When I left he gave me a souvenir watch with his picture on it.
The centerpiece of Hun Sen's attempt to remake himself as a democrat was the elections themselves. Although Hun Sen claims authorship, he had to be pushed into elections by the more moderate wing of the C.P.P., which believed the party's nationwide machine would assure victory. Still, Hun Sen had balked. Even a month before the election, he was still trying to get Ranariddh's party disqualified.
The election would not have happened at all without the cajoling of foreign diplomats, including an unprecedented effort by the Asean nations, who usually refrain from meddling in the political affairs of Asian countries. Nevertheless, the campaign climate was so lopsided that a pre-election statement issued by the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, the American monitoring groups, called the process "fundamentally flawed."
Hun Sen's control of broadcasting was one reason. The United Nations human rights office in Cambodia, which tracked media appearances, found that in the month of May, Hun Sen and C.P.P. officials were on the air 448 times, mostly shown handing out goodies. Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy party officials had a total of 14 appearances, most of them treated negatively.
Local election committees and polling stations were run by C.P.P.-appointed village chiefs. I met people who had been given clothes and food in exchange for promises to vote C.P.P., and others who had been threatened, forced to join the party and warned of the consequences if the C.P.P. lost. The U.N. human rights office, which Hun Sen has repeatedly tried to close, tracked scores of suspected political murders between the coup and the election. None have been investigated.
The C.P.P., which won only 41 percent of the vote, boosted its total from 59 to 64 parliamentary seats -- 2 more than a majority -- by using a new formula to allocate seats. Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy's party alleged that the vote count had been ruined by ballot-stuffing, deliberate miscounting or other fraud. Losers always cry fraud in Cambodia, but there was enough evidence of mischief during the vote count to make the allegations credible. It would have taken a thorough investigation to determine whether the incidents of fraud were widespread enough to have altered the outcome. Yet the international community quickly declared the election valid. The American monitoring groups, who had long-term monitors in Cambodia throughout the campaign, issued a written statement saying that the "relative success" of balloting and counting could not negate the violence and unfairness of the campaign, but that the Cambodian people had overcome those obstacles and held a "successful exercise in national self-determination."
That was overshadowed, however, by the news-conference ad lib of Stephen Solarz, the former Congressman and a leader of the delegation, who said that if the opposition charges proved unfounded, history could one day call the election "the miracle on the Mekong." He also implied that after an investigation of the opposition's claims, Hun Sen should get his Asean membership, foreign aid and U.N. seat.
The other foreign monitors were even more enthusiastic. Two days before the vote, a U.N.-sponsored monitoring group with delegates from dozens of countries said conditions for the elections were "reasonable." The day after the election, it called the voting and counting "free and fair to an extent that enables it to reflect, in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people." Sven Linder, the Swedish diplomat who was the spokesman for the group, said at the news conference: "We traced no tensions in the air. We have not traced any atmosphere of intimidation."
The positive tone prevailed, perhaps, because most monitors spent only the week around the election in Cambodia, and for that period the C.P.P. largely behaved. Cambodians, who are rarely asked their opinions on anything, had a voter turnout of more than 90 percent and told observers they were thrilled to be able to choose a good Government. Their dignity and enthusiasm for democracy moved observers. But the observers' emotional reaction may have caused them to overlook the unfairness of the campaign. They tended to forget how ill equipped outsiders were to spot problems. Villagers were warned not to talk to foreigners. It is impossible, even at less charged times than Election Day, to have a private conversation in the claustrophobic and controlled atmosphere of a Cambodian village, and anyone suspected of talking about mischief would be in danger. My visits to villages convinced me that I could gain no idea what was going on under the surface. Although there was a network of domestic observers, there were only 500 teams of foreign observers for 11,000 polling places.
Carol Armstrong, executive director of the U.S.-Thailand Business Council and an American monitor, said: "The premature judgment on the election by the international community was throwing away 12 months of documented cases of intimidation and human rights abuses for two days."
Solarz was crucial to the success of the 1991 Cambodian peace accords that led to the 1993 elections and was the Clinton Administration's special envoy to Cambodia after the coup. His involvement may have encouraged him to look on the bright side. He also had a potential conflict of interest stemming from his position as a senior counselor at the Washington lobbying firm Apco Associates. The Legal Times of Washington reported last year that in 1995 Solarz participated in a pitch meeting with Ranariddh to represent Cambodia in Washington. Apco then registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent representing Cambodia. Apco failed to get the job , however; perhaps the contract required Hun Sen's approval.
Solarz denied that these business efforts created a conflict. "My relationship to Cambodia goes back a long time," he said "If anything, I'm biased in favor of the opposition."
The calm of Election Day provided cover for other observers who had political reasons to endorse the election. U.N. monitors were never given detailed information about the abuses of the campaign period before they arrived. When team leaders from each country met before the election to write a statement about the campaign period, the Asian delegates argued against pointing out any problems. When the delegates met again on counting day, most of the Europeans argued against using "free and fair." But delegates from France and Asian nations -- which included such dictatorships as China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam -- disagreed. Asean members, in particular, argued that European standards should not apply. "Asean wants to admit Cambodia as a member as soon as they possible can," one Western diplomat said. "A minimally credible election would be enough."
Some who found the election legitimate argued that it had to be seen in context. The world, after all, had accepted Suharto in Indonesia, even though his elections featured no real opposition at all. Intimidation was nothing new in Cambodian political culture. Ranariddh, moreover, promised nothing better. He preferred golf to working and surrounded himself with courtiers. "The international community decided that Ranariddh was a buffoon," said one Western diplomat.
The American Ambassador Kenneth Quinn was widely perceived as pro-Hun Sen, but most of the important ambassadors in Phnom Penh felt that Hun Sen was the key to stability, one high-ranking Cambodian official told me. "They work with who has the power," he said. "Hun Sen became the interlocutor." The quality of the election was irrelevant, and he knew it.
The United Nations and European nations have their own reasons for endorsing the election. The U.N. spent more than $2 billion to try to make Cambodia a democracy five years ago. This year, the European Union spent nearly $12 million on the election. "There's real Cambodia fatigue," one European diplomat said. "It's been 20 years or so, and a lot of effort and time has gone into helping to fix Cambodia. People are turning away and want a solution."
It remains to be seen what kind of solution Hun Sen can offer, what kind of stability can come from a leader whose strongman rule is blocking the creation of the institutions needed for long-term stability. After the election, hundreds of opposition activists were threatened and fled their villages. Two weeks ago, Cambodia's own National Election Commission, which is stuffed with Hun Sen supporters, rejected almost all the opposition claims summarily. And on Aug. 20, one man died in a gun-and-grenade attack at a Sam Rainsy-led protest outside the Interior Ministry.
How the world will treat Cambodia has also not yet been settled, but it seems as though Hun Sen will be accorded the legitimacy he wanted. Cambodia has been a laboratory for the international community, which succeeded in pushing Hun Sen to adopt the trappings of democracy. And even those may evaporate completely once the world turns away.
But the real manipulation went in the other direction, as Hun Sen got the world's endorsement for an election that was neither free nor fair. The mouse, after all, also trains the scientist. When he rings the bell, the good doctor brings him cheese.

HEADLINE: Carried Away

BYLINE: By Corby Kummer; Corby Kummer is a senior editor at The Atlantic Monthly and the author of "The Joy of Coffee."

 BODY:
A few weeks ago I was flying toward the spa towns of San Pellegrino, in northern Italy, and Evian, in France near the Swiss border. A good deal of my grocery budget goes to water bottled in both these places. I buy them because I prefer them to my Boston tap water. Many of my friends buy bottled water because they are worried about the healthfulness of their tap water. I am not, but I like the taste of the stuff, which is better than the chemical tang of my chlorinated tap water. Still, I suspected I was missing something. I was in search of the Great Sip, the source that would spoil me for anything I could find at my 7-Eleven.
Idly, I examined the foil label that sealed the cup of water sitting in the coffee cup of the Swissair economy-class dinner. It was a brand I didn't know, Glacier Valley. There was a picture of a snow-covered mountain behind fir trees and perhaps a stream. What riveted me was the address: not Switzerland, not Italy, not France, but Ellington, Conn. 
 I grew up in Ellington. I had been there three days before, to attend the funeral of my 97-year-old step-grandfather, whose father had a farm alongside two of my great-grandfathers near the small Connecticut River valley town. Lush tobacco farmland was a part of my childhood landscape, and burbling brooks, too -- but not many fir trees, and no snow-covered mountains. I asked my brother, a New York City gastroenterologist, which water sources he remembered other than Shenipsit Lake, a local reservoir. He responded in an ominous tone, thinking of the maladies his patients frequently reported, "The cow pond at Moser Farms."
Moser Farms sounded right -- a dairy made so successful by the enterprise of the families (Swiss, as it happened) of some of our Ellington schoolmates that it has gone national and renamed itself Country Pure Foods. Upon my return from Europe, a woman in customer service told me that the company indeed supplies little cups of water to more than half the airlines that fly out of the country. "A lot of people from Ellington call us," she said. "They don't realize what we're doing here until they travel." When I asked where the water came from, the woman did not mention a cow pond. "You mean the spring out back?" she asked. The bore hole to pump water out of the spring, I learned, is attached to the yellow-brick barn we used to pass on our way to school, which instead of cows now houses spare parts for bottling equipment.
Everyone seems to be discovering a backyard spring and piping it into a bottle these days. In the past 10 years, sales of bottled water in the United States have increased 144 percent -- more than any other sector of the beverage market -- and annual per-capita consumption has more than doubled, from 5 to 11 gallons. Water has acquired a high-tech glamour for investors, who are amassing land holdings for the value of their aquifers; processing, filtering, and water-transport businesses are growing fast. The United States is the world's largest market for imported water. Water bars in Boston and New York and Los Angeles, often inside health clubs or trendy home-furnishing stores, display bottles from places like Italy, France, Sweden, Wales and Fiji as if they were single-malt Scotch, and charge laughable prices for something that can be gotten out of a faucet.
How do they get away with it? Why do we feel the sudden need to pay money for what has always been free? How is it that the plastic bottle with its pacifier-like nipple has become our latest security blanket? Have we been taken in by press-induced paranoia or merely seduced by fashion? Will we really drink any water that comes in a bottle -- even if it might be nothing more than municipal tap water, fancily filtered and reassuringly labeled as "purified drinking water"? Is water connoisseurship just wine snobbery without the color and the calories? Or does the source really affect how water tastes and even how it makes us feel?
I wanted to find out, and to answer a number of other watery puzzles, which is why I was on the plane. The water in the little cup tasted familiar -- all too familiar. I was in search of something better.
 
Who Started This Water Mania?
Not our parents. Tap water was free, or next to free, it was fluoridated to build strong teeth and its safety was simply not in question. New Yorkers, of course, had it best of all, with a pure-tasting, refreshing tap water that was the envy of the country. When Manhattan waiters began to ask which brand of bottled water to bring, the only logical reply was an indignant "New York tap, please!" In only a few years, though, tap water has gone from an automatic given to a suspect second choice.
Brand-name water first became a sign of cosmopolitan, teetotaling chic in the mid-70's, when Perrier advertised heavily and made fizzy designer water a socially acceptable alternative order at bars and restaurants -- not to mention one with a high profit margin. All-night discogoers detoxed with daylight water cures. As drugs of choice moved to targeted, in-and-out highs, water seemed a cleaner, more appropriate accompaniment than alcohol to, say, Ecstasy.
Then the gym replaced the disco, and water is the only cool drink to carry at the gym (sports drinks are a bit too phys. ed.). The culture of the body has long been replacing the culture of the soul, as the historian Barbara Ketcham Wheaton has pointed out in discussing our obsession with food; people insist on allowing only the best substances to enter their bodies, and lately "best" means "purest." Alpine landscapes on water bottles look very pure. Drinking large quantities of water is seen not just as a way to maintain health -- at least eight glasses a day, we are constantly told -- but as a way to curb appetite. Models began toting plastic water bottles to photo shoots, and it was a short step from the studio to the street.
The advent of polyethylene terephthalate -- lightweight, crystal-clear, flexible -- cannot be underestimated in explaining the huge rise in sales. PET has turned bottled water into a plausible tap-water replacement: no need for a cumbersome home cooler, and empties can easily be compacted by hand -- a neat trick, known by seemingly every European, that can come as a surprise to the uninitiated. I already knew the two-handed Evian crush, illustrated on the label, which requires some force and a stable surface. But on my European rounds I learned a more elegant technique from two men who showed me around the Sangemini plant, in Umbria, which bottles a water that Italians revere for its healthful properties. As the two men were smoking after lunch in the company cafeteria (this was Europe, after all, where even runners smoke), one of them lifted an empty bottle off the table, folded the bottom into the center and rolled up the flattened bottle like a toothpaste tube, capping it so air would not get back in and unfold the bottle. "I don't know why people make such a big deal out of it," he said with a modest shrug. I now immodestly demonstrate his method every chance I get.
The greatest current growth is in "convenience sizes" -- those trim bottles, ridged or otherwise decoratively molded, that seem de rigueur for every gym -- and conference attendee and subway rider. The first ripples of this tidal wave may have been fashion and health consciousness, and the sheer ease of carrying a little bottle rather than wondering where the next drinking fountain would turn up. Now the question is whether the water in those fountains traveled through rusty pipes or a Giardia-infested stream. What began in fashion has crested on fear.
 
What's Wrong With Tap Water, Anyway?
Very little, except taste. Yet water quality has become to the late 1990's what air quality was to the 1960's -- where environment meets personal health in a way that provokes alarm. The difference is that now people think they can buy safety in a tightly capped bottle.
There hasn't been a big tap-water scare in five years, but the bleak news of 1993 seems to have permanently clouded the country's trust in the 170,000 public water supplies. In the space of five months, both New York City and Washington issued temporary warnings to boil tap water in order to kill E. coli and cryptosporidium, respectively; in Milwaukee, at least 69 people died and more than 400,000 were sickened by cryptosporidium in the water. Environmentalists had long been concerned about pollution from pesticides, industrial chemicals and agricultural runoff, along with lead and copper from old pipes. Now the danger was potentially days, not decades, away. Millions of Americans began to question something they never wanted to see in doubt.
Bottled-water companies may be careful not to inflame these worries, but they aren't shy about exploiting them. Models in ads are sleek and fit, clearly untroubled by lead or arsenic. Forests and snow-capped mountains are at a safe remove from oil-leaking factories and carbon-spouting cars. Commercials for Poland Spring, the best-selling water in America, humorously emphasize how carefully protected the source is, to convey the idea that protection means safety. Water is presumably transported in shiny new pipes instead of rusty old ones, although just how it gets from the idyllic landscape into the bottle is rarely hinted at. The foil cover of my airplane cup of Glacier Valley did not show the tractor trailers parked in the big lot behind the bore hole at the corner of Route 83 and Lower Butcher Road.
It is easy to forget that the building of America's muncipal water system was one of history's public-health triumphs. Barely more than a century ago, impure drinking water caused massive outbreaks of cholera (1 of 20 Chicago residents died in the 1854 cholera epidemic); huge sections of cities around the world were razed and rebuilt to replace contaminated water transport systems. The search for fresh water literally drew the map of the civilized world. At the turn of the century, the creation of the reservoir system to supply New York City determined the development of much of the state. Safe, plentiful water on demand is a very recent assumption. Should people be questioning it again so soon?
The Environmental Protection Agency staunchly maintains that they should not. Two years ago, the E.P.A. strengthened the Safe Drinking Water Act, which catalogs potential contaminants, and in November, enforceable limits will be placed on seven more substances, mostly to address public concern over the byproducts of chlorine and other disinfectants. "Every American should be confident that the water coming from their tap is safe and clean to drink," Carol Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, said in a statement prepared for this article, "and is regularly tested to insure that it meets tough health standards. We want the public to understand that standards set for municipal drinking water supplies are mandatory, and are monitored and tested more often than for bottled water."
Her careful wording hints at the open antagonism people who work with municipal water feel toward bottlers. They are frustrated that every flaw in tap water shows, from a water-main break that makes tap water look muddy for a few hours to the rust that stains people's sinks -- even though the iron could well be from a basement hot-water tank or home water pipes. The bottled-water industry, meanwhile, though it is overseen by the Food and Drug Administration, has been largely self-regulated for years, setting its own safety controls and requiring members to submit to unannounced annual checks. The F.D.A.'s zeal in monitoring the industry has come in for criticism -- F.D.A. officials publicly state that they consider bottled water a "low-risk" industry, especially compared with foods like meat and poultry -- and people in the tap-water camp do not miss a chance to talk about possible risks. "There's nothing magic about putting water in a bottle," says Richard Karlin, deputy executive director of the American Water Works Assocation Research Foundation. "The source may be great, but you don't know that they kept everything clean."
The many public-water people I spoke with reminded me that in the United States, tap water overall is remarkably safe. Still, recent surveys by the General Accounting Office have found monitoring and enforcement of water safety to be lax and negligent. Big cities, including New York, have found ways to get around E.P.A. rules -- particularly with regard to the filtration of water, which is prohibitively expensive but the most common way to eliminate cryptosporidium, Giardia, and other viral and bacterial pathogens not susceptible to chlorine. Another advantage of filtration is that less chlorine can be used, meaning less swimming-pool flavor in tap water. The E.P.A. is well aware that people are turning to bottled water not only because they're scared of their tap water but because they dislike its taste.
As for home-filtration systems, municipal-water officials stress that no one should buy one before sending a sample of tap water to a laboratory (NSF International, at 1-800-NSF-MARK, runs two testing labs, and its Web site gives addresses). Test results show the presence of any potentially hazardous chemicals or excess minerals, and suggest whether you should buy a special filter; most filters screen out chlorine, lead and other minerals. Micron-sized and other expensive filters eliminate pathogens but require careful and frequent maintenance. The only good effect that carbon filters have on taste is to eliminate chlorine, which doesn't require a filter, anyway -- most of the chlorine will evaporate if you leave a pitcher of water exposed to air for a few hours; the effect will be the same even for a water bottle left in the refrigerator (open or capped, with some headroom). Reverse-osmosis filters, pushed by fear-mongering door-to-door salesmen, remove most of the minerals in water, rendering it perfectly tasteless.
Tasteless water might reassure worried American consumers, who don'twant any flavor in water. Europeans are different. They want to know just where their water comes from, not only to be sure it is safe but so they'll know how it will taste and what it will do for their health.
 
What's in the Water in Europe?
Italy and France are the world's leading exporters of bottled water. Yet in those countries, water is bottled in an untreated state shocking to Americans who assume that no water is safe without some form of disinfection. The assumption is logical, given that three-quarters of all American tap water has historically been "surface water" from lakes, rivers and streams, which is subject to bacterial, viral and parasitic contamination. "Ground water" from protected underground sources does not come into contact with animals or people, and remains free of pathogens as long as it travels in clean conduits. All Italian and French bottled water, and most municipal water too, comes from underground sources; "cryptosporidium" has not entered the public vocabulary.
"Luckily, we have quite an efficient natural filter," Donatella Cursi, a chemist who is in charge of quality control for Panna water, pointed out when I visited that company's source and factory, in the hills of northern Tuscany. She meant the layers of rock, gravel and geological sand through which rainwater and melted snow pass, shedding chemical and microbial impurities and acquiring the traces of minerals that give water its flavor and character -- its "fingerprint." Panna, Evian and other bottlers brag about the number of years it takes for their source to "recharge," as if the longer the water spent traveling through rock and sand, the cleaner it would be. In fact, one or two years of underground travel cleanses water unless manmade pollutants have seeped into the aquifer.
The European Community requires mineral water to be free of specified chemical and microbiological impurities; it must be bottled at the source, and it cannot be filtered or treated in any way. The F.D.A. also has a standard for mineral water, but it hardly matters -- I could find no American bottler that markets mineral water, even if its product fits the F.D.A. definition.
What appeals to Americans is "spring" water, a word that sounds fresh and pure. Spring water, according to the F.D.A., must originate underground and flow naturally to the surface. This reveals nothing about its fingerprint and little about its purity -- a striking deficiency of most of the F.D.A.'s categories of bottled water, which refer chiefly to how the water is taken out of the ground. Spring water is in any case almost always pumped out from a bore hole, a practice the F.D.A. allows; this insures a steady flow of water not subject to microbial contamination, as a spring-fed stream or lake is. "Spring" water is largely interchangeable with "artesian" and "well" water, two other terms defined by the F.D.A. that sometimes appear on labels as if they mean something special -- something besides the mundane fact that the water came out of the ground.
Like Evian and most European mineral waters, Panna qualifies as a spring water, because the water really does comes out of a rock. Trying to catch it in the act, though, could get you arrested. Water-collection areas are located behind locked metal doors, off limits to all but a few workers. During my visit to Panna, I kept asking if I could get behind one of those doors. My guide would quickly hustle me away to the nearly sterile room where the water is squirted into bottles on a big carousel, or bring me up to the microbiology lab to tell me how many times an hour the water is checked. .
The constant lab checks are not for show, however. European mineral-water bottlers work without safety nets -- without any of the filters and disinfectants used by the American water industry. European bottlers check their water dozens or hundreds of times a day for the presence of harmful bacteria or other pathogens, and must send daily samples to outside laboratories to confirm the results. A technician at the bottling plant for Uliveto, an Italian mineral water, told me that a full 15 percent of Uliveto's comparatively high price is for these lab tests.
At each European factory, I was told that production lines were halted at the hint of a problem, and entire lots of water might be discarded. "Does that mean you find contaminated samples?" I asked. My question usually met awkward silence. Clearly, accidents happen: Workers using cleaning products sometimes come into contact with the water; simply touching a piece of bottling equipment over which water flows could create a large problem. I elicited no tales, though. No one wants another public-relations crisis like the one Perrier went through in 1990, when traces of benzene entered the water, due to a filter failure, forcing the company to recall 160 million bottles.
American bottlers perform their own safety checks, but the need is less urgent. Their trade organization's code requires them to filter and then disinfect water by ozonation, which kills microbes including cryptosporidium, and ultraviolet light, which is effective against molds and certain viruses. These treatments retain most minerals and do not add flavor, as chlorine does. But they are unnecessary for scrupulously handled ground water -- and they render water inert.
In Europe, mineral water is a living thing. People care about its freshness, and store it in a cool place away from light (given enough time and light, unsightly but generally harmless microalgae can grow in untreated water). In Italy and France, access to living water is guaranteed. Italian companies lease the right to bottle water from the state, which requires them to provide taps where anyone may fill bottles; France requires the same thing for bottlers of water it has declared "of public interest." The Source Cachat mentioned on every Evian label is a public fountain -- a modest and pretty affair in the center of town where people flock with empty bottles, some already bearing the Evian label. In Sangemini, a town north of Rome known for its sweet-tasting, high-mineral water, a version of the afternoon passeggiata is the trip to the plant to fill as many bottles as possible. Between five and seven in the evening, the line in front of the taps is three deep.
 
Is All This Water Good for Us?
If a water bottle has become part of America's security system, in Europe it is part of the medicine cabinet. Pharmacies still stock bottles of special mineral waters behind the counter. In one of the wonderful old pharmacies lined with wood-and-glass cabinets that seem a part of every Italian village, a pharmacist recited from memory a list of waters and their properties. I asked how she could remember all that information, and she replied indignantly, "I had to take an exam in water to get my degree."
Before a water in Italy or France may be called mineral, the bottler must prove its health-promoting qualities with medical studies conducted by universities or laboratories. While some mineral waters are thought to improve circulation or treat liver maladies, the most common health claim is for kidney disease -- historically the chief reason to drink mineral waters. Pope Boniface VIII and Michelangelo both swore by the ability of Fiuggi, a low-mineral (and very pleasant-tasting) water in the volcanic area southeast of Rome, to relieve kidney stones.
Any health claims on European labels appear in only-if-you-believe-this terms. The F.D.A. forbids any such claims on labels in the United States. Medical education in this country turned its back on both natural and homeopathic medicine a hundred years ago, in favor of the scientific method. Americans may be turning back to natural medicine in large numbers, but American doctors are not sending kidney-stone patients to spas courtesy of the local H.M.O. Dr. Gary Curhan, a kidney specialist in Boston, told me that he knows of no evidence that one water can encourage the elimination of kidney stones more than another. As for the long scientific bibliographies that mineral-water bottlers offer -- not to mention endorsements from popes and Michelangelo -- Curhan said evenly, "The placebo effect is very strong."
 
Why Does Some Water Taste So Good?
This might be the unanswerable question. Evian has a milky sweetness and a heaviness on the tongue, or "mouth feel," that I find essential; Panna, Vittel and a new South Seas water, Fiji, have that sweetness too. The water experts in Europe I asked about mouth feel replied with, at best, baffled generalities about the subjectivity of taste. "Attention! " Dr. Pascale Monnerot, the communications director at Evian, cried when I asked her why Evian tastes milky. "I do not like milk."
A label will be of little guidance, even a European label, which looks something like the periodic table, with milligram counts of many mysterious minerals appearing in tiny type. A water high in mineral salts does not necessarily mean that it will taste salty: only sodium chloride, table salt, tastes truly salty. Mineral salts do help retain carbon dioxide, however. They bind with it and make a water that has smaller bubbles, is less acid to the taste and is easier to digest. This is why San Pellegrino, a water relatively high in minerals that doesn't taste very good flat (it is carbonated at the bottling plant), has finer bubbles and is less gassy than most soda water.
I did narrow down the components of good water. A relatively high proportion of bicarbonates, calcium and magnesium seem to account for the rainwater roundness I love -- the quality that made a 78-year-old Roman grandmother I presented with a sample of the day's bottling at Panna tell me she hadn't tasted water like that since the rain barrels of her youth. Calcium and magnesium are the minerals that make water "hard"; they may be bad for scaly buildup in laundry and coffee machines, but they're good for flavor and mouth feel.
No law prevents American bottlers from copying the list of minerals listed on a bottle of European water, but few of them bother to try. Arthur von Wiesenberger, the author of several books and a pamphlet called "The Taste of Water," written as a guide to conduct tastings, did tell me that one large California bottler purifies tap water and then adds a generous amount of bicarbonates, calcium, and magnesium to give it a pleasing flavor -- true designer water.
Still, no one who has worked with mineral waters thinks that a particular water can be duplicated in a test tube. One European technician plausibly suggested that the key missing element might be each water's naturally occuring microflora, which can't be ordered from a catalogue. Donatella Cursi, at Panna, said that for years she and her colleagues have tried to analyze the flavor of Panna water, without success. "I say that with displeasure, because I'm a chemist," she told me. "But that's the charm and fascination of acqua viva. I've resigned myself to the singularity of life."
 
Will People Buy Anything Clear in a Bottle?
Apparently. Most American consumers seem unconcerned with taste, let alone whether water is alive or dead. All they want to know is that their water is safe, portable and wet. Combine this attitude with the F.D.A.'s confusing standards of identity for bottled water, and you might well come up with Aquafina.
"Purity Guaranteed" and "purified drinking water" appear prominently on Aquafina's blue label, which shows an abstract design suggesting a mountain sunrise; the copy boasts of "crisp, refreshing taste" and "our state of the art reverse osmosis purification system." On the bottle that I bought Boston, tiny lettering on the cap said "bottled at the source" but named neither the bottler nor the source. It did, though, give an 800 number.
When I dialed the number, I reached Pepsi-Cola. I thought it was a wrong number, but I checked the very tiny print again. Recorded menu options offered information only about Pepsi-Cola soft drinks and instructed callers with other questions to try back during business hours.
The next afternoon, a customer-service representative told me that Pepsi indeed bottles and distributes Aquafina. The "source," she said, is either a municipal-water system or a well, but she did not know which of the two my bottle came from. I would have to call my local bottler to find out, and to ask some of my questions about how the water was processed; but, she added, these details "might be considered confidential." After asking my zip code, she gave me the number of a bottler in a nearby state. The jovial man who answered said he had no idea where the water in my bottle came from. He suggested that I call the 800 number.
Reverse osmosis, the process of which the Aquafina label boasts, removes not only potential contaminants but most of the minerals. It rubs away the water's fingerprint. Think of the dead, flat flavor of distilled water, which like "deionized" or "purified" water (both terms defined by the F.D.A.) has also had its minerals removed, although distilled water is boiled and Aquafina is not. I asked Larry Jabbonski, a Pepsi spokesman to whom the woman at the 800 number referred me when I called back, whether the company added back minerals for flavor. This was a new idea to him. "We're talking about almost an absence of taste," he said several times during our conversation, as if that were an asset. He could not say offhand how much Aquafina comes from municipal sources and how much from wells. Instead, he emphasized the expensive filters and treatments Pepsi uses to purify the water.
This is one way that soft-drink companies can justify asking consumers to pay more for a bottle of tap water than they do for a bottle of soda, which also usually starts with tap water but, after all, has some syrup. sentence TKTK here re profit margin on bottled water, preferably compared to soda. Another extra expense of bottled water is source protection -- that is, if the source is not a municipal tap.
Then Jabbonski turned the tables. "Do you agree that all water is natural?" he asked. "That's pivotal."
Interesting question. Is denatured water "natural?" Little wonder that despite years of pressure from food growers and other packagers who want to call their products "natural," the F.D.A. has refused to provide a restrictive definition.
In fact, a good deal of the bottled water sold in this country is nothing more than treated tap water, most of it packaged as "drinking water" in those translucent milk jugs or the five-gallon bottles that sit on top of office or home coolers. The F.D.A. has also dodged defining "drinking water," saying that for practical purposes it means the same thing as "bottled water." A bottler can easily avoid stating that the source is municipal. (As it turned out, 9 of Aquafina's 11 sources are municipal sources.) All a company has to do is treat water so that it fits an F.D.A. standard of identity like "reverse osmosis" of "deionized." Strip the water of all its identifying characteristics, in other words, and there's no point in saying where it came from. In Aquafina's case, the use of reverse osmosis allows Pepsi-Cola to call the water "purified."
As for the whitish squiggle on Aquafina's label suggesting a mountain, the preamble to the F.D.A.'s 1995 ruling on bottled-water categories states, "F.D.A. agrees that the use of certain graphics on a label of bottled water may be misleading to consumers if the source of the water is different than the source depicted or implied." Every Aquafina bottle sold across the land shows the same graphic, whether the source is a well or a municipal reservoir.
Even more deceptive, in my opinion although not in the F.D.A.'s, is the freedom to market the water of several springs under the same brand name, as long as each water meets the F.D.A. definition of spring water. To someone who looks to water to provide a sense of place and a unique fingerprint, this is scandalous -- like the Tuscans who after the 1983 olive freeze sold Tunisian and Spanish olive oils in bottles with their own fancy labels. It was extra-virgin olive oil and it was bottled in high-rent Tuscany, and that was all the European Community needed to know.
Recently, I was startled by how much I liked a bottle of Crystal Geyser, a water I bought in Boston that is put out by a California company. It compared favorably with Vittel, the French water I prize -- soft and rich in the mouth, with a gentle sweet aftertaste. This clashed with my memory of drinking Crystal Geyser in its home state, where I found it harsh and overly mineralized. A call to the company revealed why: The protected Blue Ridge Mountain source described at admirable length on my Boston bottle is marketed only on the East Coast. (The California bottle had come from tktktktktktk.)
Shipping costs are the main obstacle to a company that wants to establish a national brand of water. This obstacle has worked in favor of small local bottlers and thus in favor of preserving the kind of regionalism that food conglomerates have all but destroyed. But big companies are now moving to take over water as well: Already the Perrier Group, Poland Spring's parent, is selling water from several springs under its Ice Mountain label. Naya, a spring water distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises, comes from two different Canadian springs. (Don't look for "Coca-Cola" on the label, though, just as you won't find "Pepsi-Cola" on Aquafina.) The Danone Group, parent company of Evian, Badoit and other premium-priced waters, has launched a mid-priced spring water under its best-known brand name, Dannon; the water comes from one of two springs.
I find this freedom of trade depressing. It makes me wonder if I will ever find a Great Sip here, or whether I'll be able to find out where it came from if I do. But I'll always have Panna.
 
Can One Drink Change Your Life?
I did not find greatness in my own backyard, although I hoped I would. After my Swissair discovery, I visited Roger Moser, the 53-year-old former farmer who directs the Country Pure plant, down the road from my father's house. After ascertaining that I was Dr. Kummer's son, he asked affably, "So what is it you call yourself? A . . .journalist?" Moser showed me the modest bottling line where my airplane cup was filled, and the bore hole beside the familiar barn. The spring water, he explained, was probably similar to the tap water of my childhood, which came from a spring-fed reservoir up the hill, although of course Glacier Valley water was micron-filtered and ozonated. (Moser couldn't remember who came up with the name, but he did remember that everyone thought it sounded nice.) I tried the water again. It tasted like home.
But home isn't good enough anymore, now that I have been to the source of a water I love. I had always assumed that this was was named for its mouth-filling quality and rich texture: panna means "cream" in Italian. But Panna is the name of a real place, a gorgeous and -- given its location, an hour's drive from Florence -- amazingly unspoiled place in the rolling green hills of Mugello, in northern Tuscany. Since 1564, the area has been protected from all development, first as a Medici hunting reserve and now as a 3,000-square acre property under the watchfulness of the San Pellegrino group.
I spent hours begging Marco Aiazzi, the lifelong water man who directs the plant, to let me see the water come out of the rock. Finally, Aiazzi tracked down his colleague and Vasco Giuliani, a rugged man who oversees the property, on Giuliani's cell phone (Italians talk even from room to room on cell phones). We piled into an old Land Rover and traveled up several rutted, unpaved roads through dense woods.
At last, we reached a low iron gate, chained shut, as if to a secret garden. Giuliani unlocked it, and we walked a ways up a dirt path to a green metal door set into the hillside. Aiazzi switched on a light. The floor and three walls were concrete, but the far wall was living rock, and in the middle of it I saw a thick glass panel surrounded by bolts. It was fogged and covered with beads of water. Behind the panel, I could make out several holes in the porous, craggy rock, where water was dripping into small concrete tubs, the "catchment pools." Peering through the dark, wet glass, I felt I was viewing the holy of holies.
I hadn't yet penetrated it, though. The next stop was a short way downhill in the Land Rover, following the path of the underground pipe that led from the catchment pools to another locked chamber, this one holding four small cylindrical stainless-steel tanks where water is held before traveling by gravity to the plant. Four taps ran continuously at chest level beside each tank. "Who has a glass?" I asked when the men unlocked the brightly lit chamber. Here was, after all, why I had got on a plane (this one Alitalia, and the water was San Pellegrino) in the first place: to taste water at the source. The two men looked at each other and said nothing. Barely waiting for their assent, I cupped my hands under one of the streams and started drinking. Once I began, I had no desire to stop. The water was of an almost mythical sweet softness.
Later, at the factory, Donatella Cursi, the lab director, lost her smiling composure when I described my long draught. "Of course there are no glasses," she said briskly. "We don't want anyone drinking. Even I've never let myself taste that water. Those taps are for the state inspectors, and us, to test the water at the source -- that's as close as anyone gets."
I did not regret my audacity. I had tasted nirvana. Now that I know it exists, I intend to find it again, this time closer to home -- even if not quite as close as down the hill from where I grew up.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
The Finger Lakes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO; JOSEPH SIANO is an assistant to the editor of the Travel section.

 BODY:
Tribes of the Iroquois Nation believe that the Finger Lakes were formed when the Creator's hands raked across the landscape. Geologists say that eons ago, glaciers lumbered past a slab of wet cement we now call central New York State and couldn't resist. In any case, nature provided 11 fingers, perhaps because it would take more than two hands to count all the region's charms.
The supply of wineries to visit, inns to settle down in and historic Main Streets to stroll in the Finger Lakes seems inexhaustible -- especially in the fall foliage season. So an autumn tour of the region requires some choices. One suggestion: stick to the biggest lakes, Seneca and Cayuga, which are in the middle and are each about 35 miles long. Views from either side of these, with little sightseeing boats passing between sharply rising hillsides, conjure up a miniature Lake Geneva (or, in the case of 632-foot-deep Seneca, Loch Ness). 
 Along 19th-century streets in towns like Geneva, Corning, Hammondsport and Skaneateles, old brick storefronts have lost some of their right angles. But they wear their years with dignity and an honesty typical of a region where farm stands work on the honor system.
Foliage season is usually mid-September to mid-October. For updates, call Finger Lakes National Forest at (607) 546-4470. The region is about six hours from New York City via the Thruway to Exit 16, and Route 17.
 
Events
 Through Nov. 1, "Warp and Weft," Navajo weaving from the 1870's to the 1970's, will be at the Rockwell Museum, 111 Cedar Street, Corning. The 1893 red-brick Romanesque Revival building has a large permanent collection of Western art, including Remington and Bierstadt, and more than 2,000 pieces of art glass by Frederick Carder, a founder of Steuben Glass. Open Monday to Saturday 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $5, seniors $4.50, ages 6 to 17 $2.50; (607) 937-5386.
The first sports-car race through Watkins Glen was 50 years ago. On Sept. 11 to 13, historic cars will race again at the Zippo U.S. Vintage Grand Prix at Watkins Glen International Raceway. Admission: $25 on Sept. 13, $30 for the weekend. Take Route 414 south from the village and turn right at the light; (607) 535-2481.
Samuel Langhorne Clemens spent summers in Elmira and is buried there in Woodlawn Cemetery. What would Mark Twain have thought about a popular Elmira activity: flying without a motor? The surrounding flat lands are blessed with thermals ideal for gliders. Sept. 19 is Community Soaring Day and Kite-Citement at the Harris Hill Gliderport, off Route 17. Glider rides are $30 (free for disabled children), or learn kite-making; (607) 734-3128.
This one is a real no-brainer: the Great Canandaigua Scarecrow Contest. About 75 locally made straw persons compete to see which can scare the most birds off Main Street in Canandaigua, from Sept. 26 through Oct. 10. Free; (716) 396-0300.
The Buckwheat Harvest Festival, at the Yates County Fairgrounds in Penn Yan, will feature rides, food and fireworks Sept. 25 to 27. Hours: 4 to 11 P.M. Sept. 25, 10 A.M. to 11 P.M. on Sept. 26 (when Billy Ray Cyrus sings) and 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Sept. 27. Admission: $6; (800) 868-9283.
 
Sightseeing
 The sun-washed hillsides of the Finger Lakes were discovered by winemakers in the mid-1800's. Now, there are dozens of vintners along the major lakes, which provide a tempering effect on the cold climate. Whites and sparkling wines are the region's forte. Route 14 on Seneca's western shore is lined with wineries, but off the main road, Castel Grisch on Route 28 above Watkins Glen, offers a less-trafficked view of the lake amid Rhineland trappings. Open daily 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; (607) 535-9614.
On Seneca's east shore, Wagner Winery, Route 414 in Lodi, has beer tastings, too. Open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily, (607) 582-6450.
For wine-tour maps, contact the Seneca Lake Winery Association, (315) 536-9996; the Cayuga Wine Trail, (800) 684-5217, or the Keuka Lake Wine Route, (800) 440-4898.
The views of the cascades in Watkins Glen State Park are literally breathtaking, if you start the 1.5-mile trail from the bottom, on Franklin Street in Watkins Glen. As you ascend the 832 steps to the top of the 650-foot glen, you pass along, over and under 18 waterfalls (runoff from the rocky walls can leave the trail slick). Park on village streets and walk in free. A shuttle ($2.50) lets you start at the top; (607) 535-4511.
Less splashy are the falls in Fillmore Glen State Park -- named after a not-so-splashy President, Millard Fillmore. A reproduction of the tiny rudimentary cabin in which he was born in 1800, five miles away, is off the parking lot ($4 a car). The 1.8-mile trail through the surrounding woods should afford some great leaf watching. Open dawn to dusk on Route 38 in Moravia; (315) 497-0130
Among the floating excursions for leaf fanciers are Captain Bill's Seneca Lake Cruises, aboard the Stroller IV, a jaunty boat from the 1930's decked out in Philippine mahogany. In foliage season, 50-minute tours depart every other hour starting at 11 A.M. Fare: $7.50, ages 2 to 12, $3.50. Boats leave from the foot of Franklin Street in Watkins Glen; (607) 535-4541.
The modest-sized Sciencenter, 601 First Street, just off Route 13 north of Ithaca, is full of hands-on displays that will teach and entertain young children. Your little Indiana Jones can dig for real fossils. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday noon to 5. Admission: $4.50, ages 4 to 12 $3.50; (607) 272-0600.
Don't let memories of all those duplicate housewarming gifts keep you from the Corning Museum of Glass and Glass Center, 151 Centerway, Corning, (607) 974-8271. A head of Amenhotep II of Egypt, made between 1436 and 1411 B.C., is the earliest known glass portrait, and a cut-glass table from 1878 weighs more than half a ton. There's not a casserole in sight until you reach the gift shop. Open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $6, seniors $5, ages 6 to 17 $4.
The Farm Sanctuary, eight miles west of Watkins Glen, off Route 23, is a 175-acre refuge for abused livestock. It's filled with cows, chickens and pigs. Admission is free; guided tours on weekends in September and October cost $2, ages 4 to 12, $1; (607) 583-2225.
 
Where to Stay
 The Radisson, 125 Denison Parkway East, Corning, (607) 962-5000, fax (607) 962-4166, looks like a concrete bunker plopped at the foot of graceful Market Street. But the 177-room hotel, with an indoor pool, is a stroll from the Corning and Rockwell museums. Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, with about half redone last winter in dark-green tones. Rates from $139.
True to its name, the Ramada Geneva Lakefront, 41 Lakefront Drive, Geneva, (800) 990-0907, fax (315) 789-4351, is on the northern tip of Seneca Lake. Its 148 rooms are most notable for the views (91 face the water). There's an indoor pool. Rates: $109 to $139 till Oct. 1, $89 to $109 after.
Budget: For a traditional roadside motor lodge, try the Longhouse Lodge Motel, Route 14 at Abrams Road, Watkins Glen, telephone and fax (607) 535-2565. The 25 rooms were redone last summer, and 21 have rockers outside the doors to enjoy the hillside Seneca Lake view, while 4 are higher up the hill in a separate house. A VCR, with movies, rents for $5. Rates: $68 to $88, with Continental breakfast.
Similar is the Best Western Marshall Manor, Route 14, Horseheads, telephone and fax (607) 739-3891, conveniently situated between Seneca Lake and Elmira. Families can make fast getaways in the morning since the 40 clean, simple rooms have sinks inside and outside the bathrooms. Rates: $63 to Oct. 10, $52 after, with Continental breakfast.
Luxury: Geneva on the Lake, 1001 Lochland Road (Route 14), Geneva, (800) 343-6382, fax (315) 789-0322, is modeled after an Italian Renaissance villa, with 26 rooms and 4 more in a contemporary town house. A parterre garden leads to the lakeside pool. The Library Suite, decorated with Stickley furniture, has a coffered ceiling and fireplace, and the shelves lining the walls contain books from the collection of the estate's original owners. Rates: $133 to $525, with Continental breakfast, bottle of wine and fruit basket.
A soft-pink wedding cake of a house built in 1851 is now the Rose Inn, 813 Auburn Road (Route 34), Ithaca; (607) 533-7905, fax (607) 533-7908. A spiral staircase of Honduran mahogany coils majestically up to a cupola. Among the main house's 15 rooms, decorated with period furniture, are four suites with whirlpool baths. The grounds include a pretty little formal garden. Rates: $100 to $275, with full breakfast.
 
Where to Eat
 Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar Street, in Hammondsport, at the southern end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas -- all $4 to $4.95. If there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a giant cappuccino ($3.25). Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music Saturday nights (open 7:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. other days). A meal for two with drinks: $20; (607) 569-2009.
Framboise, 9 East Genesee Street, is an airy storefront with tall windows looking out onto the center of Skaneateles, southwest of Syracuse. Dried and fresh flower arrangements adorn the tables in the two dining areas. Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a pile of steamed julienned vegetables; cioppino, a fish stew made with tomatoes; or chicken Maasdam -- a breast stuffed with asparagus, roasted peppers and cream cheese and wrapped in puff pastry -- are among the entrees. Three-course dinner for two with wine: about $65; (315) 685-7196.
Tables in the pub-like London Underground, 69 East Market Street, Corning, are amply spaced. Get past the endless menu descriptions -- "local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia onion compote," for example, followed by "basil-infused chicken breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed peppers" -- and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee Street, Skaneateles, has a formal dining room and a tavern; in the latter, the Fruit Fantasia ($8.95) is a generous pile of fresh fruit, chicken or tuna salad, date-nut bread and sherbet; in the dining room, the accent is on standards like steak and prime rib, with dinner for two with wine about $90; (315) 685-3405.
While dining in the rear sun room of the Thendara Inn and Restaurant, 4356 East Lake Road (Route 364), Canandaigua, we saw one couple wed beside the lake, while a few tables away, another toasted their 50th anniversary. Among the appetizers is brie en croute with portobello mushrooms; for main courses, there's herb-encrusted swordfish with ginger lemongrass sauce or marinated grilled chicken breast with gazpacho salsa. Addlepated service was a discordant note. Dinner for two with wine: $90 to $100. Closed Monday and Tuesday after Oct.1. Reservations recommended; (716) 394-4868.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
As Canadian Dollar Declines, U.S. Visits Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia

 BODY:
A DOLLAR is a dollar, except perhaps these days in Canada, where one American dollar is now worth about one and a half Canadian dollars, giving Americans a big boost as soon as they cross the border.
And they are making the trip north in record numbers so far this year, according to Canadian tourism officials. American visitors are up 11 percent here in Vancouver, just slightly ahead of the 9.7 percent increase nationwide. 
 Curiously though, the disparity in the value of the American and Canadian dollars -- a wider gap than ever before -- is something that not all Americans are aware of.
"I'm amazed," said Patrick Fairchild, a school janitor from Victor, N.Y., who traveled to Toronto with his family recently to take in "Les Miserables" and see the sights.
Like many other American visitors, Mr. Fairchild said he had not even thought about the exchange rate before crossing the border. His good fortune only hit him when he took $35 to a currency exchange and got $47 in Canadian dollars; he could have done better at another money exchange, but he was happy.
"I'm going to hit Niagara Falls on my way back," Mr. Fairchild said.
Tourism officials say that because of the similarities between the United States and Canada, and because Canada's currency is called a dollar, tourists from the United States tend to assume that the money is interchangeable. John C. Olsthoorn, of the Canadian Tourism Commission, said that is especially so for Americans who do not live near the northern border and are not familiar with Canadian money.
"We are trying to raise awareness a bit, but not highlight it in flashing lights because the dollar will change the other way at some point," Mr. Olsthoorn said.
Part of the perception problem is that the decline in the Canadian dollar -- called a loonie because the $1 coin bears the image of a common loon -- has not been sudden. Rather, the loonie has been in a long, gradual slide since 1976, the last time one Canadian dollar was worth the same as one American dollar.
However, it was only this spring that the loonie broke through its historic low against the dollar. That has been followed by numerous further declines, which have generated a fair amount of news coverage and suddenly made Americans aware of the fact that their dollars can go much further north of the border.
A loonie is now worth just over 65 cents. Canada no longer uses paper $1 or $2 bills; a $2 coin is commonly called a toonie.
Although it's too early for statistics showing precisely how Americans in Canada are spending their windfall, Canadian tourism officials say that many appear to travel to more-remote locations or to upgrade accommodations.
"Those individuals who would have stayed at a middle-range establishment are now booking rooms in the upper end of what's available in places like Vancouver, Victoria and Whistler," said Roderick J. Harris, president of Tourism B.C., the provincial tourism office for British Columbia.
For American travelers, the decline of the loonie has provided a more transparent advantage than the currency troubles of some other countries. For example, in Mexico, where the peso was devalued precipitously in late 1994 and early 1995, resorts in Cancun and other places priced hotel rooms in dollar equivalents, as did Mexican airlines. That wiped out most of the potential advantage from the peso's decline.
Not so in Canada, tourism officials say. Mr. Harris said hotel rates have been flat or just slightly higher, in part because the Asian economic crisis has hurt many Pacific Coast resorts and forced them to keep rates competitive.
In addition, the declining loonie has not been accompanied by any noticeable jump in inflation in Canada, which makes shopping attractive, at least until Canada's high national and provincial sales taxes are added. Americans are eligible for tax refunds if they save original receipts and fill out official forms. The process is not painless, but the forms are widely available.
Mr. Harris recommends that American travelers change their money into Canadian dollars before leaving home. He does not take into account the exchange rate, but rather is focusing on a way for Americans to be able to appreciate just how much more they have available to spend during their time away.
For those who prefer to change dollars in Canada, there are plenty of options. Rates at money exchanges, banks and the front desks of larger hotels tend to be fairly consistent, the only difference often being whether a commission is charged.
Canadian Pacific's Hotel Vancouver will change up to $1,000 a day for its guests without a commission, said Oliver Muschamp, a guest-service agent at the hotel. He recommends that guests change as much as they want on arrival, and then apply whatever is unspent at the end of the stay to the hotel bill.

HEADLINE: Gershwin Is Still Cause for Rhapsody;
An Inspired Borrower Of a Black Tradition

BYLINE: By STANLEY CROUCH; Stanley Crouch is an author, a critic and a columnist for The Daily News.

 BODY:
GEORGE GERSHWIN had a gargantuan impact on what the writer Albert Murray calls "the American soundtrack." But his music and the good life that it provided for its composer were inextricably connected to the racial terrain of show business. The finer esthetic elements of his music came into existence as a result of an interracial training ground that transcended all the balderdash of the national skin game. But the troubling ethnic components of show business aren't usually discussed, particularly when a man of Gershwin's Jewish background is the subject, for fear, in that case, of being seen as anti-Semitic. My intent is to provide an overview of Gershwin more substantial than the skeleton of the great marlin that Hemingway's fishermen returned home with in "The Old Man and the Sea."
Those who praise Gershwin see him as a number of things: a composer whose work epitomized the Golden Era of popular songwriting, a true example of the rags-to-riches story, a genius from the streets who pulled telling strands of American sound together and whose innovations earned him a position in the pantheon. 
 All of that is absolutely true. Gershwin was great. He did have a snap. He was a first-class popular melodist. His sound, part Negro and part everything else that was going on when he came to power, is one of the most important distillations of lyric and rhythmic American feeling to arrive in the first half of the 20th century. He was one of the musical poets of modern life. We cannot accurately think of urban American existence with any accuracy and leave him out.
His impact has been rightfully epic. We'll never know how many people have sung his songs professionally and unprofessionally, in public and in private, how many have danced to them in every circumstance from the grand ballroom to the sweaty house party. Those numbers are incalculable, just as are all the images that are summoned when one hears Gershwin music. Anyone whose music was used in so many films and as a catalyst for so many great dance numbers lives on that mythic side of our comprehension. He strides through and beyond his time like a colossus of urban moxie and celebration, of romantic sentiment, of U.S.A. syncopation. The brother had soul.
In fact, when Gershwin began contemplating the creation of an opera based in the nation's cultural vernacular, he expressed ambitions that were far greater than American literary innovators like T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, as well as all of the great filmmakers of his country and his time. Gershwin aspired to create an expansive feeling of Americana. He told Isaac Goldberg of The New York World that he wanted to write an opera that bubbled up from "the melting pot of New York City, which is the symbolic and the actual blend of the native and immigrant strains."
"This would allow for many kinds of music, black and white, Eastern and Western, and would call for a style that would achieve artistic and esthetic unity."
In that sense, what Gershwin discussed -- and what might have arrived in musical composition had he lived and been able to come back to that idea again -- is instructive because it would have been far more adventurous than almost all the celebrated American fiction of his time other than that of William Faulkner, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. Unlike American writers, however, Gershwin was neither afraid of Negroes nor intimidated by the subjects of style and feeling that they presented in their ethnic version of American life. He spent his time up in Harlem, where he could hear jazz and listen to the masters of stride piano. He realized, as did most of the songwriters of his time, that Negroes had put something together that could supply fresh melodic, harmonic and rhythmic directions through the literal and implied elements of blues, idiomatic syncopation and swing. As early as 1922, Gershwin wrote "Blue Monday," an opera about the Harlem that was on his mind. It was orchestrated by Will Vodery, a prominent Negro musician of the time who worked as an orchestrator for Ziegfeld's follies and was an accomplished conductor.
Gershwin's time uptown had put him in the same situation as the developing black musicians who were there: he was learning from the best people he could get next to, since all artists learn from others. In particular, however, the exchanges or the homemade academies of jam sessions and rent parties and private lessons from men like James P. Johnson resulted in an extraordinary irony: with the exception of Duke Ellington, Gershwin went on to become a finer songwriter than any of the Negroes who were his contemporaries or who influenced him.
That is where we get the rub and where the attacks on Gershwin for "stealing" from Negroes falls flat on its lewdy duty. Given his talent, why is Gershwin also paddled so often for being something less than he actually was? Primarily because Gershwin was Jewish, and there is an extremely complicated history fundamental to the tale of Negroes and Jews in show business. It is a story of alliance, animosity, success, failure, exploitation transcending friendships and ongoing shifts of attitude and economic position. Show business was an open frontier for Jewish immigrants who -- often battling one another every step of the way -- rose to higher and higher positions as entrepreneurs, performers, agents, critics and so on. Where Indians complain of their land being stolen by Northern Europeans, Negroes have made similar complaints in cultural terms. Those complaints steam up from the fact that Jewish journeymen, in and out of blackface, were able to make use of Negro culture while benefiting from a support system capable of neutralizing the religious status of a minority in favor of its acceptably white skin. Jewish or not, white skin or not, George Gershwin was nobody's journeyman.
To go a little deeper, there is another irony when the subject of "stealing" comes around to Gershwin. That irony is found in the work of all the jazz musicians who have used his songs as jumping off points for classic improvisations, either on his themes or on the chord sequences he devised. The uncopyrightable chords of "I Got Rhythm," by the way, have been used by so many jazz musicians that we have no idea how much larger the Gershwin fortune would be if his estate could lay claim to every use of that harmonic material. So one could argue that black musicians have done much more profitable, literal stealing from Gershwin than he did from them, which, in his case, amounts to nothing more than inspired borrowing.
Finally, like all giants of American art, culture and entertainment, George Gershwin belongs to everyone and should be celebrated by all. His achievement goes far beyond race and far beyond the squabbles our nation's racial mess continues to guarantee. When they line up the work of those who spoke across the barriers of American life, you can believe George Gershwin will be highly placed in that number.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Lorna J. Wendt;
Marriage, and Divorce, as 50-50 Propositions

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
DIVORCE is usually a private matter. But when Gary and Lorna Wendt of North Stamford went through the process, the public got an earful.
The Wendts were high school sweethearts in Wisconsin who had a traditional marriage for more than 30 years, until, in 1995, Mr. Wendt, chairman of the GE Capital Corporation, sought a divorce. 
 In the subsequent proceedings, Ms. Wendt, a stay-at-home spouse, declared herself an equal partner, entitled to half the family's assets.
Although the Wendts' considerable assets put them in a narrow sliver of Americans economically, the issue of the financial worth of spouses who do not work outside the home affects many of America's divorcing couples. Ms. Wendt's claims also sent shivers through the corporate ranks, where the thought is that who made the money keeps most of it.
In the ensuing dispute, Ms. Wendt was pictured on the cover of Fortune Magazine under the headline, "What's a Corporate Wife Worth?" She has appeared on television and been widely interviewed, and she has established the Institute for Equality in Marriage in Stamford, a clearinghouse for information about divorce. On Sept. 23 she will speak at the Ridgefield Library.
"This is not just a divorce between two rich people," she says emphatically. It is about how wives, and sometimes husbands, are treated by their spouses and the courts.
She urges women to know their family finances thoroughly, as she said she did. "Knowledge is powerful," she explained. "Just look out for yourselves." Since about half of American marriages end in divorce, Ms. Wendt believes that preparation for independent living is essential. "I believe in marriage contracts," she says. "With that sad statistic in mind, we should go into marriage with our eyes open. Marriage may end in divorce. What's going to happen if that happens?"
Last December, the Wendt marriage was dissolved by Judge Kevin Tierney of Connecticut Superior Court. He awarded Ms. Wendt about $20 million in property and money as well as stock and pension options, out of total Wendt holdings estimated by Ms. Wendt at between $45 million and $130 million. Both sides are appealing the award.
Recently Ms. Wendt met to discuss her belief in marriage as a 50-50 partnership. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
 
Q. When your husband decided to divorce you, what were your financial expectations?
A. I assumed we would split everything 50-50. Our marriage was a partnership. If he wanted to dissolve the marriage I just assumed I would get 50 percent.
I was looking for an even distribution of assets accrued by both of us during our marriage such as stock options, restricted stock units and a supplemental pension. A lot of things have payoffs after the divorce but were earned during the marriage.
 
Q. Were you business partners?
A. I was his wife. I was in the business of creating a happy home. I was the mother of his children, the C.E.O. of our house, that was my business. I gave up my career. We decided together to have a family and it was our understanding that that is what I would do. I did those things extremely well. He went on to only do what he was very good at and that's what got him to where he is today.
 
Q. Were you tempted to just put it all behind you?
A. The first thing for me was shock that he wanted to end the marriage. Unlike many women, I did not let him put me down as a human being, devalue what I brought to our marriage. When he offered me 10 percent, that was a real personal affront. I am not a 10 percent person or a 20 percent. I gave a 100 percent or more to this partnership. If he wanted to dissolve it, I expect to be compensated for the years as a partner and that to me is 50-50.
Would anyone go into marriage today or advise anyone to go into marriage if somewhere down the line -- the courts or your spouse -- could say you're only worth 30 percent or 10 percent?
 
Q. Where is Connecticut in all this?
A. Connecticut is not a community property state. It is an equitable distribution state. Even though the root word is equal, it's up to a judge to decide how much the little lady should get. That's the "enough is enough" theory that is prevalent in the court system.
We all have different judges in family court. They all come in with preconceived ideas or notions. How was their family life? How is their life with their wife? All these things affect a human being. And what a person gets.
I would like to see that changed. We are challenging the courts on some things we thought were fairly gender-biased. One is the "enough is enough" rule. That's when a judge says -- here's a judge making maybe $125,000 a year -- "This lady has been offered $10 million. Isn't that enough?" That isn't the issue. I never said that wasn't enough. The issue is that we were partners. Who are you to decide I am a 10 percent person?
 
Q. Is that what inspired you to establish the Institute for Equality in Marriage?
A. I realized this was a bigger issue than just Gary and myself. This has become a national and international issue. It is because of the principle that when you marry you are equal, not unequal partners.
As a society, we can't have young women and men going into a marriage expecting it to be a partnership, working their whole lives side by side, then have to say "What I did at home was worth less than the person who brings home the paycheck." That's not right. How can you say that of the love that you have for a family, your children, all the things that have been consumed during a marriage, all the meals that were cooked, all the doctors' trips, all the excuses for why Dad is never home?
The institute's main mission is to educate society as to what we mean by marriage today. One of the things we are hoping to do is judicial education. That is not lobbying. That is bringing together learned scholars for the judges, for the lawyers and showing them what is going on around the state and around the United States and this is what the latest thinking is on family law.
 
Q. Are you an advocate of pre-nuptial agreements?
A. Since marriage is the biggest social contract that two people will ever make, I think they should talk about it, maybe have something in writing, a marriage contract, that doesn't say anything about money. I think it should say, "I value you as a human being, I respect you and what you will bring to our marriage. If we should go our separate ways it's been a 50-50 partnership." What if your partner balks at that? Shouldn't a red light go off? Beforehand?
I think that's being a little practical. I guess it's unfortunate the courts are not finding that marriage is a partnership, so maybe we had better have that understanding before we enter into marriage.
You can have postnuptial agreements, although it is a little harder. You could sit down with your husband and say, "Now let's have some things in writing." How do you think that would go over after 5 or 10 or 20 years of marriage? That's a little scary.
 
Q. When divorcing, is it unusual to receive less than half of the assets of a marriage?
A. Most high-asset divorce cases are settled, but they are not settled equally. Women are browbeaten and threatened verbally. So they settle for less than 50 percent. I was the one to say publicly, "Wait a minute, I gave my life to our family and to us willingly, lovingly and now you are saying that's no good."
The 30-year-olds don't understand what this is all about because to them marriage is a partnership. It is my generation that is the hardest hit because they have spent 35 years in a marriage, all of a sudden to find out he wants someone younger, or whatever, and thinks he can walk away and say, "Thank you, here's drivel." Women of divorce are the new poor class in the United States.
 
Q. What changes would you like to see in divorce laws?
A. What I would like to see happen 25 years down the road may never happen. I would like to see some uniform, basic divorce laws that affect everybody no matter what the income, across all 50 states. Every state is different. If I were to lobby now I would have to have 50 different lobbyists for 50 different states. All that has to be changed.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. Constance Ward Iervolino;
Task of Applying Standards to Classrooms

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
THE pressure is on for schools to have higher standards for all students -- pressure from the State Board of Regents, the business community and parents, among others. It will be the task of people like Dr. Constance Ward Iervolino, the new assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction for the White Plains public schools, to make sure that all the tough talk about higher standards is not just talk, not just the latest educational fad.
Dr. Iervolino, a resident of the Bronx with a doctorate in education, was an assistant principal in Ardsley from 1988-90 before becoming principal of two schools in the Rye Neck School District: the Daniel Warren School (kindergarten through first grade) and the F. E. Bellows School (grades two through four). 
 In her new job, which she assumed last month, she oversees the curriculum for kindergartners through 12th graders in White Plains, which, with 6,200 students, is one of the county's largest school districts. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with her:
 
Q. Will the directives on new standards coming from the state make a difference?
A. I think the standards now will really influence and shape classroom practice in every classroom. It will be aligned with curriculum, and it will be aligned with the assessment. For the very first time in New York State there is a parallel and a very close match between what the standard says in the curriculum and the assessment that is going to test the results. That was not always true.
Also, in each of the grade levels, from the elementary to the middle to the high school, if you look at any of the assessments that will now be used -- say the 4th-grade language arts test, the 8th-grade test and the 11th-grade Regents test -- they will use the same standards. That is very new.
 
Q. What are those standards?
A. The standards in English and language arts, for example, deal with listening, speaking, reading and writing -- to be able to read for information, to access information, to apply information; to be able to read for reflection; to be able to listen, read and write for response to literature; to be able to read, write, listen and speak for critical analysis and to read, write, listen and speak for social interaction.
And every single one of those standards are the same at 4th, 8th and 11th grade. Of course, the tests will look different at each grade level. But the components will be similar. White Plains has done a lot of work at looking at the standards and asking, What do the standards say? Now we're looking to make sure we're aligning all the curriculum to the standards and curriculum and doing a gap analysis -- saying, What's missing?
In every school district we will find there are areas where we will put in more support so that we will be able to meet those very challenging standards. And the idea is, of course, that there will be Regents exams for everyone at the end -- so it's raising expectations for all students.
 
Q. How do we know this is not just the latest fad?
A. I think the unfortunate thing is that people have perceived a lot of what has gone on as fads and bandwagons, and in truth there have been innovations that have gone nowhere.
But this is the state acting -- for the very first time. At the end of the 1980's, the different subject area groups, like the National Council of Teachers of Math and the National Council of Science Teachers, had looked at content area curriculum and had worked really closely and looked at the kinds of reforms that were needed in those subject areas to bring kids to the millennium. They did a lot of work. The wonderful thing is that the state is now embracing all the work that has gone on before. In other words, they didn't start from scratch. There is a whole body of research out there that tells us what works.
 
Q. Will the new assessments look at individual children's performance or evaluate tht of school districts?
A. The test lends itself to doing both. The state began getting away from just meeting minimal standards when it began two years ago to report test results that differentiated between how many advanced readers there were, not just how many were at grade level. That's important because the goal of schools has to be to add value -- not just have children reach their potential, but to maximize it. Otherwise, children who come to school accomplished will succeed in spite of us, but we need to take them beyond what they could otherwise do without us.
 
Q. How is the question of "gifted" children factored in? Are there separate standards for them?
A. The standards are the same standards but we need to differentiate instruction in the classroom so we can accommodate all students. The level at which students achieve is only limited by their own effort and their own ability. We need to continue to add to that. I think there are definitely ways within the classroom to differentiate instruction, and we will be working on that as well. We need to make sure that the gifted kids, the advanced child, the child who comes in reading and comes in with that knowledge base will be able to take off and go beyond and not feel constrained because they are beyond their grade levels.
 
Q. But, as you know, that is the ideal. Some are gifted teachers who can exceed curriculum guidelines, others can be trained to do so and others will never be able to do it.
A. Yes, but there are lots of things that you can do still. There can be flexible grouping. There can be additional programs, there can be programs within the programs. Within the standards that are given there is enough room to do things, to make accommodations. That's a very important part. That also brings me to something that I think is new about the standards. We've learned a lot about teaching and learning in the last 15 to 20 years and about how people learn. We don't learn for keeps when we are learning discreet, isolated pieces of information. And that's the way testing was until recently. It was really an accrual of facts and information. We're now being asked to go beyond that. Now we have an integration between math, science and technology, between English language arts and social studies. The eighth-grade English language arts test will actually ask students to write, weaving in the social studies curriculum.
 
Q. White Plains has many non-English-speaking people. How do you factor that in?
A. In Westchester County there is a growing population of limited and non-English-speaking children. We're very fortunate to have very fine English as a Second Language programs throughout the county. About six years ago, I visited Japan with a group of educators invited by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. One of the things the Japanese were so amazed and gratified about were the English as a Second Language programs we have here. There is nothing like that there or in Europe. But more than just having the program, the English as a Second Language teacher needs to work with the classroom teacher so that accommodations can be made for the child during the time the child spends in the classroom. That can be done through different materials, tape recorders and classroom volunteers. Through this early identification, that program becomes one that follows the child and the child develops more expertise.
 
Q. And how does the socio-economic perspective come into this?
A. Again, every class is heterogeneous, and particularly within the elementary schools we see the diversity of students as really an advantage as well as a challenge. It's what the real world is like, and students need to learn -- and they do learn -- from the different cultures that they encompass. We need to provide for everyone the background that will enable them to be literate, articulate and educated.

HEADLINE: Alan King's Love-Hate Relationship

 BODY:
In the 1950's and 60's, the comedian Alan King became a kind of social critic of the suburbs. He poked fun at life in places like Long Island -- where he had lived since the late 1940's -- on national television when national television was just coming of age and particularly on programs like the "Ed Sullivan Show," which originated in New York.
In a recent conversation with James Barron of The New York Times, Mr. King looked back at his life and career, and how a sense of place influenced both. 
 Q. Long Island was a part of your act for a long time. Isn't it fairly unusual for a comedian to become so closely identified with a place? How did it happen?
A. I was quoted on the "Huntley-Brinkley Report." They quoted me as saying the Long Island Expressway was the longest parking lot in the world. That was the line that did it. I was given names like the General de Gaulle of the crab-grass set. It was terrible.
Q. Seriously, though: how did you come to do the kind of material you did about Long Island?
A. It was an evolution that followed my actual life. I came out of Williamsburg when I got married 51 years ago. From Williamsburg we moved to a summer apartment in Long Beach, but we lived in it all year long. It was a little tough taking a shower outdoors in December.
At just about that time, my career started to take a little upturn. I was discovered in a sense by Ed Sullivan, and I bought a house in Rockville Centre, a $22,000 ranch house in a cul-de-sac. It was an upscale Levittown, but I thought I was in San Simeon. What happened was, when I moved into this house, there were so many crazy things going on that I used to relate to everybody. All the guys would say, "Alan, these are things you should be talking about."
Q. So, really you were just living your life, but you went on national television and talked about it.
A. I was talking about my life, an exaggeration of my own life. I wrote a book, "Anybody Who Owns His Own Home Deserves It," that was the retelling of a lot of the monologues that I started doing on the Sullivan show, like I lived on the Baldwin-Rockville Centre line. The line went right through my house. I had a Rockville Centre address, but my children had to go to the Baldwin schools. They tried to explain to me that if my kids would sleep in the garage, they could go to the Rockville Centre schools.
I did 90-some-odd appearances on the Sullivan show. In the middle of that, I started doing Garry Moore. What made the suburban thing work was the anger. I'm innately angry. What I was saying was what everybody else wanted to say about this suburban community -- instead of keeping up with the Joneses, it was keeping with the Cohens. I was talking about something I lived every day.
Q. So you were just poking fun at the manners and mores of your neighbors.
A. The competition between the neighbors -- who had the best lawns. That's when I started screaming about the crab grass. What's wrong with crab grass and just cutting it short? They put out petitions in the neighborhood; I was being burned in effigy. I said, "Leave me alone, I'm not trying to compete with my neighbors."
Q. So in a way your career paralleled the growth and development of Long Island. What about what happened to the houses people lived in? The houses started out pretty basic, like in Levittown, and then --
A. Finished basements. I said, it's so wonderful to walk into a house with an eight-foot ceiling and a basement with a four-foot ceiling and spend an evening like Quasimodo or Toulouse-Lautrec. This started to take off, with my exposure on the Sullivan show. Then everybody started giving me a title: "Here he is, the uncrowned king of the crab-grass set."
Then they started adding rooms on. That was the next thing. The open porch became a closed-in porch. The garage became a study. I had a $22,000 house and lived there for 11 years. We figured out I put $50,000 into that $22,000 house. And you know how much I sold it for? Twenty-two thousand dollars. That's absolutely true.
Q. And then you moved.
A. Then I moved into Oscar Hammerstein's quote-unquote mansion, which I'm in 40 years now. According to the press, if you have a four-bedroom house, it's a mansion. Six bedrooms, it's an estate. I'm looking at my rose gardens right now. My rose gardens are on more land than my house in Rockville Centre was on.
You know, when I was growing up in the tenements of New York, there were eight million kids on every corner. Now, all of a sudden, I had to take my kids with a station wagon to find someone to play with.
These are routines I did 40 years ago.
Q. But it sounds as if you really liked it on Long Island.
A. I had the excitement of New York and within the hour I had Bel Air and Beverly Hills right here on Long Island. I played tennis and golf for so many years. I had everything I wanted, and I had the city. That's why I never moved. It was a conscious choice because my business was moving to California. I said I was the best comedian in New York by default. California, half of it is burning down, the other half is choking to death.
Q. If your office was in the city, why didn't you just move there after your kids were grown?
A. I never chose to live in the city. I think that living in the city, you have the opportunity to be more isolated. You can live in the city and not know the guy next door. There's something about living in Long Island that's about a sense of community.
It's never been a free ride. You make a peace with yourself, you weigh the pluses versus the minuses. There are more pluses here. I lived in the city, and I couldn't wait to get to the suburbs. All my kids wanted to live in Greenwich Village and live on a fire escape, which is what I wanted to escape. I remember taking my son through Williamsburg, the old neighborhood. Here I was in a limousine car, and he said, "Gee, Dad, you were such a lucky kid." I looked at him, I was stunned.
Q. But even Long Island has a weird, dark side, no?
A. Every place does, but you have such an expanse of economics, of culture here. You go from the bowling league to the James Joyce club. It's so diverse. Don't forget, a lot of people forget how big Long Island is. It starts at Queens and it ends at Montauk. It's a state, practically.
Q. So how do you explain the barge, which sailed up and down the East Coast looking for a place to dump trash from Islip?
A. You know the expression "only in America"? Only in Long Island is garbage worth more than in its original form. You know what it reminds me of in a more dramatic sense? When we became aware of the Woodstock generation, the drug problem, they had a lot of meetings and everybody became so civic minded. They said we've got to build these halfway houses -- halfway to your house, not my house. People in Great Neck said build them in Roslyn, people in Roslyn said build them in Hewlett, and then the temples said the churches.
Q. A few years ago, a lot of comedians made a lot out of the whole Amy Fisher-Joey Buttafuocco thing. How do you explain it?
A. I don't have any bodywork done.
I don't even think about it as a Long Island happening. It's just something you read about. Somehow, I can't relate. First of all, it started out tragic because a woman was nearly killed, and then it got funny. You see this guy, and all of a sudden he's making pictures in Hollywood. I could understand if he went on the wrestling programs. I could never identify.
And you know something? I'm sure that every suburban area has its Mary Jos. You go to another town, you read about a schoolteacher having a baby by a student. No place is immune to weirdos.
Q. What kind of advice would you give people who are thinking of coming to Long Island?
A. I've been living here for 50 years. There's no greater ad. I'm the great commercial. In spite of everything I said, I'm still here and I'm not about to go down to Palm Beach and wear out my velvet slippers. I'm going to end up walking slow in Long Island.
Q. In all this you haven't said a word about the Hamptons.
A. The Hamptons don't belong to Long Island. To me, all the people I see at Elaine's and the "21" club and Le Cirque, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I really don't want to see after a three-and-a-half-hour drive on Saturday and Sunday. You go to a cocktail party in New York on Wednesday, then you go out on Friday in the Hamptons. Same people, only not as well dressed.
And there's a game they play in the Hamptons: how long did it take you to get here? Two hours. Two hours if they shoot you out of a cannon, you lying you-know-what.
The Hamptons have been taking it on the chin for years, but rightfully so. Where else can you buy a loaf of bread for $41?

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Office Buildings;
Some Owners Are Finding It's a Good Time to Sell

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE 42-story office building at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, between 46th and 47th Streets, has to be considered a trophy property because of its location, its roll of high quality tenants and its direct underground connections to Rockefeller Center and several subway lines.
In addition, the leases on large portions of the building are due to expire over the next few years, with the new leases at higher current market rates replacing those signed when the real estate market was soft and tenants commanded low rates and big concessions packages. It is almost completely rented, with only one 25,000-square-foot block of space available, and rents are expected to keep rising in Manhattan for several more years because of the booming economy and demand for space. 
 Which is why the family that controls the building has put it up for sale.
Indeed, with the run-up in values over the last few years, some investors who bought distressed properties in the early part of this decade are looking to lock in their profits by selling or refinancing their buildings.
As James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark Realty Advisors, put it recently, "We are advising our clients that if they are not long term holders of real estate, now is a great time to take a few chips off the table."
He noted that office vacancies are declining, interest rates are low, capital is available and capital gains tax treatment is less onerous with the repeal of New York State's so-called Cuomo tax of 10 percent on sales of over $1 million and the lowering of Federal tax rates, making transactions more attractive.
The state gains tax was considered particularly onerous, real estate executives said, because it was triggered by events not normally taxable, such as the acquisition of property by an investment trust shielded from Federal taxes.
Mr. Kuhn said it would be foolish for a property owner to try to wait to sell at the very peak of the market, because peaks are hard to spot and the downside is steep. "When the market corrects, it corrects quickly," he said.
"Yes, this is a good time to sell, but it is also a good time to buy, depending on your investment objectives," said Jeffrey Cooper, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield's financial services group. "With capital available at 7 percent, it is a good time to sell. But with rents headed up at good buildings in midtown and downtown, it is a good time to invest in Class A and high B buildings if you are a long term investor."
"There is no one right answer about when to buy and sell," said Charles L. Goldenberg, the president of the Sylvan Lawrence Company. "Indeed, there is a theory that well-located real estate should never be sold, but passed down to subsequent generations."
However, he conceded that this was a luxury theory and that harsh reality often does not permit such smooth transfers. He said his company would probably have not sold the 128 properties in Mr. Lawrence's portfolio, including the block-square former Port Authority building at 111 Eighth Avenue, except for litigation arising from the Lawrence estate.
The 1.1 million-square-foot building at 1185 Avenue of the Americas that is now up for sale was purchased in 1977 by a private investors' syndicate, whose general partners are Peter and Anthony Malkin, and it has been managed and marketed since by the family's operating company, W & M Properties.
Starting in 1995, the owners began a major upgrade to the building, replacing the roof, installing new controls on the high-rise elevators and refurbishing all the elevator cabs. The lobby was upgraded and the bathrooms were revised to meet standards for the disabled and the facade was examined and repaired as needed.
Behind the scenes, the air-conditioning and electrical capacity were increased and fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed. Although it was erected in 1972 -- to be the headquarters of the company that is now Westpoint Stevens -- W & M is marketing it as Class A space because of the improvements.
Anthony Malkin, the president of W & M, said the decision to offer the building for sale was strategic. Because there is a clear opportunity to increase income from rents, he said, the building should be attractive to real estate investment trusts and other institutional investors seeking secure income. "We anticipate that people will pay us a portion of the value they will be able to create," he said.
The biggest leases are expiring between 2003 and 2005, W & M officials said, with 14 1/2 floors becoming available for releasing.
SELLING the building, which could fetch several hundred dollars a square foot if recent sales are any indication, will enable the Malkin family to redeploy its capital after syndicate partners have been paid their proportionate shares.
"For the last 10 years we have been buying distressed assets, fixing them up, renting them and financing them," he said. In the process, W & M has built up an in-house engineering, construction, acquisition and finance capability, which would not be of much use in a building that has already been upgraded and is almost fully occupied.
"We can take the capital from this building and invest it in five or six other properties," he said.
Although sales prices of top quality office buildings have recovered sharply in recent years, they are still below those of the 1980's, said Daniel J. McNulty, the president of Rockwood Realty Associates, which is marketing 1185. "Nine years ago, Class A space was selling for about $400 a square foot," he said. "Now it is around $300 a foot not adjusted for inflation, so we are well south of the past peak."
He also noted that the lack of construction for most of this decade would provide support for rental rates and building sales that was not present in the last market cycle. During that time, 30 million square feet of office space was added to the Manhattan market, he said. "That is not going to happen in the next 15-year cycle."
But actually selling a Manhattan skyscraper is trickier than making the decision to sell. There are questions about the ability of a prospective buyer to obtain financing and actually close the transaction, regardless of how big a number may be initially proposed. Should an owner demand cash and face capital gains tax? Or would selling to a REIT in exchange for rights to shares be preferable because it postpones taxes -- but leaves the sellers vulnerable to declines in a REIT's stock price? Swapping for another property might avoid both pitfalls, but does not meet the objective of turning real estate into liquid capital.
Nevertheless, "a lot more people are talking about tax-free exchanges than in a long time," observed Kevin F. Haggarty, executive managing director of Insignia/ESG's capital advisers group.
Mr. Malkin made his thinking clear last week by issuing an announcement that investors at 1185 are interested in making a large number of acquisitions quickly to take advantage of tax-deferred exchange provisions of the law.
Another way of realizing cash from a building is refinancing, an alternative that allows an owner to capitalize on the value of a property, but adds a big obligation to the lender that might be hard to sustain if the market weakens and rents start to slip. That, essentially, is what happened at Rockefeller Center, real estate executives say. The companies operating the center were unable to meet debt payments and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995. A group led by Tishman Speyer Properties bought control of the buildings east of Avenue of the Americas in 1996.
The recent weakness in the stock price of many REIT's may curb their free-spending ways, industry executives say. "The softness of REIT stocks has made them less aggressive," said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of the Carleton Group, a brokerage and financing company. "Six months ago, if a high-profile property was offered to sales, the REIT's would get it. Now individuals can compete with REIT's."
Part of the reason REIT's are reluctant to issue the tax-free operating partnership units that are convertible into common stock after a period of time is they don't like the current terms of such a transaction. . "REIT's don't want to do O.P. units these days." Mr. Haggarty said. "They view their stocks as undervalued and they don't want to pay too much."
Adding the risk of stock market fluctuations to the usual complications of doing real estate transactions means that added brain power is needed to evaluate proposals, Mr. Malkin said. "The reason we went with Rockwood is their analytic capability and the capabilities of their associates," he said. "If some REIT we have never heard of comes in, we need to be able to analyze it to figure out whether its stock price is likely to decline 30 to 40 percent in the next year."

HEADLINE: For Every New Long Islander, Familiar Hopes and Dreams

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
WHEN David Grunberger first broached the possibility of moving to New York three years ago, his wife, Claudia, wasn't exactly thrilled. She had recently relocated from London to Antwerp. And she hated the month they spent in a Manhattan apartment hotel. Her husband, however, a Belgian businessman, was tired of his trans-Atlantic commute every other month. And their future, he said, was in the United States.
As it turned out, changing countries was easy. Figuring out where to live in the metropolitan area was not. 
 On a visit to New York a year and a half ago, the couple rented a car and toured neighborhoods in Westchester, Queens and Nassau Counties. This weekend, after renting a home for 10 months to make sure they liked the area, they are moving into the five-bedroom Tudor on half an acre that they bought near a park in Great Neck.
The Grunbergers are among scores of recent arrivals, a polyglot, group of homeowners seeking a suburban setting in which to raise their children.
"I didn't know what the suburbs looked like," said Mrs. Grunberger, 29, who has also lived in Paris, Venice and Florence. "When I saw Great Neck, I loved it. It was so close to the city. Great Neck has a life of its own. The main street is buzzing. London has similar high streets. I liked the Jewish feeling. It reminded me of Israel."
Mrs. Grunberger's early experiences mirrored those of many newcomers. She joined the library, enrolled her daughter in nursery school, checked out supermarkets, got lost on the parkways, and -- not knowing a soul except for her landlord and real estate agent -- called her mother in London to complain.
Welcome to Long Island. From entrepreneurs to postal workers and retirees, newcomers to the more than 260 communities in Nassau and Suffolk counties expressed personal, occupational and economic reasons for choosing to settle where they have. Some could live almost anywhere but opted for proximity to family or based their choice on schools, shopping, beaches, parks, commuting and taxes.
Following the natural pattern of neighborhoods, where empty nesters downsized, younger folks moved up and in.
The Grunbergers, for example, bought their 4,200-square-foot home from a couple in their 60's who relocated to a townhouse in White Plains to be closer to the only one of their four grown children still in the same state.
According to the Census Bureau, about 1,303,700 people lived in Nassau County in 1997, an increase of 1.3 percent since the 1990 census. The figures for Suffolk County were about 1,362,600, an increase of 3.1 percent. People from Asia and Spanish-speaking countries represented the largest increases in both counties.
"The demand for residential housing is extremely strong," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's major business group.
"The market for luxury housing on Long Island is particularly strong. The housing market has changed dramatically in the last 12 to 18 months. It's a seller's market, where in the past 10 years it was a buyer's market. We know young families are replacing retirees. Some are undoubtedly coming from the city as they become more affluent and move out here."
Changes in the tax code, allowing older residents who settled on Long Island in the 1950's and 60's to shelter more on the gains from the sale of their homes, Dr. Kamer said, "has certainly unfrozen the market and allowed younger families to move in, retaining the people who grew up here."
Homes in upscale neighborhoods, she continued, are being bought up and demolished except for a standing wall or chimney and rebuilt up to the lot line. And estates are being built on former farm acreage, with Wall Streeters commuting on a daily basis to the East End.
Retirees, however, Dr. Kamer said, are not relocating to the sunbelt, but moving to local retirement, life-care and new assisted-living developments. And low mortgage rates are causing an influx of young families who can afford to buy more home.
In July, Kwang Min, an entrepreneur with a shoe business in Manhattan and a shipping enterprise at Kennedy Airport, moved from a three-bedroom co-op in Flushing to Port Washington in search of a topnotch education for his two children, ages 10 and 14. In Queens, the businessman said, his children went to Catholic school. What he spent on tuition there, he said, he wll apply to his $500 monthly property tax bill on a $460,000, four-bedroom house with a two-car garage on a 60 by 120 lot and send the children to public school.
Mr. Min, whose extended family is still in Korea, learned about the community through a friend. When he bought the property, he said, he had seen the town harbor. He had no clue, however, as to the best shopping or parks. He was depending on his real- estate broker -- coupled with daily jogs and bicycle rides -- to learn his way around.
For his weekly soccer game, however, Mr. Min still goes back to Flushing.
"The Asian population is really growing," said Ran Sook Cho, an associate broker at Coldwell Banker Sammis in Port Washington. "Mainly Chinese, Indian and Korean doctors and lawyers and computer business and top professionals, because the schools are excellent and the train line is wonderful. A lot of people move to Flushing and then to Bayside and then Douglaston and Little Neck and then finally settle in Port Washington, Searingtown and Manhasset Hills. Some who can afford it move to Sands Point and Brookville and Old Westbury and to gated communities. If they can't afford it, they go to New Hyde Park."
It was the love of family and friends that drew Patricia and John Carusi back to Long Island after 10 years in Texas when Mr. Carusi, 62, retired last year.
While they had planned to move to New Hampshire, where they already owned a second home -- and had even moved most of their belongings to the mountaintop property -- their daughter convinced them it was time to come back to Long Island.
"If my husband hadn't been transferred, we never would have left New York to begin with," said Mrs. Carusi, 60, who was born in Manhattan, raised in Queens and moved with her husband to a colonial in Commack in 1967. "We expected todie in that house. We all had our friends and we were all established in our community. To transplant lifelong New Yorkers like we were was quite an adjustment. It's a different culture in the South."
The five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath home on the fairway of a golf course that they had in Texas, however, could not be duplicated for under seven figures on the Island, more than triple their selling price. So the Carusis downsized on their return to a two- bedroom condominium a mile from their daughter's Kings Park home. They are still trying to figure out what to do with all the furniture.
"I missed our family and our friends, that was the biggest thing," Mrs. Carusi said.
Harold and Cheryl Spector were pretty familiar with the area when they bought a $215,000 split-level house in North Bellmore last fall. Although the couple had lived in Bay Terrace almost their entire lives, Mrs. Spector, 32, has an uncle and cousins in the South Shore neighborhood. Mr. Spector's brother lives a mile away in East Meadow.
"We thought it would be a better life to raise our child," said Mr. Spector, 39, a customer service analyst for the United States Postal Service. Their son, Evan, was born a month after they moved in.
"This is one of the best school districts," said Mrs. Spector, who checked out school ratings in the neighborhood. "East Meadow was our first choice, but we just couldn't find the house we were looking for."
Mrs. Spector wanted multiple bathrooms. Her husband wanted an entranceway. "We looked in Plainview but the taxes were higher and you get much more here for the price."
"Anything closer to Queens we couldn't afford," said Mrs. Spector, who used to live five minutes from her job as a third-grade teacher and now drives an hour each way. "Anything further out made the commute too long."
Besides, her husband said, this house was close to Roosevelt Field and Massapequa malls, where they had always liked to shop. Using contractors they found in local newspapers, they painted, stripped floors and started replacing windows, adding a glass circle top over the front door. Doing work on the house, they have noticed, is a sure way to meet the neighbors.
Mrs. Spector visited a local mothers' center. They joined the library, found a park nearby with swings for the baby and went to the town pool. Just strolling the neighborhood with the baby in the carriage, Mrs. Spector found friends.
"Our neighbors are new, too," she said. "They just moved in a few weeks after us. We stay in the backyard and talk."
Since they moved in, four homes in the neighborhood have turned over."The old people are moving out and younger people are moving in," she said.

HEADLINE: Coffee's Hot, Bread's Fresh, the Bookstore Goes Social

BYLINE: By JACKIE FITZPATRICK 

 BODY:
EACH morning, not long after waking up, Sharmila Sen heads to her home away from home or, rather, her secondary office. She goes to the Atticus Book Store-Cafe on Chapel Street in New Haven, in search of a strong, hot cup of coffee and quiet.
"It's a great place to go when I have a lot of papers to grade. Their hours are perfect for someone like me -- open early, open late," she said. She often returns to the store in the evening, to find a good new book or meet friends. 
 Ms. Sen is a graduate student working on her Ph.D in English at Yale University. On a recent afternoon, she shared a late lunch with Helen Lawrence, also a Yale Ph.D. candidate and a frequent bookstore visitor. She comes "to be surrounded by books. I love that. And it's a relaxing, fun place."
They are not alone. A bookstore is no longer simply to pick up the latest techno-thriller by Tom Clancy or mystery by Mary Higgins Clark. They are places for people to sip espresso and nibble lemon bars, to hear big-name authors or aspiring folk singers, to join a monthly book club, to take their children for a pajama party complete with bedtime stories and milk and cookies.
Bookstores have become social gathering places in the 1990's, places where, as Virginia Meyrat, a manager at Borders Books in Stamford tells it, people can "browse around in search of a great book with their cookies and coffee . . . and teen-agers can sit around together on the rug, talk and read."
Some bookstores remain steadfastly devoted solely to books but many others, both independents and large chains, have branched out.
"We weren't the first bookstore to have a cafe but we were one of the earlier ones and we did it because we felt food and coffee and books go well together," said Diarmud Kennedy, manager of Atticus. "Now we have a bakery so people can pick up a book and some fresh baked bread. We're like a human fishbowl here on Chapel Street with our big, wide windows. People like looking in and people inside like watching people outside. I think people like to have a place to go where they feel welcome."
At the Whistle Stop Book Shop in Stratford, children arrive with piles of books they've just read, place them on the counter for the store owner, Bonnie Lee, and dash off to the children's section where they plop themselves on the floor.
There they hunt through shelves of used books. They receive store credit for each book they return and often leave with a paper bag full of Babysitter Club books, Judy Blume or Beverly Cleary. "We want children to be readers, that's so important," Mrs. Lee said. Youngsters can also try their hand at acting in plays from the American Girl series or participate in numerous other events at the shop.
The Whistle Stop Book Shop, tucked in near the train station in Stratford, is full of used and new books for adults and young people to explore. A grandparent might show up with a grandchild, both leaving with a few books. "We have lots of older people who can go through a mystery a day and they might not have the money to buy new, so they come in with what they've read and then get more," Mrs. Lee said.
Antiques dot the store's landscape and a bench with a quilt draped over it beckons a reader who thumbs through a few pages before making a selection. Mrs. Lee owns the store with her daughter, Pam Robertson, both book lovers. Customers have started several reading groups including a mystery and classic group. Recently the owners held a coffeehouse for local poets, singers and comics to showcase their talents. "We feel like a real part of the community here and we love that," Mrs. Lee said.
Suzy Staubach, manager of the General Books Division at the UConn Coop in Storrs, said the profile of a typical customer at a bookstore "fits the profile of a shoplifter at another store."
As she explained it, "They hang around. They browse. They pick up a book, read a bit, put it down, try another. But we love that. That's what a good customer does."
While many customers at the Coop are UConn students, in search of that text for economics 101 or biochemistry, "It's actually a very cosmopolitan place. We have a big international community and people from our region love books." Ms. Stauback said.
Early on, recognizing that people like to be connected to the authors they love, the bookstore began offering readings and signings. One of the most popular readings was by Arundhati Roy, the author of "The God of Small Things." It was slated for a day after school was out, in the middle of the day. But the place was packed. "The Indian community turned out in large numbers, as did people who had fallen in love with her book," Ms. Staubach said.
In recent years, the Coop has added a cafe and it continues to build on its signings and readings. On Sept. 17 there will be a party for Wally Lamb, author of "I Know This Much Is True," a bestseller and that became his second book selected by Oprah Winfrey's influential book club.
Mr. Lamb, who still lives in the area, wrote his first book, "She's Come Undone," in the wee hours of the morning just next door at the UConn library. He retains his status as a kind of local hero.
The R.J. Julia bookstore in Madison will also turn its attention to local authors with its first Connecticut Authors Day on Oct. 24. Roxanne Coady, owner of R.J. Julia, said she's always felt it is important to bring the writer to his or her readers. Three personalities who had drawn huge crowds at previous signings were Don Imus of WFAN Radio; Frank McCourt, author of "Angela's Ashes," and Anna Quindlen, the best-selling author and former New York Times columnist. This fall, among others, Fannie Flagg will sign her new book, "Welcome to the World Baby Girl."
Because of their ties to people in their communities, many bookstores have helped build a following for a book. Mr. Kennedy, for example, said he's been on a mission to promote William Maxwell's book "So Long, See You Tomorrow."
"When you feel passionate about a book you can share it with people who love to read and that's such a good feeling," Mr. Kennedy said.
At Borders in Stamford, poets and singers have a chance to build an audience at regular sessions in in its Espresso Bar. Poets sometimes take their words, jotted down on lined paper or just off the computer printer, and share them with listeners. "That's been very popular," Ms. Meyrat said.
It hasn't hurt bookstores, several managers have chuckled, that America is in the midst of a love affair with coffee and the java goes well with poetry and song.
"I really like it when I walk around, helping people find a book, and I see other people sitting on the floor or walking around, tapping their feet to music we have on in the background or talking to a friend over coffee," Ms. Meyrat said. "It's the kind of atmosphere that I think brings people back and back."
At Atticus, the aroma of fresh bread and cappucino mingled in the air. Robin Greenwood, a graduate student at Harvard, was in town to see his girlfriend, a Yale student. They were meeting in the bookstore's cafe. "I like the fact that they have big tables and you can spread everything out and get some work done," he said, digging into a piece of cake.

HEADLINE: With Transfers, Relocation Business Thrives

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Ann Wheatley learned that her husband's promotion would mean leaving London for New York, she immediately started looking for houses in the New York area by way of the Internet.
"I came across the Web site of a local realtor, Houlihan/Lawrence, and printed out a couple of their houses that looked interesting," Mrs. Wheatley said. "But after we arrived in New York it was actually a realtor in New Jersey, introduced to us by Saville, our London realtor, who put us together with the Houlihan/Lawrence Company in Westchester." 
 Because Mr. Wheatley now has a permanent position with an American company, with headquarters in Manhattan, Mrs. Wheatley said the couple sold their Victorian house in England and have their one-bedroom apartment on the Thames River in London on the market.
"I saw a number of houses in April, when I was here for a long weekend," she recalled. "Actually, there wasn't much on the market. Prices were high, but no higher than at home, so we weren't shocked."
Eventually, the search was narrowed to two houses, and the Wheatleys finally bought a five-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath, contemporary with a view on a pretty acre, for $570,000 in Briarcliff Manor.
"It's very lovely and reminds us a bit of England, and the commute is good," Mrs. Wheatley said. "Our first look at the area was when we took a train trip up the Hudson to Cold Spring. A friend advised us on taking a jaunt outside New York City to see some of the countryside, and we thought the Hudson River surroundings were beautiful."
During the lean years marked by corporate downsizing in the late 80's and early 90's, the relocation business was dormant. Executive moves like that by the Wheatleys were few and far between. Now, thanks to a robust economy and an influx of new companies in the region, the relocation market is thriving, despite the record-breaking high prices of houses.
"Yes, people who are being transferred from lower-priced areas are experiencing sticker shock when they see what houses cost here, but we're prepared," said Elizabeth N. Demey, director of Corporate Services for Houlihan/Lawrence Relocation Management in Armonk. "Housing costs and cost-of-living differences are explained to transferees, as are various choices of communities, life style and commuting distances. Following an introductory telephone interview, we match each relocating employee with an agent in one of our 22 offices."
One of the largest relocation moves in recent years involves the corporate consolidation of about 200 employees of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide to White Plains, where the company is temporarily situated while it looks for permanent headquarters in the Westchester-Fairfield area.
"We were competing with the large relocation divisions of the national franchisee real estate companies across the nation for this account, which we've been wooing since we first heard Starwood was considering a move to Westchester earlier this year," Stephen R. Meyers, president of Houlihan/Lawrence, said. "We were absolutely delighted that they chose to go with a local company. We're members of RELO, which is the national network of independent real estate firms providing relocation services, so our clients around the country can deal directly with a realtor in any location, eliminating the middleman."
Ms. Demey said Starwood employees from Boston, Seattle, Phoenix and Atlanta have already bought homes in Westchester, Putnam and Fairfield Counties.
"In Fairfield, we work with the William Pitt agency," she said. "To date, 24 families have either rented or bought houses, and we hope to have all 200 settled by the end of the year."
Initially, the out-of-towners in their hunt for housing were dismayed not only by the high price tags on houses but also by the high real estate taxes that went with them, Ms. Demey reported. "It is understandable, coming from a place like Seattle or Atlanta where the dollar buys a lot more house," she said.
Yet, she observed, within a 10-mile radius and less than 45 minutes from White Plains, houses for $300,000 and under do exist.
"That's the average price this relocating group is comfortable with," Ms. Demey said. "And there are some good buys in this price category in northern Westchester and southern Putnam Counties, under 45 minutes from White Plains, but some buyers, like a couple who formerly lived outside of Boston, have had to downsize. They wanted to buy a single-family home but ended up with a town house in the Brewster area, which was what they could afford."
Resale values are very important to transferees, Ms. Demey emphasized. "Most of our corporate clients insist on having a prepurchase appraisal," she said. "They want to be sure the house isn't overpriced and that it will retain its value. Moving is never easy, but relocation is even harder than a regular move, so we supply a one-stop shop for transferees through our contacts with career counselors, moving companies, mortgage companies and the like. We schedule meetings with schools and provide up-to-date school reports. What's more, we keep in contact with the family from three to six months after the move to see how they've settled in."
The company is working with a dozen major corporations and multinational companies in the Westchester-Fairfield area that have operations in various parts of the world, Ms. Demey said. "The U.S. is the top destination for global relocation," she said. "We're seeing increasing numbers of transferees from Europe and South America. And in order to make the move easier for them, we have multilingual agents who accompany the transferee and the family on their house-hunting tour, acting as a translator and giving them assistance with schools, bank accounts, grocery shopping and whatever else is needed."
Before moving, transferees going or coming from overseas receive a package full of information like local real estate practices, housing options, a home buyer's handbook, information on utilities, a measurement-conversion chart, local airport information, educational and cultural opportunities, places of interest, climate and seasonal facts and a suggested reading list.
The company is working with a corporation that is transferring a number of employees to the United States from Brazil. Anita Kowarick, an international sales agent in the Bronxville office who speaks fluent Portuguese, French and Spanish, recently helped relocate a Brazilian family.
"I've lived in Brazil, although I was born here to a Brazilian mother and a Norwegian father," Ms. Kowarick said. "I draw on my experience in Brazil to help transferees by recognizing the cultural differences and explaining American customs to them in a way they will understand."
Before she started the Brazilian family on their house-hunting quest, Ms. Kowarick escorted their two daughters, 11 and 14, on a tour of schools.
"Schools were a priority, so we looked at private schools and public schools, and eventually the girls selected a good public school," she said. "And then we found the family a house in the area. They were two very frightened girls when they arrived, anxious about the schools, but as it turned out, the thing they were most frightened of was the cold. They didn't know how they would deal with it.
"They cheered up quickly when I told them, Not to worry, the houses here were heated. You see, in Brazil they are not."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Englewood Lures Investors to Battle West Side Blight

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD

 BODY:
THE wave of redevelopment that rolled across downtown Englewood during the last decade has kept the blocks along Palisade Avenue, east of the unused railroad tracks, a vibrant shopping district. But the activity was never fully successful on the West Side, which still shows signs of deterioration and blight.
Rather than leave that neighborhood's future to fate, this Bergen County city started a campaign three years ago to turn the West Side around and in the process attract national retailers, who have long been unwilling to cross the tracks. Since then it has invested $3.5 million in city, state and Federal grants and loans and $1 million more in private money The money was used to buy run-down houses from absentee landlords, rehabilitate them and sell them; increase patrols aimed at ridding the streets of crime; remove graffiti, and spruce up the 30-acre MacKay Park, among other projects. 
 "We had to fix the quality-of-life issues before we could set the stage for economic development," said Peter M. Beronio, the city's director of community services.
By doing so, the city has succeeded in attracting Group U.S.A., a national discount women's clothing chain, to the West Side. During the next year, Group U.S.A., based in Secaucus, is scheduled to develop a 31,000-square-foot, two-story building and open a 6,000-square-foot store. A tenant, Mikasa, a china and flatware retailer, is to occupy 5,500 square feet. Group U.S.A. hopes to find a third retailer and lease 15,000 square feet of second-story professional office space, said Mahyar Amirsaleh, president of Group U.S.A.
Before the $2.5 million Group U.S.A. project gets under way, the city will demolish seven vacant and dilapidated storefronts on the site at James Street and West Palisade Avenue. Demolition began on Thursday.
The hope is that the private investment that has eluded the neighborhood for years will finally take hold, said Robert L. Benecke, Englewood's City Manager and chief financial officer. He said he is optimistic because the city is discussing two other West Side projects with developers. One involves housing above retail shops; the other focuses on an entertainment complex.
Edward T. Baczewski, who has run Herbert's Camera House on East Palisade Avenue for 25 years, said, "If you entered the city on the West Side it gives the wrong image and so, if nothing was done, all businesses would suffer."
Mr. Baczewski, who is also vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said there is some concern about increased competition. But bringing in "high-quality merchants" to the West Side could strengthen, not hurt, existing businesses, as past competition has proved, he said.
Albert King, a former New Jersey Nets basketball player who has run a Wendy's franchise on West Palisade Avenue for three years, agreed, saying: "Competition is good. It keeps everyone on their toes. Putting in the Group U.S.A. project a half-block away can't do anything but help."
Englewood's downtown comprises six blocks along Palisade Avenue and the side streets in between. East of the tracks, there are about 200 restaurants and stores, including antiques shops and boutiques, like Ann Taylor. Occupancy is high, with a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent, Mr. Beronio said, and rents average $28 a square foot.
On the West Side, the streetscape is a mix of houses and shops. It contains 100 stores, including long-established retailers like Eagle Paint, as well as the John Harms Center for the Arts. Still, the lack of investment in the last decade, along with drug trafficking, repair shops forbidden in residentially zoned areas and the poor condition of the housing, particularly in and around Armory Street, city officials said, has kept the retail streets pocked with empty stores. Rents are low, averaging $13 a square foot.
"Improving the West Side benefits the entire city in terms of both increased quality of life and tax revenue," Mr. Benecke said. Every $1 million invested will generate $30,000 in annual tax revenue, he said. He added that an additional $5 million in public and private money, including Group U.S.A.'s investment, will be funneled into the area, for a total of $9.5 million. The additional money will be used to add parking, landscaping and street lights and transform a worn-out lot off Palisade Avenue into three two-family houses that the city will sell for around $170,000.
THE city's campaign reflects the approach New Jersey encourages through its Neighborhood Preservation Program, which provides money to municipalities to rebuild entire neighborhoods rather than make quick-fix investments in a single project. Rebuilding a neighborhood "takes more than bricks and mortar," said Anthony Cancro, director of the Division of Housing and Community Resources of the State Department of Community Affairs, which administers the program.
Englewood is one of 130 communities that receives money from the program. But the city used the $400,000 it received to attract $1.3 million in other public and private money to improve the neighborhood, Mr. Cancro said.
Previous attempts to revive the West Side have fallen short of expectations. In the early 90's, a grubby, seven-acre wedge along North Van Brunt Street was transformed into a 115,000-square-foot shopping center called Palisade Court, but the $25 million project was not extensive enough to lure other private investors to the neighborhood.
As a result, plans to attract private developers to build a housing project in the troubled Armory Street area never materialized. In 1995, the plans, which envisioned 400 condominium units on 11 acres, were abandoned.
That failure prompted Englewood to redevelop the Armory Street neighborhood. At that point, in 1995, the city had the financial stability and political will to pursue such a plan, Mr. Benecke said.
The city purchased 5 of the 17 one- and two-family houses on Armory Street from absentee landlords for $85,000 each. It worked with contractors, who invested their own money, to rehabilitate those houses. The houses were then sold for $160,000 each and city and the contractors reaped the profits.
The city also helped four homeowners secure state money to renovate their homes. Now the landlords of the remaining eight houses, many of them vacant, are sprucing them up for lease or sale.
The city received a $200,000 grant from Bergen County to put in new sidewalks, landscaping and lighting in the neighborhood, and now has received another $700,000 for the rest of the West Side.
Those improvements influenced Group U.S.A.'s decision to proceed with its project. "We are taking a chance going in there," said Mr. Amirsaleh, the retailer's president. "But we believe in the potential of the area and the city's no-nonsense vision of its future." The site also provides the company with the Bergen County location it sought "to be closer to our customer base," he said, noting that working with the city also made it easier to secure building permits.
Its partnership with the city also saved the company money because Englewood set up a special 15-year land lease arrangement. Under it, the city will lease the land under the new building from the landowner, John Krantz, for 12 1/2 years, paying $65,000 for the first three years with increases tied to the rate of inflation for the remaining 9 1/2 years. When the lease expires, the owner will donate the land to the city, which in turn will sell it to Group U.S.A. for $1.
The city will also improve the drainage canal under the buildings, Mr. Beronio said, noting that the city's payback will come from increased taxes. The property owner now pays $13,000 in annual taxes; once the project is complete it will generate up to $100,000 a year in taxes, Mr. Beronio said.
Mr. Amirsaleh said that without the city's financial incentives the project would have cost $4 million, making it too expensive, since current rents are too low to provide an adequate return. "With it, our risk is reasonable," he said. The building is expected to open next August.
When the city's campaign is complete, Mr. Beronio said, "It will go a long way in erasing the tracks as a psychological barrier to shopping on the West Side."

One Riddle Fits All

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
LET me begin by saying that I'm not a Lilly Pulitzer kind of woman. But in July, I found myself on Martha's Vineyard with an hour on my hands, checked out the competition and thought, "When in Rome . . . "
I followed a group of women with sun-worn faces and plaid hair bands into the closest boutique, and there I found it: a short, flirty, flowered Lilly Pulitzer, printed with roses and frogs and prancing children. The fit was miraculous, as if a team of steely-eyed couture seamstresses had spent weeks plotting each angle and line and dip of my body. I was ready to unburden myself of $130 when I stepped out of the dress and saw the label. The magical phrase I read there changed my life: size 6. 
 I had unwittingly stumbled upon the holy grail of womanhood. Sucking in my stomach, I decided to go for a size 4 plaid skirt. The headband set listened as I struggled, wriggled and zipped. And as a soft white light suffused the dressing room and the distant strains of a divine choir (actually, it was Hanson) seemed to drift past the swinging wicker doors, I took a long breath. Victory -- size 4 -- was mine.
Women's apparel sizing is eternally mystifying. I am a broad-shouldered athlete, close to six feet tall and weighing many, many dozens of pounds. How I fit into a 6, the size of wraithlike supermodels and desiccated society waifs who eat grapes for lunch, or a positively puny size 4, is a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in, well, a size 4 wrap dress.
And it's become a lightning-rod issue for American clothing manufacturers. I described the incredible shrinking act to Dr. Lenda Jo Anderson, a professor of consumer affairs at Auburn University in Alabama, who at the behest of the Commerce Department studies size in women's clothing.
"We define ourselves in our minds by size, and designers play to that notion," she said in a demure Southern accent. "It makes us feel good to fit into a 6, but it also makes us feel good to be able to say to our friends that we fit into a size 6. But it can be ridiculous. I bought a pair of pants by Carlisle in a size 0 the other day. Who wears a size 0?" (Dr. Anderson said she usually wears a 4 or a 6.)
The American Apparel Manufacturers Association studies the subject, but Carl Priestland, the association's chief economist, says it's not a simple problem.
"Sizing has been an issue for years simply because there are so many companies out there making garments," he said. "There are seven billion garments consumed in the United states each year that require care labeling. So it's nice and pretty to say we want a standard for each and every piece."
Mr. Priestland said that each year American manufacturers make 200 million dresses, 375 million pairs of jeans, 2.4 billion knit shirts and 45 million dozen pairs of women's panties.
"Can you imagine?" he said. "Forty-five million dozen pairs of women's panties?" To be honest, I can't.
Dr. Anderson explained that American women's sizes originated in the 1940's and 50's, when the Army, confronted with the enormous task of outfitting tens of thousands of women for the first time, tried to create a standard set of sizes. The chart that resulted, outlining the 58 sizes for men and women was published by the Bureau of Standards as Document 454.
Obviously, Document 454 is not taped to the refrigerator of today's designers. Since the 40's, sizes have been shifting as crazily as the San Andreas fault.
The Commerce Department has founded the National Textile Center, a consortium of colleges, to study the subject. The Air Force is conducting a nationwide survey of American bodies to redefine the standard body and size. And as more and more consumers buy clothing in the electronic marketplace -- over the telephone or via the Internet -- Dr. Anderson said, the problem becomes pronounced because consumers rely on sizes, without actually trying on articles of clothing, to determine what will fit them best. Companies like QVC report returns of up to 50 percent on clothing due to poor fit, she said.
But aside from economic difficulties, there are psychological ones. No woman who usually wears a 12 wants to go to her closet and confront a row of stolid, round, pudgy black numbers that read 16 or 18 or 20.
In "The Silence of the Lambs," the drag-queen killer always chose young women who were a size 14 -- and the only moviegoers who remember that piece of trivia are women. And in certain female quarters, the size of Monica Lewinsky's notorious off-the-rack dress continues to inspire guessing games.
I usually call myself a 10. But I've ordered shorts from J. Crew that in a 10, without the tab pocket, are so loose I have to duct-tape them to my body to keep them from falling off. Similar shorts in the same size, with the tab pocket, are so tiny that I have to grease myself like a watermelon on the Fourth of July in order to slide them on.
In noncatalogue clothing, the discrepancies from designer to designer are startling. Tahari makes a jacket that I -- a former competitive swimmer with the shoulders of a Pittsburgh Steeler -- can wear only in a shrinky-dink 6. The skirt, on the other hand, fits in an 8 (svelte), 10 (poochy) or a 12 (nunlike). A benevelont aunt gave me a Mary McFadden couture dress in an 8, and it is broad in the beam. Country Road makes wool pants that fit beautifully in an 8, and viscose pants in the same cut that in a 10 fit like swaddling clothes.
I wear a sample-size 8 in the famously revived Diane Von Furstenburg wrap dress, and a 16 -- gasp! -- in a vintage dress from the 1950's. (Sizes have shifted so much in the last four decades that every woman loves to crow about how Marilyn Monroe wore a 14. But that was back in the days when a 14 was really an 8, so button your lip.)
"It's very upsetting," said one friend who tried on a too-tight skirt in a size 14 at Agnes B. "Even the salesclerk was consoling me."
When men shop, they are not permitted to toy with their psyches the way women do and plot elaborate mazes of self-delusion. Rather than playing a psychological shell game every time they go to the Gap or Brooks Brothers, they simply pick out the pants with a 36-inch waist and the shirt with the 16-inch neck. When they get fat, they are faced with the cold, factual truth -- Got a 44-inch waist, buddy? Well, you're fat! -- and simply scratch off the numbers on the Levi's label.
But every bubble has to burst. That same day on Martha's Vineyard, a friend surprised me with a gift: a blue-and-white polka dot dress, a saucy Marilyn Monroesque number with a halter top and a flared skirt, designed to play fast and loose with a steam grate.
"They didn't have your size," he said, as I twirled in front of the mirror, wearing my new, snug dress.
"Oh? What size is this?" I asked, slowing the gleeful twirling to a more dignified rotation.
"I think it's a, um, a 12," he said, staring down at his hands, clasped humbly in his lap.
I stopped the cake-display twirl. The room was suddenly very quiet. It was a big moment. He looked up, and his terror-filled eyes said: Is she going to hit me now?
"But the lady in the store said the sizes ran really small," he said, painfully nonchalant. "I mean really, really small."
Good answer, I thought, then took a pair of manicure scissors and snipped out the label.

Three Early Adopters, of Sorts

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHILE Federal auto choice legislation remains a long shot this year, three states have adopted insurance systems that already give drivers some discretion to limit their right to sue for pain and suffering in exchange for lower premiums.
None offer decisive evidence of how a full-blown auto choice system would play out nationally, but each offers at least modest insights. 

KENTUCKY -- The first state with "choice" -- its changes more than a decade old -- hardly offers one. Those who choose to limit their right to sue for intangible losses like pain and suffering -- the vast majority of drivers -- do not have to impose much discipline on themselves. Lawsuits are permitted as long as the injured party has medical bills of $1,000 -- a low hurdle, indeed.
 The Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimates that a switch to a system that bars virtually all claims for pain and suffering would reduce annual liability insurance costs in Kentucky by an average of $134, or 38 percent. But with premiums already below the national average, rates are not a significant political issue in the state.
 
PENNSYLVANIA -- This state's system looks a lot more like the Federal choice plan. Drivers who choose limited coverage must vault a significant threshold -- having incurred "serious injury" -- to be able to sue for pain and suffering. But full tort coverage remains the default option; to get the limited coverage, drivers must request it from their insurers.
At present, the majority of drivers have full coverage, though David Snyder of the American Insurance Association said that insurers who make the effort find they can sell the limited coverage to about half of their customers. Those who accept limited coverage receive a 20 percent discount on liability insurance.
 
NEW JERSEY -- As in Pennsylvania, drivers can choose limited or full tort coverage. But the default option for those not specifying a preference is the limited coverage. Roughly 85 percent of drivers end up with limited coverage; to sue for pain and suffering, they must meet a threshold that is somewhat weaker than Pennsylvania's. Still, according to Mr. Snyder, drivers opting for the limited coverage in New Jersey's competitive insurance market save 50 percent off the price of unrestricted liability coverage.
New Jersey currently mandates a hefty $250,000 minimum of no-fault personal injury protection. But under pressure from voters to reduce insurance premiums, which remain among the highest in the nation, the state will allow drivers to cut that coverage to just $15,000 beginning next year. That should lure some uninsured drivers back into getting required insurance, but the move could undermine the thrust of the choice system: $15,000 is grossly insufficient to compensate for many injuries, so it is likely that more people will go to court to try to make good their medical costs and lost income.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Jobs Look Steady on a Leaner Wall St.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
STOCKBROKERS often complain that a customer never remembers when their recommendations are proved right, but never forgets when they're wrong.
But if Wall Street, which makes a handsome living from its ingrates, suffers these days from swooning prices, there is little sign that this is putting many jobs at risk. 
 In the 1980's, brokerage houses expanded at breakneck speed as the market and economy emerged from the doldrums, only to contract after the 1987 crash. By contrast, the 1990's have been a time of more sober hiring even as stock prices skyrocketed. "In the past, you've seen hiring booming and busting," said Bill Montgoris, chief operating officer at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Now firms have been much more cautious."
This suggests that even if the stock market plummets, job casualties will remain few, mostly a result of mergers or confined to niches like emerging markets, where disaster has already struck.
Still, there would be a financial pinch -- probably more like a squeeze -- for tens of thousands of people in the securities business for whom annual bonuses have reached lavish proportions in recent years and have driven average industry pay in New York last year to $181,900, almost four times as much as the $48,800 earned by the average city worker. (The securities business includes investment banks as well as brokerage houses.)
An analysis by the office of New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall concluded earlier this month that in the event of a downturn, "securities firms will likely reduce costs by lowering compensation before resorting to layoffs."
The industry's deliberate pace of hiring can be seen in the fact that it wasn't until June that the New York City economy set a record for the number of Wall Street jobs -- 164,300, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That eclipsed the 163,000 total in 1987, before the October crash. The reverberations of that crash led to the loss of one in five securities firms and jobs by 1990, said Jeffrey Schaefer, a consultant to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group.
But why has the latest bull market not led to even more hiring on Wall Street? There is wide agreement on a main reason: Those who run securities businesses today were chastened by 1987.
"They're not staffed as inappropriately as they were back then," said Brian Sullivan, president of his own executive search firm in New York that specializes in financial services. Moreover, he observed, the economy is much stronger now and the industry's "product line" is broader and less reliant on junk bonds and leveraged buyouts.
Other factors that may lessen the industry's vulnerability to a major market drop are vast improvements in technology and efficiencies gleaned through mergers. An industry whose back offices couldn't handle trading volume of 10 million shares a day without expanded hours now breezes through 600 million shares a day and more.
After two companies combine, "you can have two excellent people but you only need one excellent person to do the job," said Vincent T. Pica 2d, a senior official at Prudential Securities. He said Prudential had upgraded its staff by hiring people displaced by mergers.
Still, employment at member firms of the New York Stock Exchange keeps climbing, by 3,384 in the first three months of 1998.
"We're adding pretty much universally," said Sue Weiss, employment vice president at A. G. Edwards & Company, which is based in St. Louis and has 6,352 brokers in 615 offices. She said last week that Edwards expected to add 450 to 550 employees this year.
"The more brokers, the more support they need," Ms. Weiss said. The company has 228 more brokers than it did a year ago.
Despite turmoil in many foreign currencies, officials say that currency trading is one area in which job prospects are probably fading. Mergers are one reason, but even more important is the scheduled introduction in January of the euro, the European currency.
"Lots of firms have shut down their New York trading operation" to leave the field to better-equipped giants, Mr. Sullivan said. "There will be less business across the board -- you're literally eliminating 11 currencies."

Tenants vs. Landlord on Park Ave.

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
In 1994, shortly after the 13-story building at 823 Park Avenue, near 75th Street, was sold to a developer, Robert Manocherian, tenants of its rent-regulated apartments received notices that he had applied to the state for permission to demolish and rebuild the building's interior. Since then, he has refused to renew the leases on their apartments, whose rents range from $500 to $1,500 a month, far below the market rate for one of the city's most desirable neighborhoods. When Mr. Manocherian took over the building, about 10 of its 37 apartments were vacant, and the number of vacancies has increased to 17, tenants say.
In his demolition application to the State Department of Housing and Community Renewal, Mr. Manocherian, who bought the building from the city after its previous owner had defaulted on property taxes, claims that it is unprofitable. The state may grant a demolition permit and permission to terminate leases if a landlord proves that his building yields a profit of less than 8.5 percent of its assessed value and promises that the rebuilt structure will contain 20 percent more apartments. 
 The tenants, many of whom are elderly, and their lawyer, David Rozenholc, accuse Mr. Manocherian, who owns many properties in Manhattan, of harassing and essentially evicting them so that he can gut the building and construct luxury units. Mr. Rozenholc said harassment had included taking away basement storage space and making unannounced visits to apartments. He said Mr. Manocherian has purposely minimized his profit by leaving apartments vacant and refusing to charge annual rent increases. Once the interior is demolished, he said, the developer would scrap plans for more and smaller apartments. "All this money to build studio apartments on Park Avenue?" Mr. Rozenholc asked. "It makes no real estate sense."
The lawyer claimed that if tenants must give up their apartments, many will be physically and financially unable to find new housing. "It's a building on Park Avenue," he said, "but it's not a Park Avenue building. These people don't have millions stashed away."
Mercia Bross, who has lived at 823 Park Avenue for 27 years and whose husband has cancer, said Mr. Manocherian "told me don't even bother painting my apartment because I'd be out soon."
The Department of Housing and Community Renewal is holding weekly hearings on Mr. Manocherian's application, and neither side expects a quick decision.
Mr. Manocherian's lawyer, Gary Rosenberg, said demolition "was always a possibility." And he insisted that the building was unprofitable. "My client would be delighted to provide all tenants with relocation, not on Park Avenue, but comparable housing with D.H.C.R. standards," Mr. Rosenberg said, adding that Mr. Manocherian had not harassed tenants and fully intended to put in at least 20 percent more apartments.
Anne deSanto said losing her rent-regulated ninth-floor apartment, where she has lived since 1943, would probably force her to enter a nursing home and to give up her china and antiques.
"It's too much trouble to find a new place," said Ms. deSanto, a widow and former schoolteacher, who is in her 90's and testified last week at the state hearings.
A spokesman for the State Department of Housing and Community Renewal, Harry Ryttenberg, called the case "very complex," adding, "We have to be very cautious because you have a sizable amount of tenants whose housing's being threatened, and our goal is to create affordable housing, not demolish it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON MARKETTURBULENCE;
Shuffling Retirement Deck Is Easier, but Few Play the Game

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
IN the old days of 401(k) plans, if the market nose-dived the way it did last week, participants who wanted to change their allocations usually had to cool their heels for 30 or even 90 days. Market timing was out of the question.
These days, however, many 401(k) participants can shift assets on the fly, moving money in or out of different categories of stocks and bonds with a single phone call. And they can do so daily if they want, with few restrictions and no penalties or fees. 
 "It's easier than ever for people to switch, and people have more options available," said Tom Schlossberg, president and chief executive of Diversified Investment Advisors in Purchase, N.Y.
Some plans limit the number of times a participant can change their asset allocations to four times a quarter or to once a month. Some also restrict movement in and out of fixed-income investments, to discourage participants from playing interest rates, Mr. Schlossberg said. But the majority of plans allow unlimited changes.
When an investor moves ordinary assets around, capital gains on sales are taxable right away. But gains in 401(k) plans are not taxable until the assets are withdrawn, usually after retirement, so there are significant tax advantages to using 401(k) assets to satisfy any urge to time the market.
While most 401(k) participants now have that opportunity, hardly any are using it.
Ned Burmeister, second vice president of pensions at Principal Financial Group, a 401(k) administration company in Des Moines, offered two possible reasons. Participants are either financially savvy and know they are investing for the long haul, he said, or they are paralyzed by inertia -- not knowing what to do, they do nothing.
During the market gyrations in July, Robert A. Rudell, president of Scudder Kemper Retirement Services in Boston, saw a slight uptick in phone calls, but little shifting of money by its 500,000 participants. "With so little activity in this current market swing," Mr. Rudell said, it shows that "we've done a pretty decent job of education."
In its 401(k) index, which tracks the daily transfers of 1.4 million participants at large companies, Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., has found that fewer than 1 percent move money when the market goes haywire.
Last Thursday, for example, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.19 percent, the transfer activity in the index was normal, at 1.22, with a slight shift of assets into fixed-income investments. By comparison, during the market crash of Oct. 27, 1997, the Hewitt index showed four times its normal activity, at 4.0. But even so, just under 1 percent of the participants made changes that day, transferring two-tenths of 1 percent of their $62 billion in assets from stocks to fixed-income investments.
On July 30, when the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were both up more than 1 percent, the index showed about twice the average activity -- mostly shifts from bonds to stocks -- said Stacy L. Schaus, a Hewitt consultant. The next day, when both stock indexes tumbled nearly 2 percent, the Hewitt index was at 3.20, with a move into fixed-income investments.
The small minority who do such shifting might not be helping themselves, Ms. Schaus said. Jumping to a different asset category on the day of a plunge means that "they're locking in a loss," she said.
Most people do so thinking that they are timing the market, but they often misunderstand a fundamental difference between changing mutual fund allocations and buying or selling stocks directly.
Karnig Durgarian, managing director and chief of Putnam Investments' defined contribution business in Boston, observed that in a typical plan, where the majority of assets are in mutual funds, transactions do not take place until the end of the day. An investor may call at 10 A.M. hoping to get out of a sliding market early, but the assets must still ride out the day before being transferred, he said. And if things look rosier the next morning, a call at sunup to switch back before prices recover will also be futile.
"You think you got back in early?" he said. "You didn't." Instead, the investor has absorbed all of the bad day's losses and missed all of the good day's gains.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Sample Case;
You Fill Up My Census, Even If I Can't Find You

BYLINE: By STEVEN HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"OBSCURED by the debate over whether the Census Bureau should use statistical sampling to supplement the next national head count is a little secret: the "actual enumeration" mandated by the Constitution never really takes place.
In the 2000 census, the bureau wants to count everyone who lives in 90 per cent of the households in each of the country's census tracts -- neighborhoods containing about 1,700 dwellings each -- and use the data gathered from them to estimate the remaining 10 per cent who haven't been located. It would then conduct a nationwide survey of 750,000 households and use the results to adjust the official figure up or down. 
 Opponents of sampling say it offends the Constitution, which mandates an "actual enumeration" of the population every 10 years. Their criticism grew even louder last week after a Federal court in Washington said the Census Bureau's plans for using sampling violated statutes governing how the count is to be conducted. When the opponents of sampling say actual enumeration, they mean just that. "You have to go nose-by-nose, head-by-head, neighborhood-by-neighborhood to count people," said Pete Jeffries, spokesman for Representative Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican.
 
Dream On
Such comments evoke a dreamy past in which clipboard-toting census-takers troop through communities counting people one at a time. But since the first census in 1790, the traditional head count has been conducted in ways that belie that notion.
"There has never been a kind of line-up-everybody operation where the U.S. Marshals or the census enumerators had to actually see the people," said Margo J. Anderson, author of The American Census: A Social History" (Yale University Press, 1988).
Conducted in a country that has always loathed heavy-handed intrusion by its Federal government, the census has instead relied on the word of whoever in the household chooses to provide the information. If that person gives erroneous information, for whatever reasons -- personal, political, economic -- no one tries to verify it.
In 1970, the Census Bureau moved even further away from the original idea when it began to mail out census questionnaires, and generally relied on the information that was sent back. With mail-back forms, there are no government representatives noting evidence -- bicycles stacked on the porch, raincoats hanging in the hall -- that would look the information-giver in the eye and say, "Are you sure you're the only one living here?"
"In a sense, it was a bigger change in census-taking to go from enumerators going to every house to mailed questionnaires than anything we're talking about now," said Barbara Everitt Bryant, Director of the Census Bureau during the Bush Administration. The fall off in the number of households that mail the questionnaires back -- it dropped to 65 per cent in 1990 from 78 per cent in 1970 -- is a prime reason the Census Bureau wants to change its methods. In the 1990 census, counters went back again and again to households that did not send back the form and to households where no one was home when a census taker came calling. In some cases, households were finally contacted as late as August, a major reason why the 1990 Census had an estimated 26 million errors, including people missed, people counted twice and people counted in the wrong place.
 
Not Just Where, but When
Since census tallies are used for allocating seats in the House of Representative and drawing boundaries for legislative districts, the Census Bureau has to find out not just how many people live in a given neighborhood but how many people live there on the same date, April 1 of the census year. Thus, information gathered in August is barely relevant. And if a census-taker never is able to catch up to the occupants of a household at all, he would ask landlords, neighbors, shop-keepers, even people on the street -- measures that are closer to guesses than actual enumeration.
The Census Bureau has even used a form of sampling to help fill in data. In 1970 Census Bureau statisticians sent counters to a sample of houses that were considered vacant and found that a percentage of them were in fact occupied. This data were then used to extrapolate how many people actually lived in the rest of the nation's presumably vacant dwellings. As a result, a million people were added.
Opponents of sampling say, though, that in the past, those were measures of last resort. This is the first time the census deliberately intends not to at least try to count everyone. What's needed, they say, is for the Census Bureau to merely try harder.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT:FOCUS ON MARKET TURBULENCE;
Flying Through Tumult Of Less-Friendly Skies

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IN a market that until recently was obsessed with corporate earnings -- and that now seems obsessed with nearly everything -- few sectors have performed as peculiarly as airline stocks.
Business conditions are extraordinarily good for carriers these days, yet airline stock prices have been in a tailspin for weeks. 
 Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, spent some time late last week, before the outcome of pilot contract negotiations at Northwest Airlines was known, to sort out the conundrum.

Q. Isn't it unusual that airline stocks are getting battered?
 
A. The fundamentals are very strong. We are likely to have record traffic and earnings for all four quarters of 1998. Pricing is good, and fuel prices are at record lows. All of those conditions have made this a very good year.
And yet, since their July highs, the stocks have sold off by more than 20 percent. It seems to me that market sentiment is growing that conditions are as good as they can get and will only get worse.
There were fears that the weak second-quarter gross domestic product number would lead to a real slowdown in the second half. But we are looking for the economy to snap back to more than 3 percent real growth in the last two quarters of the year.
 
Q. Are there other things that investors are not considering as they rush to sell airline stocks?
A. The market seems to be overlooking the fact that interest rates are still low. Traditionally, the up cycle for airline stocks ends when interest rates go up and earnings are disappointing. But interest rates have been steady to lower, and earnings continue to come in as expected or better.
 
Q. Can you give us an example of just how negative investors are at the moment?
 
A. Last month, when American Airlines and Delta announced earnings for the second quarter, both said they would buy back large amounts of stock, a total of more than $1 billion worth.
Stock buybacks in the airline industry are rare because airlines need to spend so much of their cash on new aircraft. And they are doubly rare when the buybacks are of that magnitude. And yet, when they made the announcements, the stocks sold off.
 
Q. What will it take to get a shift in sentiment?
 
A. We have been waiting for the airline group and the market as a whole to stabilize. But until some of the volatility shakes out, it will be difficult for the stocks to mount a sustainable advance.
However, between now and year-end, probably after third-quarter earnings numbers are released, we should get an investible trading rally.
 
Q. What is your outlook for third-quarter earnings?
 
A. Currently, we expect industry earnings will be up about 20 percent in the quarter.
And we are not alone in this regard: The rest of the Street has not lowered any of their earnings estimates. And the companies have been saying that their view of the fundamentals really hasn't changed.
 
Q. Northwest Airlines is one carrier that doesn't seem to have terribly positive fundamentals working in its favor at the moment. They are looking at a major strike, and important Asian routes have been hurt by the economic crisis in the region. The stock is not on your buy list, but you recently gave it an outperform rating. Why?
 
A. Historically, by the time you get to a strike, the bad news is already discounted in the stock. Moreover, times of labor disquiet have usually proved to be a good time to buy a stock.
I think the strike is already priced into Northwest's stock, and I think the Far East is, too.
American Airlines negotiated a contract where costs will go up about 10 percent over the life of the agreement; it was expensive, but the rest of the industry is coming up to where it is.
As long as the economy remains solid, those cost increases in the long run get passed on to the consumer.
 
Q. Are there stocks you like better than Northwest?
 
A. We have outperform ratings on six carriers, including America West, Alaska Airlines and United. And we have strong buy recommendations on American Airlines and Continental Airlines.
 
Q. What makes those two stocks stand out from the crowd?
 
A. American's new computerized reservation system, scheduled to go in place in November, could add upward of $200 million to revenues. Its alliance with U S Airways, were it to go through, would also be beneficial, as would the proposed alliance with British Airways.
Even though much of the turnaround in Continental's fortunes has taken place, we still like the stock. The pending alliance with Northwest should incrementally add to earnings next year.
Continental continues to grow internationally, both across the Atlantic and in Latin America. It is adding new gates in Houston. And its regional jets and commuter flights are a definite opportunity to capture more of the business travel market.
 
Q. Analysts are not supposed to provide advice about which stocks to stay away from. At this point, are there any you would avoid?
 
A. At these prices, there is not much I would stay away from. It is hard to pick a company to short right now.

Thinking Globally, Acting Locally

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
Who would have thought that strife between Hindus and Buddhists and a diplomatic dispute between far-off Asian nations could affect an East Side real estate deal? Apparently no one in city government, until a curious City Council aide looked up the proposed buyer, the Kingdom of Bhutan, and raised concerns about its human rights record.
The episode started with a routine meeting on Aug. 20 of the Manhattan Borough Board, which is made up of Manhattan's 12 community boards, its 10 City Council members and the borough president. Among other things, the board votes on the sale of some city-owned property, in this case, the sale of a five-story, $2.3 million building at 763 First Avenue, at East 41st Street, which Bhutan wants for a new consulate. 
 Four members of the board were set to vote in favor of the sale, which had already been approved by the Economic Development Corporation and was supported by Community Board 6. But they were short of the quorum needed. That is when Steve Simon, an aide to Councilman Stanley E. Michels, rushed in, waving a photocopied page from The New York Times Almanac containing the entry for Bhutan.
"We have to stand up to oppression," Mr. Simon explained later. "The City of New York shouldn't be in the business of selling property to an anti-democratic regime." The board is expected to take up the matter again at its next meeting in September.
Since 1991, in the almanac's account, more than 70,000 refugees of Nepalese and Indian descent have fled Bhutan, a remote mountain nation that borders India and China, following anti-Hindu measures passed by the National Assembly, which the almanac calls a "rubber stamp" for the King. Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist.
As Nepal struggles with a refugee problem, Bhutan's National Assembly passed a resolution in July authorizing the forced retirement of relatives of refugees from civil service, according to Amnesty International, which said in its annual report that last year "at least 150 possible prisoners of conscience were detained, many of them incommunicado, without charge or trial." Many of these prisoners, the group said, "were reportedly tortured or ill treated by law enforcement officers."
An employee at Bhutan's Mission to the United Nations said no one was available to comment.
"We are not saying Bhutan has no right to a consulate in New York," Mr. Simon said. "We're simply saying the government itself should not be selling anything to this repressive regime. It gives them very high-profile legitimacy." DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A Call for 'Auto Choice' and Lower Premiums

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
SPENDING more for auto insurance than on car payments? You're not alone.
Although heightened competition, a fraud crackdown and double-digit returns on insurance companies' investment portfolios have kept premiums in check for the last few years, the high cost of auto insurance remains a hot political issue in traffic-choked states from New Jersey to California. And an unusual coalition of would-be reformers, urban officeholders and partisan Republicans is trying to channel that simmering discontent into the most far-reaching changes in auto coverage in a quarter-century. 
 The advocates' motto is "auto choice," which stands for a set of legal changes based on the idea of cutting premiums by limiting the right to sue for damages. Republican Congressional leaders, eager to seize an issue that touches a populist chord, have vowed to bring to the floor in both houses before the November elections a bill that would require states to adopt the auto-choice approach.
Passage of such legislation -- bitterly opposed by trial lawyers and some consumer groups -- would seem unlikely this fall. But hardly anything about the plan, which supporters say would save drivers some $40 billion annually, is following the conventional script.
For example, insurance companies are divided on auto choice, even though they might be expected to stand behind any proposal that clipped the wings of their nemesis, the trial bar. Support for the plan, meanwhile, has come from such disparate political players as the conservative United States Chamber of Commerce and the pragmatic Mayor of Denver, Wellington E. Webb.
The roots of auto choice are found in the wreckage of the last great push for change in auto insurance: the no-fault movement of the early 1970's. In jurisdictions that adopted no-fault coverage -- 13 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, plus Puerto Rico -- an accident victim's own insurance company pays claims against medical bills and lost wages (called economic losses) up to the policy limits. That contrasts with the "pure tort" arrangement in most other states, in which the injured must collect from those they say were at fault -- typically, the other driver's insurance company.
When states first adopted no-fault plans, it was widely assumed that lawsuits would become rare and that the chunk of insurance premium dollars swallowed by litigation costs would shrink to almost nothing. In fact, legislation in almost every no-fault state left wide loopholes that permitted lawsuits for a range of non-economic losses.
State no-fault laws routinely make exceptions for deliberately caused injuries, injuries caused by drunken drivers and injuries resulting in death. Many states also permit suits for "loss of bodily function," "serious disfigurement" or "temporary disability" -- all examples of injuries serious enough to meet a legal standard, the so-called verbal threshold for litigation. Still others set a dollar threshold; when injuries result in medical bills exceeding some minimum, claims can be brought for pain and suffering.
These dollar thresholds have had a particularly perverse effect, according to Michael Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, who champions auto choice: They encourage the injured to spend extra on physicians and chiropractors to meet the legal minimums -- or even to enlist them in fraud. "It's become a rule of thumb that insurers settle claims for three times the medical costs," Mr. Horowitz said.
 WORSE, perhaps, the tort system rarely compensates those who most deserve to be compensated. In a 1991 study of thousands of accidents in pure tort states, the Rand Institute for Civil Justice estimated that injury victims with economic losses exceeding $100,000 received just 9 cents on the dollar in compensation, on average.
And across the spectrum of tort and no-fault states, a remarkable amount of money is spent just to keep the wheels of justice in motion. According to a study this year by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, attorney fees absorbed 28 percent of every premium dollar paid for bodily injury coverage in 1996. Fraudulent claims chewed up an additional 13 percent. And agents' commissions and other overhead expenses devoured 25 percent. That left just 34 percent of premiums for compensating accident victims.
Naturally, no-fault seems to work best in minimizing lawsuits in states that set the toughest thresholds for determining whether an accident victim can go to court -- a requirement, for example, that an accident result in "permanent injury or disability." But even in Michigan, widely regarded as the toughest no-fault state, coverage for bodily injuries remains relatively expensive, because the state mandates that every policy provide unlimited coverage of economic losses.
Auto choice aims to accomplish the initial goal of no-fault -- lower premiums and fewer lawsuits -- by putting a price on the right to sue.
Drivers choosing the basic coverage would receive virtually bulletproof no-fault: They would be permitted to sue for pain and suffering only when contending that the injury was intentional or that the other driver was drunk. (They could also sue in the relatively uncommon circumstance in which tangible economic losses exceeded their "personal injury protection" coverage.)
 On the other hand, drivers who wanted the option to sue for pain and suffering could retain it -- but would pay an additional premium.
The price difference would be substantial. According to Stephen Carroll and Allan Abrahamse, researchers at Rand, the cost of providing bodily injury insurance would be 45 percent less, on average, for drivers who opted for basic coverage. And since personal injury protection represents a bit more than half the cost of auto insurance, the cost of a basic policy under the choice system would fall a bit less than 25 percent -- an average of $184 for each car each year, by the Rand calculations.
But there would be new complications. When a driver with full tort coverage was injured by another with a full tort plan, they would be free, of course, to duke it out in court. And when two drivers with basic coverage were in an accident, there presumably would be no suit. But when a driver with tort coverage was hit by a driver with basic coverage, the injured party would have to sue his own insurance company for pain and suffering. That situation -- which could occur often -- "is terribly complicated," said Bob Pike, general counsel for Allstate, one of the nation's biggest auto insurers, which opposes auto choice.
Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a proponent of auto choice, says the interaction between tort and basic drivers had a Rube Goldberg feel to it. But, he noted, "it's no worse than the problem with uninsured-motorist coverage, where injured parties must collect from their own insurance company."
 CRITICISM of auto choice comes in many stripes. Some is financially motivated, at least in part. In a membership recruitment letter last year, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America called auto choice "an assault on our livelihood."
Other opposition comes from consumer groups that view any limit on the right to sue as a dangerous constraint on the little guy. Without much thought, the vast majority of drivers would give up their rights in return for premium savings, said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader.
Besides, she argued, "drivers who cause grievous harm ought to pay."
Many insurance executives see the whole notion of Federal intervention as the camel's nose under the tent. "How we compensate injury victims should be addressed at the state level," said Mr. Pike of Allstate.
George Priest, a law professor at Yale University, generally sympathizes with initiatives to minimize the cost of settling legal disputes. But he wonders about the justice of auto choice. No-fault plans socialize the cost of accidents, he said, and barriers to suits for pain and suffering reduce the chance of collecting from wrongdoers. Put those together, and auto choice reduces the odds that dangerous drivers will be forced off the road by higher premiums.
 Supporters of auto choice have an answer to each of the objections. To begin with, the state's rights issue is a red herring, argued Mr. O'Connell of the University of Virginia. Under the measure pending in Congress, state legislatures would have the discretion to reject auto choice, while state regulators would have the authority to block its implementation if insurers could not guarantee minimum levels of savings for insured drivers. Indeed, the states' broad discretion to reject or modify auto choice -- included in the bill in order to attract conservatives' votes -- worries some advocates, who remember the process that peppered no-fault insurance with the loopholes that largely nullified its impact.
Supporters also scoff at the idea that auto choice would give a free ride to dangerous drivers. While any no-fault system reduces deterrence of bad driving, Mr. Horowitz argued that the impact would be very modest. "Insurers would still have plenty of reason to charge higher rates to bad drivers," he said, because they are more likely to injure themselves. Besides, he added, drivers who cause injuries could still be sued for economic losses that exceeded the injured person's own coverage.
 However consumers come down on these issues, the potential savings in premiums will win them over, proponents of auto choice say.
They figure that those 25 percent savings in premiums for basic coverage would prove attractive across the board. And the potential savings for two influential groups are even more striking.
Premiums for commercial vehicles would fall by about 28 percent, according to the Joint Economic Committee. Corporations, which now face a disproportionate share of suits for pain and suffering, would enjoy bigger-than-average savings as the number of suits declined; injuries to their own drivers, moreover, are already covered by workmen's compensation.
"It's real simple," said Larry Kraus, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce. "Our three million members would save $8 billion annually."
City dwellers are also in a position to reap exceptional savings from restrictions on suits, because urban accident victims are exceptionally litigious. In Washington, D.C., for instance, auto accident rates fell 22 percent between 1985 and 1995, but the number of lawsuits over auto accidents rose 137 percent, according to the Joint Economic Committee. In 1994, the committee found, people involved in auto accidents in Los Angeles were 2.2 times as likely to claim they were injured as people in the rest of the state. In Philadelphia, the multiple was 3.5; in New York City, 2.7; in Newark, 2.4.
 BY no coincidence, a 1991 survey by Robert Klein, then the director of research for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, showed that the average liability premium was 32 percent higher for drivers in large cities than in other parts of the same states. Hence the support for the overhaul proposals from some big-city politicians. "I favor auto choice for one reason," said Mr. Webb, the Denver Mayor. "My constituents would be a lot better off."
 The numbers help explain the eclectic band of supporters drawn to auto choice. In the Senate, they include Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. Other supporters are Representative James P. Moran of Virginia, a centrist suburban Democrat; Republican Governors Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and John Engler of Michigan; Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York, and past Presidential candidates like Michael S. Dukakis and Steve Forbes.
To deepen this coalition, Republican Congressional leaders say they intend to cast their insurance proposals in populist terms, just in time for the November election. "Auto choice is for the moms and dads who sit at the kitchen table every month with the family checkbook trying to balance the family needs with the family budget," said Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader.
 Two of the biggest auto insurers, USAA and State Farm, support auto choice, on the grounds that it would cut the portion of premium dollars burned up by fraud and litigation. But other major insurance companies are either opposed or are watching from the sidelines.
Trial lawyers are investing heavily in the defeat of auto choice. "We're focusing like a laser beam on this issue," said Richard D. Hailey, the past president of the trial lawyers association.
Hopes for passage rest on a combination of pressure from the Congressional leadership to keep Republicans in line and small-business support drummed up by the Chamber of Commerce. But swing votes will have to come from Democrats.
And legislators might very well feel pressure from their constituents on the topic. While auto insurance is not on voters' minds in much of middle America, it is a volatile issue in densely populated parts of the East and West Coasts. High premiums almost toppled Governor Whitman last year, when her Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, made the cost of auto insurance a centerpiece of his campaign.
 Will Washington politicians remember this episode? That depends on how much consumers care about the issue. "Auto choice would give city residents a much needed break on insurance," said Mr. Moran of Virginia. "The big question is whether they'll get the message and explain their feelings to Congress."

Suppose John and Mary meet the hard way at an intersection: Their cars collide and each driver sustains a mild to moderate injury. Whether they, or more likely their insurance companies, will meet again in court depends on which insurance system is in use in their state. Here is a simplified summary.
 
IN A TORT STATE
Whose insurer pays for the accident depends on who is found to be at fault -- an issue that often must be settled in court. John and Mary may sue each other's insurers for pain and suffering as well as economic losses. They sue their own insurer if the other driver was uninsured.
 
IN A NO-FAULT STATE
John's insurer pays for his economic losses (medical bills and lost wages), and Mary's insurer pays hers, regardless of who is at fault. John could sue Mary, or vice versa, for pain and suffering only if the injuries meet a test of severity or the medical bills exceed a dollar threshold; limits vary from state to state.
 
UNDER AUTO CHOICE
If both John and Mary have chosen full tort coverage, the situation is the same as in a tort state. If both chose the cheaper, "limited" option, the situation is the same as in a no-fault state, except that they can only sue for pain and suffering if the other driver was drunk or deliberately caused harm. If one driver has limited coverage and the other full tort, the full tort driver, only, can sue his or her own insurer for pain and suffering.

"A Patchwork of Effects"
Because current laws and insurance claim patterns differ greatly from state to state, the savings that proponents say would be delivered by a shift to auto choice vary widely. Here are average auto insurance premiums and potential savings under auto choice in all the states, shaded in the map by their current type of insurance system.
 
Tort compensation system (t)
The injured must collect from those who they claim were at fault.
 
No-fault compensation system (n)
An accident victim's own insurance company pays claims against medical bills and lost wages up to the limits of the policy.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Without a Splash, a Tiny Fund Stays Ahead

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHILE many mutual funds spend a lot of their shareholders' money on splashy magazine ads and TV commercials, Meridian Value budgets zero for marketing to investors. "Our philosophy is to focus on investment performance with the idea that good performance will attract assets to the fund," said Kevin C. O'Boyle, the fund's lead manager.
As a marketing strategy, that clearly hasn't worked. Meridian Value, started in 1994, holds a puny $12 million. Throw in the value of stock grants, and that's what some of Mr. O'Boyle's peers take home in a year. 
 But the focus on performance has worked quite well for investors. The fund has returned an average of 20.4 percent annually for the three years ended Thursday, compared with just 10.7 percent for its peers in the small-capitalization value category, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. This year, Meridian Value managed a 2 percent return through Thursday, while its peers lost 13.9 percent.
While Morningstar classifies him as a value manager, Mr. O'Boyle has built his track record at the fund by identifying what he calls "busted growth stocks," shares of fast-growing companies that stumble. He became lead manager in June 1995.
"When a company with a strong balance sheet and a history of generating strong returns from capital fails to meet its earnings estimates for a year, the stock prices tend to decline dramatically," he said. "We find this happens even if the company's three- to five-year business outlook remains strong."
Meridian Value can invest in companies of any size but tends to favor smaller ones; the median market capitalization of the companies in the portfolio is $400 million. Mr. O'Boyle aims to spread the fund's assets evenly among about 40 stocks -- he currently has 38.
He will consider any company in any industry except biotechnology. "Those companies generally have no profit history and often no revenues," he said. "So we have a hard time valuing them."
Otherwise, he looks for companies with rock-solid balance sheets and for industries with strong growth prospects. The fund has more than 14 percent of its assets in retail stocks and hefty amounts in consumer products, telecommunications, health services and technology.
Finding a busted growth stock is one thing, but before he buys, Mr. O'Boyle also identifies a catalyst that will let the company increase its earnings by more than 15 percent a year over the next two years.
One catalyst might be a shift in one or more industry trends. For example, the fund owns shares of Tyson Foods and Sanderson Farms, two poultry processors. This industry suffered from excess capacity for years, Mr. O'Boyle said; shares of Tyson lagged behind the market from 1993 through 1997, while those of Sanderson fell from $19.25 in early 1997 to less than $12 in the fall of that year. But starting last year, consolidation reduced industry capacity, pushing up retail prices; meanwhile, the producers' feed prices declined.
He began buying both stocks last May, Tyson at $20 a share and Sanderson for between $12 and $13. Mr. O'Boyle expects Tyson to earn $1.25 in its 1999 fiscal year; the stock now sells for $17.625, just over 14 times those projected earnings. Sanderson, at $12.25, sells for under 14 times his 1998 fiscal-year earnings estimate of 90 cents a share.
A switch to a more effective business strategy can be a catalyst, too, especially when new competition has beaten down a company's stock. Mr. O'Boyle cited Discount Auto Parts, a do-it-yourself car parts retailer in the Southeast.
The company implemented a "store clustering" strategy, putting many stores close together to fend off competitors like Auto Zone and Pep Boys. The strategy reduced sales at individual stores and cut earnings growth for the company in 1996 and 1997, but sales started picking up earlier this year. The company is also starting a commercial parts delivery service.
Mr. O'Boyle expects Discount Auto to earn $1.90 a share in fiscal year 1999; At $21.50, it trades for just 11 times those projected earnings.
 ANOTHER example is Shoe Carnival, a 100-outlet discount retailer that does business in the Midwest and parts of the South. It more than doubled the number of its stores in 1993 and 1994, but had problems: it sold too many low-margin private-label shoes and struggled with a bloated inventory.
By mid-1996, the company had eliminated its excess inventory by cutting prices and used the resulting cash to pay down debt. The stock traded at $5, just above tangible book value.
But Mr. O'Boyle began buying shares only after Shoe Carnival rolled out a strategy in the second half of 1996 to sell quality-brand shoes at a discount. Sales in the company's established stores began rising shortly thereafter, and Mr. O'Boyle held on, recently adding to his holdings at $11 a share. The stock now trades at $9.25. He expects the company, which trades at just over 11 times his estimate of this year's earnings, to earn 75 cents a share in 1998 and 90 cents a share in 1999.
 Mr. O'Boyle keeps in shape by swimming two miles a day, four days a week after work. "Swimming gives me time to think and relieves the stress from work," he said. He swims competitively with the masters' team at the University of San Francisco.
His proclivity for staying active shows itself on the business side of his life as well. His fund's turnover rate is 144 percent, versus an industry average of about 90 percent. He is quick to dump companies that do not improve their operating results, or whose stock price outstrips their business prospects.
Mr. O'Boyle aims to stay fully invested, but right now, cash makes up a steep 17 percent of the fund.
"I've been having trouble finding companies with prospect of improved operating results because the Asian situation has slowed economic growth and the strong U.S. dollar has slowed export growth," he said. "The economy has been strong in the U.S. for so long that few companies fall into our category of having operating problems for one year."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT:FOCUS ON MARKET TURBULENCE;
Seeing a Powerful Correction, but No Bear Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
BACK in mid-January, the stock market faltered, investors fretted, and Byron R. Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, stepped up to the plate, telling clients that the Dow Jones industrial average, helped by declining interest rates, could hit 9,000 during the first half of the year. It did. But in early August, with the market down sharply from its July 17 high, some people wondered whether to prepare for the next leg of the bull market or to sell. Mr. Wien advised the latter and those who did are glad they did.
On Friday, Mr. Wien shared his opinions about the market turmoil. 

Q. First, what has prompted all this?
 
A. I don't think that Russia, in and of itself, is the factor that has got everybody concerned. It's that Russia is the latest development. What you have is a situation where Europe and the United States were doing well and one by one the rest of the world was getting into trouble.
 
Q. Is there a problem of further contagion?
 
A. The people who are going to be hurt are the people who have lent money to Russia or the people who have had investments there. That's primarily the major German banks and some hedge funds and they've already been hurt. I think the German banks can deal with this and I don't think the hedge funds are a critical economic factor.
 
Q. How is this likely to play out in the United States markets?
 
A. I think we began a topping process in June where the number of stocks performing well was becoming increasingly narrow. Now we're suffering the down side of this enormously favorable first half that we had and my view is that we'll erase all of the gains of this year.
But I don't think we're in a serious bear market because the economic fundamentals of the United States are still quite favorable. The level of employment is still high. Interest rates are low. Housing starts, durable goods orders are still strong. So my belief is that we're going to suffer the worst correction that we've had since October of 1990, but I don't think we're in a bear market.
 
Q. Corporate profits are starting to skid, though.
 
A. One of the factors that could make me wrong is that profits are coming through worse than I and others expected. But they are still positive. In spite of all the things that have happened, the year-over-year profits are still above a year ago. And I think they will be better in the second half than they were in the first half.
 
Q. Is the Dow catching up with the erosion that's been taking place elsewhere?
 
A. Well, I think that the rest of the market, beyond the top 100 stocks in the S.& P. 500, has been hitting a bear market for a while now. More than 60 percent of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were down more than 20 percent as of the end of last week. Stocks like Coca-Cola are beginning to suffer along with the rest of the market. Part of my idea of how this would unwind is that some of these large-capitalization multinationals would suffer along with the rest of the market and that would provide the final flush-out that would end this phase of the decline.
 
Q. Is there some flight to quality?
 
A. There were some high-technology stocks like Microsoft, Dell Computer and Cisco Systems that were certainly doing well. Liquidity is playing a big factor in this market. One, if you're a little uncertain about the market, you want to buy something you'll be able to sell if you change your mind. And, secondly, many mutual funds now have grown to the size where they need large-capitalization stocks to put certain amounts of money to work.
 
Q. How confident are you that shareholders will hang in there if the market continues to sell off?
 
A. I'm not confident at all about that. We've seen a few weeks of poor markets and net redemptions. It's possible if we have another bad week that August could turn out to be a net negative month as far as withdrawals. The last time that happened was in the fall of 1990. This won't be over until there are some mutual fund redemptions.
 
Q. Should investors look for stocks that have held up, or been beaten up?
 
A. If you look at the pattern of the market over the last decade or so you'll see that out of every major correction new leadership has emerged. For example, from 1988 to 1990, large-capitalization stocks did extremely well. Then the market corrected as a result of the Iraq invasion of Kuwait and, coming out of that, small- and medium-capitalization stocks did well. Those are the ones I would focus on when the final bottom is reached.
 
Q. So, is your advice to sit tight or to lighten up?
 
A. My advice has been to sell on the rallies because this is going to get worse. But we're probably two-thirds of the way toward the bottom. And next year is going to be a good year. So, if you have stocks that you have long-term confidence in, I wouldn't sell them at distressed prices here. On the other hand, if you have some marginal holdings, where the fundamentals have changed, and you don't have long-term conviction if the market does rally, I would sell those.
 
Q. And the bond market?
 
A. You do have a flight to quality in the bonds. So you could see long-term rates perhaps go to 5 percent, but my view is that if the economy stays strong and these are stabilized, and the Russian situation doesn't infect the rest of Europe, long-term rates will head higher next year.
 
Q. Are there any particular stocks you would recommend?
 
A. The carnage in the bank stocks has been extreme. The airlines have suffered excessively. Those are the only two.
 
Q. Where will the market end this year?
 
A. My feeling is that the market will end the year plus or minus 5 percent of its starting point.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
One Amway Product Your Aunt Won't Sell

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.

 BODY:
AFTER decades of peddling soap, detergent and toothpaste to Middle America, the Amway Corporation, the direct-marketing juggernaut, wants to clean up in another line of business: mutual funds.
Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments shouldn't be too concerned. Amway's army of more than one million distributors won't be hawking fund shares at neighborhood coffee klatches or at the office water cooler. Nor will they seek to sign up their friends and neighbors to sell the fund in the type of multilevel marketing plan for which the company is famous. 
 For now, at least, Amway distributors are the target buyers, not sellers, of shares of the Amway Mutual fund. "This is not soap, where we market to our distributors and they sell to customers and receive bonuses based on sales," said James J. Rosloniec, an Amway vice president who oversees the company's mutual fund efforts. "But we would like to make the fund more noticeable."
In short, Amway wants its $162 million stock fund to grow and possibly multiply into a family of mutual funds. That, in turn, could let Amway funds expand into corporate retirement plans and, thus, reach more investors outside the Amway family circle.
Amway, whose $7 billion in worldwide sales makes it one of the country's largest privately held companies, is not a newcomer to the mutual fund game. The fund was started in 1971, making it older than 90 percent of all diversified equity funds. And it is by no means a clunker. While it has never finished at the top of the fund rankings, it has rarely strayed far from the middle of the pack of the large-capitalization funds tracked by Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
Over the 10 years ended Thursday, the fund returned an average of 14.6 percent a year, less than the 17.8 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index but ahead of the 13.3 percent of its large-cap value peers.
The fund has remained small, Mr. Rosloniec said, because Amway has never really tried to attract investors. "It was started as a sort of paternal thing on the part of the company's owners, a kind of savings program," he said.
Certain Amway distributors, in addition to receiving an annual cash bonus based on product sales, can also receive a profit-sharing bonus, which is paid in fund shares. In January, for example, Amway bought $14.1 million in fund shares, equivalent to about 10 percent of the fund's assets, which it transferred to distributors as bonuses.
Therefore, while the Amway fund is open to any investor who inquires, Amway employees and distributors own the vast majority of the fund's shares. The largest holder, with 15 percent of the shares, is a partnership and foundation affiliated with Jay Van Andel, one of Amway's two co-founders.
The sales expansion effort, at least initially, is likely to be low-key. "I don't anticipate that we'll be taking out an ad in the newspaper next to Fidelity," Mr. Rosloniec said. Instead, the company is likely to include information about the fund in monthly advertising packages mailed to distributors.
Amway is also looking for a "national marketing organization" to help it expand its reach, Mr. Rosloniec said. In addition, shareholders recently approved several changes intended to make the fund "more marketable," he said. Among other things, they eliminated the fund's 3 percent sales charge and added a continuing distribution, or 12b-1, fee, of 0.25 percent; the fee can be used to compensate financial advisers or others who might eventually sell shares of the fund.
So why would a giant direct marketer use intermediaries to sell its mutual fund? Fund shares, like those of ordinary companies, are securities, and to sell them an individual is required to hold a license -- something that most Amway distributors do not have.
Amway argues that the expansion will bolster the fund's assets, which, through economies of scale, may result in a lower expense ratio. Last year, fund shareholders paid 0.90 percent of assets in expenses, not including the 3 percent sales load. This year, including the 12b-1 fee, they will pay 1.15 percent of assets.
Eventually, Amway hopes to reach even more investors by participating in retirement programs. But to crack that market, the company will probably have to expand its menu of offerings.
"It's probably logical for us to have an array of different types of funds" to serve the retirement market, Mr. Rosloniec said, including a fixed-income fund. Also under consideration is a charitable gift trust, similar to one offered by Fidelity, which allows investors to make charitable donations in the form of appreciated shares of stock.
 THE question of who will manage or be the sub-adviser for any new offerings will depend on the funds' investment objectives. The portfolio of the existing fund is guided by Ark Asset Management, a New York money manager that has served as sub-adviser since 1995. At the end of June, the fund's assets were spread across about 80 stocks, mostly blue chips.
Not among them is Procter & Gamble, which has sued Amway twice, and certain of its distributors at least seven times since the early 1980's, contending that the company encouraged its distributors to spread false statements about the company, including rumors linking Procter & Gamble to Satanism. Amway has denied the accusations, contending that Procter & Gamble has engaged in a false public relations campaign of its own.
Prospective investors should be aware of one key difference between Amway Mutual and the company's nonfinancial products. Unlike, say, Amway's Glister toothpaste, the fund does not come with a money-back guarantee.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: FOCUS ON MARKET TURBULENCE;
The Bear Draws Blood

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
FROM the standpoint of the United States economy, Russia does not matter."
That was the line coming from American stock market optimists until late last week. Their research reports and market comments painted a benign picture of Russian turmoil, at least as it concerned Americans. Of all United States exports, the reasoning went, less than 1 percent were to Russia. The Russian economy was no larger than that of the Netherlands. Few people invested their money there and those who did knew they faced high risks. 
 Investors ignored that logic and panicked anyway.
Russia's financial and political crisis, however removed from the day-to-day business of most American companies and from the portfolios of most investors, prompted the largest one-day selloff of stocks so far this year, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down 357.36 points, or 4.19 percent, on Thursday. A further loss of 114.31 points in a volatile session on Friday left the Dow at 8,051.68, to close the week down 13.8 percent from its peak in July. Most other stock markets also fell, and a flight of capital to the safety of Treasury bonds drove the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to just 5.34 percent.
If the current correction in stock prices turns into a full-scale bear market, meaning a retreat of more than 15 percent in the Dow, historians will almost certainly see Russia as the trigger.
The reason, to use the buzzword of the mid-1990's, is globalization: the ugly version.
The good version was peddled right up until the current crisis erupted. It held that capitalism was spreading through the places where socialism once reigned. Tapping new markets and billions of new consumers, multinationals had already begun to earn big money abroad.
The ugly version is of more recent vintage. It goes like this: Currency crises can zip from one changing economy to the next, spreading deflation around the world and leaving recessions in their wake. No one, not the United States or the International Monetary Fund, has the power, or perhaps the will, to do much about it.
From that perspective, Russia is the latest to succumb to a contagion that first broke out in Thailand in July 1997 and shows no sign of slowing its global march. South Korea has more economic heft. Thailand and Malaysia have more foreign investment. But Russia was a vital experiment in capitalism that until very recently was thought to be too important, politically and militarily, to fail.
"Any one of these countries in isolation is not big potatoes in the world economy," said Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, "but they tell a story about the downside of globalization."
When he served in the Commerce Department during the first Clinton Administration, Mr. Garten was a leading proponent of America's global push. Today, he sees the dark side of the trend. "Nobody ever said that globalization was just a great thing, that it only means economic progress for everyone," he said.
Russia's fall makes clear that capitalism -- floating currencies, open borders and free markets -- cannot exist without institutions to support it, Mr. Garten said. The United States has a Federal Reserve Board to act as a backstop in a bank crisis. The Securities and Exchange Commission serves as a cop for the stock market. Bank deposits are federally insured. Global capitalism has no such bulwarks.
"This is one reason we had a global depression in the 1930's," Mr. Garten said. "No one took responsibility. We have been fooling ourselves that the I.M.F. would act as a lender of last resort. They have not. They failed, in Asia and now in Russia."
Russia's decline also shows the power of global price trends. Some see Russia as having aggravated an already troubling downward spiral of prices, or deflation, that is sweeping the world through ever-cheaper manufactured goods.
Prices for these goods began to tumble in Asia in the mid-1990's. Many countries in that region now have full-scale deflation in consumer prices, a phenomenon not seen on such a scale since the Depression. With the devaluation of the ruble, prices of Russian exports like oil and metals, which were already sagging, are likely to slump further.
Falling prices on a broad scale can be insidious because companies earn steadily less for the products they make and because consumers tend to wait before they buy. But while most economists recognize the evil of deflation, little is being done to stop the spread, said Chen Zhao, a managing editor of Bank Credit Analyst, a research and publishing concern in Montreal.
In fact, real interest rates, which take inflation into account, are at record highs in many countries, as governments and central banks try to defend their currencies against speculators. Shortly after Russia devalued the ruble, for example, Canada and Mexico raised rates to defend their currencies. High real rates slow economic growth and put fresh downward pressure on prices.
"Russia is part of the deflation problem," Mr. Chen said. "We don't think there are any major forces that can put a stop to it." He suggests that the United States Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to reduce the relative appeal of the dollar. But he sees few signs that the Fed is prepared to do so unless domestic economic fundamentals take a turn for the worse. "The U.S. does not comprehend the risk," he said.
So far, Russia's internal problems have had only a marginal effect on earnings of companies in the United States. Republic New York, BankAmerica and Lehman Brothers are three financial institutions that have already acknowledged some Russia-related losses. Several high-risk hedge funds took serious hits and others may follow. Steel companies, paper producers, chemical producers and others dependent on commodity prices are also made vulnerable by Russian deflation.
But if the direct losses are relatively minor, the indirect cost, including the toll on investor psychology, is immeasurably large. Investors have already begun to treat "global" as a bad word.
Until recently, many of the largest companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advertised their world ties, and it was not just hype. Over the last decade, the foreign share of sales of S.& P. 500 companies have risen to 34 percent from 25 percent.
Of Exxon's total sales, 88 percent are foreign, according to I.B.E.S. International; Coca-Cola sells two-thirds of its soft drinks abroad. Motorola is 60 percent foreign. Intel and Dow Chemical both sell more than half of their goods overseas. Because of the turmoil in emerging markets and the strong dollar, which reduces the dollar value of foreign sales, I.B.E.S. now projects that all of those companies' earnings will fall this year. Merrill Lynch downgraded Coca-Cola shares last week, citing emerging-markets woes.
After faring relatively well in the summer selloff, shares of large, internationally oriented companies are getting slaughtered. "Globalization is starting to work against us," said Byron R. Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The international luster is tarnished."
James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a longtime bear, said Russia's woes and the poor short-term outlook for the global economy left Wall Street bulls with little ground to stand on.
"Globalization means the knee bone is connected to the thigh bone," Mr. Grant said. "When there were these great developments abroad, it was a whole new world of opportunity. It could explain some extraordinary valuations of stocks. Then when it's not working, Wall Street decides that the rest of the world doesn't count for much."
The idea that the American market alone can justify stock prices that were once predicated on world expansion is an exercise in wishful thinking, Mr. Grant said. "You could call it rank cynicism or hopeless optimism," he added. "I don't think anyone will believe it."

In the last two weeks, nearly every morning seemed to bring American investors dire headlines about spasms in overseas markets, and every trading day a volatile, turbulent stock market. Put the charts together, and the roller coaster that equity investors rode stands out starkly, with the unhappy twist that the plunges often grew steeper, not tamer, as the ride went on. The Dow Jones industrial average, plotted here at five-minute intervals during each trading day, bounced as high as 8,753.78 and as low as 8,011.52 before closing on Friday at 8,051.68, off 373.32, or 4.43 percent over the two-week period.

HEADLINE: The World: Tribal Rights;
Throughout the Americas, Natives Invoke the Law of Land

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, after initialing the first treaty that his people had ever concluded with Canada's Government, Chief Joseph Gosnell Sr. held the document over the seal whiskers of his regal headdress and shouted, "The Nisga'a canoe has returned."
It was a reference to a trip to the white man's capital taken by his native American ancestors a century ago, and it was a way of saying that the Nisga'a's long journey for recognition within Canada was over. 
 But the Nisga'a in fact have a long way to go, and in that they are little different from other native Americans in Canada, Mexico and the United States. For the treaty, which gives the Nisga'a title to ancestral lands and the right to govern what goes on there, still must be approved by Nisga'a members, the legislature of British Columbia and the federal Parliament. It has already raised objections from other Canadians about the special rights it would give the Nisga'a.
In fact the Nisga'a experience illustrates how much, across all of North America, the original problem that European settlers faced on their arrival in the new world remains largely unresolved. More than 500 years later, Indians continue to demand recognition that they have special rights to live a special way of life by virtue of their having been in North America first.
And this is more than a simple question of granting justice, as the native Americans see it. Even where the political will exists to grant such rights, governments and courts struggle to reconcile the needs of Indian cultures with the concept of equality in the constitutions of all three countries.
It is a little like the basic political problem with affirmative action programs: While the central goal of righting past wrongs enjoys considerable support, the formulas being put forward are under attack because they seem to grant special privileges to some, but not all, citizens.
In Mexico, for example, Indians in the state of Chiapas have taken up arms to force the government to recognize Indian autonomy, but officials worry that doing so too broadly could give Indians rights not available to other Mexicans.
And in the United States, tribes are testing the boundaries of their sovereignty by exploiting their land in ways that might not be tolerated off the reservations.
 
Fear of Precedent
In the Canadian case, opponents object to the treaty because it would allow elections limited by race. So they are preparing to challenge the constitutionality of the Nisga'a treaty before the precedent is followed by dozens of other Indian groups that are also clamoring for self-government.
Despite different histories and vastly unequal populations, these issues all boil down to a demand to control Indian destiny by controlling Indian land.
"What makes Indians Indians is the dream of living on communally held lands," said Jose Barreiro, associate director of the American Indian Program at Cornell University, who has worked and studied Indian groups across the American continent. "The issue of land is very, very strong in all indigenous communities."
The issue of the land itself has been addressed, fairly or not, in treaties or contracts signed over many years. Now the crux of controversy in all three countries is the way Indians live on the land. Although they travel in pick up trucks, wear jeans and use the Internet, many Indians lead lives on their reserves and reservations that are different from the societies around them.
The 2,500 Nisga'a who live on their traditional lands are divided into four bands, which correspond to four villages. Patterns of leadership, land tenancy and even marriage are determined to a large extent by participation in the bands.
Some tribes have their own courts, their own methods of punishment and their own preferred style of elections, which is not always democratic. These patterns have persisted despite ferocious attempts at assimilation through residential schools and laws that banned traditional ceremonies.
 
A Generation of Lawyers
Over the last 30 years, the recognition of basic human rights around the world has exposed injustices in the way Indians are treated. In the United States, the civil rights movement focused attention on Indians, and affirmative action gave a whole generation of Indian students access to universities and law schools. That generation of lawyers is now testing the limits of Indian sovereignty, and the fight for greater independence is sometimes financed by tax-free revenues from gambling operations.
In Canada, the Government is still smarting from a violent confrontation between soldiers and Mohawk Indians in 1990. A report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples last year left no doubt about how badly directed Canada's paternalistic handling of Indians had been. Recent court decisions have upheld Indian claims and even the legal validity of Indian oral histories.
In the United States, Indians in Utah, claiming sovereign powers, caused a panic with their plan to accept nuclear waste.
In Mexico, where there are no reservations, the number of full-blooded Indians is estimated to be around 10 million. Their poverty is as extreme as their marginalization from the rest of society. Much of the current tension can be traced to a constitutional amendment in 1992 that essentially privatized Indian land, which until then had been held by the community. The Government believed it was boosting Indian chances of entering the modern economy but Indians have opposed the change. The Zapatista uprising in Chiapas was based on issues of the land and Indian rights.
In negotiations with the Zapatistas, accords acknowledging Indian autonomy were reached in January, 1996. But the government recoiled at what the negotiators had given away. It was particularly concerned that acknowledging the rights of "the Indian people" as opposed to the more limited concept of "Indian communities," infringed on the sovereignty of Mexico and created two classes of Mexicans.
The Zapatistas prefer to see themselves as part of a global tribe of Indians. "We have helped create, at the side of men and women in the five continents, a great network," the Zapatista leader, Marcos, wrote in the Indians' latest declaration from Chiapas, "a network that is fighting to build a new world."

HEADLINE: The World;
Moscow Dashes American Illusions

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
THE contrast is striking. With Russia on the ropes late last week, American officials were hardly forthcoming on what they might do, offering reporters only the assurance that they were studying the situation and urging the new Russian Government to "stay the course of reform." Regarding President Clinton's planned trip to Moscow this week for a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, a senior official said simply, "We will not hit the ground with a bag of tricks."
Flash back to March 23, 1993. It was Mr. Clinton's first full-dress news conference as President, and Russia was in crisis then too. Mr. Clinton's words were, "We are not bystanders," and, "I intend to go in there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American partnership." 
 The odyssey from full-throated engagement to mournful and bewildered encouragement has been a long and messy one filled more with failure than success. The apparent inertia may be partly a result of distractions like the Monica Lewinsky affair. But for some scholars, like Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian studies at New York University, it is more a direct consequence of what he considers a foolish and self-centered "American crusade to transform Russia into a replica of American democratic capitalism and junior partner in world affairs."
American ideology, he asserts, has "hit the iceberg of Russian reality," so it is no surprise that the policy's proponents have nothing to say now. He says that while he too would like to see Russia democratic and oriented to free markets, the path toward that goal has to be more gradual, more mixed, more genuinely Russian.
What the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko has called "the McDonaldization of Russia" has proved a failure, Mr. Cohen believes.
Marshall I. Goldman, a Russia expert at Harvard University, agrees that American policy has not been the wisest in recent years. But he also says there is little Washington can do.
"When the patient is dying of cancer, you can pray and make him more comfortable, but little else," he said. "We gave the Russians poor and contradictory advice, but even if our advice had been good it would have been awfully difficult to undo 70 years of Communism and cold war without serious repercussions."
Whatever Washington chooses to do in the coming weeks, it appears to be sobered by nearly seven difficult years -- first under President Bush and then under Mr. Clinton -- of trying to shape post-Soviet Russia in its own image.
Actually, there is still considerable debate as to how much the United States has truly invested in Russian reform. There are those who say that Washington has been far too deeply involved, that it has been trying to micromanage a Government and economy that it poorly understands. This has turned the initial Russian love affair with American culture and liberty into an ugly, reactionary anti-Americanism.
Proponents of this view point to the legions of Americans sent swarming through the Kremlin and Russian industry to proffer advice, insist on painful "shock therapy" and even demand that certain candidates fill key government jobs. While the Russian people suffered, American advisers urged patience.
There are others who say the problem has not been undue American involvement in Russia but rather shortsighted disengagement -- both materially and politically. They say Washington may have talked a great deal about aid, but it never really spent the kind of money needed to bail out and stabilize a nation that, after all, occupies the largest land mass of any country in the world, has thousands of nuclear missiles and sees itself as a great power.
"We have given material aid only in small amounts," said Padma Desai, a professor of economics at Columbia University. "We spent billions fighting Communism but once the Soviet Union collapsed we were very selective in material help."
Former Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Operations, summed up a prevailing American view on policy toward Moscow when in June 1991, six months before the Soviet Union collapsed, he said: "We now have the opportunity to participate in the most fundamental change in a major society in the 20th century and to help shape that society in a way that will give us an opportunity to minimize our defense expenditures."
Shortly thereafter, when the Soviet Union was collapsing, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d organized Operation Provide Hope, which sent hundreds of tons of food to the fracturing empire.
For some analysts at the time, this was woefully insufficient. Former President Nixon circulated a memorandum in March 1992 accusing President Bush of failing to recognize the significance of the opportunity before him.
"The stakes are high and we are playing as if it were a penny-ante game," Nixon wrote. "The hot-button issue in the 1950's was 'Who lost China?' If Yeltsin goes down, the question 'Who lost Russia?' will be an infinitely more devastating issue in the 1990's."
Anders Aslund, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, argues that it was Mr. Bush, in fact, who lost Russia.
"The big mistake was when the Bush Administration did not support Russian reforms in 1991 and 1992," he said. "They were in a total financial mess and they tried to do all the right things. The United States didn't provide them with a cent. Instead they held this conference on humanitarian aid like they were discussing Sudan or something."
Asked why such a course was chosen, Mr. Aslund speculated that "Bush thought that to win re-election in November he could not be seen helping other countries."
Others assert that Mr. Clinton has been too doggedly pro-Yeltsin, supporting the Russian leader when he had the military storm the Parliament in 1993, bombed and attacked the breakaway republic of Chechnya and drafted what some consider an authoritarian constitution. They say Mr. Clinton's support rendered American talk of freedom and democracy hollow and paved the way for reactionary forces to rise again. This was worsened, according to this line of thinking, by American insistence on expanding NATO to include Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, thereby adding to Russia's sense of isolation.
Most scholars, however, say the question of who lost Russia is the wrong one, first because it is not yet lost and second because Russia's future does not depend wholly on American policy. Moreover, no one really knows what it means for a major nuclear power "to go under." Russia's sheer size and remaining military might mean that the United States will always feel the need for involvement.
There is, however, a sentiment emerging that Russia may have to be dealt with more on its own terms. There are differences over NATO, Bosnia, Iran and Iraq but they should be seen as reflecting differing interests and histories rather than as disobedience by a junior partner. If the path to a market economy includes temporary price controls or some level of state industry for a while, that does not have to augur a return to Communism, some scholars insist.
"Much has been accomplished so far," said Professor Desai of Columbia. "The army has been cut from 4 million to 1.5 million, defense expenditure is down, assets are freed, trading is open. The issue now is how much of this can be retained.
"What policy modifications are we willing to make? Are we still singing the same old pure-market tune? People are suffering. We can't just say, 'Take the consequences.' Russia still matters. It always will."

It's a Bad Time for Weak Leadership

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IT is sometimes said that extraordinary times produce extraordinary leaders. But if so, where are they?
Many experts in foreign affairs worry about what they see as a perilous combination of Brobdingnagian challenges to international stability and Lilliputian authority among the political leaders tackling them. 
 With the Asian meltdown spreading to Russia and undermining Europe, China and Latin America, some experts fret about the risk of a severe global downturn, perhaps another depression, with incalculable political and military risks. But just as the threats to world order seem unusually grave and complex, leaders in major capitals appear unusually enfeebled.
"Today we are on the verge of massive international dislocations, which may have started in one country, Thailand, but have created the real prospect of global financial instability," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management. "The reason this is potentially calamitous is that no one is in charge."
That is something that President Clinton might discuss with President Boris N. Yeltsin at their summit meeting in Moscow this week. But the metaphor of a summit seems inappropriately robust; these days the most fitting location for any meeting of the Group of Eight industrialized nations might be a hospital ward, where presidents could compare scars and take bets on who will survive longest.
Mr. Clinton is so hobbled by scandal that he cannot even launch missiles against alleged Afghan-based Arab terrorists -- against whom it would normally take about two seconds to build a domestic consensus to bomb -- without widespread doubts that the missiles weren't at least in part an attempt to change the subject. In Moscow, the uncertainty is not whether Mr. Yeltsin will run again in 2000 (he said last week he wouldn't), but whether he can even finish his present term. In Germany, which has much at risk in Russia's moribund economy, Helmut Kohl may be unseated in elections next month after 16 years as Chancellor of Europe's powerhouse.
 
Limping Along
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is limping along in his first weeks in office, looking a bit dazed and struggling to show some national leadership for the first time in his 35 years in Parliament. Even in China, President Jiang Zemin has been humbled by severe floods and by an economy that has been slowing ineluctably. The only major figure who has sustained his authority is Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and he has been distracted by the turmoil in Northern Ireland.
"Domestic, social and economic forces are overwhelming political leaders everywhere," warned Michel Oksenberg, an international relations expert at Stanford University. Professor Oksenberg argues that the challenges to international order can be addressed only at the political level, and that there is no correcting mechanism -- say, global market forces -- that will insure that everything works out well in the end.
"I don't think the world is on auto-pilot," he said. "If so, I'd hate to say where the plane is headed."
Of course, it is difficult to argue that the threats to the global economic order today are more serious than the risk of nuclear annihilation during the cold war.
Yet except for periods like the Cuban missile crisis, back then there at least seemed to be a predictability to international events, some notion of what might happen if the world did not explode into a fireball. These days, it seems more likely that there will be a tomorrow, but less clear what it will look like.
Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist, published a famous essay in 1989 arguing that the collapse of Communism marked "the end of history." The great debates that had animated history, he suggested in that essay and in a subsequent book, had been resolved. But now he has fresh doubts.
"The past few months have been really the first time since the beginning of the decade that I felt that I could really be proven wrong in the argument that I laid out in 'The End of History,' " Professor Fukuyama mused in a telephone interview.
"There are two things on the horizon that I think are really quite scary: that the Asian crisis could broaden into a global depression, in which case all bets are off about everything; and essentially that Russia could fail in its attempt to Westernize and go backward seriously," he added. "Both of those may really develop."
A third and related challenge, one that many experts cite as requiring concentrated efforts by the world's leaders, is the threat of proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. Recent events are not encouraging. The longest-serving American arms inspector in Iraq quit in protest last week, saying the Clinton Administration was unwilling to force Baghdad to reveal its hidden weapons programs and was instead engaging in a charade. Some analysts suggest that India may have been successful in surprising the world with its nuclear tests this spring in part because officials were not paying enough attention. And experts also worry about Pakistan as its joins Russia on the list of nuclear powers with disintegrating economies.
What should the world's leaders be doing about these challenges? The answers vary, although everyone agrees that the first priority for people like Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Obuchi is to stop the self-inflicted injuries that are threatening international stability. Mr. Yeltsin's withdrawal from day-to-day decision-making and his firing of his Prime Minister and economic team a few days ago have worsened the collapse of the ruble, and Mr. Obuchi is so weak that six bills vital to Japan's economic restructuring program are stuck in Parliament, aggravating the Asian crisis.
 
I.M.F. Impasse
As for the United States, its economy is the envy of the world, but President Clinton has been unable to wrest money from Congress to replenish the International Monetary Fund. There remains a vigorous debate within America about whether the I.M.F. has done more harm than good, but many foreign officials say that Mr. Clinton's failure to deliver the money has limited the fund's ability to combat the crisis in Russia and has, more broadly, added to the unease in global markets. Already, some analysts are blaming Mr. Kohl and Mr. Clinton for not having done more to bail out Russia when its reformist economic team was still in power.
Moreover, many Government officials worry that if the United States economy falters, President Clinton will be too weakened to resist protectionist pressures from Congress.
The wavering and weakness among major leaders now contrasts with other moments of international crisis, like World War II and its aftermath. Figures like Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt commanded enormous authority once the allies faced up to the threats posed by expansionist Germany and Japan. And even a seemingly weak president like Harry S. Truman, dealing with a Republican Congress, managed an extraordinary agenda, including the formation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the Berlin airlift and the Bretton Woods economic system.
Mr. Garten of Yale argues that crucial differences from that era are a narrower perspective today and an inattention to political risks that arise from economic instability. The linkage was more obvious to people like Truman, who had just fought a world war intimately connected to the Great Depression: Hitler emerged from the economic collapse of Weimar Germany and Japanese militarists seized power in the chaos and misery of the Showa Depression.
"After World War II, leaders recognized that ultimately economic problems were political and security problems," Mr. Garten said. "They saw that right away."
He added that "people today are far too technical in their approach" to global economic instability. "They don't see the connection."
More broadly, there are apparently several reasons why strong political leaders are scarce today. Some of those reasons may be more profound than quirks like the strong libido of one president in Washington and the weak heart of another in Moscow.
"You can deride the personalities involved, but I think something much more fundamental is going on," said Professor Oksenberg.
International public opinion surveys, for example, have shown declining confidence in government in recent years not just in the United States but also in Canada and most of Europe. Bipartisanship on foreign affairs has faded. Journalism has become more aggressive and cynical as commentary has expanded with the technological capacity to deliver it.
Improvements in technology and communications have also cost political leaders their monopolies on information and weaponry, arguably empowering citizens and terrorists at the expense of presidents. The private sector has gained prestige and self-confidence, emerging as a rival force to guide policy -- which may be a good thing at a time when "political leadership" seems an oxymoron.
 
Market Discipline
"If there's a saving grace, a force that could compensate for weak political leadership, it's business," said M.Y. Yoshino, a professor at Harvard Business School. "Still, that can't compensate enough. What can you do when the ruble devalues 10 percent overnight?"
In some sense, globalization and the huge pools of capital that now slosh violently around the world, searching for the highest return, have taken over a measure of the leadership that once was demonstrated by national leaders. These oceans of capital now set the international agenda and overwhelm the modest sums in the accounts of central banks. The capital is beyond the reach of any state.
Still, the forces of globalization, however fickle, at times function as a useful force to guide economic policy. Above all, there is the discipline of capital markets, which are a powerful force for prudence. Whenever Mr. Obuchi equivocates about tackling Japan's bad loan problem, Tokyo stocks tumble and force him to be more direct. Likewise, the fear of being blamed for a market crash is a major incentive for both Mr. Clinton and Congress to avoid protectionist legislation.
But the bond market is no substitute for a leader. Japan, more than any country, demonstrates that economies still require dynamic politicians to forge a national consensus and set a country's course. For Japan, in microcosm, has been something like the world today: a place of powerful markets and puny leadership. If it is a sign of what is to come, it is not auspicious, for it is a country of enormous strengths that for eight years has stagnated and drifted without anyone at the helm.
"We have a set of challenges today that are out of the ordinary," said Charles E. Morrison, president of the East-West Center in Hawaii. "It's not a happy picture, because you need someone to push the agenda along, and it's not going to come from weak political leadership."

HEADLINE: Let's Not Panic -- Yet

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman; Paul Krugman is an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Could the current craziness in world financial markets translate into a global slump, maybe even a new Great Depression? Of course it could. The story might go something like this: Over the next few weeks, investors, made jittery by the debacle in Russia, stage runs on the currencies of many third world countries. The governments of these countries respond by raising interest rates to 30, 50, 70 percent -- stabilizing their currencies but pushing their corporations into bankruptcy, provoking devastating bank runs and plunging their economies into deep recession.
Meanwhile, Japanese lawmakers are unable to agree on a plan to rescue the nation's dysfunctional banking system. The result is a sharp drop in the yen, but Japan's central bank, declaring that a strong yen is essential, defends the currency with higher interest rates, which sends Japanese industry into a tailspin. 
 The direct effects of these developments on the United States and the European Union are relatively small. But the dismal news undermines the euphoria that had driven Western stock prices to hard-to-justify heights. As stocks fall, so does the consumer spending that had offset the drag from Asia's collapse.
Despite all this, the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank are reluctant to cut interest rates. The Fed believes that the stock crash validates its earlier warnings that the market was driven by "irrational exuberance" and -- like the Bank of Japan in the early 1990's -- welcomes the bursting of the financial bubble. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank -- which will hand over the monetary reins to the new European Central Bank in only a few months -- wants its successor to understand the importance of sound money and stable prices, and is unwilling to blur that message with any hasty reflationary moves.
Within a year or two, of course, it becomes clear that everyone has been far too cautious, and many countries start trying to boost spending any way they can. But it is too late: self-fulfilling pessimism has become so deeply embedded in the private sector that even zero interest rates and large tax cuts are not enough to get the world economy moving again.
I hope you don't regard this scenario as a literal prediction of what is going to happen. For one thing, real crises never play out according to the expected script. Anyway, this scenario, or any similar scenario, is not all that persuasive. It requires not only that world financial markets be governed by Murphy's Law -- that everything that could go wrong does -- but also that all of the major policy makers play right into Murphy's hands. The odds are that at least a few things will go right, that Japan will pass a halfway decent bank reform law, that the markets will take a deep breath and realize that Brazil and Russia are, after all, rather different places.
Even if financial markets do continue to tumble, Alan Greenspan and his counterparts in other advanced countries have the tools they need to prevent paper losses from turning into a slump in real output. Mr. Greenspan turned a stock market crash into a real-economy non-event in 1987; he can do it again.
But will he? That's where I start to worry. The real risk to the world economy comes not from bad fundamentals but from rigid ideologies -- ideologies that might make policy makers fail to respond, or even move the wrong way, if a global slump starts to develop.
One of those ideologies is the belief that a strong currency means a strong economy, that stable prices insure prosperity. Notice that my scenario had the Bank of Japan actually raising interest rates in a recession in order to defend the yen, and the Bundesbank refusing to cut rates because it doesn't want to encourage laxity in its successors.
Both actions would be deeply foolish. Alas, given the strong-yen rhetoric of Japan and the stable-price rhetoric of Germany, both are also quite plausible. In his classic book "Golden Fetters," Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, showed that the spread of the Great Depression was, more than anything else, caused by the dogged determination of many nations to remain on the gold standard at all costs. Nobody is on the gold standard these days, but the urge to defend monetary purity, never mind the real economy, remains.
The other ideology might be summarized as "blaming the victim." Just listen to what one now hears about Asia: that it shouldn't even attempt a quick recovery through monetary and fiscal expansion, because it will only delay the correction of deeper structural problems. This admonition sounds like an eerie echo of the famous advice that Herbert Hoover received from Andrew Mellon: "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate . . . purge the rottenness out of the system."
It is easy to imagine that effective action against a slump might come too little, too late, because the initial stages of that slump are regarded not as danger signs but as just punishment for economic sins.
In the end, a global slump is quite an easy thing to prevent. The only way it can happen is if the people who have the power to prevent it fail to take the risk of such a slump seriously, and continue to cling to ideologies inherited from a more benign era. If Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues have an appropriate degree of nervousness -- if they understand that while a replay of 1929 is unlikely, it is possible -- then everything will be more or less all right. The only thing we need to fear is the lack of fear itself.

HEADLINE: Oh, Those Beltway Innocents

BYLINE: By Alan Wolfe; Alan Wolfe, a sociology professor at Boston University, is the author, most recently, of "One Nation, After All."

 BODY:
It seems as if everyone outside of Washington is saying that they want the controversy over Bill Clinton's sexual infidelities to end. And it seems that everyone inside Washington is doing everything to insure that the controversy never will.
Beltway insiders say that they must guard against abuses of Presidential power. The polls, however, show Americans in a different frame of mind -- they want the President to apologize for his lies, and then they want the country to move on. And in this desire, they show that they have a different, and more correct, definition of what the word leadership means. 
 It all starts with the President's speech on Aug. 17. Though the appearance lasted less than five minutes, the President gave two speeches that day. One, addressed to the American people, called for an end to the controversy. The other, invoking a legalistic defense and launching a partisan offensive against Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, was an open invitation to Washington's elites to continue the debate. If the price of ending the controversy was to show contrition or admit guilt, then Mr. Clinton was unwilling to do either. On Friday, he made another nonapology. As he has done so often, the President has chosen not the decent course of action but the dangerous one.
The fallout has been tremendous. This week, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who in February publicly acknowledged having had an extramarital affair of his own, urged the President to speak more frankly with the American people.
Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who is nursing Presidential ambitions, has openly discussed the possibility that Mr. Clinton will face impeachment. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a politician for more than 20 years now, said last week that her faith in the President's credibility had been "badly shattered." Why? Because back in January he had looked into her eyes and sworn there was nothing to the Lewinsky story.
Republicans seem equally determined not to put this unseemly business to rest. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma has called for his colleagues "to put aside the public opinion polls and remember their ultimate duty to protect the Constitution and preserve the rule of law."
This sounds impressive until one realizes that Republicans are making political calculations of their own -- both for this November and in the year 2000. They might be better served if they adopted the so-called Aiken strategy, named for the Republican Senator from Vermont who in 1966 offered this advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson on Vietnam: Declare victory and get out. Or Republicans could recognize that the President has won this round and follow the classic political adage that when you lose, it is better to change the subject.
There are times when Beltway insiders are out of sync with the American people because they have not yet learned what the American people think. This is not one of them. All of official Washington knows that the public has had enough, yet all of official Washington cannot let go.
No doubt from the point of view of Republicans and Democrats, the country deserves some accountability from President Clinton. But the public recognizes that their criticism also springs from personal ambition and longstanding ideological grievances.
Here is the rare case where the public is more in tune with Realpolitik than the politicians. Appeals to principle and claims of aggrieved innocence, coming from seasoned politicians, perpetuate the unreality of the whole scandal, as if the American people had expressed a desire to be led by saints.
Still, the public's desire goes unheeded. Had the President only followed public opinion and said he was sorry, had his fellow Democrats kept their mouths shut and had the Republicans also followed public opinion and settled for Mr. Clinton's begrudging admission of guilt, the country might now be able to turn its full attention to the collapse of the Russian economy or the crisis of international terrorism. True leadership would recognize issues that are important, and those that are better put to rest.
What we are witnessing is not leadership but what the French call immobilism: a political system so gridlocked by faction and personal animosity that all sides can appeal to the higher ground with full confidence that nothing will ever get done. The unwillingness of our elected officials to get serious about reality landed us into this Lewinsky mess in the first place. Now they are doing their best, it seems, to keep us there for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: Vote Today In Panama Could Affect Canal's Fate

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Officially, only the destiny of President Ernesto Perez Balladares will be decided when people vote Sunday on a proposal that would amend the Constitution here and allow him to seek a second consecutive term. But the future of the Panama Canal may also be at stake, and so the campaign here has turned extraordinarily ferocious.
If voters grant Mr. Perez Balladares, once part of the inner circle of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, permission to run again, his next objective would be to win the presidential election scheduled for May. That would guarantee him another five years in office and give him full sway over the canal when the United States yields control of the waterway and the remaining military bases around it on Dec. 31, 1999. 
 As a result, the vote has engaged the passions of Panamanians more than any matter since the American invasion in 1989 that overthrew General Noriega.
Gerardo Gonzalez, president of both the governing party and the Congress, has compared advocates of the "no" position to "cockroaches and scorpions." Opponents of Mr. Perez Balladares, whose nickname is El Toro, have portrayed him variously as Pinocchio and a dead bull hanging from a meat hook.
Mr. Perez Balladares said this week that he was "not animated by any personal ambition other than that of completing a task undertaken that is already beginning to show results."
His goals in a second term, he added, would be to "reduce poverty, relieve unemployment and create the conditions that will permit all Panamanians to assume united responsibility for the efficient administration of the canal" when the United States hands it over.
But it is precisely the prospect of seeing the canal in the hands of Mr. Perez Balladares and his Democratic Revolutionary Party that alarms the opposition here. They worry that a crude power grab is already under way, and fear that its ratification would reduce international confidence in Panama's ability to run the canal, which is the backbone of the country's economy.
Given the opportunity last year to name directors to the Panama Canal Authority, which will oversee the canal's administration beginning in 2000, Mr. Perez Balladares appointed relatives, business partners and party loyalists instead of the broad-based nonpartisan board he had promised. There have also been suggestions by his supporters that some canal functions could be "privatized" after the waterway passes to Panamanian hands.
"At this moment, nothing is more important than the administration of the Panama Canal," Joaquin J. Vallarino, one of the country's most influential businessmen and a leader of the "no" movement, said in an interview here. "Without a new government, once the Americans leave, he can continue with what he already has: total and absolute control of the board of directors and the operations of the canal."
The principle that a sitting President not be allowed to succeed himself has been embedded in law here since Theodore Roosevelt engineered the country's separation from Colombia nearly a century ago in order to build the Panama Canal. The country's current Constitution, which went into effect in 1972, permits a President to run for a second term, but only after he has been out of office for 10 years.
Mr. Perez Balladares, who was elected in 1994 despite winning barely a third of the vote, has urged voters to consider only the constitutional issues involved and not to make the referendum a judgment on his performance in office. "If you are unhappy with my Government, the time to hand me the bill is in 1999, not now," he said this week.
Some opposition to his plan has emerged even within the governing party, led by potential candidates who would see their own aspirations for the presidency delayed for five years or more if Mr. Perez Balladares is given a chance to run again. But much of the party rank and file appears solidly behind him.
"Ours is the party that signed the treaty with Carter that recovered our sovereignty, so we deserve to be the ones who receive the canal," said Vicente Palacios, 41, a painter. "It's the same as if you're watching a good program on television: you want to keep it on, not change the channel."
The official American position is one of neutrality, but the governing party's decision to hire James Carville, one of President Clinton's closest political associates, as their main campaign adviser has set off much speculation. Party leaders were not available to discuss the choice, but opposition figures suggested that Mr. Perez Balladares was hoping to convey the false impression that the Clinton Administration secretly favors a second term for him.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Retreat Not Expected to Spoil Budget Surplus

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
While booming stock prices contributed importantly to the Government's now-certain budget surplus for 1998 -- the first in almost 30 years -- the market's recent swoon poses little threat so far to the nation's hard-won return to fiscal integrity.
Indeed, economists and budget specialists say, the many investors who frantically or more deliberately decided to cash in some stock winnings will swell the surplus even further, at least for a while. 
 "As people are pulling out, they're having to take capital gains that have been built up," said James Glassman, managing director of Chase Securities in New York.
Reflecting the job and wage gains of a surging economy as well as soaring stock prices, the Government has repeatedly scrambled to raise its budgetary sights, with the Congressional Budget Office now projecting that Federal revenue will exceed spending by $63 billion for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
The Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton White House have pounced on this largely unforeseen surplus -- the Administration's first estimate early last year was for a deficit of $121 billion -- to press, respectively, for tax cuts or for partial mending of Social Security, among other programs.
After the Congressional Budget Office in July more than doubled its projection of the surplus over the next 10 years, Republicans said the Government could afford to do both.
But analysts say the additional revenue resulting from months of cashing in stock profits -- most issues retreated well before the August dive of blue chips -- will only marginally affect the budget debate unless the stock market drops enough to help tip the now-slowing economy into recession. This is a prospect that has become less remote in recent weeks, but is still considered unlikely.
"I don't think this correction is going to have any measurable impact on the rate of economic growth," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton, Conn., who served in the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan Administration.
When recessions do occur -- the latest being a mild, eight-month one that ended in 1991 -- they shrink revenue and raise spending for unemployment and other benefits.
And while stock prices have been designated an official predictive indicator of the economy's course, recessions have sometimes humbled the most sophisticated forecasters. In the summer of 1990, for example, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he saw no recession on the horizon, but it turned out that the economy had already entered one.
Kenneth J. Kies, a former staff chief at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and now a managing partner at Price WaterhouseCoopers, said the market would have a minimal effect on the budget unless the market dropped enough to force the Government to cut back its long-term projections for economic growth.
But Mr. Kies also said that shrinking stock values and the lower tax receipts associated with them would allow Republicans in Congress to argue that it would be less costly to make further cuts in the tax bite on capital gains and on estates.
In a somewhat perverse twist, Mr. Kudlow contended that one largely unrecognized factor in the current meltdown of stock prices was the enactment this summer of a reduction in the holding period for preferential capital gains tax treatment, to 12 months from 18 months.
Robert D. Reischauer, who headed the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995, said the Government would probably enjoy a temporary, modest rise in taxes from capital gains, but the amount could not be quantified. "It's a difficult call," he said, "because a lot depends on who's selling" -- the combination of small investors with years of profit buildup and professionals bailing out of recently established losing positions.
Mr. Reischauer, who is now with the Brookings Institution, said the impact of current developments would depend not only on how far the stock market fell but also on whether, for example, corporate profits faltered badly or instability in Russia and elsewhere prompted an increase in the military budget.
John H. Makin, a budget specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the current wave of selling would bring the Treasury no more than an extra $10 billion of tax for the year, and that the market's condition would have to become more acute to justify worry about revenue shortfalls.
"It would take a very large move that would raise other issues than the budget to have a noticeable impact" on the nation's newly restored fiscal health, he said.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: STRATEGIES;
Dear Mr. President: What to Do in Moscow

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Henry A. Kissinger says that if President Clinton backed out of the summit meeting in Moscow, it would mean certain political death for Boris Yeltsin.
Brent Scowcroft says that it's a shame that Mr. Clinton scheduled his trip in the first place, but now he must live with the consequences and get on the plane to Moscow on Monday. 
 Colin Powell says that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin will find some way to declare their summit meeting a success -- if the Russian Government doesn't collapse first.
But Zbigniew Brzezinski says that Mr. Clinton should stay home for now.
The four men, all of them former national security advisers, agree that the best sort of summit meeting between Washington and Moscow is a well-rehearsed production combining the right blend of substantive talk, pleasant photographs, warm toasts, inevitable posturing and even a signed agreement or two, all scripted in detail in advance.
After all, taken together, the four have strategized and spun, argued and ad-libbed their way through two decades of summit meetings.
But with Russia gripped by political and economic turmoil on the eve of President Clinton's trip to Moscow, the national security veterans acknowledged in telephone interviews that they cannot recall another summit quite like this. So it is not at all surprising that they do not agree on exactly what Mr. Clinton can or should say, what the outcome will be, or even whether he should go.
"If the President didn't go now it would be the last nail in Yeltsin's coffin," said Mr. Kissinger, who served as both national security adviser and Secretary of State under Richard Nixon. "It would say that the foreign leader who has shown the most consistent confidence in Yeltsin has lost faith in his ability to deliver. I don't want it to be perceived that the final excuse for Yeltsin being dumped is Clinton's withdrawal from him."
But Mr. Kissinger added that Mr. Clinton has no life-support system to take to Mr. Yeltsin or his country. "The President can offer nothing concrete to Yeltsin that I can imagine," Mr. Kissinger said.
Mr. Scowcroft, the national security adviser in the Bush Administration, said that if he were still sitting behind his old desk in the White House, he "would have told the President a few months back: 'Don't schedule that trip. There's nothing either side can get from the trip that makes a meeting worthwhile.' "
But at this point, he added, it's too late. "To cancel it now would be one more blow to Yeltsin," he said.
That doesn't mean the summit meeting is destined to accomplish anything, he added.
"The trouble is that when the two of them sit at a table and look at each other, what are they going to do?" Mr. Scowcroft continued. "You folks in the media are going to have a field day writing about two mortally wounded leaders sitting around trying to figure out how to get back into the good graces of their people. Even if they did reach some agreement, neither one can carry it out."
For Mr. Powell, who served in the Reagan White House as national security adviser and as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton, serious work could go a long way in helping to justify the summit meeting and make both leaders look good.
"This is not the time to look for nice photo ops and the theatrics and visuals that we used to work so hard for at a summit," he said. "This has to be the most businesslike summit ever.
"Summits are usually recoverable. Both leaders always want a successful summit and I'm sure both leaders will claim this one a success."
But Mr. Powell made his prediction with one big caveat -- that "nothing disastrous happens," he said. In other words, that the Russian Government outlasts the summit.
"I'm not hoping for or expecting it," he said. "Yeltsin has shown remarkable political skill at getting himself out of tight spots."
Mr. Scowcroft is not quite so charitable in his assessment of the Russian leader. "Yeltsin quite clearly has periods of dementia," he said. "I don't know how frequently or how long they last. But it's not clear how much Yeltsin is in charge of Yeltsin."
Mr. Kissinger agreed with Mr. Powell's assessment that this was the moment to put an end to summit meetings of backslapping and guffawing. In fact, Mr. Kissinger suggested that Mr. Clinton could seize the opportunity to infuse the relationship with Russia with a more serious tone.
"It would be the beginning of moving our relationship from what I call a psychological one to a political one," Mr. Kissinger said. "In every previous summit there's been a demonstrative camaraderie between the two leaders, an almost playful camaraderie that creates the impression that this is almost like a personal relationship."
Both Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Powell stressed the advantages of casting as wide a net as possible, with meetings for Mr. Clinton with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister; leaders of Russia's Parliament, other political figures and would-be leaders. Such meetings are on the Mr. Clinton's agenda.
"President Clinton should convey to all of them a view of a permanent U.S.-Russian relationship that goes beyond Yeltsin," Mr. Kissinger said. "We should stress that Russia is a potential great power, but that there is nothing we can do if Russia doesn't have a serious reform program."
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a Deputy Secretary and Secretary of State under Mr. Bush, suggested a blunter message than did Mr. Kissinger, his former boss.
"The President should say, 'Listen, the guys who did the reform business really screwed it up,' " Mr. Eagleburger said in a telephone interview. " 'Corruption is awful and if you really want any more help from us you're going to have to prove you're serious.' "
Mr. Eagleburger would also like to see serious talk about arms control, but added that in the current climate, "It's not going to make much difference."
Still, said Mr. Eagleburger: "Clinton should go. Why would he not go?"
Mr. Brzezinski, the national security adviser under Jimmy Carter, the last Democratic President before Mr. Clinton, had an answer for that question. "There is no government and there is no set policy in Russia so what is there to talk about?" Mr. Brzezinski said. "Clinton is not going to save Yeltsin; Clinton is not going to drown Yeltsin. They're both weakened and neither is in control of the situation."
But even as Mr. Brzezinski railed about how weak the current Democrat in the White House is, Mr. Eagleburger, the one-time Secretary of State to a Republican President, wished that Mr. Clinton could be made to look stronger as he heads to Moscow.
"The trouble Clinton is going to have," Mr. Eagleburger said, "and this drives me crazy even when it comes to my own Republicans, is that we talk so much about him weakened that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."

HEADLINE: Chivington Journal;
Effort Grows to Unearth Killing Field of Old West

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CHIVINGTON, Colo.

 BODY:
One historian calls it the American My Lai. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, the lone American Indian in Congress, calls it "one of the most disgraceful moments of American history."
But 134 years after 700 United States Army volunteers stormed through an Indian encampment near here on the Big Sandy Creek, slaughtering scores of women and children, Colorado's killing fields have disappeared into the swirling dust and endless horizons of big sky country. 
 William F. Dawson, a retired judge, says the massacre occurred on what is now part of his ranch. "The killing was all along here, under the trees," Mr. Dawson said recently, surveying a swath of leafy cottonwoods that snaked along the dry bed of Big Sandy Creek.
Pointing to a bluff, he said: "Up there, I found U.S. Army jacket buttons, with the eagles on them. Over there, I found an Indian ax head."
No, says Mike Koury, a military history publisher, this was not the site. "There were 700 soldiers firing rifles, artillery pieces -- cannonballs exploding, bullets flying -- tons of metal should be found at the site, not pounds," Mr. Koury said, noting the paltry number of artifacts found on Mr. Dawson's ranch. "The Indians left behind pots, pans, axes, saws. Your metal detector should go crazy. There is no way that is Sand Creek."
Richard Ellis, a history professor leading an official search for the site of what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre, said, "When we think of battle sites on American soil, this is the only major battlefield we can't find."
New forces are pushing for a solution to this archeological mystery. National politics coupled with Indian desires for recognition of their history are converging on this tiny hamlet in southeastern Colorado, named after John M. Chivington, the Methodist minister turned Army colonel who led the troops in the massacre.
In July, the Senate unanimously passed a bill sponsored by Senator Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne, ordering the National Park Service to find the massacre site, a first step to establishing a "Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site." Within days, a companion bill was introduced in the House by Representative Bob Schaeffer, who represents Colorado's Eastern plains, which includes the massacre site.
In Oklahoma and Montana, the roughly 5,000 Cheyenne and Arapaho descendants of massacre survivors are organizing to lobby for reparations promised in an 1865 treaty.
Mr. Campbell, in explaining the interest, said, "It is clearly one of the darkest pages in Colorado history."
Sand Creek, historians say, explains a cartographic oddity: why eastern Colorado once teemed with Indians but now has no Indian reservation. Studying the killings as ethnic cleansing helps students understand atrocities elsewhere in the world, says Thomas J. Noel, a University of Colorado history professor.
In the spring of 1864, the Cheyenne dog soldiers, an autonomous military wing of the Cheyenne tribe, unleashed bloody attacks on whites in Colorado's eastern plains. They stole horses and mules and butchered cattle. They wiped out wagon trains, burned stagecoach stations and tore down telegraph lines. The economy of the three-year-old Colorado territory ground to a halt as wagon trains with gold-mining equipment could not leave St. Louis. Food prices soared as farmers abandoned crops.
Colonel Chivington, a Civil War hero and Colorado's military commander, called for volunteer "Indian fighters" for 100-day enlistments. On Nov. 29, 1864, the colonel and his volunteers rode deep inside the Arapaho-Cheyenne reservation, where Indians led by the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle had set up camp weeks earlier. A white flag and an American flag flew above the teepee of Black Kettle, whom the colonel had met two months earlier near Denver in inconclusive peace talks. The fact that the Cheyenne dog soldiers were not camped with Black Kettle's group did not stop Colonel Chivington from unleashing his attack.
One reason for Colonel Chivington's deep hatred of Indians was offered recently by his 85-year-old great-great grandson, Laurence E. Riordan, who lives in Denver. In 1861, Mr. Riordan said, a Ute Indian had raped the colonel's 17-year-old daughter in western Colorado.
At Sand Creek, Colonel Chivington exhorted his troops, "Remember our murdered women and children!"
After emptying wagonloads of anti-personnel cannon fire into the village of 125 teepees, according to historical accounts, the soldiers swept up the creek bed, killing every Indian they could find, often hunting down fleeing children. After six hours, about 150 Indians, or one-quarter of the camp's population, lay dead. The soldiers took three prisoners, all children. A dozen soldiers were killed, some apparently by friendly fire in the frenzy.
Coloradans hailed the soldiers, who had mutilated Indian bodies for souvenirs. But news of Sand Creek was poorly received in Washington. President Lincoln replaced Colorado's territorial governor. A Congressional inquiry condemned the battle as a massacre.
"It's a sad feeling that our ancestors were attacked in that manner," Laird Cometsevah, president of the Southern Cheyenne Sand Creek Descendants Association, said from his home in Clinton, Okla. "Black Kettle basically wanted peace for his people. The Cheyenne trusted the non-Indians -- and they were betrayed."
A grandson of a survivor, Mr. Cometsevah testified this summer at Senate hearings on Sand Creek in Denver and Washington. In addition to seeking the reparations of land and horses specified in an 1865 treaty, Mr. Cometsevah wants the site to be identified and protected.
As for the 20th-century archeological mystery here, the Park Service plans this fall to sweep Big Sandy Creek with a new, highly sensitive metal detector that can find objects two feet below ground, double normal depths. In addition, a geomorphologist is to take soil core samples to determine the historical impact of flash floods, whether the creek channel shifted over the last century, and if there is a charred layer of sediment consistent with the burning of the Indian village.
Looking at Mr. Dawson's ranch, skeptics compare the handful of artifacts unearthed to the 7,000 found at the Little Bighorn after a wildfire in 1984 swept over the site of Lieut. Col. George A. Custer's defeat. But Doug Scott, a Park Service archeologist who has worked at both sites, noted differences. Custer's last stand was on a Montana hilltop that was preserved as a memorial three years after the battle. In Sand Creek, fighting was on a flood plain that was later farmed and picked over for souvenirs.
But even if artifacts are sparse here, the pressure is on to find a site.
"There never has been closure for the Cheyenne people," said David F. Halaas, Colorado's chief state historian. "It still is an open wound."
Referring to the massacre of Vietnamese civilians by Army troops, Mr. Halaas said, "Sand Creek was the My Lai of the 19th century."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: IN GERMANY;
Billions of Dollars for Russia Emerging as Issue in Elections

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 29

 BODY:
Locked in a tight national election campaign, German political leaders are coldly reappraising their longstanding willingness to bankroll Russia and to support its President, Boris N. Yeltsin.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the German Government has guaranteed about $30 billion worth of bank loans in Russia, largely to finance construction projects, the sale of heavy machinery and German investments in Russia. Beyond that, the Government has also pumped billions of dollars into development projects. 
 But Helmut Kohl, who has been Germany's Chancellor for 16 years and encouraged the German lending, is now in danger of being ousted by the opposition Social Democratic Party in an election late next month.
Even without electoral pressures, he and other German political and business leaders say it would be foolish to lend more money in Russia until the country carries out reforms.
Though the Russian crisis has yet to surface as a significant issue in the election campaign, the leader of the Social Democratic Party was quick to charge that Mr. Kohl's policies had contributed to the problems.
Oskar Lafontaine, chairman of the Social Democrats, accused Mr. Kohl's Government of being so obsessed with increasing exports to Russia that it had guaranteed billions of dollars' worth of bad loans that would now have be paid with taxpayers' money.
"What have we actually achieved and with what risks?" Mr. Lafontaine asked in a television interview scheduled for broadcast on Sunday. "It would have been better to send German companies in to build a road, a railroad or a power station, instead of just transferring money. We would change that policy."
Mr. Kohl and other political leaders here have also felt a special moral obligation to Russia. A feeling of guilt remains from World War II and Germany's invasion of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
More important, Mr. Kohl continues to feel a powerful gratitude for the role Moscow played in permitting the unification of East and West Germany in 1990. The key to unification was the Russian leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, who allowed Eastern European countries to break away from Communism and indicated to German leaders that a unification of East and West Germany was conceivable.
But faced with Russia's current crisis, Mr. Kohl said today: "We can only help when we know that there is a completely clear program with goals that would assure success. It is in the German interest not to drive our most powerful neighbor in the east into a hopeless situation."
The roots of Germany's involvement in Russia are as much political and historical as they are economic. Russia's sheer proximity to Germany -- a few hundred miles from parts of its eastern border -- makes it an important partner in much the way that Mexico is important to the United States.
Germans import much of their natural gas from Russia, as do many other European countries. And ever since Mr. Yeltsin came to power in 1991, Germany has been eager to expand trade eastward and to tap what it had hoped would be the boom of a newly liberated giant.
Although German banks are by far the heaviest lenders to Russia, bank executives say that most of their lending has been to finance the activities of German companies in Moscow. And even though the perils of doing business in Russia have been well known, banks like Deutsche Bank have pushed ahead to stake out a presence for themselves in Moscow.
Shaken by the magnitude and intractability of the Russian financial crisis, German bankers now argue that extending more credit without major reforms would be throwing good money after bad.
"Nobody should be expecting expanded credits or help from the German side," said Per Fischer, vice president in charge of lending for Russia at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "All steps to reestablish the creditworthiness of the Russian Central Bank and the Russian Government are of priority importance."
Another banker, who did not want to be identified, said the German Government's generosity in guaranteeing loans added to the problems.
"I don't think the German Government didn't fully see the risks involved," he said. "We kept pretending that they were going to carry out the reforms they said they would, and they kept pretending that they would respect our decisions. If ever there was a case of obvious moral hazard, it was there."
Paul Welfens, head of the European Institute for International Economic Relations at the University of Potsdam, said that Germany should have been tougher about insisting on reforms.
"Germany has been extremely generous financially," Mr. Welfens said in an interview with Die Tageszeitung in Berlin. "It would have been much better if Russia had been helped in the development of a law-based government and a functioning system of financial oversight."
Most experts and Government officials are confident that Germany's own economy will not be significantly affected by the Russian crisis. Though Germany is Russia's biggest trading partner, trade with Russia accounts for only about 0.2 percent of the country's total output. Indeed, German trade with Russia is actually less than its trade with Poland or the Czech Republic.
Though Germany's stock market has plunged in the last several days, along with most other exchanges in the world, analysts say the decline reflects a much broader anxiety that stock markets had become overheated and were due for a correction.
"Russia was really the straw that broke the camel's back," said Rainer Siegkow, a senior economist at Westdeutsche Landesbank in Dusseldorf.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans To Keep Out Of Air Strike At Northwest

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Aug. 29

 BODY:
President Clinton refused early this morning to intervene in the Northwest Airlines pilots' strike, urging both sides to iron out their differences on their own.
But Administration officials said that if the strike extended into the Labor Day weekend and appeared to be causing widespread inconvenience, the President would reconsider his decision. 
 If the strike warrants Presidential intervention, Mr. Clinton will act, said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman. "I won't get into what specific factors would need to change for him to act," Mr. Toiv told reporters early this morning after the strike began at 12:01 A.M. "But the President wants both sides to stay at the table and negotiate."
Mr. Toiv said he would not "put a time-frame" on how long Mr. Clinton would refrain from acting, but other officials said they were waiting to see how much the strike would disrupt domestic travel during the normally busy Labor Day weekend. This year, however, school is starting in many areas before Labor Day, which could ease the traditional holiday traffic.
Under the Railway Labor Act, the President can stop a strike by ordering a 60-day "cooling off" period if he finds the walkout would pose a "substantial economic threat" and deprive a region of a "central transportation service."
The Administration has been sending signals for days that it would not step in, and while the airline made contingency plans, both sides had reason to think the President might intercede. Mr. Clinton set a precedent of sorts last year when he stepped in minutes after 9,300 pilots at American Airlines walked off the job. It was the first time a President had halted an airline strike since 1966.
Administration officials here, where the President is wrapping up a two-week vacation, and in Washington said there were enough differences between the American strike and the Northwest walkout to justify the President's hands-off approach this time.
American, the nation's No. 2 carrier, is much bigger and has a broader reach across the country; Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, is concentrated in the upper Midwest.
But there are also tricky political considerations for the President. The American pilots were nonunion. The Northwest pilots are part of the Air Line Pilots Association, an affiliation of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has been one of the President's strongest political allies and is among the biggest financial contributors to the Democratic Party.
Intervention would be perceived as an anti-labor move because it would keep the company in business and reduce the clout of the workers who wanted to walk out.
The issue has split politicians in the region served by Northwest. The Governors of seven Midwestern states, most of them Republicans, asked Mr. Clinton to intervene, saying a Northwest strike could cost their economies hundreds of millions of dollars in the first week alone.
At the same time, 24 Democratic members of Congress, all of them with strong ties to labor, wrote to the President and urged him not to intervene.

HEADLINE: The Surreal Summit

 BODY:
Two days of summitry, starting Tuesday, between the politically wounded leaders of the United States and Russia are shaping up as a surreal encounter in which real diplomatic business will be hard to transact. Given the rapid deterioration in Russia last week, it probably would have been best to postpone this trip at least until the lineaments of the new political and economic situation could be more clearly discerned. But since both sides have decided to go as planned, President Clinton can try to put the visit to good use.
The planned itinerary will give Mr. Clinton several opportunities to speak directly, on television, to the Russian people. With Communists surging in power and nationalists waiting expectantly in the wings, he should encourage the Russians not to give up on democracy and free-market economics in the despair of the current crisis. He should also caution them to resist the false notion that recovery can be painless with a return to discredited policies. Whatever short-term relief might be bought by printing rubles and renationalizing factories and banks will be paid for many times over in extra suffering by workers, savers and consumers as investment evaporates and inflation rockets out of control in the years ahead. 
 Mr. Clinton and his entourage must try to learn more from President Boris Yeltsin and his acting Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, about their troubling concessions to the Communist-dominated parliament. Today, Mr. Yeltsin's emissary is expected to sign an agreement with the Communists on coordinating economic policy and diluting the powers of the presidency. Temporary compromises with opposition groups may be necessary to get through the present political rapids. But the United States and the world must worry if these steps mark a long-term retreat from reform. Despite their faults, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin represent the best hope for maintaining minimal international economic credibility. They should concede no more than is necessary to re-establish stability. In that regard, Mr. Chernomyrdin's announcement about a new economic panel is a more encouraging sign.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers should also use this visit to build working relationships with other leading Russian politicians, including Mr. Yeltsin's sometime ally, sometime rival, Aleksandr Lebed; Moscow's Mayor, Yuri Luzhkov; the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, and reformers like Boris Nemtsov. Mr. Yeltsin, whose weakness is on painful display, may survive the current political crisis. But he no longer dominates the political scene, and Washington must begin to think about possible successors. By reaching out to other leaders, Mr. Clinton can underscore America's long-term interest in Russia's evolution.
Mr. Clinton and Russia's leaders have a fair amount of foreign policy business to discuss, including differences over Kosovo, Iraq and Russian missile sales to Iran. While it is probably unrealistic to expect any increased Russian cooperation, there is symbolic value in continued discussions.
By traveling to Moscow at such an uncertain time, Mr. Clinton runs the risk that even a well-planned agenda could be buffeted by new economic or political turbulence he can neither foresee nor control. He may also encounter renewed questioning about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, an issue that still requires a fuller explanation and apology from the President. But having decided to proceed with the trip, Mr. Clinton is obliged to speak out strongly for political stability, diplomatic continuity and America's long-term determination to help Russia establish a viable democracy and a successful market economy.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Does Little to Press Inquiry Into Tunnel Deal

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Five months after a state agency vowed to scrutinize its awarding of a $97 million contract to a Republican political donor, its investigators have done little if anything to pursue the inquiry, failing even to interview losing bidders who contend that the process was biased.
In May 1997, the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, gave the contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel to Silverite Construction, a Long Island company that is owned by one of the biggest financial backers of Gov. George E. Pataki and the Republican State Committee. 
 The authority had originally determined that Silverite and its partner in the venture, Frontier-Kemper Constructors of Evansville, Ind., lacked the experience for the four-year tunnel project, one of the largest state contracts in recent years.
But Silverite, of Hicksville, then changed its application and got the contract. In the days just before and after the contract was awarded, the Republican State Committee received several donations, totaling $100,000, from contributors linked to Silverite's owner, according to disclosure records.
The authority and Silverite's owner, Angelo J. Silveri, both said the donations had nothing to do with the contract. But after The New York Times disclosed the timing of the donations in March, the authority's chairman, E. Virgil Conway, asked its Inspector General to conduct a "complete review" of the contract. At the same time, two teams of Federal prosecutors issued subpoenas and began grand jury investigations of the contract.
On Friday, the Inspector General, Roland M. Malan, acknowledged that his office was just beginning to look at the tunnel job and had not yet interviewed authority employees or bidders about it. "Our investigation is at the point where we are just about to get ready," he said. "We are not into it yet."
Mr. Malan said he had decided to postpone the inquiry because his office was not able to obtain authority records connected with the contract until earlier this month. He said the authority had sent the records in the spring to an outside law firm that the authority had hired to help it respond to the grand jury investigations.
Asked why his office had not simply requested copies of the records from the law firm in the spring, he said: "I don't know the answer to that. There is a delay in getting the records that I can't explain."
Mr. Malan, who was appointed by Mr. Pataki and whose office is semi-independent of the authority, denied that the delay stemmed from political considerations related to the coming gubernatorial election.
"It's nonsense," Mr. Malan said. "No one has interfered one iota in anything that we have done."
He expressed confidence that the investigation would not be hindered by the delay. But he added that he had decided not to examine any role that political contributions might have played in the awarding of the contract, saying he would leave that to the Federal prosecutors. He said he would focus only on how the authority's staff conducted the award process.
In March, Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan began separate investigations of the tunnel contract, but the Manhattan office later withdrew. Prosecutors in the Brooklyn office have refused to discuss their inquiry, which is continuing, but an executive at one of the losing bidders who was interviewed by the prosecutors said they appeared to be closely examining how the award process was conducted.
"It sounded to me like they were looking for somebody in the authority who was responsible for giving the contract to the Silverite group," the executive, Peter Schneidkraut, president of Grow Tunneling, said on Friday. "They asked me whom at the authority I had dealt with. And as recently as three or four weeks ago, I got a call asking about a lower-level guy who was involved in the awarding of the contract."
Mr. Schneidkraut said he had not been summoned before the grand jury but expected to be. He said he had not been contacted by the Inspector General's office. "You would think that they would want to hear what our complaints were," he said.
Prosecutors are also investigating an earlier, $14.1 million contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel that Silverite won in 1993 and was then accused by the authority of mismanaging. The company was never penalized for its performance and was even paid extra by the authority.
The authority gave the additional money to Silverite in 1995, soon after the Governor and his senior economic development adviser attended a party for the Pataki campaign at Mr. Silveri's home in Oyster Bay, N.Y. Mr. Silveri raised more than $100,000 in 1995 for Mr. Pataki and the Republicans. Pataki aides said there was no connection between the donations and Silverite's treatment by the authority.
Prosecutors are also examining whether Mr. Silveri used other people to funnel his contributions to Mr. Pataki and the Republicans, a maneuver that could be illegal under Federal or state law, lawyers involved in the case said. In early April, Mr. Silveri released a statement in which he called articles in The Times about his company "entirely false." He then referred to contributions that had been recorded as having been made by his family members and business associates as having been made by him.
At one point, he described a "$100,000 contribution I made to Governor Pataki's 1994 campaign," when in fact the money was recorded by the campaign as several donations from him and family members. When Mr. Silveri's lawyer, Edward M. Shaw, was asked in an interview about the statement, he said it had been accidentally worded incorrectly and would be changed.
Mr. Shaw's office did not respond last week to requests for comment on the tunnel contract.
The Democratic gubernatorial contenders have pointed to the contract as evidence of what they say are the Pataki administration's ethical problems. Told on Friday about the delay in the Inspector General's investigation, one candidate, James L. Larocca, blamed it on politics.
"It's fair to assume that their motivation is to take this out of the political season," Mr. Larocca said.
Asked about such criticism, Michael E. Marr, a spokesman for the Pataki campaign, read a statement: "The State Democratic Party chairwoman recently said of President Clinton's 18-month extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, 'Everybody screws up once in a while or is entitled to one lapse.'

HEADLINE: Poor Face Grim Choices as Pakistan's Economy, and Government, Unravel

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 28

 BODY:
During such a tumultuous week, it might be expected that people here were preoccupied by the American missile attack in neighboring Afghanistan. After all, dozens of Pakistanis were among those killed in the barrage that fell on what the United States says were terrorist training camps.
But this is not the case, for people in this country have concerns far more immediate. 
 The world's newest nuclear power also has one of the world's worst credit ratings, and with the possibility of default looming on its $30 billion foreign debt, Pakistan's economy is quickly coming unspooled. Many people here, whether pundits or politicians or shopkeepers, say they believe that the Government itself may unravel next.
With confidence in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a seeming free fall, it is common to hear predictions that something dramatic is about to occur, though people are at a loss to suggest what that might be. They refer to what has happened elsewhere: social unrest in Indonesia; the emergence of theocratic states in Iran and Afghanistan. They mention a familiar staple of Pakistan's past: the military takeover.
"If this is an economic meltdown, as many say, Pakistanis who have stashed money away overseas -- or who have relatives living overseas -- are likely to leave," said Abida Hussain, a former Ambassador to the United States and now a member of Mr. Sharif's Cabinet. "The institutional framework of government, already so stressed out, might come under unbearable pressure. Radical religious elements would try to profit off this.
"At the same time, people ask if the military would take over. I'll quote the answer given me by a young officer who is my friend. I asked him, 'Do you guys have the guts to impose military rule?' And he said: 'Of course, we do. But what would we get out of it but a lot of criticism?' The military's choices are no less grim than the Government's."
As usual, those with the grimmest of choices are the nation's poor. Abdul Khaliq, 35, is a barber in the working-class city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, Pakistan's ornamented capital. "The feudal landlords and politicians have looted our country until there is nothing more to loot and they leave us with nothing but our poverty," he said.
Mr. Khaliq's barber shop is an 8-by-8-foot room with a single chair. Electrical wires, frayed as old rope, hang from the ceiling. He has halved the price of a haircut to about 33 cents, but customers seldom venture inside. "They have no money," he said.
Next door is a tiny vegetable stand run by Mohammad Farooq, 42. His shelves are stocked with only small amounts of ginger, tomatoes and cabbage. People have been buying much less these last few weeks. The price of onions has doubled. Potatoes have tripled.
"What is a man to do in a country like Pakistan, get a rifle, kill yourself, kill your family, kill someone else?" he said angrily. "My wife has pains in her ear. Medicine helps, but I have no money for medicine. I tell her she must live with the pain."
While foreign news programs repeatedly showed Pakistanis protesting against the American missile attack, such rallies have been few and quite small. Even now, many people in Rawalpindi have never heard of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire the United States believes was behind the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Certainly, a vast majority never knew who he was before last week.
The man most people speak of is Mr. Sharif, who was elected by a huge margin in February 1997 but has recently found his popularity plunging. Voters, a discouraged lot, had at the very least presumed him to be less dishonest than his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, who faces corruption charges here and in Switzerland. Many also supposed that a millionaire industrialist might know something about running a government.
But these days even a supporter like Ms. Hussain, the Minister for Population Welfare and Science and Technology, is spare in her praise of Mr. Sharif's leadership.
"This Government is probably cleaner than any in the past," she said. "But the cleanliness is at the top. Lower down, it's business as usual."
In its 51-year history, Pakistan has been a democracy only sporadically, with elected governments trading turns with military dictatorships. Corruption seems an unbreakable habit: politicians gorge at the public trough, landowners and industrialists refuse to repay mammoth loans from national banks, less than 1 percent of the population pays income tax. Almost 70 percent of the budget goes toward interest on debt or for the military.
These conditions have created a shaky economic scaffolding. Nevertheless, Pakistan, with about half the population of the United States, has usually managed to muddle through by begging and borrowing -- and forever promising to clean up its act.
Mr. Sharif has made such promises, and while even his critics say he has made some progress, his efforts at reform strike most as insufficiently bold.
With his support withering, and the economy already slowed by Asia's economic crisis, Mr. Sharif enjoyed a spurt in popularity after May 28, when Pakistan spurned United States offers of financial aid and tested nuclear bombs, matching earlier trials by its enemy, India. America imposed economic sanctions on both nations, and the International Monetary Fund suspended disbursements -- castigations that have been harder on Pakistan than its rival.
Mr. Sharif implored his countrymen to economize, to drink two cups of tea a day instead of three, to cook with one spoonful of oil instead of two. He announced ways to raise revenue, including the recovery of those billions in loans owed by the country's elite.
But efforts to collect have largely been a flop, a failure all the more irritating to the public since among the well-heeled deadbeats was the Prime Minister. He has refused to repay his loans with cash, instead turning over assets that critics say he has overvalued. Calls for a comment from Mr. Sharif's Information Minister were not returned.
Desperate for revenues, the Government increased prices for petroleum and electricity. At the same time, the value of the rupee has plunged by 30 percent. Inflation has hit hard.
With $3 billion in foreign debt coming due, Pakistan is in danger of defaulting. Last Wednesday, the United States expressed support for a deal among international lenders that would rescue Pakistan from its payments crisis.
Such last-ditch debt-juggling has saved Pakistan in the past, and while the I.M.F. and others usually demand economic reforms to accompany their loans, many complain that such requirements are half-heartedly enforced here.
"The I.M.F. and the World Bank bend over backward to appease these regimes," said Najam Sethi, editor of a weekly newspaper, The Friday Times. "At every step of the way, the Government lies to these agencies and the agencies surely know they are being lied to."
But it has been difficult for the West to forsake a place like Pakistan, with so many illiterate people and so little health care. This is all the more true now that the nation is carrying a tin cup in one hand and nuclear bombs in the other.
"Pakistan and its creditors are locked in this unfortunate, self-defeating embrace," said Paula Newberg, an author who has written extensively about Pakistan. "What appears to be convenient in the short term may be worse for the long term. This pattern of bailouts keeps getting repeated, and in the meantime Pakistan's structural problems are never solved."
In the narrow stalls of the Rawalpindi market, with haggard old men and bony horses pulling heavy carts through the streets, people wonder if some virtuous Islamic leader might come along to save the country. Mohammad Jameel, 40, a shopkeeper, said he would welcome a fundamentalist government, but then was unable to name any Islamic leader he would deem worthy. Pakistan does have fundamentalist Islamic parties. They have yet to fare well in elections.
In what some here see as cynical politics, Mr. Sharif has begun to portray himself as newly zealous. Today, in a speech before Parliament, he said the cure for the nation's social ills was a constitutional amendment to makes its laws more closely reflect Islamic teachings.
Pakistan's Muslims are split among Sunnis and Shiites, with the Sunnis in a great majority, as they are in almost all predominantly Muslim countries. Yet even within these groups, there are sects. They would be hard to unify under any banner, let alone a fundamentalist one. Most Pakistanis prefer less-strict interpretations of the holy Koran.
"The armed forces are a deciding factor, and I don't think they would welcome an Islamic resurgence," said Aziz Sidique of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a private group, in Lahore. "I wouldn't rule out a military takeover. What has prevented it so far is that now they have the opportunity to influence decisions without taking responsibility for them.
"It is not so appealing to take responsibility these days in Pakistan."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: SUMMIT MEETING;
BAD TIMING ASIDE, CLINTON RESOLUTE ON YELTSIN SUMMIT

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to depart for Moscow on Monday hoping to repair his scandal-stained image while offering comfort -- but no aid -- for the wounded President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin.
Not since 1974 has an American President gone to Moscow in such a weak domestic position. President Nixon met with Leonid I. Brezhnev in late June of that year as the final chapters of the Watergate scandal were unfolding. The summit meeting gave a fleeting impression of an active President engaged in the international arena, but nothing of substance was accomplished. Five weeks after returning to Washington, Mr. Nixon resigned in disgrace. 
 With Mr. Clinton beset by the Monica Lewinksy matter and a sickly Mr. Yeltsin struggling to manage a country in political and financial chaos, few expect substantial progress on any items on the meeting agenda -- arms control, terrorism, regional conflicts and the global economy. The meeting may, however, give each leader a 48-hour respite from their restive constituencies.
Despite the bad timing and poor prospects of the Moscow meeting, Administration officials insist that it is in America's interest that Mr. Clinton proceed. Administration officials discussed throughout this tumultuous week postponing or canceling the summit meeting -- before unanimously agreeing on Friday that it should go forward.
Four former national security advisers disagreed on exactly what Mr. Clinton can or should say, what the outcome of the meeting will be, or whether he should go at all. Page 11.
Mr. Clinton said on Friday that he owed it to his beleaguered counterpart to lend moral support in "this dark night."
"Anybody can come see you when you're doing well," the President said.
Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser, elaborated on the reasons Mr. Clinton felt it necessary to go to Moscow now. "It is important that he go on this trip despite the situation -- or perhaps even more, because of -- the situation in Russia," Mr. Berger said.
He said the President would convey to Mr. Yeltsin the importance that the United States puts on the relationship with Russia and give assurance that "particularly in times of difficulty, the United States and the West will not turn away from cooperation."
And he said critical work remains to be done on assuring the safety of Russia's nuclear arsenal, on controlling the spread of weapons, and on Kosovo and Iraq. The leaders are expected to announce agreements on reducing Russia's stockpile of bomb-grade plutonium and sharing early-warning data on missile launches from third countries, particularly in the arc of instability from Iran through South Asia to North Korea.
"America has a strong interest in preventing Russia from backsliding and in promoting its stability and success," Mr. Berger said.
American officials said there was no substitute for visiting Moscow and sitting across the table from Mr. Yeltsin to judge his political and physical health. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin have not held a formal summit meeting since March 1997, in Helsinki, Finland, though they have met briefly in private during larger gatherings of the top industrialized nations twice since then.
Mr. Clinton carries two messages to Moscow, neither of which is likely to be warmly received by all audiences. One is that while the United States is sympathetic to Russia's current economic plight, it has little to offer unless the yet-unformed Government of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Acting Prime Minister, adopts painful short-term measures to raise taxes, battle corruption and control inflation.
"It is their success in carrying out these steps that we believe will be crucial in determining their economic prospects in what is not an easy global economic environment," said Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. But he said, "Russia's economic future will be shaped in Russia by Russian policy choices going forward."
The other is that while the West has to do business with Mr. Yeltsin as the elected President of Russia, Mr. Clinton and other world leaders are looking beyond him to a new generation of reform-minded leaders willing to make a decisive break with Russia's Communist past. The centerpiece of the trip, from the American standpoint, is a speech Mr. Clinton is to give to students and young community and business leaders at the Moscow Institute of International Relations on Tuesday afternoon.
It is an open question whether those leaders have any hope of achieving real power under Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin, who have given mixed signs about their willingness to accept Western-dictated economic measures or to work with those who advocate them.
Mr. Clinton's advisers say they believe that canceling the summit meeting would do more harm than good, delivering a devastating vote of no confidence in Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin just as they are trying to cobble together a Government.
But many believe that the timing is atrocious because critical Government posts are empty and there is no set of policies to discuss.
"Nobody is overjoyed at the timing," said one senior Administration policy maker. "There is no plan and there are no people. We're reduced on the policy side here to having hypothetical discussions on what one might do if there were a certain type of Government.
"But if there's a silver lining, it's that you don't have to answer all the hard questions because virtually every hard question is premature."
The chief danger of holding the meeting now is that it will give the illusion of stability in the relationship and the possibility of progress down the road when little is possible, some Russia scholars contend.
James Goldgeier, a Russia specialist at George Washington University, said that, in the ideal, summit meetings are where leaders make promises and then deliver on them. But neither President is in a position to do so, he said.
"Now we have got a summit in which the main political aspect is that you have two Presidents who are extremely weak domestically, each of whom has a legislature that isn't in much of a mood to give them anything," Mr. Goldgeier said. "You've got elites in both capitals calling for each President to step down, and again that's not helpful as you approach a summit. You've got investors fleeing Russia. You've got social unrest growing. And so the Bill and Boris Show is not a particularly compelling spectacle as we approach Sept. 1."
Mr. Clinton will stop in Northern Ireland and Ireland for three days after the Moscow meeting to celebrate the signing of the American-brokered peace accord this spring and to preach reconciliation between the British province's warring factions.
He will meet with Catholic and Protestant leaders, visit Omagh, site of a car bombing Aug. 15 that killed 29 people, and deliver several speeches to the Irish people. The White House hopes that he will be met by spirit-lifting huge crowds, like those he encountered during his first visit to Ireland, in November 1995.
Mr. Clinton's five-day trip will end with a round of golf on the storied links at Ballybunion, in southwest Ireland. He will return to Washington on Saturday evening.

HEADLINE: Tourism Puts Some Back on Job;
Less-Skilled Workers Are Especially Helped by Boom

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
For most New Yorkers, the tourists swarming Manhattan are a source of mixed emotions: amusement, exasperation, even pride. But for an increasing group of city residents, tourists are the source of something much more concrete: jobs.
And many of the jobs are the kind the city particularly needs, jobs for less-skilled workers who might once have found work in factories but have struggled, in recent years, to find any employment. 
 "Manufacturing used to be where unskilled people could get a start on the rungs of the career ladder," said Marc M. Goloven, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "But as manufacturing has dwindled in the city, perhaps tourism is one industry that will supplant it."
Jobs in tourism are always vulnerable to economic shifts in the country and abroad. The current economic turmoil in Asia and Latin America could have an impact, for instance. But for now, the city's tourism boom means jobs.
Exactly how many jobs are dependent on tourism is unknown; the most recent figures available from the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau date from 1995, though officials there hope to have more current data by next month. The outdated figure of 131,000 jobs would account for about 4.5 percent of all nongovernment employment in the city.
The actual number of tourism jobs is almost certainly much higher. Employment in "tourism-sensitive" industries has increased by about 8 percent since mid-1996 -- much faster than the city's job growth rate of about 5 percent in the private sector. Those tourism sectors have added about 33,500 jobs, for a total of 458,000, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of workers in "amusement and recreation services," which include everything from theaters to race tracks, has jumped by almost 16 percent; employment at museums, botanical gardens, zoos, bars and restaurants has increased at double-digit rates. The number of hotel employees has grown by almost 8 percent in the two years that ended in June.
Not all of these jobs come from tourism; native New Yorkers eat at restaurants, go to museums and attend Broadway shows (except, perhaps, "Cats"). But tourism is giving these businesses a push, said John L. Wieting, the bureau's regional commissioner. Certainly, the number of tourists visiting the city has soared. Last year, more than 33 million people came to play, an increase of more than 13 percent, and they spent $13.7 billion; the city estimates that with all its ripple effects, tourism added $18 billion to the local economy.
This year, the numbers are continuing to grow, although at a slower pace; the Visitors Bureau forecasts that 34 million tourists will spend a total of $14.3 billion, an estimate that city officials describe as conservative.
By no means are all of the workers catering to these visitors unskilled, said Fran Reiter, the president of the agency, which is responsible for marketing the city to tourists. "The industry provides jobs at every level," she said, noting that the hotel business has increasingly needed computer workers, and that running entertainment and travel businesses requires a lot of management expertise.
But, Ms. Reiter acknowledged, tourism also provides many entry-level jobs for people without much work experience.
Many tourism-related jobs, accordingly, do not pay very well. The average salary at hotels last year was about $32,900 a year, and the average worker at a bar or restaurant, while sometimes making extra money in tips, made less than $17,000 in salary, according to the New York State Comptroller's Office. The average worker in the city made $48,800.
The increase in tourism is probably helping to push up the earnings of all less-skilled workers, because demand for such labor is increasing, said Alan Krueger, a economist who teaches at Princeton University.
And though tourism tends to rise and fall based on economic conditions, the long-term trend is strong, Mr. Krueger said. "As the rest of the world, with hiccups, becomes wealthier," foreigners will become more likely to take vacations, he said.
New Yorkers whose jobs are not dependent on tourism are not all delighted to see their city ranked with Orlando and Las Vegas as a destination. Ms. Reiter hears complaints about everything from crowded sidewalks to Peeping Toms on the double-decker buses. But she is not sympathetic to complaints about tourists. "They spend $18 billion," she said. "Give me a break."

HEADLINE: Tourism Puts Some Back on Job: Tour Agent;
An 'Easy Job' On the Streets

BYLINE: By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
Silvio Acosta has what is by all accounts a dead-end job: He sells sightseeing trips to the tourists who descend on New York each day.
But considering the way business has soared in the two years since he took the job, Mr. Acosta would gladly take a dozen more like it. Wherever he stops his mobile office, an aging blue double-decker bus that also wears a rather large ad for Continental Airlines, swarms of vacationers flock with questions and cameras. Thanks to them Mr. Acosta's pockets have never been fatter, nor his future more stable. 
 "This is the best job I've ever had," the 27-year-old declared one recent afternoon, as he scouted for customers along Times Square.
Demand for the tickets he sells is so hot that his employer, New York Double Decker Tours, plans over the next year to add another 125 street-based agents to its current team of 75.
"After years of being notorious, New York is the place to be again," boasts Alexander Garzon, Double Decker's chief executive. "Everybody is benefiting." The company, whose tours cost from $20 to $35, also intends to expand its fleet of 20 buses next year with 30 new buses.
For Mr. Acosta, the company's good times have afforded him a ticket to a better life. He earns $5 for every ticket he sells, which on most weeks brings him about $700, more than double the $300 a week he had been making working various restaurant jobs.
Mr. Acosta said he never thought he could "make a living so easy in this city." He added, "Now I feel able to relax."
When Mr. Acosta moved from Santiago in the Dominican Republican seven years ago, all he had was a semester of college and adesire to see the city that had captured the imaginations of so many of his friends back home. He found work in the usual refuge for new arrivals, restaurants, where he bused tables and washed dishes. He later worked at a midtown McDonald's.
Looking to ease his way out of the fast-food industry, Mr. Acosta applied for what he had intended to be only a transitional job. But the money has been better than even he expected, although he receives no benefits. "People, they think we don't earn so much being out here -- but let me show you something," he said snatching a copy of his most recent pay stub from his pouch. Proudly pointing out his bounty for the week, $675, he continued, "This is a good, easy job, no?"
Still beaming, Mr. Acosta cuts himself off to make his pitch to a couple from Ohio who have walked up to the bus for more information. It is shortly after noon and he is still more than $100 away from his goal of $200 in commissions today. He looks the couple over, turns up his smile and says, "We have the best prices and best seats in New York." But the pitch fails. The woman notices the sprawling Virgin record store across street and drags her companion off.
But Mr. Acosta is unfazed. "All I have to do," he says, "is to stand here and be friendly. The people will come. This is why they come here." NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

Pampering Guests At $15.57 an Hour

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
For eight years, Violeta McZeno worked as a receptionist at a dental office in downtown Manhattan. She liked her job and made what she thought then was a good salary, $8 an hour. Then, two things happened: Ms. McZeno separated from her husband and she lost her job when the dentists moved.
In nine months without a job or a husband to help her pay the rent, Ms. McZeno, 52, went through her nest egg -- about $10,000 -- and borrowed money from her sister and a friend. Just as Ms. McZeno was reaching the end of her rope, though, the tourism boom hit New York. 
 Enter the Pierre, a 68-year-old landmark hotel on Fifth Avenue and 61st Street, where a room costs a minimum of $440 a night for a single occupancy and where Japanese guests are pampered with soft cotton kimonos and plush terry slippers. A friend of Ms. McZeno's who worked as a housekeeper there told her jobs were available and suggested she apply.
Ms. McZeno, who had never worked as a housekeeper and had never searched for a job in the service industry, followed her friend's advice and got a full-time job less than a week after she applied. She started making $11 an hour and now, two years later, she is making $15.57 an hour. She gets two weeks of vacation and full benefits.
"I couldn't be happier," she said. "I was lucky, what can I say?"
Ms. McZeno benefited from the hotel's policy of hiring people with good attitudes, regardless of their hotel experience, said Mary Jo McNally, director of public relations at the Pierre. But Ms. McZeno was also fortunate because she went looking for a job just when the hotel needed extra workers to cope with the increasing number of tourists.
"We were definitely hiring more people then because our business was so much stronger," Ms. McNally said.
In the last two years, she added, the hotel has hired 16 housekeepers to complement a staff of 650 employees. This year, the Pierre's executives have projected an 85 percent occupancy rate, Ms. McNally said. "In the 80's, we were lucky if we reached 70 percent some years," she said.
Ms. McZeno's days are long and difficult. She begins at 8:30 A.M. and, by 5 P.M., has cleaned 15 rooms, paying attention to the details required by Four Seasons Hotels, the company that runs the Pierre. The towels have to be folded just so, the fluffy bathrobes have to hang behind the door of the bathroom and the flowers have to be fresh.
But her efforts are rewarded, she says. Her salary has been raised twice and most of her guests leave tips that range anywhere from $1 a day to $30 at the end of a brief stay.
With the money she has earned so far, Ms. McZeno was able to pay her debts, buy a set of gold bracelets she had always wanted and travel to Mexico, Las Vegas and California. She also moved with her two daughters, now 19 and 26, to a bigger, more expensive, apartment in Brooklyn.
Ms. McZeno, who was born in Panama but has lived in the United States since 1989, says she never imagined that cleaning other people's rooms and attending to their every need would pay her more than she ever made working as a secretary, the career she studied and trained for back home.
"I pay my bills and rest easy at night," she said. "Who could ask for more?" MIRTA OJITO

HEADLINE: Tourism Puts Some Back on Job: Couture Saleswoman;
At Versace, Service Comes in Spanish

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Veronica Valerio did not dream big fashion dreams. No one she knew wore designer clothes, and her knowledge of celebrities, and their proclivity for borrowing fancy gowns, was the stuff of glossy magazines.
She moved to New York with her parents when she was 15, and quickly went to work to help support life in their apartment overlooking Yankee Stadium. "Work was a necessity," she said, leaning back into a Rococo-style chaise longue in the Versace atelier on Fifth Avenue. 
 In 1991 she saw a help-wanted ad for a cashier. She was already working as one at a pizzeria on 42d Street, so she knew she could do the job. "All I knew is that it was a clothing store," she said. She was thrilled to realize that she would be ringing up sales of Versace jeans and glittery tops.
Her sales skills and knowledge of Spanish would later combine to vault her to an assistant manager position. When she walks through her old neighborhood now, she wears a slim black Versace suit made for her. "They say, 'Here comes the Versace girl,' " she said with a grin.
Her language skills are essential to the five-story store on Fifth Avenue near 52d Street, where roughly half the purchases are made by South American tourists. Indeed, tourists account for far more sales on Fifth Avenue than on any other upscale strip in Manhattan, retail experts say, and that makes language skills a big plus among those who work there.
"Tourists love to make trophy purchases on Fifth Avenue," said Markus Evner, a Versace spokesman. "If an associate can speak a language, that is important."
Saks Fifth Avenue has a special service for foreign shoppers that matches them with personal shoppers, and the concierge at Barneys New York keeps a list of which employees speak what language.
Clerks who know something about fashion and can talk about it in Japanese, Russian and French are so valued, many stores do not even want to discuss them.
"Everybody is after good sales associates with language skills," said Robert Triefus, a spokesman for Calvin Klein, who has a store on Madison Avenue. And, consequently, he did not want a reporter meeting any at his store. "The high-end stores and the staff that are in them are a precious commodity," he said.
Ms. Valerio, 29, was promoted to the sales floor in 1997 and quickly started to help the richest of the rich. There was the architect from Puerto Rico who came in for a tie and walked out with $97,000 in jewelry for his wife. "It's always nice to see him," she said.
She has helped Madonna pick out a dress to borrow, as well as the socialite Julia Koch, who was so impressed with her, she called the publicity office the next day to compliment her, and sent a gift.
Then, there are people like the family from Spain who were browsing the sportswear floor the other day. Like the majority of shoppers who come in to gawk at the glittering, barely-there gowns or just to see the house built by the designer whose murder became a subject of public discourse, they would almost surely buy nothing.
She greeted them warmly and in Spanish, as if they had just dropped by for lunch. "Your first time here," she asked. "Welcome!" Some of these exchanges end up being her favorites. "When I learn where a customer is from, we exchange a bit of stories," she said.
She still walks by that pizzeria on 42d Street from time to time. "I think to myself, 'Oh God," she said. "It's like a Cinderella story." JENNIFER STEINHAUER

HEADLINE: Tourism Puts Some Back on Job: Art Consultant;
Guiding Appreciators Of Contemporary Art

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Three weeks ago, Todd Weissner's financial landscape was as barren as Wall Street on a Sunday. He had spent the last nine months as a gofer for various executives around the city, making calls, typing and filing letters and fetching coffee. He had gone for months without health or dental benefits. Out of desperation, he applied for a job as an art consultant at Martin Lawrence Galleries in SoHo. He landed it, and now sells art for one of the largest dealers of pop art in the country.
Bless the booming tourism industry. 
 The galleries, deluged by tourists this summer, began increasing their staff of six in June, said Nancy Retchin-Rich, director of the galleries on West Broadway, which cuts through the heart of SoHo. She hired Mr. Weissner full time three weeks ago, even though business for art galleries generally trails off in the summer.
"I may not have been looking for additional people had business not been so good, had I not seen the need, had there not been so many bodies walking in the door that I saw needing to be attended to," said Ms. Retchin-Rich, who has worked as director for a year and at the galleries for eight years. "Most of our sales are to tourists."
As for Mr. Weissner, 24, he had no idea that tourism would ever have such a direct impact on his life. A painter himself, he is glad to have finally landed a job in an area related to one of his passions.
A poised and spindly man dressed in a dark shirt and tie, Mr. Weissner guides clients around various original paintings and prints by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Keith Haring.
"The market's real thin right now in Europe," Mr. Weissner said. "So a lot of people who come in think we are a museum. They see so much work that they don't actually realize we are selling it, especially with the pop art."
This is Mr. Weissner's second full-time job since graduating two years ago from Rutgers University with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. He lasted exactly two months at his first job at a studio in the East Village, he said, because the pay was too low.
He pays just under $700 for space in a sprawling top-floor loft apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that he shares with two other people, a musician and an entrepreneur. He also has studio space in the loft where he can paint.
When, after a time working at a temporary employment agency, he learned through a newspaper ad that Martin Lawrence was looking for a consultant, he couldn't believe it.
"I'm glad I got the job because I am passionate about art," he said. "I was really interested in working at Martin Lawrence so I could meet collectors and other people who love art, not just those who buy it to decorate walls. I've found that here." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

HEADLINE: Tourism Puts Some Back on Job: Outdoor Food Vendor;
A Chance to Try Out High School French

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
When Charlene Watson went back to work after 18 months of making do on unemployment and then welfare, she did not expect the job benefits would include learning how to count in German and practicing her rusty high school French.
But as an assistant manager of the outdoor food stand at Pier 83 on the Hudson River at 42d Street, where the Circle Line sightseeing tour boats dock, Ms. Watson gets a little "frisson" of excitement from dealing with the foreign tourists. 
 "I'm having fun doing this," she said, all the while keeping an eye on the slowly cooking hot dogs that have now become her stock in trade. "If I didn't have this, I would be solely dependent on public assistance."
Still, doling out dogs and helping strangers make sense of American money was not Ms. Watson's idea of a dream job. She had been working as a bookkeeper and secretary, but those weren't the kinds of jobs being offered.
Ms. Watson, 41, was hired in April by Eurest Dining Services, which runs the food concession for Circle Line and Seaport Liberty Cruises. At that time, many people in the tourism industry, including the sightseeing and food companies, were anticipating a boom summer.
Eurest, for example, hired 50 people in the spring for its tourism-related contracts.
So far, however, the expected boom has not materialized. Donald Fairbanks, general manager of the cruise company, said that after a spectacular spring, ticket sales now are at the same level as last summer, even with three extra evening tours. "We had anticipated growth," he said.
Nevertheless, those early great expectations helped Ms. Watson, who lives in the Bronx, rejoin the work force.
She said she had worked for 13 years for Aramark Corporation, another food service company, at its dining halls at New York University. She started out as a weekend deli person and worked her way up to office jobs before being laid off in a company-wide "downsizing."
"I knew the downsizing was coming," Ms. Watson said. "I just didn't think I would get caught up in it."
She had three children -- at the time, 18, 17 and 13 years old -- still at home. When the unemployment checks stopped after six months, she went on public assistance, getting a check for $149 every two weeks and $250 worth of food stamps each month.
Through America Works, a private company that helps welfare recipients prepare their resumes and interview for jobs, she tried to get another office job. But Ms. Watson said her background in food services is what finally led to a paycheck. It was like starting from scratch: Her new job was preparing salads for the same food services contractor, Aramark, where she had worked so many years.
"It was 13 years of experience down the drain," Ms. Watson said.
When the Aramark job ended after three months, she was again unemployed. The Grand Street Settlement House, which also helps applicants polish their job-hunting skills, sent her to Eurest. After a training course serving food on one of the Circle Line tours -- Ms. Watson's first trip on the sightseeing boat -- she was assigned to the food stand outside the ticket office.
Many of her customers are from Europe. They add a little flavor to her eight-hour day behind the grill. "I had one customer from France, I guess, and I said hello to her in French and then she was off," Ms. Watson recalled. "She started talking and talking in French and I was just trying to remember it from high school."
"I just kept saying 'uh-huh' and 'hmmm' and nodding," she added. "Then at the end the lady said to me, in perfect English, 'Have a nice day." ' SUSAN SACHS

New Job Description for Workers: Owner

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
Many on network television -- from Roseanne to Sanford and son to the ensemble on "Taxi" -- have tried to pass themselves off as representatives of the American worker. But none of them have done it quite as effectively as the cast of "Livelyhood," a quarterly PBS show whose third installment, "Honey, We Bought the Company," has its national premiere this Friday at 9 P.M. and will be shown in the New York area the following Monday, Sept. 7, at 8 P.M. on Channel 13.
The reason is simple: the folks you see in "Livelyhood" are, in fact, real working people. And that goes (or at least it used to) for the host, the humorist Will Durst. "I'm a third-generation factory rat," Mr. Durst said in a recent telephone interview. He said his grandfather, his father and he had all worked in the same tractor factory in West Allis, Wis., near Milwaukee. 
 Like Mr. Durst, "Livelyhood" steps back and takes a wry look at issues affecting American workers. In this case, the host gets his share of camera time, including one segment about franchising in which he spends a few hours as the night clerk at a convenience store. It's a good illustration of the mood of the show: honest enough to represent the mind-numbing boredom and low pay of such a job, but not going so far as to show Mr. Durst being confronted by armed robbers.
And that sort of approach keeps "Livelyhood," which examines work and its relationship to family and community, from seeming like a real job to watch. The series producers, an Oakland, Calif., company called the Working Group, want to show the challenges of job-related issues but keep it light. When the show presents statistics, it makes them seem like drive-through menu items (and tosses in one transparently bogus entry, like "American workers who can spell entrepreneur: 8 percent").
"Honey, We Bought the Company" focuses on those who, out of either entrepreneurship or sheer necessity, have become owners or part owners of the companies they work for. It starts with a couple visiting a franchisers' exposition in Atlanta, and this segment focuses on one franchise that actually seems like a good, affordable idea: a mobile car-wash system that lets its owner go to the dirty vehicles. Unlike most of the pitchmen at the expo, the man selling the car-wash franchises seems capable of delivering the unpolished truth about the risks and return involved.
There are also segments on an Indian woman who sells solar energy units to remote homes on Hopi and Navajo reservations, a group of cabbies who decided to form a cooperative after being laid off and aluminum mill workers in Montana who thought they were splitting the profits 50-50 with their new bosses but had to go to court to get their money. All the vignettes end with workers who, if not rich, are at least still employed.
In one case, a group of Maine textile workers facing unemployment at the hands of the corporate downsizer Albert J. Dunlap become part owners of their mill. Mr. Dunlap, meanwhile, whose nickname is Chain Saw Al, was dismissed in June as chairman and chief executive of Sunbeam by unhappy board members. Maybe there's an opening down at the mill.
One knows better than to think it always ends so satisfyingly. But, as Mr. Durst pointed out during the interview, "Livelyhood" is still documentary quality. "You don't really see American workers on sitcoms," he said. "You see them go off to work, then you see them come home -- unless you have a badge or you're a gunshot victim or you're on the Jerry Springer show."
In working on this series (the fourth show is scheduled for January, after which, Mr. Durst said, more money will be needed to keep it going), Mr. Durst said he had come to admire the resilience of Americans in the face of job market vicissitudes. "You throw them out of a job, and they'll create a new job," he said. "They're like mercury.
"And there's a lot more hope out there than I thought. I'm surprised by the hope."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Debate on Property Taxes Has to Hit Close to Home

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
On the day after Governor Whitman was nearly defeated for re-election last fall, she stood before a dozen television cameras and reiterated her campaign promises to address voters' top two concerns: auto insurance rates and property taxes.
The Legislature, after much stumbling and debate, last spring adopted a plan that promises to lower auto insurance rates. 
 And now, finally, property taxes are on the table for discussion. A 24-member commission, appointed by the Governor in December, is expected to make its recommendations public next week.
So what can New Jersey's overburdened property taxpayers expect?
Well, no one should expect a property tax bill to plummet. At the same time, no one needs to worry that this commission will recommend major statewide tax increases.
The commission is expected to come up with three dozen recommendations, Whitman administration officials say, but they concede that none of the recommendations could be described as a magic bullet.
That is because the commission received early instructions from Governor Whitman: do not even think about making recommendations that would increase statewide taxes or the state's overall tax burden.
And in case Mrs. Whitman was ever tempted to change her mind, she needed only to look at the way voters responded to former Governor Jim Florio's approach to property taxes. He increased the income tax rate to help pay for an increase in state aid for education, and voters threw him out of office.
Yet most experts say the only way to reduce property taxes significantly in New Jersey is to increase state assistance for public education significantly. That is because the cost of public schools makes up the biggest portion of property tax bills.
The state pays only 40 percent of the cost of public education, sticking local taxpayers with the rest. The national average of what states pay toward public education is 50 percent. Complicating the picture is the fact that New Jersey spends more on education per pupil than any other state.
The report is also expected to note the high price New Jerseyans pay for their insistence on home rule. A hundred years ago, there were 270 municipalities in New Jersey. Today, there are 566 cities and towns. Taxpayers are also paying for 21 counties, 188 fire districts and 611 school districts.
And taxpayers in New Jersey have also come to expect more municipal services than residents in other states do. In many states, residents pay a private contractor for trash pickup. In New Jersey, tax dollars cover trash pickup in most towns. And in tiny Essex Fells, a borough of 2,139 people in Essex County, you don't even have to drag your trash cans to the curb. The local department of sanitation collects them from the rear of your home.
So this commission hopes to generate debate among New Jerseyans about exactly what municipal services they want badly enough to pay for through their property taxes, not to mention how much they really want to spend on public education.
The commission also hopes to help New Jerseyans recognize that there is a tremendous cost to land-use decisions made weekly in borough halls and township buildings. The commission is expected to point out that new residential development, once considered a way for towns to expand their property tax base, can often add to a municipality's overall tax burden.
Some of the commission's recommendations are expected to generate controversy. Already, the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union, is gearing up for a battle over a suggestion to place a cap on annual raises for teachers' salaries. The commission is also expected to recommend a cap on annual salaries for all local government employees.
"We would be opposed to such a move," said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association. "First of all, there is already a cap on all school budgets in New Jersey. All of the contracts are negotiated by representatives of the community, and they are driven by the local economy. We hope that they deal with the property tax issue itself and do not take a detour that places blame or responsibility on the shoulders of public employees."
Property taxes, like auto insurance rates, have bedeviled one New Jersey governor after another.
"It is a problem that has always been around New Jersey politics," said Stephen Salmore, a Republican political consultant. "But I am not convinced that the public blames the Governor for it."
Not, that is, until governors try to do something about it. Voters tossed former Governor William T. Cahill out of office after he recommended a statewide property tax. And Mr. Florio was also badly punished by the voters for his efforts to lower property tax rates.
"I have repeatedly asked, in polls, questions about taxes," said Mr. Salmore, a co-author of the newly revised book "Government and Politics of New Jersey: Suburban Politics Comes of Age." "Everyone believes that their taxes are going up, whether they are or not. And then, when you ask who is responsible, most of the blame falls to the local government and the local school board."
Well, last year voters blamed Governor Whitman. Now, the commission is likely to put most of the blame on local governments and local school districts. But maybe New Jerseyans need to put some of the blame on themselves.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 6, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The On Politics column last Sunday, about property taxes, misstated the system for trash collection in the town of Essex Fells. Trash is collected by a private hauler from Belleville, T. Farese & Son. Homeowners pay the hauler directly; tax dollars are not involved.

The Uninsured Find Fewer Doctors in the House

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DESPITE a decade of steadily rising prosperity, a million more Americans a year are losing the protective umbrella of health insurance. As a result, more than 41 million people, or 15 percent of the population, don't have coverage.
They lack insured care because they can't get it at work or can't afford it. Most are adults under 65, the age when they become eligible for Medicare. Most are men. Most have no children at home, so they are ineligible for Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor. Most have jobs, or live with someone who works, but their incomes, typically below $25,000 a year, make them ineligible for Medicaid. 
 Yet even as their numbers grow, the uninsured are finding that their last resort -- charity care -- is being threatened by the rapid expansion of managed care, which is putting tremendous financial pressure on doctors and hospitals to focus their resources on insured patients.
It's true that in crises the uninsured can take their diabetes, their rotted teeth, their tuberculosis, their hypertension, their addictions, their obesity, their asthma attacks -- all scourges of the poor -- to emergency rooms, where by law they must be seen and treated free.
For less urgent care, they can go to doctors' offices, public hospitals and clinics subsidized by the government and philanthropic groups. Often, that care is free as well, or the patient agrees to pay a few dollars a month for it, albeit for years.
Recently, however, anything beyond emergency treatment has become harder to get in much of the country. As managed care has expanded to cover 85 percent of the working population, it has succeeded in stabilizing costs for employers and their managed care subscribers. And the Government is reaping similar rewards for taxpayers by steering Medicaid recipients and the elderly into managed care plans, and by cutting Medicare reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
But as part of the process of containing costs, the Government and the managed care industry have also pressured doctors to take cuts in their incomes or to take on more paying or insured patients to maintain their current incomes, which has left them with less time for charity.
 
Free Care, but Not Much
One fraying thread of the safety net is the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church's medical clinic in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit. Sister Mary Ellen Howard, the registered nurse who manages the clinic, uses volunteer physicians and nurses to treat 3,000 patients a year, all uninsured, on an annual budget of $50,000 collected from small foundations.
The care is free, but there's less of it.
"I had somebody come in here who had blood in his urine," Sister Mary Ellen said. "He needed further diagnostic study, and we couldn't do it. He couldn't go to an emergency room because that's not an emergency. There was a urologist I could call and say, 'Joe, will you take this one client?' He would take him."
"Now when I call, he says, 'Sorry,' " she added, noting that he has cut back on charity care because he has to see more and more patients to maintain his income. "My clients are able to get primary care here," Sister Mary Ellen said. "But I cannot get any kind of a specialist to see a poor person in the city of Detroit."
Dr. Richard Corlin, a senior officer of the American Medical Association and a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica, Calif., says he won't turn away poor patients sent by a similar clinic in nearby Venice who need gall bladder removals and colonoscopies. But he says the Government, like managed care, is draining his reserves for charity.
Once, Dr. Corlin said, he could "balance bill" by charging wealthy Medicare patients the difference between Medicare's reimbursement for a procedure, which might be $180, and his usual fee of $300, and then use the difference for charity. Balance billing is now prohibited by the Government, and because of falling reimbursements from both Medicare and H.M.O.'s, Dr. Corlin says he now collects 50 percent of his standard fees, compared with 75 or 80 percent 10 years ago.
Such complaints by health care providers help explain the findings of a survey in June sponsored by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which specializes in health-care philanthropy. "Contrary to a common belief that the uninsured are able to get the medical care they need from doctors and hospitals, in 1997 uninsured adults were four times more likely than those with private health insurance to say they did not receive the medical care they believed to be necessary," the survey found. "Over half said they had postponed getting care, and a quarter had not filled a medical prescription -- both because they could not afford it."
The Kaiser foundation and many providers of charity care say shortchanging the uninsured by treating them only in emergencies is often more costly than preventive care -- for the patient, for the health care provider and for the overall economy.
An uninsured diabetic is cheap to treat when he is delivered comatose to an emergency room and dies. But a more typical emergency-room visit brings charges of $200 to $500, which the hospital often swallows as charity care.
Dr. Joy Everson, director of patient financial services at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, says an "emergency treat and release" costs $50. An EKG costs $125, and the doctor who reads it charges $50 to $100. Holding a patient for observation costs $26 an hour. Admitting him to the hospital costs $725 a day.
 
'Train Wrecks'
In the argot of emergency rooms, many uninsured patients are "train wrecks." They show up every month or so, with asthma attacks or chest pains, and incur similar charges each time. But a patient in a managed care plan, receiving the regular preventive care that prolongs lives and spares the emergency room, is cheaper to care for.
"One reason people dismiss the problem of the uninsured is that they don't believe people are turned away," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "They're right. What happens is people delay getting care. And when they get it, they are more expensive to treat."
Dr. Jonathan Weisbruch, director of the Maricopa County Health Department in Phoenix and a former medical director for the county of Los Angeles, estimates that universal care and prevention could curb the nation's $1 trillion spending on health care by one-third. "If we intervene with people when they're 45 years old, get them to do things like stop smoking and reducing their weight," he said, "imagine what that would do to the cost of Medicare after they're 65."

HEADLINE: Slump in Tourism Is Seen Through End of '99

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DORADO, P.R., Aug. 30

 BODY:
A tourism industry leader says the global market is unlikely to recover until 2000 from the combined effects of the Asian economic crisis, Russia's deep financial trouble, the slump in stock prices and new concerns about terrorism aimed at the United States.
Geoffrey Lipman, president of the London-based World Travel and Tourism Council, told a business forum here on Saturday that "the world's major tourism-generating markets are under new pressures." 
 The travel group had originally forecast industry growth averaging 7 percent a year through 2008. But the Asian economic slump began to take the steam out of the travel market in mid-1997, and the group now expects the market to remain flat through 1999.
"In the short term, I don't think we'll see any growth on global terms," Mr. Lipman said on Saturday, ahead of today's opening of the Southern Governors' Association's three-day meeting here with Central American presidents. "There aren't very many positive signs out there."
In mid-1997, Mr. Lipman said, "we saw a marginal downward shift in virtually every indicator, and based on recent events, I expect we'll push recovery out to the beginning of the millennium."
He said it may be a few more weeks before industry experts can gauge the full impact of the downturn in the Japanese economy, which has been dominant in Asia.
Asia's economic troubles come as European nations continue to struggle with high unemployment and nervous companies around the world limit corporate travel spending amid fear that last week's stock market selloff could be an early warning of recession.
Despite the travel group's pessimism for the next year or so, it views the current problems as a downward blip in an industry whose economic importance has tripled in the last three decades and is still rising, Mr. Lipman said, adding, "The regional markets within themselves will still keep some buoyancy."
He predicted that travelers would stick closer to home -- with Europeans still traveling within Europe, Asians within Asia and Americans within the Americas. That could create new opportunities for Latin America to capitalize on its warm climate, relative stability and proximity to the United States, with its huge number of foreign travelers.
"Foreign visitors are an export in trade terms," he said. "That's often forgotten."

HEADLINE: After Hurricane, Loss of Beach to Erosion Appears to Be Inevitable

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORTH TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C., Aug. 28

 BODY:
In the aftermath of Hurricane Bonnie, officials looking across the flat stretches of beach that once held sand dunes can see that they may be fighting a losing battle against erosion.
Hurricane Bonnie, which pummeled the North Carolina coastline this week, took with it about 60 percent of the dune line along North Topsail Beach, the northernmost stretch of Topsail Island north of Wilmington, N.C. Erosion has chipped away at the 25-mile-long barrier island, and, in a few places, its width has been whittled to about 150 yards. 
 The disappearance of parts of the dune line after large storms is not surprising, said Dr. Orrin Pilkey, a geologist at Duke University in Durham.
"This is the most dangerous island community in North Carolina and one of the most dangerous along the East Coast," Dr. Pilkey said. "The dunes are all artificial and extremely fragile, and, all in all, it's an island community that should not have been developed if common sense were to prevail."
The island, once undeveloped and a haven for surf fishermen, has grown rapidly in the last few years, as developers have built condominiums and resorts. Even Hurricanes Fran and Bertha two years ago, which knocked down first and second rows of houses in places on the beach, did not deter development.
Although it has taken time for homeowners to rebuild and for businesses to recoup losses, new houses replacing those damaged by the storms are scattered on the island. The hurricanes also took much of what remained of the island's maritime forests, which help slow erosion.
"I've not seen a hurricane have a big impact on development just other than to bring in bigger and better buildings," Dr. Pilkey said. "That's really fundamentally the impact these things have. It's really an urban renewal project."
But hurricanes, development and the natural give-and-take of the tide have taken their toll on the dunes. While the southern end has maintained a larger natural berm, other parts of the island's dune system have had to be rebuilt. Sand from the island has repeatedly been bulldozed into 10-foot-high piles, which offer some protection from the tides, but are not as stable as natural dunes and have to be replaced after storms.
"I'd be willing to bet they lost 120 feet in the last 20 years," said Bill Cleary, a professor of geology at the Center for Marine Science Research at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
Tony Hammond, the town manager of North Topsail Beach, said the cost of replacing the dunes was justified if it saved houses.
"The dunes that had the vegetation seem to have held up better," Mr. Hammond said. "The ones with the limited vegetation didn't do as well."
Dr. Pilkey said Topsail Island was never intended to accommodate development.
The constant chipping away of sand is proof that the island is doing what nature intends, he said. The island has a small natural sand supply and is at a stage where it is beginning what he calls true migration. Barrier islands, like Topsail, become thin from erosion and begin over washing, which moves sand into the sounds that separate them from the mainland. The over washing widens the side closest to the mainland while the opposite side erodes.
"That translates into island moving," Dr. Pilkey said. "This is an island that wants to migrate."
But homeowners do not like island migration. For several years, the town has used bulldozers to pile up the sand, creating an artificial dune system.
After Hurricane Fran, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed North Topsail Beach $1.6 million of the $2 million cost of creating an emergency berm, by bulldozing sand displaced by storms, said Jay Eaker, an agency spokesman.
Although these efforts will cause the island to migrate more slowly than it would naturally, Dr. Pilkey said, the process is inevitable. If hurricane activity increases as predicted -- and brings them to the North Carolina coastline with the regularity of the 1950's when the state earned the nickname "Hurricane Alley" -- it could work against their best efforts to slow the process.

HEADLINE: Northwest Says Its Final Offer Really Is Final

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Setting the stage for what could be a long stand off, Northwest Airlines said yesterday that it would not alter the dollar value of the final offer it made to its pilots before they walked off the job on Saturday and grounded the carrier's 1,700 daily flights.
Northwest's management seems resolved to stand firm because, in addition to its 6,200 pilots, the airline is embroiled in contract negotiations with about 45,000 other union workers, including its maintenance crews, customer service agents and flight attendants. 
 "The reality of this is once the union goes on strike, the company can't really move from its last tabled position," said Richard B. Hirst, chief labor negotiator for Northwest, which has its headquarters near here. "If we do, we will have to take strikes in every other contract negotiation. We have to draw a line in the sand."
Since the pilots are equally determined to obtain an "industry-leading contract" from the company, the walkout could last longer than the brief period many analysts had predicted before the strike began -- unless President Clinton reverses his position and decides to intervene, a move Northwest would welcome.
New negotiations have not been held since the pilots walked out early Saturday morning and none are expected for a few days, though that could change quickly. Both sides say they are waiting for the other to make a move.
Northwest has already canceled all its flights through the end of Tuesday and some international flights through Wednesday. On Monday the airline will begin laying off some workers. How many was uncertain.
Laying off all its workers would save the company valuable cash, but it would also delay getting the airline up and running for as long as two weeks if the pilots returned. Northwest plans to keep as many workers as it needs to be able to restart the airline before Friday in the hope that the White House will order the pilots back to work in time for them to fly over the Labor Day weekend, which is traditionally a busy travel period.
Officials at the Department of Transportation, who monitored the strike's impact all weekend and have been briefed by the Federal mediator supervising the negotiations, are scheduled to meet officials at the White House on Monday. So far the disruption caused by the strike appears to have been unexpectedly moderate, diminishing the chances that Mr. Clinton will step in.
Nevertheless, hundreds of passengers lined up at the ticket counters of Northwest's competitors at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport today, trying to get seats on the few planes still flying. Northwest usually flies 80 percent of the planes in and out of the airport. Many of the travelers had to be routed through cities like Houston, a hub for Continental, to get to East Coast cities. Northwest also said that 500 passengers were stranded in Hawaii.
A long strike raises the question of whether Northwest will lose more money as a result of the walkout than it would have to pay the pilots by simply agreeing to their demands. The differences between the last two offers on the table before the walkout are $70 million a year over the life of a three-year contract, according to the pilots, and about $100 million a year, according to the company.
Analysts estimate that the net loss will be between $10 and $15 million a day if Northwest lays off most of its workers because the carrier will avoid outlays for its payroll, taxes and fuel bills.
"If it's $10 million a day, a 7-day strike pays for one year of the contract," said Paul G. Omodt, the spokesman for the pilots union.
The pilots gave up $365 million in wages and other concessions in 1993 to help save Northwest from bankruptcy. In return, they received 14.4 million shares of stock and a seat on the airline's board of directors. Since then, Northwest has registered four years of record earnings, while the pilots' pay has not risen beyond where it was before the cuts.
Having grown increasingly embittered as negotiations have dragged on for two years, the pilots want a 15.5 percent pay increase, more generous pension and retirement benefits and greater job guarantees.
Mr. Hirst said that Northwest was willing to compromise on non-economic issues, such as the number of regional jets it can buy, but that it cannot afford to pay the pilots more than their peers at the other major airlines.
Wall Street analysts generally agree with management. While the airline industry has had its best years recently, industry profit levels are still below the average for industrial companies. And Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, generates 30 percent of its annual revenue from Asia -- the largest percentage of any domestic airline. As a result, since the Asian economy began to founder last summer, Northwest has seen its profits decline faster than its competitors.
And yet, some analysts do not expect the airline to adhere to its current negotiating stance if it means a long strike that would force Northwest to spend the $3 billion war chest it has amassed. That, analysts say, could cripple the carrier.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA;
Clinton and Blair Vow Support, if Reform Goes On

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Clinton discussed Russia's crisis by telephone today and agreed that the West was ready to help, but only if Russia continued along a path of economic reform, Mr. Blair's spokesman said.
"There was clear agreement that we're ready to help Russia, but only if Russia is ready to pursue further economic reform," the spokesman said. The reforms, mapped out in a deal with the International Monetary Fund, include demands for better tax collection and reliable conversion of the ruble. 
 If Russia fails to meet its commitments, it could jeopardize its next loan installment from the I.M.F., due to be reviewed next month, worth $4.8 billion.
In Russia, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's prospects of being swiftly approved as Prime Minister by Parliament were thrown into doubt today after Communists said that they would oppose him.
"We have to see whether Chernomyrdin is confirmed, the new government is formed and a program mapped out," Mr. Blair's spokesman said.
The two leaders talked for about 15 minutes. Earlier, Mr. Blair also telephoned other leaders of the major industrial countries -- members of the so-called Group of Seven.
Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to travel to Moscow this week for a summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin, would be "taking a message of reform with him," Mr. Blair's spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Taxi Crackdown Could Backfire, Critics Warn

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW with ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
When Yakub Sachakov, a cabdriver, came off the Manhattan Bridge into Chinatown on Aug. 10, a police officer spotted him making an illegal right turn. After barking orders to stop through a loudspeaker, the officer handed Mr. Sachakov, an emigre from Kazakhstan, a fistful of tickets -- four for failing to follow traffic rules and one for taking too long to pull over.
Mr. Sachakov, 52, was so stunned and demoralized by the blizzard of tickets that he has worked only two days since then. Because of two prior violations, his hack license is almost certain to be suspended or revoked, and he will have to pay hundreds of dollars in fines. 
 As Mr. Sachakov has learned, the rules of the road -- and the consequences of violating them -- have changed drastically for cabbies since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began his crackdown last spring amid growing concerns about taxi safety. Police figures show that ticketing of cabbies is up 36 percent over last year's pace, and city officials acknowledge that it has become fairly common for officers to write multiple tickets for some offenses. In addition, stiffer fines and penalties took effect late last month, and fleet owners are expecting a wave of drivers to be suspended as the latest tickets are processed.
Taxi regulators say this hard-nosed campaign is making cabbies more cautious and should help bring down the accident rate among a class of drivers who have long been criticized for their risky antics. "I think we've got everyone's attention," said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "They know we're serious."
But many drivers and fleet owners, and even some judges in the commission's own court system, say some aspects of the enforcement initiative amount to overkill, and are likely to worsen a shortage of full-time drivers. Other critics say that it is cabbies' desperate need for fares that leads some to drive recklessly, and that if the city wants to improve taxi service and make the largely immigrant driving corps more professional, it must also find ways to make getting behind the wheel more profitable.
"The city's approach is really to use negative reinforcement on the industry, to do tougher enforcement and higher fines," said Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College in Manhattan who has studied the taxi industry. "It seems to me that encouraging a system where drivers can make it a profession and earn a living and stay in the industry awhile would have a much better effect."
Surveys by the taxi commission show that the drivers who receive the fewest traffic tickets are generally those who have been in the business for five years or more and are used to its pressures. So one of the most difficult questions now is whether it is wise to chase drivers out of the business after two or three tickets and replace them with inexperienced drivers who may be no better.
City officials, who regulate nearly every aspect of the taxi business, say they are aware that more needs to be done, and are readying a second round of changes. Last week, the taxi commission announced plans to require more extensive training for new cabbies. It has also scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on one of the most basic aspects of the industry's economics: the fees that most yellow-cab drivers pay to lease their medallions, or licenses, from the cabs' owners.
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie would not say whether her agency is considering major changes. But another new rule, requiring taxis to carry much more accident insurance, takes effect tomorrow. And veteran drivers, especially those who own their medallions, say they fear that insurance costs, which are expected to jump 40 percent, coupled with the new fines of up to $1,000 for each violation, could drive them out of the business.
Indeed, industry officials said, the next major battle might be over whether there should be a fare increase to pay for the safety improvements. The industry would like an increase, but Ms. McGrath-McKechnie has said she sees no need for one. City officials say medallion owners should absorb the costs of the safety improvements and find ways for drivers to make more money.
But so far, the early results of the Mayor's actions are most visible in the tensions on the streets, where the Police Department's taxi unit is monitoring cabbies more closely at busy locations like Pennsylvania Station and other checkpoints.
In interviews, a number of drivers said they recognized the city's need to tighten enforcement of traffic laws, and some said they are driving more carefully now. But city statistics show that the number of tickets issued to cabbies had already doubled from 1995 to last year. And in recent months, the cabbies say, police officers have been issuing tickets that classify many common violations as more severe infractions.
For instance, cabbies complain that police officers have been classifying violations like stopping more than a foot from a curb or driving alone in a restricted lane where cabs must carry passengers as "reckless driving," which carries the highest fines and adds the most penalty points to a driver's record.
Leonard Schwartz, 64, who has been driving a cab for 30 years and has a clean record, was pulled over in late June when passengers who were hurrying to catch a train hopped out of his cab at a red light near Penn Station. An officer issued him tickets for blocking a traffic lane and dropping off passengers more than 12 inches from the curb -- two of the violations that police are issuing more tickets for in an attempt to keep cabs from disrupting traffic flow.
Mr. Schwartz said he could not control the passengers' actions. But what bothered him most was that the officer designated both of the violations as "reckless," and the cabbie faces up to $800 in fines.
"It's just harassment, that's all it is," Mr. Schwartz said.
Other drivers also say they have been treated harshly.
Anna E. Pellow, a 60-year-old widow who raised four children with her earnings as a cabbie, received a criminal summons, instead of just a traffic ticket, for reckless driving after making what a police officer considered an "improper turn" while changing lanes on Eighth Avenue in mid-July.
Ms. Pellow's passenger was so upset by the officer's actions that she wrote and signed a statement on the driver's trip log saying she "did not notice anything unusual re the driving of the vehicle." Ms. Pellow's case has not yet been heard in court, but she has filed an administrative complaint against the officer.
"The police are like wolves going after a bunch of little bunny rabbits," she said.
Taxi and police officials deny persecuting cabbies. "My sense is that the Police Department is not doing anything different than they've ever done," Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said. But some drivers are getting support from an unlikely quarter.
Several judges in the taxi commission's court system, which has a history of upholding the overwhelming majority of the tickets given to taxi drivers, said they have recently downgraded or dismissed reckless-driving charges or refused to accept guilty pleas from drivers who did not understand the seriousness of the consequences.
"Most of the senior judges are looking at these things and they're appalled by it," said one judge, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Most of the cops say they don't like it either, but they have to do what they have to do."
Still, the judges say they also expect many drivers to be suspended over the next few months as tickets written under the stricter laws are adjudicated. In addition to raising fines on July 26, the taxi commission created its own penalty point system, which has a much lower threshold for suspension than the state applies to all drivers.
The commission's new penalty system also applies retroactively to the last 18 months of a driver's record. So just one new ticket could push hundreds of drivers, like Mr. Sachakov, the Kazakhstan native who made an improper turn off the bridge, into 30-day suspensions or cause their licenses to be revoked.
The sting of the new rules is compounded by what drivers call the "double zap," an extra ticket from the commission that usually accompanies a regular traffic summons. Mr. Sachakov is likely to receive five tickets from the commission in addition to the five that the police officer wrote, giving him a total of 10 tickets for that one stop. Depending upon how the commission classifies the violations, his fines could total a few hundred dollars or as much as $1,600.
Members of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents owners of the largest taxi fleets, said some drivers have begun to cut back their hours or look for other work. They said this partly explains why an average of 18.5 percent of their fleets' cars were idle each day in July, up from 13.8 percent each day in July 1997.
Allen Kaplan, one of the fleet owners, said: "There are guys coming in saying, 'Allen, I don't know if I can continue. Maybe I've had it.' And what's disheartening is that these are the veteran drivers, the type of driver we're all looking for."
The taxi commission judges and other analysts wonder whether the cabbies who replace the veterans will be better or safer drivers.
"It will be interesting to see who leaves the business and who comes in to replace them," said one of the judges. "I don't think it's going to be a higher-quality driver at all because nobody in their right mind would want to do this job."
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said it would be a big step forward if the drivers who commit serious traffic violations moved on to other jobs. To improve the quality of new drivers, the commission last week proposed increasing the standard training course to 80 hours from 40, to teach drivers more about geography, courtesy and traffic rules.
But to make lasting improvements, Mr. Rogoff and other analysts say, the commission and industry officials will have to improve working conditions in a business often likened to a sweatshop on wheels.
Some industry officials say they believe that regulators want to reinstate the system that prevailed through the 1970's. Under that approach, fleet drivers were employees with fringe benefits who split the fares with their bosses. Now they are independent contractors who pay $90 to $135 a day to lease their cabs and are then on their own: The more fares they collect, the more they make. Most cabbies say they take home $70 to $100 a day.
Mr. Rogoff said he plans to testify at tomorrow's hearing that leasing is "a very poor system" that gives drivers "all the worst incentives to drive like crazy."
But the fleet owners say they like the way leasing guarantees their income and would resist substantial changes. The new rules have already made it harder to sell their lucrative medallions, some owners said, and they fear that prices would plummet if the city makes more changes.
Mr. Kaplan said he worries that the regulators are "overdoing it."
"There's an old saying that the operation was a success but the patient died," he said.

Those who discharge passengers more than a foot from the curb, as this cabby did last week at Pennsylvania Station, are getting bigger fines and multiple tickets for each traffic stop.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. Officials Wary on Moscow, Fearing Backsliding on Economic Changes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Administration officials warily monitored the maneuvering to form a new Government in Moscow today, disturbed by possible signs of backsliding on Russia's commitment to tough economic changes but reluctant to render a verdict until new personnel and policies were in place.
American officials avoided definitive comment in advance of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow on Tuesday, for fear of appearing to take sides in what promises to be a delicate negotiation among factions in Moscow over the next several days. 
 The official Administration line today was that the Russians themselves would have to sort out the approach that they take to finding an exit from their economic and political morass. Until then the Clinton Administration will make clear its policy preferences but will not try to broker a truce among competing Russian power centers.
"We'll have to see how it all plays out," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said on "Face the Nation" on CBS-TV News. "What is crucial is not words at this point, but actions the Russians are able to take at what is a critical juncture for them and their management of the economy."
A senior Administration official who insisted on anonymity said Washington was discounting much of what it was hearing from Moscow as political posturing during an effort to create a governing coalition. Engaged in the competition for power are those loyal to President Boris N. Yeltsin, the business oligarchy, the resurgent Communists, regional power brokers and advocates of broad economic changes that the West endorses.
"We will give our opinion of the course they choose," the official said. "But we are not going to do it before we have a Government in place and have a chance to sort out what the real policies are."
He said that the United States did not know whether Acting Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin would be confirmed by the Parliament by the time Mr. Clinton arrives.
Until Mr. Chernomyrdin is confirmed, the official added, the Administration will not comment, except to signal what policies it would find objectionable.
Those would include, according to the official, trying to bail out failing banks, granting additional credits to state-run enterprises, flooding the market with newly printed rubles and "other actions that could clearly have inflationary effects."
The Administration would welcome, he added, programs that would allow market forces to work, even if the short-term effects were painful, and measures to insure an economy that functions under the rule of law rather than Kremlin fiat.
"We're going to have to see what the terms are, what kind of economic plan Russia actually carries through on the ground," said Mr. Summers, who will travel to Moscow for the summit meeting.
Another senior Administration official, also insisting on anonymity, said he hoped that Mr. Clinton's visit would put pressure on Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin to stick to the difficult path of reform rather than to accept compromises as the price of remaining in power.
"There's going to be a lot of back and forth," the official said. "But what we really don't know is where Chernomyrdin's heart is. It's really do or die now. Does he understand he can't go back to the old ways?"
But until Moscow's direction becomes clear, the official said, Mr. Clinton and his senior advisers are going to "try to avoid getting sucked into everyday speculation" about who is in power and what they might do.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is leaving his position as the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, described the compromise being negotiated in Moscow as a "very favorable development."
Speaking today on "Meet the Press" on NBC-TV News, Mr. Richardson said the United States was prepared to continue and even expand its financial aid to Russia, if the Government proceeds with changes.
"We're prepared to do more," Mr. Richardson said. "As long as there's economic reform we're going to be there."
Mr. Clinton, who returned today to Washington from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, participated in conference calls with senior aides and his national security team, White House officials said.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN RUSSIA: NEWS ANALYSIS;
When Minds Do Not Meet

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Judging by how the grand and improbable alliance between Russia's pro-capitalist leadership and its Communist critics exploded this evening -- on television, spectacularly, in a crossfire of accusations and threats -- one might think these people hadn't a clue about what to do with their country.
In fact, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government and the Communists who run Parliament have plenty of ideas for keeping the country from sliding into insolvency, social chaos and third-world status. The problem is that their ideas are diametrically opposed. 
 It is hard to conduct government by consensus if there is no consensus. And seldom, it seems, have two political bedmates been more incompatible than these two.
Nor is the mismatch going to disappear, even if global pressure in the form of President Clinton, who arrives on Tuesday, persuades the two sides to glue together some sort of agreement.
Westerners have no right to snicker. A glance at the last six years of divided government in the United States shows that democracy in action is not an especially appetizing sight. The problem, of course, is that most Western democracies accept the rule of law and the division of powers among executives, legislators and courts. Despite huge strides, Russia is still a place where rumors of coups are taken seriously and where the popularity of a leader -- or his unpopularity -- affects not only his power but also his legitimacy.
Consider a few contradictions: Mr. Yeltsin and his choice for Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, have concluded that Russia's salvation hinges on adoption of Western market capitalism, even if Russified by a coterie of tycoons. The Communist Party, led by the legislator Gennadi A. Zyuganov, wants to renationalize major industries and the banks.
Mr. Chernomyrdin has pledged to do what it takes to persuade the West's line-of-credit officer, the International Monetary Fund, to continue doling out portions of a $22.6 billion loan package agreed to last month. Mr. Zyuganov said today that he wanted the terms of the package rewritten to ease its bite on ordinary Russians.
Mr. Chernomyrdin talks of a Europeanized Russia. Mr. Zyuganov dreams of Soviet days gone by, and Parliament's nationalist bloc still fondly recalls the czars.
Mr. Zyuganov wants Mr. Yeltsin gone and substantial power shifted to Parliament via a new constitution. Whatever Mr. Chernomyrdin thinks, Mr. Yeltsin is still President, and he is dragging his feet on those questions. That may have been the clincher that led Mr. Zyuganov to reject so publicly the power-sharing agreement this evening.
The alternative -- approval and fulfillment of the accord -- might in some ways have been as strange as the scene that unfolded on television tonight.
It is easy to forget, after seven years of a democratic Russia, that Mr. Yeltsin became President by ousting a Communist system that he has repeatedly called cruel and despicable. For his part, Mr. Zyuganov has long been organizing a nationwide strike, called for Oct. 7, against Mr. Yeltsin's Government.
Should a mongoose-and-cobra alliance have been arranged, the new Government would have melded Mr. Zyuganov's Communists with a President backed by pro-market theorists and a Prime Minister whose most ardent supporter is Boris Berezovsky, a capitalist in the bloodless image of Commodore Vanderbilt.
Though disillusioned, many Russians still hope for a democratic future. But a hard core of 25 percent or so would still support a Communist system of government, and an unknown number of others look for an autocrat to lead them out of troubled times.
One of the things that makes Russia's fiscal collapse so devastating is that it has laid bare that absence of consensus about where Russia should be going next.
Mr. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996 with 53.8 percent of the vote but has seen his popularity go into precipitous decline. Mr. Zyuganov, who finished second in that presidential race with 40.3 percent of the vote, wants not only a change in economic policy but a rewrite of the Constitution as well.
Whether he will get it is now questionable. Tonight's breakdown seems to mean that Parliament will vote to reject Mr. Chernomyrdin's appointment when it meets on Monday. If no compromise is reached, Mr. Yeltsin could dissolve Parliament and call for new elections, hoping to win a few new supporters to his side.
In the interim, Russia remains rudderless at a point where almost everyone agrees that there is no time to waste. Mr. Chernomyrdin said today that he knew where to begin to resolve the crisis, but that "time must not be lost."
"The country cannot function without a government," he warned.
Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired army general, once and future presidential candidate and leading prospect in some eyes to become Russia's next autocrat, is even blunter.
"The choice is simple," he said today. "The confirmation of the Prime Minister, formation of a new team of energetic people and the presentation of a program for leading Russia out of crisis, or a total breakup."

HEADLINE: Strike by Pilots Cuts the Cord That Sustains North Dakota

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: GRAND FORKS, N.D., Aug. 30

 BODY:
People here figure they can handle almost anything.
After the thundering flood waters that last year forced the evacuation of the entire city -- all 50,000 people -- what could faze them? But the pilots' strike that has grounded Northwest Airlines since Saturday morning is already trying people's patience. 
 It marooned Joe Larson in Minneapolis and made him miss his grand-nephew's wedding. It is causing Ron Boonstra to bow out of his fertilizer company's annual training session in Peoria. It may keep out-of-state students from the first week of classes at the University of North Dakota. And it threatens to put the kibosh on one of Grand Forks's biggest events this year: the national women's amateur slow-pitch softball tournament.
In fact, virtually everything in Grand Forks, North Dakota's third-largest city, depends in some way on Northwest Airlines. Northwest delivers the mail here. It brings medical supplies for the hospital, flowers for the florists, even goldfish for the pet stores. No other passenger airline flies in or out.
"It'll affect just about every one of us," said Mayor Pat Owens of Grand Forks. "People don't usually come here unless they fly. Now, we're land-locked."
No negotiations were planned today between the pilots and Northwest's officials. Page A12.
For the rest of this spread-out, wide-open state, where the prairie rolls on forever and the rural roads are like miles of string threading tiny towns like beads, this single airline has become an umbilical cord. The only other commercial carrier that flies in and out is United Express, the commuter arm of United Airlines, which runs only a smattering of flights in the state: In Fargo, which is the largest city by far, there are three 30-seat flights most days and in Bismarck, the state capital, there are six 19-seat flights most days.
Earlier this month, afraid of a Northwest strike, Gary Ness, the executive director of the state Aeronautics Commission, sent a letter to 20 airlines, begging them to route a few planes North Dakota's way. He got no takers.
Now, Mr. Ness predicts the economic cost of the strike will be about $365,000 a day statewide, about 1 percent of the gross state product, and that is only counting the cost to travel-related industries like travel agents, hotels and car rental companies.
It does not measure the cost, for example, to the North American Bison Cooperative, which each day flies about $10,000 worth of buffalo on Northwest to New York and Boston, where butchers turn it into steaks and buffalo burgers. "I imagine we'll have to give up on most of it," said Dennis Sexhus, the chief executive officer, who says the Northwest shipments represent about 5 percent of his bison business.
And it does not account for the frustration of people like Bill Antongiovanni, a nuts, bolts and screw salesman who was supposed to be taking his 4-year-old granddaughter, Taylor, to stay with him in Bakersfield, Calif., while her parents in Fargo prepared to give birth to a new baby. After hours on the phone, Mr. Antongiovanni, 56, booked the only flight he could, out of Billings, Mont., a 10-hour drive away.
But for North Dakota, the potential cost is almost more painful than the actual loss. It is not only the North Dakotans who want to fly elsewhere, but cannot. It is the people who will not come.
The thing is, not too many people come to North Dakota to begin with. With 2.9 million visitors a year, it is the least visited of any state, said Bob Martinson, the director of the North Dakota Tourism Department. The outlet malls in Freeport, Me., home of L.L. Bean, get more visitors a year than all of North Dakota.
"One of those national weather guys can destroy us in a 30-second piece -- 'Snowstorm in North Dakota' -- as though we are the only state that has winter," Mr. Martinson said.
The state has been trying hard to promote tourism any way it can, aware that drivers do not tend to stumble upon North Dakota on their way to somewhere else. It has jumped on the Lewis-and-Clark bicentennial bandwagon, hoping to lure visitors to see where the exploring team spent a long winter in 1804 and 1805. It is playing up its Wild West image and American Indian heritage, especially in Europe.
But the strike may have already dealt a setback. A group of European travel writers is supposed to fly in on Wednesday for a state tour. "If we miss that window, we lose the whole winter publication time," Mr. Martinson said. "They won't be coming back until the spring."
Some towns try to draw visitors (and free labor) to potato-picking festivals. And then there is Norwegian tourism in a state where every third resident has a Norwegian ancestor. There is a large Norwegian festival in Minot in October. And Grand Forks has been wooing groups of Norwegians to visit Red River Valley farms where, "they are just amazed at the six feet of black soil," said Char Brekke, the manager of Brekke Tours here. She added that they also "enjoy going to the cemetery and seeing all these Norwegian names on the tombstones."
Grand Forks is also trying to capitalize on a bubble of flood tourism. City tourism staff hop aboard tour buses and show people where the water was, a flood exhibit has been set up at the museum and a new restaurant, the Red River Cafe, has built a brick wall inside its dining room that is the height of the water during the flood. The idea, said James Tsismanakis, the executive director of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, is that "you're sitting there and in a sense you're under water."
Without people flying into Grand Forks, these and other economic generators could languish. Steve Johnson, the executive director of the Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority, figures that without Northwest's four jets and three small flights run by its AirLink partner, Mesaba Airlines, each day, the city will lose at least $50,000 a month in airport fees. And hotels like the C'mon Inn are already getting cancellations.
But beyond just tourism, people here worry the strike will end a kind of cross-country pollination: people coming to the state and North Dakotans venturing out for all sorts of global village reasons. The mail can be trucked in. Businesses can send and receive items via Federal Express. But when the nearest jets fly into Winnipeg, Manitoba (a two-and-a-half-hour drive), or Minneapolis (five hours), that puts a real damper on things.
Northwest is "not just the economic lifeline, it's the social and cultural lifeline also," said Hal Gershman, who runs a chain of liquor stores called Happy Harry's Bottle Shops.
But the bigger fear is that once the strike is over, Northwest will be forced to cut some of its routes and will sacrifice -- where else? -- North Dakota.
"Our concern is that we continue to be served by Northwest, a national airline, and not be downgraded to a regional airline," Mr. Gershman said. "You fall off the screen on certain things when you do not have a national airline serving your city. I think that's a major economic, social and cultural threat to all of North Dakota. Are you a destination, or are you not?"

HEADLINE: Market Selloff Could Forecast Trouble Ahead

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The sharp selloff in stocks has led a growing number of people on Wall Street to wonder whether the stock market, often a leading economic indicator, may be forecasting a recession in the United States.
The stock market is down nearly 14 percent in the last six weeks, with more than a third of that loss coming in the last week. The stock market has not experienced such a prolonged downturn since 1990 -- when the United States last slipped into a recession. 
 So far, few economists believe the end of the nation's seven-year economic boom is near. Like most investment strategists on Wall Street, they think that even if stock prices had risen too high, jobs are plentiful and housing is booming. And there are no indications of inflation that might cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, the typical precursor to an economic slump.
Even though corporate profits are slowing down because of the economic difficulties in Asia, there are few signs yet that this weakness is widespread enough to cause the United States' total economic output to begin to shrink.
But if the drop in stock prices continues, it could shake the confidence of the many American consumers who accumulated considerable paper wealth in the 1990's bull market. If these consumers begin to cut back their spending, that might be enough to further weaken corporate profits, sending the economy into at least a stall, if not a downturn.
And beneath the surface of the booming American economy is a disparity that financial analysts say cannot last. "Americans recently have been spending faster than their incomes have been rising," Greg A. Smith, the chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities, said. "Could their spending be even stronger next year? I don't think so." In recognition of that fact, Mr. Smith said, the stock market is anticipating "a profits recession, if not an economic recession."
Still, some economic experts say the stock market's recent decline has not yet been severe enough to change investors' psychology. "The average investor doesn't believe he will be impacted by this," said John Cleland, the chief investment strategist for the Security Benefit Group, a mutual fund company in Topeka, Kan. "The enormous wealth that has been created over the last three years means that most people are playing with the house's money." For their outlook to change, investors will have to get a sense that the money they are losing is their own, he said.
Albert Wojnilower, an economist at the Clipper Group, a Wall Street investment firm, agrees. "If the stock market does not fall much from where it is now, I think all this will have zero effect on people's spending habits," he said.
Yet some investors already appear to be pulling back from the stock market, perhaps in recognition that more of Americans' total wealth is tied up in stocks today than at any time since the end of World War II. Individuals have rushed to buy more stocks after every significant market decline since 1990. But in recent weeks, as many of their mutual fund investments have begun to show losses for the year, investors have been funneling more cash into the safer havens of money market funds.
Some of that reaction can be traced to the general feeling of uncertainty that has grown in recent months, as the economic troubles overseas have worsened. "It isn't that the stock market is predicting a recession," Peter L. Bernstein, a New York economist and consultant, said. "What's happening is much more complicated than that. There is a sense that people really don't understand what makes the world work, and they don't know what to do about it. Two months ago, people understood how the world worked, and in case anything happened, Alan Greenspan was there to make everything come out right."
The stock market starts the week with the Dow Jones industrial average coming off its worst week in nine years and, at 8051.68, the index is 13.8 percent below its high of July 17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader market indicator, has posted a similar decline. If the Dow falls into the 7,000's, the psychological effect could be great on investors accustomed to seeing a far larger number on the nightly news.
To prevent that, many Wall Street analysts say that what the stock market, if not the economy, needs most is for interest rates to decline further. Some analysts hoped that the Federal Reserve might move in that direction after last week's symposium of economists in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which was sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. Until now, the Federal Reserve has leaned in the direction of raising rates to keep inflation under control.
Some of the more traditional signs of an economic downturn have begun to show up on Wall Street as well. The companies that would be hit hardest by a recession are those in cyclical industries, like manufacturers of heavy equipment and big-ticket items like cars or jet airplanes.
Harnischfeger Industries, for example, a company based in St. Francis, Wis., whose subsidiaries manufacture huge pieces of machinery used in paper-making factories and for surface and underground mining, said last week that it would lay off 20 percent of its work force, or 3,100 people, because of "ongoing weakness in all our businesses" that is expected to extend into 1999. Harnischfeger's stock price last week fell to its lowest level in four years.
Similarly, Boeing's share price has given up two years' worth of gains as slowing sales of jets to Asian buyers has started to create a glut of planes. Auto stocks have fallen 15 percent in the last six weeks on concerns that American consumers might be willing to make do with their not-so-old current models.
And stocks of financial companies, particularly banks, have been hit hard as investors have absorbed the impact of losses from loans made to developing countries, particularly Russia. The coming weeks are expected to bring more disclosures of losses on Russian operations similar to those made last week by Republic Bank, BancAmerica and J. P. Morgan.
Some people on Wall Street see nothing to worry about in those developments. Abby Joseph Cohen, the bullish investment strategist at Goldman Sachs & Company, for example, sees the best opportunities for investors in financial, technology and cyclical stocks.
"What we have seen among many of the financial service stocks is certainly a whole wall of worries," Ms. Cohen said. But in addition to concerns about their exposures to developing countries like Russia, bank stocks are often the stocks in investors' portfolios that have gone up the most over the last few years.
"If investors are inclined to raise a little cash, they look to sell the stocks that have gone up a lot," Ms. Cohen said. "But we think the change in fundamentals has been dramatically overstated" by the recent decline in financial and other stocks.
Others are not so sure. Generally, banks make money by first borrowing money at low, short-term rates of interest and loaning it out at higher, long-term rates. Currently, however, some short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates -- a situation known on Wall Street as an inverted yield curve. As with the recent drop in stock prices, the last time interest rates maintained such a skewed relationship was in 1990, just as the American economy was stumbling into a recession.
"The Federal Reserve has enough room to lower interest rates should they see fit to do so," said Richard Cripps, the chief investment strategist for Legg Mason Inc., the Baltimore brokerage and investment firm. "And the American economy still has room to grow. But companies like Gillette and Coca-Cola are going to get hurt" by their dependence on sales outside the United States to generate profits.
Those companies have been the source of some of investors' greatest gains in the recent bull market. Already, declines in the general market are eating into the profits Americans have accumulated in recent years. Through Friday, the average general equity fund had lost about 2 percent of its value since the beginning of the year, according to fund tracking companies.

Did the Economy Bring Down a President?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
President Clinton's ability to maintain strong approval ratings for the job he is doing, if not for himself as a person, has mystified some commentators. It certainly stands in sharp contrast to the tumbling poll numbers shown by Richard Nixon during the Watergate investigation that ultimately led to his resignation.
One explanation for this phenomenon is that Americans think sex is a private matter, and are as much offended by the fact that Mr. Clinton was forced to testify about sex as by the possibility that he committed perjury. Perhaps it is not offensive to cover up conduct that never should have been made public to begin with. By contrast, Nixon's conduct was a violation of the Constitution, and his efforts to cover it up stirred a public that eventually turned on him. 
 All that makes sense. But it may not be the whole explanation. Other things were happening in 1973 and 1974 when Nixon's approval ratings were plunging. Most notably, the economy and the stock market were putting in their worst performance in a generation, in large part due to an international crisis that might have been better handled.
It is impossible to separate the effects of Watergate and economic maladies on Nixon's falling ratings because they were occurring simultaneously. In October 1973, Arab armies attacked Israel, which asked for and got massive American aid to prevent defeat. On Oct. 20, a day after Nixon made public the extent of the aid, Arab oil producers declared an oil boycott. On the very same day, he fired the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, in the Saturday Night Massacre.
The Arab oil boycott led to a sudden increase in the price of oil and sent much of the Western world into recession. The stock market, already weak before the Middle East war broke out, entered the worst bear market since the Depression, a decline that did not end until two months after Nixon resigned in August. By then, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 45 percent from its peak.
History is never run twice, so it is impossible to know what would have happened had the Nixon Administration pursued a different course before and during the Mideast war. There were people in the Nixon Administration who were aware of the growing American dependence on Arab oil. But those concerns were not paramount either before the war broke out or during it, when American aid to Israel inflamed Arab opinion. Would things have been different if the President had not been preoccupied by scandal? Probably not, but there is no way to be sure.
To return to 1998, the American economy and the President's poll ratings have been doing very well. But economists have been surprised by the depth and the duration of the Asian problems, and financial markets are worried that they will spread to Europe and the United States. The collapse in Russia has unnerved investors, as soaring oil prices did a generation ago.
It is not clear what the Clinton Administration could have done to prevent the Russian collapse, or what it should do now. But the threat to the American economy is now greater than at any other time in the Clinton Presidency, and at a time when there is reason to doubt the President's attention is strictly on his job.
Perhaps, just perhaps, Mr. Clinton's ability to survive this scandal will depend more on how well his Administration deals with the economic crisis than on whether he is proved to have lied about sex.

After Just Playing Around, Dent Is Set to Go to Work

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

 BODY:
Taylor Dent's 6-foot-2-inch, 195-pound physique says that he belongs in the United States Open. So does his last name: his father, Phil, was once a Grand Slam finalist and a Davis Cup stalwart for Australia.
But Taylor Dent's birth certificate tells a different story. At 17 years 4 months, he is the youngest player in the main men's draw. And when he takes the court against Alex Radulescu of Germany in the first round today, he will be discarding the safety net of amateur tennis for good. 
 As a professional, Dent is now eligible for plenty of prize money and plenty of pressure; for complimentary hotel rooms and complementary expectations.
But then Dent has been dealing with economy-sized expectations since he won the United States Tennis Association's 14-and-under and 16-and-under national titles in consecutive years.
"I think he's got an incredible amount of ability," said Tom Gullikson, the U.S.T.A.'s director of coaching. "I think he's got a big game and the potential to do very well on the pro tour."
As one of an extremely small group of American boys currently considered to have such potential, Dent has been swarmed by agents; he has heard the encouraging words of elders, and now he and his father/coach are convinced that the time is right to make the leap: not straight into the top 10, mind you, but into the arena.
"I've beaten all the best juniors, and I think the pros is the next step for me," Dent said with a wide, can't-miss grin and not the slightest hint of trepidation. "It's the right timing because I'm right there with the top guys. Last week at Long Island, I beat some guy who was ranked 58th in the world. Regardless of what anybody says, when you're ranked that high, there's not much separating the top. It's just up here," he said, pointing to the side of his head.
"It would be different if I was getting blown out of matches, just getting smoked. But I'm holding my own, and I just need the consistency of competing with these guys day in and day out."
Dent, who has a powerful all-court game, a huge serve and a one-handed backhand that he can slice or drive effectively, did beat the world's 58th-ranked player: Mariano Puerto of Argentina. He also pushed the former Wimbledon semifinalist David Wheaton, now ranked 210th, to three sets in the first round in Indianapolis.
But not everyone agrees that Dent is ready. Dick Leach, the father of the professional Rick Leach and coach at Southern California, said Dent could benefit from a year or two of college tennis. But Phil Dent, who has coached his son since he began playing at age 11, has a different perspective, although he is very quick to emphasize that his son's game is a work in progress.
"I don't want to blow this out of proportion because he's not ready," Phil Dent said. "I know the expectations are there because there aren't many American guys really, but in my eyes, if his potential level is a 10, he's probably only at a 4 right now. He's just beginning.
"Every guy playing in the U.S. Open junior event here except for the Americans is basically a pro. They get money from agents and clothing firms. They play money tournaments. All going pro excludes Taylor from doing is playing tennis in college and maybe a couple of national junior tournaments. It does not necessarily mean he will not play any more junior events. But I think he's ready to be out there on the tour."
Marketability was also a factor in the Dents' decision.
With American prospects scarce, Taylor's appeal to sponsors is magnified. And though the Dents say they have yet to sign any deals, negotiations on a multimillion-dollar contract are well under way with at least one firm.
Though Taylor spent several years in Australia as a child, he was born and spent most of his life in Southern California. The only time he sounds Australian is when he imitates his father, who reached the Australian Open final in 1974. Taylor has never seen footage of his father at his best.
"I've hidden all the film," Phil Dent said. But the truth is that both of Taylor's parents were worth watching. His mother is Betty Ann Stuart, a former top-20 professional player. Dent and Stuart divorced when Taylor was 12. Since then, Taylor has lived with Phil.
Father and son are close, teasing each other about their respective tempers and respective laundry habits, and they will soon be in even closer quarters as they roam the world in pursuit of tour computer ranking points.
Phil is not concerned about his son's ability to adapt to nomadic life.
"To tell you the truth," Phil said, "Taylor even likes airline food."

As Drugs in Sports Proliferate, So Do Ethical Questions

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Mark McGwire, the brawny St. Louis Cardinals first baseman, has become a folk hero to many people for his skill at hitting home runs, baseball's most dramatic -- and clear-cut -- feat. The ball flies out of the park, or it doesn't. But McGwire's recent admission that he has used a testosterone-boosting compound for the past year has led him and his fans into a place where uncertainties abound.
The substance used by McGwire, called andro stenedione and originally developed for performance enhancement by East Germany's state-sponsored athletic drug program in the 1970's, in many ways epitomizes the new wave of performance drugs that is sweeping through the sports world, and its use underscores the ambiguities and questions that have arisen: What do these substances do? How can they be detected? Should they be legal? If they are legal, is it ethically right to take them? How should fans feel about athletes who do? 
 Last month, the top team in the Tour de France was expelled after a team car was discovered to have a trunk-load of drugs, including a blood thickener and drugs that mask steroids. Earlier this month, two former Olympic gold medalists from the United States, the shot-putter Randy Barnes (who tested positive for androstenedione) and the sprinter Dennis Mitchell, were suspended by track and field's world governing body for suspected drug use. Members of the Chinese national swim team were banned earlier this year after vials of human growth hormone were seized in their possession. In all of those cases, the drugs were -- unlike traditional anabolic steroids -- not directly detectable by current lab tests.
The difficulty is compounded by big money and science, intertwined in the so-called natural supplement and additives industry that has arisen following Federal deregulation in 1994. The loosening of the laws dealing with food supplements -- intended to encourage the market for herbal remedies and natural products -- created an opening for products like androstenedione (pronounced an-dro-steen-DIE-own) which can be derived from things like the Mexican yam plant and the Scottish white pine. Manufacturers and medical experts say these products would not have been available over the counter under the old Food and Drug Administration rules.
By calling a substance a supplement and carefully avoiding any claims that it can cure a medical condition, a product can be labeled a food even though in most of the world it is a controlled substance.
"It's opened the door for a lot of people to push the limits of the law," Millard J. Baker said of the 1994 law. Baker is the founder and editor of Mesomorphosis, an on-line magazine that follows the supplement and muscle-building industry.
The changes in the law have also altered how the United States is regarded in the world sports community and have changed American attitudes, medical experts say, about products that might once have seemed risky, but which can now be purchased over the counter like vitamins or painkillers. Sports trainers and athletes say that what was once unthinkable has become common -- foreign athletes are coming to the United States to buy performance-enhancing substances like andro stenedione that are illegal in their home countries.
Meanwhile, other substances like creatine, an amino acid powder also said to help build muscles, have become as unremarkable as free weights in locker rooms from high school on up to professional teams. The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who has been running neck and neck with McGwire in the race to break Roger Maris's single-season home run record, is one of many athletes who says he takes creatine. Creatine has not raised the same alarms as androstenedione, but physicians say its long-term effects are not known.
It all adds up to big profits. The supplement industry had $12 billion in sales last year, up from $8 billion before the Federal law took effect, says Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication.
The result is a multilevel conflict -- for drug-detection labs and suppliers, each racing to keep ahead of the other; for athletes who are, as always, pressured to find and keep a competitive edge, and for fans who must decide what they want or do not want their sports heroes to be.
Conflicting Claims
And Differing Bans
 Androstenedione is banned by the National Football League, the International Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which also ban all anabolic steroids. Federal law treats anabolic steroids as controlled substances, available only by prescription. Major League Baseball bans illegal drugs and a list of other substances, including anabolic steroids. The National Basketball Association currently has no drug policy that includes testing for steroids, and the National Hockey League bans only illegal drugs. General Nutrition Centers, one of the biggest retail chains, does not sell androstenedione because it says it is not yet convinced that it is safe.
"The line between what is effective and legal and what is effective and illegal is fading -- it's not clear anymore because the people who are making these other substances are getting very good and they are finding ways to dim the line," said Harold Connolly, a former Olympic hammer-thrower and world record-holder who used steroids in the 1960's before coming out against their use.
The man generally regarded as the father of androstenedione production in United States -- an Illinois chemist named Patrick Arnold, who translated German medical documents and patents in the mid-1990's after the fall of the Soviet Union -- said he thinks the product is safe when taken correctly. Unlike traditional steroids, which can make testosterone levels soar to dangerous levels, so-called precursor substances like androstenedione are converted to testosterone within the body. Arnold said he thinks the body can create only so much testosterone by this method and no more -- the rest, he said, simply gets washed out.
"If you take more, you cannot breach this ceiling, so far as we can tell," said Arnold, who created the first commercial batches in the United States in 1996. "You will not reach superphysiological levels."
Now the news about McGwire and the confusion about whether scientists like Arnold are correct seem to have sparked efforts to reconsider the new compounds and the supplement industry in general.
Major League Baseball and its players union said they would look at the medical and performance aspects. The International Olympic Committee proposed setting up an agency to coordinate drug testing around the world. The Association of Professional Team Physicians, made up of doctors from most major league sports in the United States, this week called on baseball to denounce and ban androstenedione.
Meanwhile, sales of health and performance-enhancement products have surged from the publicity, and companies are racing ahead with new products. Last week, Met-Rx, a company in Irvine, Calif., with which Arnold is affiliated, said that it was developing a gum that boosted testosterone -- three times more effectively than the stuff McGwire takes, company officials boasted -- while you chew. Another company has developed a steroid that dissolves under the tongue. Advertising copy on the Internet bursts with claims about everything from better state of mind to heightened sexual performance.
 
Beyond Legality, Ethical Questions
But there is much more than pharmacology to the McGwire story. In many ways, McGwire's testing of his own limits at the plate has become a test for Americans in general, experts in ethics and sports say.
Should there be limits, either in morality or law, on how much and through what means an individual can improve upon fate or genes? Should enhancement efforts for athletes be considered differently from the efforts of ordinary people to improve their states of mind through drugs like Prozac, their sexual performance with drugs like Viagra or their hairlines with drugs like Propecia? What, in a time of exploding interest and economic growth in natural herbal substances and medicines, is a drug? What does the term "natural" even mean?
Many drug monitors say that as testing has improved, "natural" substances -- harder to detect in the body, and with a legal base of operations under the Federal food supplement law -- have become the last refuge for cheaters.
"In today's world, athletes who are determined to cheat know that natural substances are the way to go," said Dr. Don H. Catlin, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at U.C.L.A. and a member of the medical commission of the I.O.C., which specifically banned androstenedione late last year. Catlin said many newer substances, including androstenedione, cannot be detected by current tests and are new enough that many leagues have not formed policies about their use -- which makes them attractive to athletes on multiple levels. "And there's a whole cornucopia of other things right behind it," Catlin said. "That's where things are going."
Compounding the questions is that McGwire, in chasing one of the most hallowed records in sports, has tapped into a vein of romance and nostalgia for a supposedly sunnier, more innocent time.
"I think this taps some pretty deep roots about what sport means to us -- because it's baseball and baseball has a special place in the American psyche," said Tom Murray, the director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University and a member of the anti-doping committee of the United States Olympic Committee. "Ultimately, this is a question about values. I think people are really struggling with it."
Most awkwardly, perhaps, people are struggling with what to tell young people, both about what is safe and about what, if anything, it means that a star like McGwire, a man with a wealth of positive attributes, looks for a controversial edge.
"Instead of telling kids not to take it, he comes out and says, in effect, 'It's O.K. because it's allowed,' " said Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, the president of the New York chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine. "He needs to say, 'What I'm doing for me is my business, but for you kids, there's evidence that this stuff is like steroids -- listen to your doctors and don't be buying it.' "
Some professional athletes, while not criticizing McGwire for his supplement use, say he has to be careful because so many kids hang on his every word and deed.
"There's a lot of kids out there who think that if the home run king is doing it, then I should be doing it," said Mark Jackson, the Indiana Pacers point guard. "It's time for him to put out his own warning label for the kids of America, to tell them that no one knows the long-term effects of what he is using and it could prove to be harmful."
 
Confusing Message To Young Athletes
Many baseball fans, including parents of young children, say that they are willing to give McGwire the benefit of the doubt.
"I don't fault him for trying to enhance his performance," said Larry Rhine, a chiropractor from Allentown, Pa., who was in Williamsport, Pa., last week with his 8-year-old son, Mark, watching the Little League World Series. "If he's within the legal bounds of Major League Baseball, it shouldn't taint him at all." Rhine said his son did not seem to be having any second thoughts either: Mark still got up every morning eager to see if McGwire or Sosa had hit another home run, Rhine said.
Arnold, the chemist, agreed in an interview that no one under 18 should think of using androstenedione. He said that the company he works with, Met-Rx, is careful to put such warnings on its products. But he admitted that the implications of such use are largely unknown. A 16-year-old male, for example, whose body is already producing a bumper crop of testosterone, probably would not be harmed by taking the compound, Arnold said.
"But it's sort of an unknown," he added.
Companies that sell supplements say that business has never been better. Chico Laney, who started a mail-order supplement company, Muscle Up, out of his parents' house in San Jose, Calif., three months ago, said that before the McGwire story broke, sales were slow -- sometimes only one order a week. Over the past week, however, he had received six to seven orders a day, mainly for androstenedione, which he gets from an Oregon manufacturer.
Laney said that at least one of the calls was from a 45-year-old man who had heard that boosting testosterone would cure impotence. Laney said he was not sure, because he really did not know himself what androstenedione would do.
"I didn't guarantee that it was going to do that," Laney said. "I told him to call back, because I'd be curious to know."
