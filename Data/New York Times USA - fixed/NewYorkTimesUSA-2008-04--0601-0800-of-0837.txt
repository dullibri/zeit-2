HEADLINE: In Hudson Heights, a Bid to Keep the Economy's Woes From Becoming Their Own

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Joanna Czech cringed at the sight of the plastic cup of water that a colleague had set in front of her. She allows only the finest things at her Washington Heights spa: Bodum mugs made of heat-resistant glass, cashmere blankets, stainless-steel appliances and a state-of-the-art, $20,000 skin care machine.
 Some might call Ms. Czech, 44, a stickler, or even a diva. But it is this type of care and service, she said, that has kept customers streaming in and out for luxuries like detoxifying algae wraps, even at a time when necessities can be difficult to afford. 
 ''Women, they want to come, they want to talk; it makes them feel better,'' said Ms. Czech, who was born and raised in Poland. ''They say, 'Joanna, I can give up my pair of shoes, but I cannot give up my monthly facial.' ''
 Ms. Czech is among several foreign-born business owners in a quiet nook of Washington Heights known as Hudson Heights who are going the extra mile to keep their customers during the current downturn in the economy. Their lives are examples of an often-told immigrant experience: survival through hard work and meticulous attention to detail.
 A Chinese real estate agent whose office is across the street from Ms. Czech's spa occasionally offers pro bono advice to buyers and sellers, and she will spend hours with them discussing how much their homes are worth or how much they can realistically afford. A Greek woman who owns a diner around the corner says she works roughly 15 hours a day, six days a week, allowing her to hire fewer employees and keep a close eye on the service and food.
 If there were a place for business owners in Washington Heights to succeed during financial turmoil, Hudson Heights would be it. 
 Over the years, Hudson Heights -- a quaint enclave that stretches roughly from 181st Street on the south to Fort Tryon Park on the north, and from Broadway on the east to Riverside Drive on the west -- has attracted more affluent residents than the rest of Washington Heights, where the overall average household income in 2006 was less than $45,000, according to the United States Census Bureau. In Hudson Heights, one-bedroom apartments can fetch as much as $1,800 a month in rent and two bedrooms for nearly $3,000. Two-bedroom co-ops and condos can cost as much as $800,000. Much of the construction is prewar, and there are even some Tudor-style facades. A fortresslike wall stands along the community's western edge.
 And the demographics of Hudson Heights differ from that of Washington Heights, which is mostly Hispanic.
 When City Councilman Robert Jackson first moved into his two-bedroom rental on 183rd Street 30 years ago, he said in a recent interview, his neighbors were older-generation Jewish and German immigrants with surnames like Schild, Blumenthal and Kaiser. As that population has died off, middle- to upper-income young professionals and families have taken their place, he said.
 And the newer residents want amenities close by. ''They're looking for places to eat, rather than go downtown,'' Mr. Jackson said.
 That has been a blessing for Vicky Limberis, 49, a Greek immigrant who took over Angela's Coffee Shop four months ago. The diner sits on Hudson Heights' main drag, a sloped stretch of roughly 100 yards on 187th Street between Fort Washington and Pinehurst Avenues.
 But the weak economy is affecting Ms. Limberis in the form of soaring food prices. 
 The price of a 50-pound bag of pancake mix, for instance, jumped to $38.50 from $28.50 in a week, she said. By working long hours and taking care of various tasks on her own -- cooking, tending the counter, washing the dishes -- Ms. Limberis is trying to keep afloat without raising prices.
 Eventually, she suspects, prices will have to go up. But she hopes that her customers' habits will help her survive.
 ''They're used to eating out, meeting friends when they go to restaurants,'' Ms. Limberis said. ''And they like the food.''
 As recently as 10 years ago, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly residential, said Simone Song, a Chinese immigrant who runs a real estate company, Simone Song Properties. Back then, she said, many homeowners resisted incursions by business establishments, fearing that they would detract from the quaintness of the community.
 Now, the main drag is eclectic. The cuisine in the restaurants along the short block include Asian fusion, Southwest, kosher baked goods, Chinese, Italian and Mediterranean. What used to be a meat market on 187th Street has been transformed into a well-polished supermarket and deli.
 Ms. Song said it was business as usual for her agency. But that is not by chance, she said -- she and her agents work hard to keep up with market trends.
 The agents all live in the neighborhood and forge close bonds with their clients. One of her agents once lent a client money to take care of a personal issue, she said. Ms. Song said a young couple trying to sell a co-op on their own once came to her for advice. She went to their place, free of charge, to check it out and offer tips. They were so appreciative, she said, that they eventually hired her to help them sell it, and she charged them 50 percent of her typical fee.
 Ms. Czech opened Sava Spa five years ago with a business plan that would allow her to survive if she could secure 120 regular clients, those who come at least four times a year. She now has 1,000 to 1,500 regulars, she said.
 Her clientele includes celebrities like Uma Thurman, Liam Neeson, Kyra Sedgwick and Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler. The celebrities occasionally expect house calls, adding yet another dimension to customer service.
 For Ms. Czech, whose spa decor has a European touch, loyalty to her customers is vital.
 ''My creation is to treat problems,'' said Ms. Czech, who moved to the United States 19 years ago. ''To treat foot problems, to treat skin problems, to help instead of just creating a relaxing atmosphere.''
 That attitude has made Susan Adler, 48, a weekly client. At most spas, Ms. Adler, a hospital administrator, said, ''it's often a very rushed kind of experience where it's almost like an assembly line.''
 But Sava is relaxing, she said, and a chance to take her mind off the tumbling stock market. ''There's something very important in taking care of yourself in a hectic, depressing world.''

HEADLINE: Revival of a River Alters A City's Course in Sports

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY 

 BODY:
As the nation's top kayakers and canoeists dipped their paddles in the Oklahoma River over the weekend while competing for a spot on the United States Olympic team, it was possible to imagine that a few city leaders had something else on their minds.
 Like, take that, John Steinbeck.
 Almost 70 years after Steinbeck popularized the plight of Oklahoma's Dust Bowl refugees in ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' residents here still chafe at the city's reputation as a barren place. As recently as a decade ago, the river was a scar through the city's heart, at times a trickle of water in a ditch so overgrown it had to be mowed three times a year.
 Civic leaders and politicians gambled millions that a rejuvenated river would attract investors to an economically struggling city known for its love of football and rodeo. But to the surprise of even those behind the effort, the river has spawned something else. 
 The city has become a mecca for elite water sports. Last fall, a crowd of 50,000 showed up for a rowing competition that drew Olympic athletes from Australia and the Czech Republic. Three local universities have begun varsity rowing programs, and a fourth is considering one. 
 ''We completely did it by accident,'' Mayor Mick Cornett said.
 After a series of floods devastated the area in the 1920s, Oklahoma City and the United States Army Corps of Engineers sought to prevent future catastrophes by straightening, widening and redirecting a stretch of the North Canadian River away from the population center. 
 ''They said, 'That will never happen again,' '' Cornett said. ''And sure enough, they took all the water out of our river.''
 Talk of bringing the river back persisted for decades, especially as civic leaders and planners searched for ways to turn the city around after the oil bust of the 1980s left the local economy reeling. In 1993, taxpayers narrowly approved a sales tax dedicated to an ambitious redevelopment, including the creation of a ballpark, an arena, a library and a trolley system. The tax also included money for the river. 
 In 1999, engineers began erecting a series of dams and locks that transformed the ditch into a bona fide waterway. Along with the Corps of Engineers, the city planted thousands of trees and added wetlands and walking trails along the banks.
 By the time the corridor opened to the public in December 2004, the city and the federal government had spent a combined $54 million. State legislators renamed a seven-mile stretch the Oklahoma River, and private investors built a futuristic boathouse.
 The city has since attracted an estimated $700 million in new development. A Dell office complex is on the riverfront, and a multimillion-dollar American Indian Cultural Center is under construction. 
 Renaming the river was the idea of Ray Ackerman, an advertising executive from Oklahoma City who said he cringed whenever he flew over the ditch on his way home. Ackerman argued that the name North Canadian River would confuse out-of-towners, but the change drew grumbles from many longtime residents who worried history was being erased.
 People like Ackerman saw economic opportunity in the river. Mike Knopp's view was more elemental -- the newly filled waterway could now float a boat. Knopp, a rowing enthusiast, looked at one 2,000-meter stretch that was perfectly straight and realized the Army Corps of Engineers had unwittingly created an ideal location for a boat race. 
 ''It's very spectator-friendly,'' he said. ''And that is pretty unique, to have an urban venue like this.''
 In 1998, Knopp invited Pat Downes, a consultant to the Oklahoma City Riverfront Redevelopment Authority, to a regatta on a nearby lake. It was a cold, rainy day, Downes recalled, but he saw an opportunity. ''The sight of those long, graceful rowing shells on a body of water is truly a remarkable sight,'' he said.
 The river's potential as a sporting site has become an integral part of city leaders' dreams for the future. Of course, the city continues to pursue other sports projects. Last week, for example, N.B.A. owners approved the relocation of the Seattle Supersonics to Oklahoma City. Still, little has captured the community's imagination more than boating.
 Knopp quit his job as a lawyer and became the rowing coach at Oklahoma City University, one of the three local universities that offer rowing as a varsity sport with athletic scholarships.
 With the help of corporate donors like the locally based Chesapeake Energy Corporation, Knopp set about building a state-of-the-art boathouse. It filled almost immediately after opening in 2006. 
 Jim Abbott, the athletic director of Oklahoma City University, said he was skeptical when Knopp approached the institution. 
 ''This is Oklahoma -- we're football, we're rodeo,'' he said. ''So rowing five years ago was nowhere on the minds of the average Oklahoman.''
 But he quickly saw the benefits. Since September 2003, when the team began, 70 athletes have enrolled at the university because of the rowing program. 
 ''The four largest events in the history of our university are the four regattas that we've hosted,'' Abbott said. Those events now draw the nation's top rowing teams, including Harvard, and attendance has quintupled since the first regatta was held in 2004, Abbott said.
 The sport's popularity has grown so fast that the three university teams are planning to build boathouses along the river, and another university is considering erecting a fourth. There is even talk of constructing a white-water course near the new boathouses.
 Kayakers at the weekend Olympic trials, which drew between 10,000 and 15,000 spectators, said they had heard about Oklahoma City through their friends in rowing. Aside from some concerns about the city's ferocious winds, the athletes said they were pleased. 
 ''I think they've definitely proven that they can provide a solid race course and event,'' said Carrie Johnson, who earned a spot on the Olympic team in the 500-meter single kayak event on Friday. 
 Johnson was the only athlete over the weekend to be definitively selected for the United States team; the rest will be selected after races in Montreal and Szeged, Hungary. 
 ''The actual boathouse is one of the best that I've seen,'' she said.
 The Oklahoma River has also won over Norman Bellingham, the chief operating officer of the United States Olympic Committee and a gold medalist in kayaking. 
 ''I was a little bit in disbelief,'' he said, recalling his initial reaction to rowing in Oklahoma City. ''I had to come out and see it myself.''
 Then, at the USA Rowing World Challenge held in Oklahoma City last October, Bellingham spotted a top competitor from New Zealand. He said he knew the site had been accepted.
 Perhaps the best test, he said, was that he got few questions when he told people where the Olympic trials were being held. In the boating world, ''it seems like a very natural, logical statement to make,'' he said. ''You don't get that second look like, did I hear that correctly?''

HEADLINE: Schools Have To-Do Lists Ready After Record Influx in State Aid

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU; Ford Fessenden contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ROOSEVELT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Like a lottery winner suddenly surrounded by well-wishers, Robert-Wayne Harris, the superintendent of the scandal-scarred and long-suffering school district here, has been bombarded with calls from textbook peddlers, education consultants and community groups. The district, which was $8 million in debt last fall and worried about whether it could make payroll, is newly flush with $10.8 million in extra state money to spend in the coming school year.
 ''People think it's a lot of money, but it's really not when you look at educating a child,'' cautioned Mr. Harris, who was appointed in September to run the district, which has been under state control since 2002 because of decades of mismanagement and weak student performance. ''It's still just bringing your head above water. We're not drowning, but we're still in the water.''
 The 2,700-student district, whose proposed budget for next year is $78.8 million, plans to use the additional $10.8 million to, among other things, buy 10,000 English, math and science textbooks; build another technology lab in the high school; hire a new guidance director; replace band instruments and uniforms; and have an orchestra for the first time in years. 
 Roosevelt, whose looming deficit was cleared in January with a one-time $8 million state bailout, is like a grand-prize winner in a state budget cycle in which virtually all of New York's nearly 700 school districts ended up with at least a consolation prize, and some of them with much more. With overall education spending jumping by a record $1.7 billion to a total of $21 billion, every district will get more operating money, though about two dozen wealthy suburban districts, including Jericho, Great Neck and Amagansett on Long Island, ended up with decreases of up to 9 percent in total state aid because of shifts in other categories. 
 The windfalls come as public school systems around the country are facing layoffs and program cuts. The largest gains, according to an analysis by The New York Times, are in small rural and urban districts, often with growing numbers of poor and disadvantaged children: Putnam Central School District near the Vermont border, which has 84 students, topped the list with an increase of nearly 79 percent, or $157,257. Aid to New York City schools will rise 8.5 percent to $8.2 billion, while its suburbs will receive substantially bigger increases: an average of 12.1 percent for districts in Nassau County, 9.6 percent in Westchester County and 8.8 percent in Suffolk County.
 ''This is not one of those years when you're going to hear people complaining that they didn't get enough state aid,'' said David Albert, a spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association. ''Education was probably the only area spared the budget knife.''
 Some school officials, feeling pressure to improve test scores under the federal No Child Left Behind law, said the new state money would enable them to expand academic programs and services. Others said the money would prevent program cuts or layoffs to cover higher costs for salaries, benefits and utility bills. 
 Most said that despite more state aid, they would still seek modest increases in school taxes, though by far less than they otherwise would have. Residents will vote on district budgets on May 20.
 Kathleen Grimm, New York City's deputy schools chancellor for finance and administration, said the money would help reduce class sizes, increase class time, promote professional development, restructure middle and high schools, expand early childhood programs and provide support for students with limited English proficiency.
 The 4,600-student South Country Central School District in Suffolk County will receive a 35 percent increase, or $14.3 million. Of that, $11 million is marked for continuing renovation of seven school buildings, said Susan A. Agruso, the superintendent. Dr. Agruso said that her district had cut programs in leaner years, and that the large state aid increase meant that the district would not have to delay its plans to lengthen the high school day to nine periods from eight, add two more Advanced Placement courses in history and computer science, and start an alternative high school program for struggling students.
 In Westchester, the Chappaqua district received a 2.7 percent increase in state aid, or $179,128, that will, among other things, help pay for a new interdisciplinary Chinese class combining language, culture and history at the high school. ''Everything helps,'' said David Fleishman, the superintendent of the 4,281-student district. ''This is another revenue stream that helps us maintain and expand what we already do during challenging economic times.''
 But nearby, the 1,761-student Briarcliff Manor district has decided against starting any new initiatives with its additional $460,780 in state aid, a 12.3 percent increase after a slight decrease the year before. Frances Wills, the superintendent, said the money would be used for one-time fixed costs: replacing the carpet in the high school library, purchasing more chairs and tables for the high school cafeteria, installing an irrigation system on a practice field and repairing a boiler in an elementary school.
 Dr. Wills said that the district had planned conservatively for next year because it faced decreasing tax assessments from local businesses and a worsening economy that could force state legislators to cut the state aid increases mid-year, as they did in the 1991-92 school year. ''We don't want to get caught if that happens,'' she said
 In Nassau County, Great Neck had a 2 percent decrease of $165,763, but was able to offset that loss with a $200,000 grant from a separate pool of money secured by a local legislator. The district was considering a 6.4 percent increase in school taxes, but now can keep it under 6 percent. 
 ''At least we broke even compared to last year, thanks to the efforts of local legislators and others at the state level who made this happen,'' said Great Neck's superintendent, Ronald L. Friedman, noting that the state's share of his district's budget has dwindled to 4 percent from 11 percent in 1989. 
 Here in Roosevelt, the additional $10.8 million includes a $6 million increase in an annual state grant for academic improvement and $4.8 million more than last year, or nearly 12 percent, in other state aid.
 Mr. Harris said that Roosevelt still spent far less on its students than some of its wealthier neighbors, and that the new money would help to provide things taken for granted in other schools, like a textbook for every student. It will also help cover the cost of opening a middle school in September, including the hiring of custodial and security workers and the paying of utility bills. 
 The money has already made a difference to Ilce Gonzalez, whose 5-year-old daughter, Naomy, is in kindergarten. Roosevelt reduced kindergarten hours two years ago because of budget problems but restored the full-day program in February. Naomy now takes classes in music, library and art that she did not have before. ''I'm very excited because she has more time in school, and she's learning more,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said.
 At the Ulysses Byas Elementary School, the band practices in a makeshift space in the gym, interrupted by shouting and bouncing balls. The musicians are selected by lottery because the district does not have enough instruments for everyone who wants one. More than 100 students are turned away every year in the elementary grades, said Kevin Sheehan, the band teacher, who called Mr. Harris to lobby for more instruments.
 Sarina Murray, a fourth grader,plays a worn alto saxophone, patched together with masking tape, which was handed down from her cousin and sister. She said that she gets frustrated because the instrument often squeaks, and ''you can't play right without good instruments.''
 Mr. Sheehan now travels to his classes in the three schools with a rolling suitcase stuffed with masking tape, pliers, screwdrivers, and other tools to hold together ancient instruments. 
 ''You learn to fix what you can,'' he said. ''So basically tape, rubber bands, and glue, that's my specialty, unfortunately.''

HEADLINE: Army and Marine Corps Grant More Felony Waivers

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
Strained by the demands of a long war, the Army and the Marine Corps recruited significantly more felons into their ranks in 2007 than in 2006, including people convicted of armed robbery, arson and burglary, according to data released Monday by a House committee.
 The number of waivers issued to active-duty Army recruits with felony convictions jumped to 511 in 2007, from 249 in 2006. Marine recruits with felony convictions rose to 350 from 208. 
 Over all, the numbers represent less than 1 percent of the 115,000 new enlistments last year in the active-duty Army and Marine Corps.
 Coupled with sharp increases in the number of waivers for misdemeanors, the trend raises questions about the military's ability to attract quality recruits at a time when it is trying to increase enlistment. The Army, which has suffered the most war casualties and the longest deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, faces an especially difficult challenge in attracting qualified men and women.
 From Sept. 30, 2006, to Sept. 30, 2007, the Army granted so-called conduct waivers for felonies and misdemeanors to 18 percent of its new recruits, an increase of three percentage points from the previous year. So far, in just the first six months of this fiscal year, the Army has granted waivers to 13 percent of its recruits. 
 ''It raises concerns,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which requested the information on felony waivers from the Department of Defense. ''An increase in the recruitment of individuals with criminal records is a result of the strains put on the military by the Iraq war and may be undermining our military readiness.''
 Mr. Waxman said his committee had requested additional information on the specifics of the felony waivers, the rationale for granting them and the waiver program's track record.
 Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder of the Air Force, a Defense Department spokesman, said waivers were used among the services rarely and judiciously. Dispensations are granted only after a careful review of any applicant's record and the circumstances surrounding the charge or conviction, Colonel Ryder said. Often, he added, the charges occurred when the recruits were juveniles and were less serious than they appeared initially.
 Only one in three young men in the general population meet the physical, mental, educational and other eligibility requirements to enlist in the armed forces. Colonel Ryder said that in the past year, the percentage of waivers issued to people with criminal histories and medical conditions declined for the Defense Department in general.
 ''The services continue to ensure that numerical recruiting missions are met with above-average young men and women from across America,'' Colonel Ryder said. ''Low unemployment, a protracted war on terror, a decline in propensity to serve and a growing disinclination of influencers to recommend military service make the current environment a challenging one for recruiters.'' 
 The 2006 and 2007 Pentagon data released Monday show for the first time the number of dispensations issued for specific felonies. The number of Army waivers for aggravated assaults with a dangerous weapon rose to 43 from 33. Waivers for burglaries increased to 106 from 36. Waivers for possession of narcotics, excluding marijuana, rose to 130 from 71 and for larceny to 56 from 26.
 In the Marine Corps, waivers for burglary convictions rose to 142 from 90, while those for aggravated assault increased to 44 from 35.
 The Army also listed a handful of felony waivers granted for kidnapping, making terroristic threats, rape or sexual abuse, and indecent acts or liberties with a child. 
 Lt. Col. Anne Edgecomb, an Army spokeswoman, said the waivers had been carefully vetted and were not as serious as they appeared on paper. The kidnapping charge involved a divorced woman who moved out of state with her child without the permission of her former husband, she said. One terroristic threat charge involved a 14-year-old who called in a bomb threat to his school, and the other also involved a minor. 
 The rape and sexual abuse charges stemmed mostly from relationships between minors and older boyfriends, Colonel Edgecomb said. None were violent sexual crimes, she added.
 ''We take this incredibly seriously,'' Colonel Edgecomb said. ''This is our Army, too. We have to serve with the people we allow in.''
 Military analysts, though, say these are exactly the kinds of recruits who would never have been allowed into the Army before the war in Iraq. To reach its recruiting targets, the Army has had to soften many of its requirements. It now allows in more recruits who did not graduate from high school and who received lower test scores in their service entry exams. Recruits are older and less physically fit. And there are more people in the service with medical conditions that would have otherwise disqualified their enlistment.
 ''With the Iraq war being as controversial as it is and absent any higher level call to service, it's a very difficult challenge to all the services, particularly the Army,'' said Michele Flournoy, the president and co-founder of the Center for a New American Security, a centrist research organization that focuses on national security and military policies. ''The fact that the use of waivers has increased dramatically is something that should be of concern and should be watched over time.''

HEADLINE: A Day of Fluctuation and Light Trading

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Investors turned cautious again Monday after another record-breaking tear in oil prices and disappointing news from Bank of America and National City Corporation, a Midwest bank.
 Bank of America said its first-quarter earnings fell 77 percent on write-downs and widening credit losses. National City said it received a $7 billion cash infusion from equity investors, lowered its dividend and posted a $171 million loss for the first quarter. 
 Still, the market performed relatively well Monday, climbing back from an early plunge. Part of the reason was that not all the earnings on Monday were downbeat. Merck said its profit nearly doubled in the first quarter because of a $1.4 billion distribution from a partner drug company and a slight rise in sales.
 With little in the way of economic data scheduled to arrive this week, investors are looking at a big flow of corporate reports for insights into the well-being of the economy. Because investors have already taken huge amounts of money out of stocks, the market fluctuates as traders retreat after disappointing news but then take advantage of bargain prices.
 ''The percentage of cash on the sidelines, as a percentage of market value, is the highest it's ever been,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. ''We have an acute level of risk aversion by investors -- understandably so.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.34 points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,825.02, after dropping 98 points in early trading.
 Broader stock indicators closed mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.16 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,388.17, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.07, or 0.21 percent, to 2,408.04.
 The technology-dominated Nasdaq got a boost from Apple, which rose $7.12, or 4.4 percent, to $168.16 after an RBC Capital Markets analyst lifted his price target for the stock and predicted the company's fiscal second-quarter results will surpass expectations.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.07 points, or 0.43 percent, to 718.00.
 Rising oil prices, meanwhile, weighed on some stocks, including airlines, but bolstered energy companies, including Exxon Mobil, which rose 26 cents, to $94.26. 
 Crude rose 79 cents to close at a record $117.48 a barrel, on supply worries and speculative buying.
 AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 57 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $8.20; United Airlines' parent, UAL, declined $1.42, or 6.2 percent, to $21.43; and Continental Airlines lost $1.19, or 5.4 percent, to close at $20.67.
 Volume, at 3.03 billion shares, was down from 4.12 billion shares on Friday and the lowest since Jan. 3. Many traders took the day off for the Passover holiday.
 Bank of America stock fell 95 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $37.61. National City shares tumbled $2.30, or nearly 28 percent, to $6.03.
 Merck fell 13 cents, to $39.63.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32, to 98 5/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.73 percent, from 3.71 percent. 
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: The Error of Ethanol

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Fuel Choices, Food Crises and Finger-Pointing'' (front page, April 15): 
 Regarding the issue of food or fuel, the issue may not be one or the other per se, but rather the enormous subsidies for corn ethanol in the United States and similar, more modest ones in Europe.
 By most reckonings, a barrel of gasoline displaced by corn ethanol costs the United States Treasury somewhere between $36 and $65 with almost no reduction in harmful greenhouse gases. This pushes production of ethanol way beyond what makes economic sense, adding more pressure on food prices and the cost of land for planting other foodstuffs. 
 Driving less, driving a smaller car or switching to the bus reduce oil needs and greenhouse gas emissions by a far greater amount than ethanol alone could do.
 And then more of the world will have more food choices at affordable prices, while energy and oil demand will go down.

HEADLINE: In a Red State, a Blue Dog Has Republicans Worried

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: WEST POINT, Miss. 

 BODY:
Republicans' longstanding sway in this in this red corner of Mississippi could be tested here Tuesday in a special Congressional election in which a down-home Democrat is given fair odds of winning. 
 The seat had been considered a lock for President Bush's party: a Republican, Roger Wicker, held it for 14 years before resigning to fill a Senate vacancy late last year; Mr. Bush won 62 percent of the vote here in 2004; and the Congressional district has some of the most conservative voters in the nation. Its placid unofficial capital, Tupelo, is home to the Christian conservative minister Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association. 
 But the Republicans' hold is being unexpectedly tested by a self-described ''Mississippi Democrat,'' a gregarious local courthouse official whose positions on social issues -- guns, abortion, same-sex marriage -- are indistinguishable from those of the other party. Democrats are hoping to add the candidate, Travis Childers, 50, to the raft of conservative ''Blue Dog'' Democrats elected in the 2006 midterm elections, due partly to economic appeals and doubts about the war. 
 If anything, those pitches have been sharpened in the campaign of Mr. Childers, a veteran of grass-roots politics in a state where many local officials are still Democrats, despite the Republicans' solid grip on national elections here. 
 Up and down the rolling hills, black-soil prairies and small towns of this upstate district stretching north to Tennessee, Mr. Childers makes frequent appeals to what he calls ''working folks'' struggling in a weak economy, and expresses his opposition to a war policy he says is ''not working.''
 He has been bolstered by his conservative positions, his network of contacts and the more tenuous connection to the district of his Republican opponent, Greg Davis. Mr. Davis is mayor of a Memphis suburb, Southaven, which many here consider barely part of Mississippi. 
 In an appearance in the university town of Oxford, Mr. Childers quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and, as he often does, told the students that he was forced to support his family, as a teenager, after his father died. 
 ''True conservatism was going to work full time when you're 16,'' Mr. Childers said, echoing that theme as he campaigned outside a retirement home in the old brick downtown here. 
 Inside a restaurant, he greeted county courthouse workers with familiarity. They were part of a network he has built up over 16 years as chancery clerk, or county financial manager, in a county to the north of here. 
 For all his connections, a Childers victory would still be an upset -- Mr. Davis has outspent him two-to-one to fill what is left of the term, which runs to the end of the year. But it would also be a warning to Republicans about general prospects in the fall.
 ''If Travis Childers wins Tuesday, that will be a siren in the night for Republicans,'' said W. Martin Wiseman, a political scientist at Mississippi State University. ''If he wins, it's just absolutely huge.''
 Even Republicans acknowledge that the race appears to be close. The party has turned to advertisements questioning, among other things, care at a nursing home owned by Mr. Childers, a campaign style that has disconcerted some Republicans more used to the genteel politicking of candidates who have long known one another in a largely rural, close-knit district. 
 ''It could go either way,'' said Alan Nunnelee, a Republican state senator in Tupelo. ''People are frustrated with the aggressive campaign tactics that have been used, particularly on the Republican side. The Republican camp has been much more aggressive than people in northeast Mississippi are used to.'' Mr. Nunnelee said he was nonetheless sticking with his party.
 Not so one of the state's Republican eminences, Jack Reed Sr., who once ran a credible race for governor and led the Mississippi Economic Council. A businessman in Tupelo, he is supporting Mr. Childers, citing ''the personal appeal of the candidate'' and ''dissatisfaction with the Bush administration.'' 
 The Republican Party is hewing to a campaign tactic that has proved successful in defeating other Democrats in the South: tying them to national Democratic figures who are held in deep suspicion here, especially the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. 
 ''I think northeast Mississippians understand the implications of voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House,'' said Jim Herring, chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party. ''You look at the presidential race -- the best they've got to offer are extremely left-wing candidates.'' 
 Mr. Davis, a former state representative whose town is in the state's fastest-growing county, echoed those thoughts in an interview, saying he was the ''real conservative'' in the race. ''I won't be voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker,'' Mr. Davis said, ''and I won't be standing beside Clinton and Obama in the fall.''
 He has staked out a difference with Mr. Childers on the Iraq war, saying of a timetable for withdrawal, ''We need to leave that decision to the experts.''
 Mr. Childers, who has been quoted as calling for a withdrawal of troops, scoffed. ''His message is, stay the course,'' he said. ''But that cookie cutter message is not working. How long can you put a round peg into a square hole? Those people have been fighting for centuries.''
 Interviews here offer evidence that Mr. Childers's approach may be catching on with voters who described themselves as Republicans and independents.
 ''Something just stands out about him,'' said Marty Sullivan, manager of a real estate management firm. ''It's his openness. He doesn't dodge any questions.''
 Still, most reckon the election is for the Republicans, and Mr. Davis, to lose. ''If they lose in this, they better reconnoiter and figure out where they need help,'' Professor Wiseman said.

HEADLINE: Banks and Beyond

 BODY:
Rumors of the demise of the credit squeeze have surely been exaggerated. At the end of last week, after a string of dismal first-quarter reports from some of the nation's biggest banks, stocks rallied, propelled in part by investors' belief that the worst was over. 
 On Monday, however, Bank of America -- the nation's second-largest bank behind the ailing behemoth, Citigroup -- reported results that were much worse than expected. And like many other banks -- including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Washington Mutual and Wachovia -- it said it was adding billions of dollars to its provision for future loan losses, a sign of more pain ahead. The stock market, so enlivened last week, flattened. 
 Far from signaling a recovery, then, recent bank losses suggest a difficult recession ahead. In addition to problems with mortgage securities and leveraged buyout loans, losses are mounting now for credit cards, auto loans, home equity loans and other debt, including mortgages made to credit-worthy borrowers. 
 Like the banks that are trying to get ahead of the next round of losses by setting aside heftier reserves, Congress must reassess its responses to the downturn. 
 The best place to start is by rethinking economic stimulus. When Congress passed the existing stimulus package, gasoline was around $3 a gallon. By the time the rebate checks start going out in May, gasoline is likely to be well on its way to $4 a gallon. At that price, much of the $100 billion or so in rebates will go to fill Americans' tanks, a bigger boost to nations that sell oil to the United States than to the United States itself. 
 The next round of stimulus, which Congress should be considering now, must accomplish what the first round neglected. It must focus on bolstered unemployment compensation and bolstered food stamps, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent on the neediest and on programs that are proven to spur the most economic activity for every dollar provided. The nation cannot afford more misguided giveaways.
 The more difficult issue is housing. Until housing picks up, no economic turnaround is possible. As the excesses of the bubble years are worked off, lawmakers can provide confidence by coalescing around relief efforts to ensure that families and communities are helped to the fullest extent possible. Most important, Congress must not continue with efforts that have not worked to date, namely, appeals to the mortgage industry to act voluntarily to help distressed borrowers. Instead, lawmakers should allow bankrupt homeowners to have their mortgages modified under court protection and carefully and quickly vet the possibilities for taxpayer- financed assistance.
 Distress has spread from the financial sector to the broader economy. Congress is behind the curve and needs to catch up.

HEADLINE: Gannett Reports Earnings Decline; A. H. Belo Falters

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Newspaper publishers reported more trouble from the weak economy Monday as the industry leader, Gannett, posted lower first-quarter revenue. 
 The A. H. Belo Corporation, spun off two months ago from the broadcaster Belo Corporation, also disappointed investors Monday with a warning that its earnings would be ''substantially below'' the company's expectations.
 Gannett, based in McLean, Va., said the economy weakened further during the quarter, especially the latter half of March. Advertising revenue for March dropped 12.8 percent, an even greater year-over-year decline than the 8.3 percent in February.
 Overall earnings at Gannett, often seen as a bellwether for the industry, came in line with analysts' expectations, declining 9 percent, to $191.8 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding a gain on the sale of land, earnings were 77 cents a share.
 Revenue performance at Gannett reflected the pressure on the industry as it copes with the weak economy. Gannett owns 85 daily newspapers in the United States, including USA Today.
 Gannett's total revenue fell 8.4 percent, to $1.68 billion, while newspaper advertising, the bulk of the company's revenue, fell 10.2 percent. 
 Investors punished A. H. Belo's shares after the newly minted company delivered its profit warning in a letter to shareholders and said 2008 was shaping up as a ''very difficult year.'' Shares of A. H. Belo plunged $1, to $10.97 Monday.

HEADLINE: Price Volatility Adds to Worry On U.S. Farms

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Fred Grieder has been farming for 30 years on 1,500 acres near Bloomington, in central Illinois. That has meant 30 years of long days plowing, planting, fertilizing and hoping that nothing happens to damage his crop.
 ''It can be 12 hours or 20 hours, depending,'' Mr. Grieder said.
 But Mr. Grieder's days on the farm in Carlock, Ill., are getting even longer. He now has to keep a closer eye on the derivatives markets in Chicago, trying to hedge his risks so that he knows how much he will be paid in the future for crops he is planting now. And the financial tools he uses to make such bets are getting more expensive and less reliable.
 In what little free time he has, Mr. Grieder attends Illinois Farm Bureau meetings to join other frustrated farmers who are lobbying officials in Chicago and Washington to fix a system that was designed half a century ago to reduce uncertainty for food producers but is now increasing it. 
 Mr. Grieder, 49, is shy about complaining amid so much prosperity. Prices for his crops are soaring on the updraft of growing worldwide demand, and a weak dollar is making the crops more competitive in global markets.
 But today's crop prices are not just much higher, they also are much more volatile. For example, a widely used measure of volatility showed that traders in March expected wheat prices to swing up or down by more than 72 percent in the coming year, three times the average volatility for that month and the highest level since at least 1980. The price swing expected in March for soy beans was three times its monthly average, and the expected volatility in corn prices was twice its monthly average.
 Those wild swings in expected prices are damaging the mechanisms -- like futures contracts and options -- that in the past have cushioned the jolts of farming, turning already-busy farmers into reluctant day traders and part-time lobbyists.
 One measure of the farming industry's frustration is the overflow crowd expected at a public forum on Tuesday at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington. Interest is so high that the commission, for the first time ever, will provide a Webcast of the forum, which it says is being held to gather information about whether crucial markets for hedging the price of crops ''are properly performing their risk management and price discovery roles.'' The Webcast link is available on the commission's Web site, www.cftc.gov.
 The additional costs that stem from volatility in grain prices -- higher crop insurance premiums, for example -- are not just a problem for farmers. ''Eventually, those costs are going to come out of the pockets of the American consumer,'' said William P. Jackson, general manager of AGRIServices, a grain-elevator complex on the Missouri River.
 Prices of broad commodity indexes have climbed as much as 40 percent in the last year and grain prices have gained even more -- about 65 percent for corn, 91 percent for soybeans and more than 100 percent for some types of wheat. This price boom has attracted a torrent of new investment from Wall Street, estimated to be as much as $300 billion.
 Whether new investors are causing the market's problems or keeping them from getting worse is in dispute. But there is no question that the grain markets are now experiencing levels of volatility that are running well above the average levels over the last quarter-century. 
 Mr. Grieder's crop insurance premiums rise with the volatility. So does the cost of trading in options, which is the financial tool he has used to hedge against falling prices. Some grain elevators are coping with the volatility and hedging problems by refusing to buy crops in advance, foreclosing the most common way farmers lock in prices.
 ''The system is really beginning to break down,'' Mr. Grieder said. ''When you see elevators start pulling their bids for your crop, that tells me we've got a real problem.''
 Until recently, that system had worked well for generations. Since 1959, grain producers have been able to hedge the price of their wheat, corn and soybean crops on the Chicago Board of Trade through the use of futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity for a fixed price on some future date.
 More recently, the exchange has offered another tool: options on those futures contracts, which allow option holders to carry out the futures trade, but do not require that they do so. Trading in options is not as effective a hedge, farmers say, but it does not require them to put up as much cash as is required to trade futures.
 These tools have long provided a way to lock in the price of a crop as it is planted, eliminating the risk that prices will drop before it is harvested. With these hedging tools, grain elevators could afford to buy crops from farmers in advance, sometimes a year or more before the harvest. 
 But that was yesterday. It simply is not working that way today.
 Futures, for example, are less reliable. They work as a hedge only if they fall due at a price that roughly matches prices in the cash market, where the grain is actually sold. Increasingly -- for disputed reasons -- grain futures are expiring at prices well above the cash-market price.
 When that happens, farmers or elevator owners wind up owing more on their futures hedge than the crops are worth in the cash market. Such anomalies create uncertainty about which price accurately reflects supply and demand -- a critical issue, since the C.B.O.T. futures price is the benchmark for grain prices around the world.
 ''I can't honestly sit here and tell you who is determining the price of grain,'' said Christopher Hausman, a farmer in Pesotum, Ill. ''I've lost confidence in the Chicago Board of Trade.'' 
 David D. Lehman, director of commodity research and product development for the C.B.O.T.'s owner, the CME Group, said: ''We know that the current global environment is creating challenges for many of the traditional users of our markets, and we are very concerned. But there are a lot of things that are changing and there is no silver bullet, in terms of a solution.''
 Many farmers and people in related businesses blame the tidal wave of investment pouring in from hedge funds, pension funds and index funds for the faulty futures contracts and rising volatility. But those institutional investors' money actually adds liquidity to the market, which in theory should reduce price volatility, Mr. Lehman noted.
 In any case, at current levels of volatility, options trading becomes riskier, and therefore more expensive -- too expensive for many farmers like Mr. Grieder, who now has to hedge with the recently less reliable futures contracts.
 That exposes him to the risk of having to put up more cash -- to maintain his price protection -- whenever a weather threat, shipping disruption or a fresh surge of money from Wall Street suddenly pushes up grain prices.
 ''If you've got 50,000 bushels hedged and the market moves up 20 cents, that would be a $10,000 day,'' he said. ''If you only had $10,000 in your margin account, you'd have to sit down and write a check. You can see $10,000 disappear overnight.''
 On an unusual day, he said, he might get four phone calls a day from his broker seeking additional margin. ''But usually, the margin calls come in the mail, in a little blue envelope,'' he said. ''You don't have to open it to know what it is.'' 
 When it arrives, he sometimes has to rely on his bank to advance him the margin he needs to keep those hedges in place -- a worrisome requirement even for a successful farmer in an economy already struggling with a credit squeeze.
 ''The nightmare scenario is when you have to make margin and you're looking out your back door and seeing, maybe, a crop problem,'' he said. ''Everybody has a story about a guy they know getting blown out of his hedge'' by unmet margin calls.
 Farmers used to leave the market-watching to traders who work for big grain elevator companies. But with some of those companies now refusing to buy crops in advance because hedging has become so expensive and uncertain, farmers have to follow and trade in those markets themselves.
 ''This is something the farmer didn't have to worry about before,'' said Curt Kimmel, a commodity broker at Bates Commodities, the advisory service Mr. Grieder uses. ''It's a cruel and unforgiving market.''
 John Fletcher, a grain elevator operator in Marshall, Mo., started pressing the C.B.O.T. to address the flaws of futures contracts almost two years ago -- even before his futures hedge on a million bushels of soybeans failed to fully protect him last September, hitting him with a cash loss of $940,000.
 Mr. Fletcher does not blame the big institutional investors stampeding into the market. ''But they have contributed to the problem by making these markets so much larger -- so large that they have outgrown their delivery system,'' he said. ''And that has detached the futures market from the cash market.''
 Frustrated over the flawed futures contract, Mr. Fletcher is voting with his feet. Last year, he entered into a contract with A.I.G. Financial Products, a leading sponsor of commodity index funds, which allows him and the index fund to hedge their risks without using the C.B.O.T.
 Instead of using futures or options, A.I.G. simply buys the commodity directly from Mr. Fletcher, who stores it for a fee and buys it back six months later. His storage fee is lower than the one built into the C.B.O.T. contract, so A.I.G. pays less for its stake in the market. And he has a hedge he can rely on.
 ''I did a deal with them for corn a year ago, and this year I'm doing a deal on soybeans,'' he said.
 But private deals like these do not provide pricing data to other farmers and to the rest of the food industry, which has long relied on the Chicago Board of Trade as the best measure of supply and demand. If such bilateral contracts become more common, it will be harder for everyone in the industry to anticipate costs and potential profits -- which could also push prices up.
 This growing uncertainty about prices and hedging ''just makes the market less efficient,'' said Jeffrey Hainline, president of Advance Trading, an agricultural advisory and brokerage service in Bloomington, Ill. ''And anything that makes these markets less efficient increases the cost of food.''
 Robert E. Young II, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, has held meetings on this topic around the Farm Belt over the last month and has gotten an earful from distressed food producers and elevator owners, he said.
 ''I tell people, 'You are not going to market the 2009 crop the way you marketed the 2007 crop. You may never market grain that way again.' ''

SHIRLEY TEMPLE
 America's Sweetheart Collection, Volume 6
 Shirley Temple Black will turn 80 on Wednesday, an occasion that Fox Home Entertainment is celebrating with the release of the sixth and final volume of ''Shirley Temple: America's Sweetheart Collection.'' With the three films in this set -- ''Stowaway'' (1936), ''Wee Willie Winkie'' (1937) and ''Young People'' (1940) -- all of Ms. Temple's starring vehicles for 20th Century Fox are now available on DVD, in editions that are as well restored as they are cloyingly packaged, in the princess-pink plastic normally reserved for Disney's direct-to-video releases. 
 From ''Bright Eyes,'' her 1934 breakthrough hit, to ''Young People,'' the final film of her Fox contract, Ms. Temple played variations on the same role: that of a dimpled cherub with blond ringlets and a magical ability to cheer up the glum adults who surrounded her. Long before she was an ambassador in real life (to Ghana in 1974 and Czechoslovakia in 1989), she seemed, to Depression-era audiences, like an emissary from another world, one where ships were made of candy and there were no bread lines in sight. 
 ''As long as we have Shirley Temple, we'll be all right,'' Franklin D. Roosevelt reportedly said, and audiences must have agreed. Although reliable box office information for the 1930s is hard to come by, Ms. Temple consistently placed at or near the top of exhibitors' popularity polls, along with more worldly stars like Clark Gable and Mae West. 
 Of the new batch of titles, ''Stowaway'' -- directed with efficient anonymity by the comedy specialist William A. Seiter -- is probably the most typical Temple vehicle. She plays Ching-Ching, a young Caucasian child raised in China who has been doubly orphaned (by the death of her parents and then by the dour missionary couple who took her in). Abandoned on the docks of Shanghai, Ching-Ching makes her way to an American ocean liner, where she finds a protector in the form of a wealthy tourist, Tommy Randall (Robert Young), a dissolute playboy described as a relic from the pre-crash years of the Roaring Twenties. Also on board is Susan Parker (Alice Faye), a bright, down-to-earth representative of the American middle class, traveling to meet her dull fiance in Bangkok.
 This is a familiar position for Ms. Temple, who lacks one or both parents in most of her Fox films. In a plot device that Walt Disney would later take up in several of his live-action films, the child is effectively allowed to generate her own parents, an innovative form of asexual reproduction that solved more than one problem in the puritanical Production Code years. But with Ms. Temple the device seems more than merely evasive: her unstoppable energy and cheerfulness shake the adults out of their emotional paralysis, setting things right psychologically, socially and (thanks to the redistribution of wealth Ching-Ching slyly brings about) even economically. 
 ''Stowaway'' is appealing studio fare; the other two films in this new collection are more personal and more interesting. This is the same restoration of ''Wee Willie Winkie'' that appeared in Fox's superb John Ford set last December, with the original tinting: sepia for the noonday sun scenes; different shades of blue and green for nighttime shots and interiors. Based on a Kipling story, it is one of Ford's most underrated films, a surge of creative energy amid the doldrums that beset his career in the years right before the resurgence of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). 
 In ''Wee Willie Winkie'' Ms. Temple plays a more grave variation on her usual character. Here she's Priscilla, an American girl who moves with her recently widowed mother (June Lang) to a British outpost in northern India commanded by her curmudgeonly grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith). Priscilla wins him over, as she does most of the post, as well as the ''savage'' tribal leader (Cesar Romero) mounting a rebellion in the nearby mountains. But her most significant relationship in the film is with MacDuff (Victor McLaglen), the gruff sergeant who takes her under his wing and trains her to be a proper British soldier.
 The film is probably Ford's most generous tribute to McLaglen, whom he directed in several of his early starring roles of the silent period as well as in an Oscar-winning performance in ''The Informer'' (1935). But McLaglen, a mountain of a man with amazing physical and facial agility, gives a richer, deeper, more natural performance here, working with Ford to suggest that his character's growing affection for the child goes hand in hand with the slow realization of what he has sacrificed to his life in the military. His death scene is among the most moving of the many such moments in Ford; with Priscilla at his hospital bedside he quietly slips away, taking infinite care to ensure that the little girl does not realize what is happening in front of her eyes. 
 Directed by Allan Dwan, a filmmaker whose career goes back to the beginnings of the medium, ''Young People'' seems a self-conscious summation of Ms. Temple's years at Fox. It begins with an ingenious use of old footage (quite unusual for the time) to depict Ms. Temple growing up onstage, aging from 6 to 12. Again she is an orphan, this time adopted by a pair of vaudevillians (Charlotte Greenwood and Jack Oakie, both excellent) who buy a New England farm in hopes of giving the girl a normal life, only to face the prejudice and hostility of the locals, resentful of show business interlopers. There is something hauntingly self-reflexive in Ms. Temple's performance, as if her character's conflicted desires -- she yearns both for a ''normal'' life and the exaltation of the stage -- were her own. 
 Dwan, who directed Ms. Temple in two of her essential roles -- ''Heidi'' (1937) and ''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' (1938) -- constructs the film as a touching but unsentimental farewell: Ms. Temple is leaving both Fox and her childhood behind, inching toward independence and adulthood. In a way ''Young People'' feels like her last film as a star, although she continued to receive top billing when she moved on to a contract with David O. Selznick and roles more appropriate to the attractive teenager she was becoming.
 After ''Young People'' the public would no longer need her in quite the same way. She had grown up, and so had the country -- out of the Great Depression, and into a war that would change everything.

HEADLINE: Retail in This Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Retailing Chains Caught in a Wave of Bankruptcies'' (front page, April 15) is a sobering reminder of the precarious state of the American economy. 
 As editor in chief of Retailing Today, a business publication for the retail industry, I found the analysis spot on as it relates to consumer trepidation. But I would point to at least one other major phenomenon contributing to the failure of the retailers cited in the article. 
 In an age where consumers shop for groceries at warehouse clubs, and $29 DVD players are sold as commodities, there's no room for second- and third-tier chains with business models predicated on disproportionately high margins and prices.
 Value-based retailing is not a passing trend. I hope this fact does not get lost on the ''eight mostly midsize chains'' referred to in the article, particularly those fortunate enough to exit bankruptcy protection in one piece.

HEADLINE: In Britain, Banks Can Swap Assets For Bonds

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and CARTER DOUGHERTY. 
David Jolly reported from Paris, and Carter Dougherty from Frankfurt.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The Bank of England said on Monday that it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed securities valued at approximately $100 billion for government bonds in an effort to restore calm to the British financial markets.
 Under the plan, banks will deposit the securities, which have become difficult to sell since the credit markets began to tighten in August, in the central bank as collateral, but at a discount. In return, they will receive easily tradable government bonds, which the Bank of England hopes will be used to expand lending, in particular among banks themselves.
 The banks themselves will have to bear the loss if the securities on deposit decline in value, the central bank said. But its governor, Mervyn King, also said there was no ''arbitrary limit'' on how much could be lent under the plan, though discussions with banks suggested they would need about $:50 billion ($99 billion). ''It may well go higher,'' he said. 
 Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said earlier that such a plan was necessary because the freezing up of credit markets represented ''an unprecedented shock to the system.''
 ''We haven't seen this in generations,'' he said on BBC television. ''It's happening in America, Europe, the Far East. It is affecting countries all over the world. We're determined to do everything we can to get normality here.''
 The central bank said the one-year asset swaps could be renewed for up to three years. The swaps are available only for assets existing at the end of 2007 and cannot be used to finance new lending.
 Analysts seemed skeptical that the move would ease lending conditions significantly, though they agreed that it was a shot in the arm for banks.
 Many British banks have announced plans to reduce exposure to real estate lending, and with prices falling few are inclined to rethink those intentions, analysts said. The experience of the United States, where similar measures have failed to initiate much new lending, is also cautionary.
 The Federal Reserve in Washington said last month that it would swap up to $200 billion of government bonds for mortgage-backed securities.
 Still, Michael Deppler, head of the International Monetary Fund's European division, said that the British situation was not nearly as dire as that in the United States, where a wave of housing foreclosures has delivered a broad shock to lenders.
 British home prices are falling, but the extent of the damage is far less than in the United States.
 Mr. Deppler made the comment as part of an assessment that painted a pessimistic outlook for economic growth in all of Europe. The mixture of higher oil and food prices, the strong euro, recessionary conditions in the United States and financial market turmoil will bring growth in Western Europe down to 1.4 percent this year, from 2.8 percent in 2007, he predicted.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government, facing difficult local elections in May, has been under pressure to shore up the financial system and restart the mortgage lending market. Mr. Brown met Friday in Washington with several financial officials, including Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 Despite three interest rate cuts that have taken the Bank of England's benchmark rate to 5 percent, the three-month London interbank sterling rate, a reference rate for loans between banks, was at nearly 5.9 percent Monday, down slightly from Friday, but still a level that indicated banks remained nervous about their peers.

HEADLINE: Appellate Argument: An Artist's View

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK. 
Online: Documents and an archive of Adam Liptak's articles: nytimes.com/adamliptak.

 BODY:
For three days last week, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. heard arguments in a real court in Washington. Then he came to New York to preside over a fake one -- the finals of the moot court competition at Columbia Law School. 
 Though he looked a little weary, Chief Justice Roberts's questions were deft, and his wit was dry. A few of his remarks, during and after the argument, lit up a large lecture hall like summer lightning. 
 He talked a bit about the art of appellate argument, of which he is an acknowledged master, and he gave some hints about his judicial philosophy, which he presented as cautious and practical.
 Moot court is a funny institution, part debate club and part ''American Idol.'' Students are assigned a case, often loosely based on a real one, and they pretend to be appellate lawyers, writing briefs and making arguments. The best advocate wins.
 The four students who presented arguments on Thursday had been winnowed from a field of 55. After they made their pitches, Chief Justice Roberts and the three stars of the appellate bench who sat with him gave brief critiques and then selected a winner.
 ''I particularly liked your rebuttal, Mollie,'' said Judge Diana Gribbon Motz of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. ''Jordan, I liked the way you started your argument.'' 
 (Judge Motz, the author of an important decision in an enemy-combatant case last year, praised all four of the finalists: Mollie M. Kornreich, David A. Scherr, Jordan W. Connors and Christopher M. Hogan. Mr. Hogan won the competition.)
 Chief Justice Roberts spoke more generally, drawing on his experiences on the other side of the bench. He argued 39 Supreme Court cases in private practice and as one of the elite lawyers who represents the government in the Supreme Court in the solicitor general's office.
 The chief justice seems to get a kick out of judging moot courts, which is surely a busman's holiday. That is probably because he is a connoisseur of the art of oral argument.
 ''Quite often the judges are debating among themselves and just using the lawyers as a backboard,'' Chief Justice Roberts explained to the students afterward, referring to appellate arguments in his court and others. ''One of the real challenges for lawyers is to get involved in that debate.''
 The fake case the students were arguing had two parts, each impossibly complex. The first concerned whether poor pregnant women who were denied access to medical care can sue a state health agency under a federal law even though Congress had not said they were allowed to do that in so many words. Layered on top of the first question was whether the women may use a federal civil rights law as the way to get into court. 
 The second question was whether the trial judge could certify a class action to consider only some of the issues in the case.
 Whew.
 The four finalists were all plenty smart and in full command of the statutes and precedents in play. They fielded questions with self-confidence and, for the most part, a fluid, conversational style. But their approach was sometimes awfully technical.
 Judge Michael W. McConnell of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit gently reminded the students afterward that the law is more than a series of propositions to be fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle.
 ''It may be the former academic in me,'' Judge McConnell said, ''but I do think this was a case that might have invited going a little deeper.''
 Instead of arguing about which of two inconsistent Supreme Court decisions should apply, Judge McConnell said, the students might have used the confused state of the law as an opportunity to talk about justice in a broader sense.
 Chief Justice Roberts suggested in his questions, though perhaps only for effect, that he was no fan of either class actions or of allowing judges to make broad policy judgments.
 ''A class action is a dramatic departure from the normal rules of litigation,'' he said. He asked one student whether the practical impact of allowing a class action was not merely to grant the plaintiff leverage in settlement talks.
 Discussing a federal law that requires states to run medical programs ''consistent with efficiency, economy and quality of care,'' Chief Justice Roberts sounded exasperated.
 ''How in the world is a judge supposed to apply those terms -- economy, efficiency?'' he asked. ''Those sound like legislative judgments.''
 The post-argument critiques were not limited to the students. Two of the appeals court judges said the Supreme Court might work a little harder to establish clear principles.
 ''The multipart tests that come down from on high are not particularly helpful,'' Judge McConnell said. And Judge Diane P. Wood of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said she did not always enjoy traversing the ''difficult terrain of decisions of the Supreme Court that seem to point in different directions.''
 Chief Justice Roberts laughed along with everyone else. He had earlier sorted out the relationship between the two conflicting precedents, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association and Gonzaga University v. Doe, to his own satisfaction. 
 ''Wilder is limited to its facts, I guess is the most charitable way to put it,'' he said during the argument, meaning the Gonzaga decision had effectively overruled it. 
 Afterward, he discussed why he had spoken with such easy authority -- aside from being chief justice of the United States.
 ''I argued and lost, of course, the Wilder case and argued and won the Gonzaga case,'' he said. He was smiling as he recalled the victory.

HEADLINE: Banks Hunting For More Cash

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The bill for the credit mess keeps rising.
 Nine months after the crisis in the American mortgage market began to tear through the financial world, the cost to banks, in terms of their own sinking investments, is approaching $300 billion. To shore up their weakened finances, one bank after another is racing to raise capital -- a total of $160 billion so far.
 The pain is far from over. Even the most optimistic forecasters say banks will suffer billions of dollars in additional write-downs on mortgage investments and other debt in the months ahead. The final figure for the banks write-downs could eventually exceed $750 billion -- twice some early estimates -- if the economy sinks into a prolonged recession, some analysts say. 
 Another round of grim results from major banks added to the gloom hanging over the industry on Monday. The day opened in New York with Bank of America reporting another decline in quarterly profits and ended with Citigroup hurriedly raising $6 billion in the capital markets. 
 In between, National City, Ohio's biggest bank and a big subprime lender, posted a $171 million loss, slashed its dividend and agreed to sell a $7 billion stake to investors led by Corsair Capital. 
 ''It's too early to strike up the band and say that happy days are here again,'' said Kenneth D. Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, in the bank's earnings call Monday.
 Bank of America, one of the country's largest banks, said that its profit sank for a third consecutive quarter. The bank raised its reserves for credit losses fivefold, to $6 billion, and took write-downs of at least another $1.91 billion. The announcements followed last week's round of dismal bank earnings, which included a $9.7 billion write-down from Merrill Lynch, $5.1 billion at JPMorgan Chase and about $13 billion from Citigroup. Meanwhile, Merrill, JPMorgan, Wachovia and Wells Fargo each announced plans to seek out large sums from investors to shore up their capital positions.
 While some finance chief executives sounded positive notes last week -- Richard S. Fuld, chief of Lehman Brothers, said the worst part of the financial squeeze was over -- many said they expected further pain as consumers cut back on spending and faced problems paying off debt.
 ''We are in the early stages of the credit cycle,'' G. Kennedy Thompson, the chairman and chief executive of Wachovia, said last week. ''Its severity will play out according to the health of the economy.'' 
 The ultimate cost of the financial industry's write-downs is a crucial question on Wall Street. Many analysts say the figure will keep rising if the economy continues to suffer, spreading loan losses far beyond the housing market.
 ''The economic situation is profoundly worse than we had thought, and that's affecting the banks,'' Mark T. Fitzgibbon, director of research at Sandler O'Neil & Partners, an investment research firm. ''We will continue to see the Band-Aid being pulled off in the coming quarters.''
 Write-downs -- the recognition that assets like mortgage bonds or corporate bonds are worth less than previously thought -- have been pushing banks to the brink of comfortable capital levels since last summer. As financial firms mark down the value of their investments, they become less able to make loans. That, in turn, translates into harder times for companies and individuals who need to borrow money.
 Since June, banks have tried to shore up their finances by raising tens of billions of dollars from investors, and each new write-down seems to be followed with a hunt for more cash. Raising capital, of course, can reduce the value of stock held by existing shareholders.
 ''They need more capital now, and they're likely to need even more in the next year or two,'' said Jeffrey E. Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management and a former under secretary of commerce. ''We're in kind of a Catch-22 situation: a recession that is not too severe depends on the resumption of bank lending. Without that resumption, the recession is going to become deeper and longer.''
 Part of the problem within the banks is that the people who bought and sold mortgage and other bonds in recent years no longer know what they are worth. As banks prepare their quarterly earnings, each division tallies up its investments. They are supposed to mark them to a price based on what they could sell them for, but sales of many types of assets have ground to a standstill.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission published a letter last month that noted that the Financial Accounting Standards Board's fair value rule allows companies to avoid marking down assets whose values appear low in the market simply because of ''forced liquidation.'' 
 Many bank executives say distressed selling is rampant, and they may be avoiding lowering values of some assets because of that, banking analysts said.
 For many banks, raising more money from investors might help them lower future write-downs, said Stuart Plesser, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. He said that banks with better capital would be able to shift securities into the category they planned to hold, rather than sell, and avoid some write-downs. 
 As turbulent as all the continuing write-downs appear, the fallout has not reached as broad a swath of financial institutions as the banking downturn in the 1980s. In that era, about 3,000 banks collapsed and 1,500 were left in weak positions. William Isaac, chairman of the F.D.I.C. in the early 1980s, said a positive result of the banks' problems would be if more regulations were imposed so that banks would not find themselves in such need to raise money in the future.
 ''The financial system over the past 10 or 15 years has gotten fairly wild and woolly,'' said Mr. Isaac, now the chairman of the Secura Group, a financial consulting firm. ''I think now what people are finally realizing is there's a reason why we have banks and there's a reason why our banks have to have lots of capital. It's so they can ride through periods like this.''

HEADLINE: Revisiting Nafta in Hopes to Cure Manufacturing

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton promises to start renegotiating Nafta in her first 100 days if elected president. Senator Barack Obama would use the threat of opting out as a hammer to demand strong labor and environmental standards in Mexico. 
 The two Democratic candidates have heaped blame on the 14-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement for the plight of unemployed workers in declining Rust Belt towns where jobs have been lost to global competition. But what they are truly talking about when they criticize the agreement, which lifted trade and investment barriers among Canada, the United States and Mexico, is trade with Mexico. 
 The pledge to renegotiate parts of Nafta is much more complex than either candidate has publicly acknowledged. One question is how tighter labor and environmental standards would be enforced. Another is whether they would restore lost manufacturing jobs.
 The attacks on Nafta, first in the Ohio primary and more recently before Tuesday's vote in Pennsylvania, have surprised some experts and analysts. There is little doubt that the rise of Asia, particularly China, has accelerated job losses in the United States faster than Nafta did. 
 Still, the argument carries a strong punch -- particularly when famed American brands pack up and move to Mexico. One recent example is the Hershey Company, the chocolate maker. This month, the president of the Teamsters union, James P. Hoffa, traveled to Reading, Pa., to visit what the union called ''Nafta victims,'' 260 workers in a Hershey plant that is moving to Mexico by the end of the year. 
 ''These so-called trade deals are killing American jobs,'' Mr. Hoffa said. ''They aren't about trade, they're about helping companies move their factories to countries with cheaper labor.'' 
 In theory, stronger labor and environmental standards would raise the cost of doing business in Mexico and might make companies think twice about moving. But with the average hourly manufacturing wage in Mexico about 13 percent that of the United States average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mexican labor is still cheap. 
 Then there is the problem of enforcement. Under Nafta's labor and environmental side agreements, there are no effective sanctions against companies that break the law or governments that do not enforce it. 
 Some advocates argue that at the very least, those agreements should be subject to the same kind of arbitration and sanctions that disputes over trade or investment barriers now face. But even those might not have much effect. Nafta trade disputes drag on for years and rulings are not always enforced. 
 Another option might be fines for companies in violation, or even bans on their imports. But that could backfire. Under Nafta, industries like the auto industry have become highly integrated. Parts move back and forth across the border as subassemblies are put together and finally end up in auto plants in the United States. Halting that process, perhaps for a labor violation, would result in trouble for the American plant and its workers. 
 ''Nafta is not going to go away,'' said Jeff Faux, a fellow at the Economic Policy Institute, who opposed the agreement when it was being negotiated in the early 1990s. ''You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.'' 
 Mexico's conservative government has rejected renegotiating Nafta. But if the agreement were opened up, Mexico would present its own demands, perhaps on easing legal migration or protecting corn farmers.
 ''If we are going to have a serious negotiation, it's not going to be one-sided,'' said Luis de la Calle, a former Nafta negotiator for Mexico who is now a political consultant. ''Let's put labor and the environment back in Nafta, but in exchange for what?''
 President Felipe Calderon of Mexico, meeting with President Bush and the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, in New Orleans, strongly defended Nafta in remarks made on Monday. 
 American analysts question whether a new president would want to spend political capital on reopening Nafta in light of other, more pressing issues like health care and the war in Iraq. 
 The Democratic candidates are replaying the arguments made against Nafta in the early 1990s, when opponents like the Texas billionaire Ross Perot argued that it would create a ''giant sucking sound'' of jobs moving to Mexico.
 But much has changed since then. (For a start, Perot Systems, which he helped found, has set up its own Mexico subsidiary.) 
 In the first years of Nafta, jobs did leave the United States for Mexico, although a fast-growing economy blunted the fallout. But in this decade, American jobs lost to China have dwarfed those going to Mexico. And Mexico's own factories are leaving for countries with even lower wages, especially China, said Enrique Dussel Peters, an economist who heads the Center of China-Mexico Studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
 Manufacturing employment fell 10 percent from 2000 to 2007, according to Mexican government statistics, he said. The debate in the United States makes ''it seem that the villain is Mexico that is taking the jobs,'' Dr. Dussel said. ''I wish that were the case.'' 
 At the same time, China and other Asian countries are eroding the promised surge in American exports to Mexico. Ten years ago, Mexico bought almost 80 percent of its imports from the United States. Last year, that figure dropped to just less than 50 percent. ''There's a fourth uninvited guest at the Nafta party,'' Dr. Dussel said, alluding to China. 
 And the focus on the environment and labor rights ignores changes inside Mexico. A strong environmental movement has developed, putting multinational manufacturers on their guard and pushing the government to inspect industrial polluters. 
 Indeed, American baby boomers, rather than American factories, are unwittingly at the center of Mexico's fiercest environmental debate. Local activists have been fighting the rapid development of Mexico's coastline -- much of it driven by demand for retirement homes and time shares for retiring Americans. 
 In labor, the picture has changed less. Mexican plants that produce exports still mostly recognize compliant sham unions. But even if a reworked Nafta could strengthen labor rights, multinational corporations in Mexico now hold the same trump card they hold in the United States: the threat to move to a cheaper country. 
 Analysts on all sides contend that if anything concrete is to come out of the Nafta-bashing, it should be a broader approach to the United States' relationship with Mexico and Canada.
 ''They have put so much attention on Nafta that the next president will have to do something,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. He argues that energy, security and climate change are the crucial concerns for the next president in dealing with Mexico and Canada and that ''second-order issues of labor and the environment'' would follow. 
 Robert A. Pastor, director of the Center for North American Studies at American University, proposes a fund to help Mexico build infrastructure to develop its poorer central and southern states. ''If Mexico grows fast, our exports grow faster,'' he said. Under his plan, all three Nafta nations would contribute to the fund. 
 Mr. Faux at the Economic Policy Institute agrees, although he would be more explicit about negotiating improved labor rights across the region.
 ''The real question is, What kind of North American economy are we talking about?'' Mr. Faux said. ''Now that we have this continental economy, how can we start managing it in a way that works for everybody?''

HEADLINE: Why Are These Democrats Smiling? It's Cyclical

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
There has been endless talk about the 2008 presidential race being a ''change election.'' A New York Times/CBS News poll this month indicated that 81 percent of respondents said they believed ''things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track'' and 78 percent said the country was worse off than five years ago. ''Change'' has become a mantra chanted not just by Senator Barack Obama, who has been running as an avatar of a new kind of politics, but by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain too. 
 According to the authors of ''Millennial Makeover: MySpace, YouTube, and the Future of American Politics,'' change is indeed on its way, and the magnitude of that change will be monumental -- a tectonic realignment of the sort that occurs about every four decades, leading to a fundamental shift in policy priorities and voter coalitions. 
 Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais also write in this fascinating but not always persuasive volume that the party capturing the White House in 2008 has ''a historic opportunity to become the majority party for at least four more decades,'' and that the rising generation of Millennials (born between 1982 and 2003) will imprint the coming national discourse with its own temperament and predilections, washing away ''the current politics of polarization and ideological deadlock'' and putting in its place ''a new landscape of collective purpose and national consensus that involves individuals and communities in solving the nation's problems.'' 
 Mr. Winograd, a former adviser to Al Gore and the co-author of an earlier book called ''Taking Control: Politics in the Information Age'' (which was reportedly widely read in the Clinton White House), and Mr. Hais, a communications researcher, have relied heavily in this volume on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe, who in books like ''Generations'' (1991) and ''Millennials Rising'' (2000) have articulated a theory of generational change and who are acknowledged in these pages as key inspirations. Much of the methodology and terminology used here comes directly from the writings of Mr. Strauss and Mr. Howe, as do many of the qualities ascribed to specific generations like the Baby Boomers and the Millennials. 
 What Mr. Winograd and Mr. Hais have essentially done is explore, in detail, the political implications of Mr. Strauss and Mr. Howe's sociological observations. As they tell it there have been five major political realignments in American history, and while each of these huge shifts seems to have been triggered by a crucial event (like the Civil War or the Great Depression), all were actually rooted in ''underlying changes in generational size and attitudes and contemporaneous advances in communication technologies'' like the development of radio, television and, more recently, the Internet. 
 There are two types of major realignments, the authors say. ''Idealist'' realignments, the last of which occurred in 1968 with the rise of the boomers, are marked by low voter turnout, negative attitudes toward politics and political institutions and ''a focus on divisive social issues involving such concerns as substance use, sexual behavior and socially acceptable roles for women and men''; in the public policy arena ''idealist realignments tend to lead to gridlock, limited use of and even decline in the national government and greater economic inequality.'' Since the 1968 realignment the Republicans, who had become the party of traditional values, would win 7 of 10 presidential elections.
 In contrast ''civic'' realignments -- which occurred in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln and 1932 with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt -- are characterized, Mr. Winograd and Mr. Hais write, by rising voter turnout (or stable turnout at high levels), positive attitudes toward politics and political institutions, and ''a focus on broader societal and economic concerns rather than social issues involving personal morality.'' 
 Although Republican strategists like Karl Rove, as well as a number of political analysts, saw the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 as triggering a realignment that would confirm Republican hegemony for many decades to come, the authors of ''Millennial Makeover'' -- both of whom are Democrats -- argue that 9/11 is more likely to encourage ''the Democratically inclined Millennial Generation to vote in large numbers'' and thus make the 2008 presidential election ''more likely to be a realigning election that favors Democrats.''
 Why are Millennials inclined to vote Democratic? Thanks to ''their protected, structured and positively reinforced upbringing'' (lots of quality time with their parents, lots of exercises in self-esteem) Millennials tend to be far more optimistic and group-oriented than their Gen X predecessors (the alienated generation sandwiched between Boomers and Millennials), and according to Mr. Hais and Mr. Winograd, they're predisposed to be inclusive, empathetic and tolerant in their social outlook. ''A large majority of Millennials endorses affirmative action programs (82 percent) as compared with two-thirds of older Americans,'' the authors write, and ''more than two-thirds of Millennial women'' are opposed to the idea of women returning to traditional roles. 
 Millennials' reliance on the Internet (technology that the Democrats have learned to exploit more quickly than their Republican opponents) and their passion for texting and instant messaging have political implications as well. In placing a heavy value on the opinion of friends and peers, the authors of this book suggest, Millennials are inclined to favor conclusions reached by decentralized decision making, and multilateral rather than unilateral policy making. Their proclivity for sharing their lives with thousands of others through MySpace and Facebook also makes them ''the generation least perturbed by any potential restrictions on civil rights or invasions of privacy that might have occurred in fighting the war on terrorism.'' As a more socially tolerant and less divisive Millennial generation becomes a larger part of the electorate, Mr. Winograd and Mr. Hais predict, ''the power of social issues to drive our political debate will wane'': wedge issues will lose their effectiveness, and ideological divisions will give way to an emphasis on ''successful governmental activism.'' ''Majorities,'' they argue, ''will coalesce around ideas that involve the entire group in the solution and downplay the right of individuals to opt out of the process.'' 
 Some of the authors' predictions (like the demise of disputes over Darwinism or the adoption of an inclusive solution to immigration) seem less likely to surface any time soon, given the importance of these issues to high-decibel factions of the right. In addition some of Mr. Hais and Mr. Winograd's remarks about the new generation of voters are patently absurd. They assert, for instance, that Andy Sachs, the perky heroine in the movie version of ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' is ''a true Millennial, different from the lead character of previous coming-of-age movies about other generations.'' And their unalloyed faith in their paradigms seems to leave little room for the accidents of fate and free will.
 Though Mr. Winograd and Mr. Hais sprinkle their text with qualifications like ''there is no absolute certainty about which political party will benefit from the current 'crisis' era,'' the overwhelming thrust of their book is to point to a coming Democratic victory, buoyed by the votes of Millennials. And though they never come out and say so, their book (which went to press before the Democratic field narrowed) also suggests that a candidate like Mr. Obama -- who appeals to this most ethnically diverse of generations with a message of postpartisanship and consensus-building -- will likely be the next president of the United States. The bitterness of the continuing Democratic nominating race (with yet another pivotal primary being held Tuesday), though, and polls showing Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, in a virtual dead heat with either Democratic candidate remind the reader that these sorts of predictions -- based on historical patterns and generational change -- can never be a foregone conclusion.

HEADLINE: As Construction Deaths Rise, Buildings Chief Faces Scrutiny

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The sleek glass tower at 51st Street and Second Avenue, where a crane collapse last month killed seven, rises 18 stories, nearly halfway to its promise of 43 stories, 180 luxury apartments and panoramic views of the city.
 But with work stopped at the site, the city now says that the building's design violated four local zoning regulations and that the Buildings Department should never have issued the original permits in the first place. 
 Those problems came as no surprise to a group of local residents and politicians: they said they raised questions about the tower's height several times over the past 18 months. But the department did not investigate until January, after the developer's own lender asked for a letter reaffirming city approval.
 ''You have a Buildings Department that seems more interested in preserving the rights of developers at the expense of citizens and the community,'' said Bruce Silberblatt, a retired contractor and a member of the Turtle Bay Association who was among the first to complain. 
 The problems with the building, 303 East 51st Street, come as the Buildings Department is under fire for a spike in fatal construction accidents this year and other high-profile problems. To the department's critics, the mishandled permits also raise sharp new questions about Buildings Commissioner Patricia J. Lancaster, an architect hired by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to modernize the 1,286-person agency. 
 On Monday, Mayor Bloomberg did little to quell the criticism of Ms. Lancaster, breaking with his customary habit of staunchly defending his commissioners from public criticism.
 ''I don't think anybody should be fully satisfied with the Department of Buildings' performance,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Whether somebody could have done a better job -- I'm trying to -- whether they could have done a better job I just don't know,'' he continued, groping for words. 
 Saying he understood the dangers of construction work and the complexities of regulating the city's thousands of construction sites, he added: ''But that's not an excuse.''
 The city is not threatening to tear down the 51st Street building, and the developer asserts that the zoning problems can be resolved through negotiations. But city officials said some changes to the design were possible.
 In a telephone interview, Ms. Lancaster, 54, defended her record, saying that she had modernized the department in the midst of an unprecedented building boom, imposed integrity standards, hired and trained hundreds of employees and made records accessible to the public. Last year, the department issued 9,929 full or partial stop-work orders at construction sites for safety-related problems.
 ''In order to enact reforms, you have to lay a foundation,'' she said during the interview. ''In order to be able to enforce or bring court cases, you have to have lawyers. You can't have vacancies and no training. And so, we've been building that foundation, as well as getting increased penalties.''
 In 2002, Ms. Lancaster inherited a department where older records were stored above ceiling tiles, 19 of 24 plumbing inspectors had been arrested on corruption charges, the computers at its Staten Island office crashed almost daily at 3 p.m. and more than 250 positions went unfilled.
 Even her fiercest critics say that Ms. Lancaster has had some success in turning around a long-neglected department, putting public records on the Internet, overhauling the city's often confusing and outdated building code, and instituting measures to ensure the integrity of its reviews. But those critics say that the administration has starved the department of resources and focused on spurring construction as part of the economic development, at the expense of safety.
 ''She has done many things to make the department more effective,'' said James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn assemblyman who has been critical of the department and is planning a hearing on regulation and enforcement of construction and development for Thursday. ''But in relation to what's happening in construction, the department was always behind the curve, and the overriding interest was development.''
 A spate of fatal accidents has highlighted the department's challenge. This year, there have been 13 fatalities at construction sites in the city, including the seven on Second Avenue, compared with 12 during all of 2007. The victims included a window installer who fell from a condominium tower in Queens when a safety strap failed and a construction worker who fell 42 stories from the Trump SoHo condominium hotel in January. 
 In another case, investigators found after the 2007 fire at the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero that building inspectors had failed to detect numerous violations, including the dismantling of a standpipe that would have carried water to firefighters at the top of the building.
 The tower on East 51st Street was largely unknown to New Yorkers until March 15, when a 22-story crane collapsed on the site, killing seven and injuring 24 others, while forcing the evacuation of hundreds from their homes. 
 The planned tower had already been the subject of complaints by local residents and officials. Under questioning last week at a City Council hearing concerning crane safety, Ms. Lancaster stunned critics, community activists and officials with a new revelation: The tower under construction on 51st Street was too tall for its location.
 ''Wow,'' responded Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin, who represents the neighborhood and whose question triggered the response. ''You're telling me this building should never have been approved in the first place.''
 ''That is correct,'' the commissioner replied.
 At the same hearing, the commissioner was dismissive of complaints about the tower from local residents. ''I think the community doesn't want the building at all,'' she said. ''In fact, that property owner has property rights like anybody else who owns property and can build a building there.''
 Ms. Lappin was surprised and disappointed, she said, because residents had been raising questions about the height of the tower for some time. In December, a community group, the Turtle Bay Association, received only perfunctory responses to two letters it sent to the Buildings Department raising questions about the zoning, as well as balconies and affordable housing.
 Ms. Lappin and Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing then arranged for a Feb. 19 meeting with Christopher Santulli, the Buildings Department official in charge of Manhattan. Mr. Santulli promised to get back to them and to provide them with the developer's building plans. They are still waiting. 
 Now, Ms. Lappin said the Buildings Department appeared to be agreeing with the residents. But in an interview on Friday, Phyllis Arnold, the department's deputy commissioner for legal affairs, said that the department had reviewed the zoning and building permits for the project earlier this year in response to a request from the developer's lenders, not the local officials or the community group.
 Ms. Arnold said that the zoning for the site allowed for a 33-story tower atop a broad base, not the sheer, 43-story tower for which the developer received approval. In addition, the tower was found to be too close to an adjoining four-story building owned by the developer.
 To resolve those issues, she said, the department told the developer, James P. Kennelly, that he must include a space for community use, like a school, clinic or doctor's office, to bring the tower into compliance with the zoning. He was also required to reduce the size of the small buildings that sit in front of the tower on Second Avenue, which are owned by a separate company related to the developer.
 Mr. Kennelly said he submitted his initial plans for a full review and received a building permit last October. In response to the department's review in February, he said he submitted a new set of plans by early March.
 But, Mr. Kennelly said, he knew nothing about another issue raised by Ms. Arnold: the balconies on his tower intrude over an adjoining property. ''At no point did anyone from Buildings have a question or a quandary about balconies,'' he said.
 Ms. Lappin said she had been saddened by the whole affair.
 ''I'm not sure why D.O.B. is bending over backwards to find every which way for him to build what he wants, as opposed to building what is legal and appropriate'' she said.
 For her part, Ms. Lancaster said she thought she would be given enough time to finish reforming her department. 
 ''I serve at the pleasure of the mayor, and I have a lot of work to do in the next 619 days,'' she said. ''I took this job to make a difference to the city, and I'm pretty clear that I'm still focused on that.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the growing scrutiny faced by Patricia J. Lancaster, New York City's buildings commissioner, after a series of fatal construction accidents misstated the source and timing of a revelation that an East Side building that was the site of a fatal crane accident last month was too tall for its location. That statement was made by a Buildings Department official in an interview on Friday, not by Ms. Lancaster during a City Council hearing on Thursday. (At the hearing, Ms. Lancaster would say only that the building proposal should not have been approved because it did not conform to zoning regulations.)
An article on April 22 about the growing scrutiny faced by Patricia J. Lancaster, then New York City's buildings commissioner, after a series of fatal construction accidents misstated the location of one accident, in which a window installer fell from a condominium tower when a safety strap failed. The tower is on the East Side of Manhattan, not in Queens.

 CARTER SAYS HAMAS AND SYRIA
 Are Open to Peace Deal
 Jimmy Carter said that in talks in Damascus, Syria, he had extracted a promise from the militant group Hamas to respect the creation of a Palestinian state negotiated by Hamas's rivals in the Palestinian Authority if it were ratified by a referendum of the Palestinian people. Mr. Carter also said he found Syrian leaders eager for a full peace treaty with Israel. PAGE A10 
 GEORGIA-RUSSIA TENSION ESCALATES
 Georgia accused Russia of violating its airspace and using a MiG fighter jet to shoot down an unmanned Georgian reconnaissance drone over the separatist territory of Abkhazia. Russia's Air Force denied the Georgian claim, but Georgia released what it said was the video recording of the final live feed received from the unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. PAGE A12 
 PAKISTANIS FREE ISLAMIST LEADER
 The provincial government in Peshawar, Pakistan, released from prison the leader of a banned Islamist movement after he agreed to denounce violence and work to bring peace to the area. The prisoner was detained six years ago after leading hundreds of men in Afghanistan to fight against United States forces. The agreement appears to be an attempt to pacify the region through negotiation. PAGE A14 
 RICE PRESSES IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for greater financial and diplomatic support for Iraq during a meeting with Arab foreign ministers in Bahrain, but she did not win any new commitments. The ministers did agree that Iraq could be included in future such gatherings, a gesture Ms. Rice called ''a very good step forward for the reintegration of Iraq into regional affairs.'' PAGE A10 
 AFGHAN BAN ON SOAP OPERAS
 In the latest battle of the war between Afghanistan's cultural conservatives and liberals, the minister for information and culture ordered television networks to stop broadcasting five soap operas, saying they were not in keeping with ''Afghan religion and culture.'' The companies initially refused to obey the order but one network has since pulled one show. PAGE A6

 IN PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY, AGE IS MORE THAN A NUMBER
 Young people have left Pennsylvania in droves, giving the state the second-highest proportion of people over 65 in the country (Florida is first). That could be a big factor in the Democratic primary, as age has been a stubborn dividing line in the Democratic race -- with older voters opting for Hillary Rodham Clinton and younger voters flocking to Barack Obama. ''This is classic generational politics,'' one demographer said. ''Their identification with one candidate or the other has to do with the time when voters were socialized.'' PAGE A22 
 THE CONS OF THE DREAM TICKET
 It has been bandied about as a Democratic ''super-ticket'': both Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton as the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees (or vice versa). But one of the big hitches in this scenario coming to fruition is the personal animus the two candidates feel for one another. And were Mr. Obama to secure the presidential nomination, he would have to consider the challenges of managing a certain former president, in this case, his vice president's spouse. PAGE A23

They are trying to determine family blood lines for the children -- to determine whether the group routinely married under-age teenage girls of 15 or younger -- which is made difficult because many children share the same name and have been raised in a communal setting by numerous mothers married to the same man.

 EFFORTS ON VETERANS AND SUICIDES
 On an average day, there are 18 suicides among America's 25 million military veterans, says a spokeswoman from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The agency set up a hot line for veterans in crisis, which has fielded more than 37,200 calls since it opened in August. The hot line gives local responders information so they can check in on troubled veterans, who are at greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, which heightens their risks for suicide.

 In his first remarks after reports surfaced that he and his wife had given just $150 to charity last year, Gov. David Paterson said he did not want to reveal more about his charitable giving because he worried it would bring intrusive news media attention to those he helps. ''I felt to go further into an explanation opened the door to a feeding frenzy that I thought I was the victim of in the last month,'' he said. PAGE C12

 GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO CLIMB
 With Little Hope for Relief
 Gasoline prices surpassed $3.50 a gallon nationwide for the first time and oil jumped to a record as the long rise of energy prices showed little evidence of giving way to recession fears. Some analysts expect it to approach $4 a gallon this summer. The latest rise was prompted by reports that a Nigerian rebel group had blown up pipelines in the Niger Delta. PAGE C1

 Tea has been traded at the Tea Auction Center in the state of Assam, heart of India's famed tea country, since 1861.

The move to computerized auctions promises to turn the tradition-bound world of tea traders upside down. PAGE C1

Many of the nation's wealthiest hedge managers have contributed to Mr. Obama's campaign. PAGE C1 
 SWISS BANK CITES BLIND AMBITION
 The Swiss banking giant UBS, which has written off more debt from the subprime crisis than any other bank, conceded in a report that a blind drive for revenue led it to take more risks than it should have.

 FANS AND TEAMMATES WONDER 
 Why a Star Is Struggling
 Andruw Jones is a five-time All-Star center fielder, but he hasn't looked like one much lately. Since arriving as a free agent as a Los Angeles Dodger this off-season, he has struggled mightily, batting .169 with one home run through 18 games. Some think he's in decline. Jones, though, points to 2005, another season that started off as rockily as this one -- in which he finished with 51 home runs and was the runner-up for the National League Most Valuable Player award.

 A RARE CHANCE TO RUN THE TABLE
 The Trinity College Bantams are inching toward an unprecedented feat: an undefeated season in college baseball.

If the Bantams defeat perennial power Eastern Connecticut State on Tuesday, they will have a very real shot of running the table. ''It's scary to think of,'' said Matthew Sullivan, Trinity's center fielder. ''We know we can do it. We don't talk about it. But in our minds, there's no reason we should lose a game.'' PAGE C17

HEADLINE: Early Target For Fuel Economy Is Expected

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are expected to unveil on Tuesday an accelerated schedule for auto companies to work toward a fuel-efficiency goal of 35 miles a gallon by 2020 for their vehicle fleets. 
 The proposed regulation is likely to require the industry to meet a target of 31.5 miles a gallon for Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, by 2015, according to three people with knowledge of the announcement.
 The interim standard would force auto companies to speed up their development of lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles.
 In December, Congress mandated that auto companies reach a new minimum CAFE standard of 35 miles a gallon between 2011 and 2020. Currently, the average of cars and light trucks combined is about 25 miles a gallon. 
 But the legislation left it to the Bush administration to determine how quickly the industry needed to make progress.
 The announcement, by the Transportation secretary, Mary E. Peters, is expected to require the industry to achieve more than half of the overall goal between 2011 and 2015.
 The Transportation Department declined to provide details of the announcement, scheduled for Tuesday in Washington.
 But one environmental consultant, Daniel F. Becker, said the interim target for CAFE was likely to be 31.5 miles a gallon by 2015. That target would essentially push auto companies to achieve the bulk of the reductions in the first half of the 10-year phase-in period.
 ''They will be implementing roughly two-thirds of the improvements in oil use and emissions in half the time,'' said Mr. Becker, an independent consultant to environmental groups.
 Mr. Becker said he had reason to believe that federal regulators would require an improvement of six miles a gallon by 2015, with an additional four miles a gallon by 2020.
 Environmental groups have argued that auto companies should be pressed to make the greatest strides toward the new CAFE standard early in the process.
 ''The improvements that are made in the early stages will add up significantly over time,'' said Eli Hopson, a Washington representative of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
 Mr. Hopson declined to comment on what his group expected from Ms. Peters's announcement, but said a requirement of 31.5 miles a gallon by 2015 would be ''a good first step.''
 There was no immediate comment from auto companies. Privately, an official at one Detroit automaker said the industry expected an aggressive first-stage requirement toward meeting the CAFE goal.
 The expected announcement comes as gas prices hit landmark highs. On Monday, an oil industry study group said that the average price for regular unleaded gasoline was now a fraction over $3.50 a gallon, nearly 65 cents higher than a year ago.
 ''For the first time ever, the average American is paying more than $3.50 a gallon to fill up a vehicle,'' said a survey released by the Oil Price Information Service.

HEADLINE: Empty Promises on Warming

 BODY:
White House aides had billed President Bush's Rose Garden speech last week as a major turning point at which the president would unveil an ambitious set of proposals to address the problem of global warming -- a late-breaking act of atonement, as it were, for seven years of doing nothing. 
 Sadly, Mr. Bush's ideas amounted to the same old stuff, gussied up to look new. Instead of trying to make up for years of denial and neglect, his speech seemed cynically designed to prevent others from showing the leadership he refuses to provide -- to derail Congress from imposing a price on emissions of carbon dioxide and the states from regulating emissions on their own. 
 Mr. Bush's main proposal was to halt the growth of emissions in the United States, chiefly from power plants, by 2025. This means, of course, that after seven years of letting emissions grow, he would allow them to continue to grow for another 17 years -- and would come nowhere near the swift reductions in emissions that scientists believe are necessary to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. 
 We've been here before with Mr. Bush. A few years ago he grandly offered to reduce ''carbon intensity.'' The idea then was that carbon emissions could rise so long as they rose more slowly than economic growth. The president has never quite grasped the idea that the only way to reverse the process and prevent serious damage is actually to reduce emissions.
 And how would Mr. Bush reach his own inadequate goals? Not surprisingly, there was no mention of government intervention. Mr. Bush argued that industry would do what it hasn't done until now and voluntarily reduce emissions on a broad scale. He insisted that new technology, developed with public and private financing, would make that possible. 
 No one who cares about this problem disputes the need for major investments in cleaner ways of producing energy from existing sources like coal, in alternative energy sources like wind power and in carbon-free technologies that are now little more than dreams. But no one believes that industry will invest in those new technologies until existing ways of producing energy become too expensive. For that to happen, government will need to put a price on carbon emissions through a mandatory cap or carbon taxes, or some combination of both.
 Mr. Bush again resisted that central truth and reaffirmed his opposition to both taxes and the mandatory caps that lie at the heart of a bipartisan Senate bill sponsored by Senators John Warner and Joseph Lieberman. And not only did he oppose new laws, but he also criticized states and the courts for invoking old ones, like the Clean Air Act. 
 Only a few months ago Mr. Bush pledged to obey a Supreme Court ruling that the act required the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases. Now he warns that obeying the law could cause a ''regulatory train wreck.'' 
 It is hard to find anything redeeming in this speech, though it contains two obvious truths: This president has no intention of addressing climate change. The next president will have no choice but to do better.

HEADLINE: On McCain Tour, a Promise To Find 'Forgotten' America

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain opened a weeklong tour of the nation's ''forgotten places'' in the Alabama Black Belt on Monday by acknowledging the challenge he faced in appealing to African-Americans and admitting that ''I am aware of the fact that there will be many people who will not vote for me.''
 But in a speech delivered against the backdrop of one of the great symbols of the civil rights movement, the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, promised to hear voters' concerns and be ''the president of all the people,'' including those who supported his competitors. 
 Mr. McCain was framed in camera shots by the bridge where white police officers beat black demonstrators trying to march to Montgomery in 1965, and where Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama converged last year in a political spectacle to commemorate the footsteps of the marchers.
 ''There must be no forgotten places in America, whether they have been ignored for long years by the sins of indifference and injustice, or have been left behind as the world grew smaller and more economically interdependent,'' Mr. McCain said to a largely white and friendly crowd on the banks of the Alabama River.
 Mr. McCain's trip, which seems a mix of Mrs. Clinton's ''listening tour'' in her 2000 Senate race in New York and President Bush's efforts to portray himself as a ''compassionate conservative'' in his presidential campaign the same year, is to take him to Appalachia; the economically depressed steel town of Youngstown, Ohio; and the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, the area hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
 Mr. McCain's advisers devised the weeklong trip as an effort to show that a Republican could appeal to some traditional Democratic voters, or at least to get Mr. McCain credit for trying. The trip is also trying to attract a fraction of attention to Mr. McCain's campaign in a week when the political center of the world is the Democratic primary showdown in Pennsylvania between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 Democrats dismissed Mr. McCain's trip as a deluded belief that a Republican could appeal to poor people hard hit by seven years of Republican policies. ''It's like an arsonist turning up at the scene of the fire,'' said Paul Begala, a former Clinton White House adviser and a Democratic commentator.
 But some Republicans said that Mr. McCain, who has often bucked his own party and is seeking to attract independents and some moderate Democrats in the fall, had a rationale for the trip. ''I don't know if I would have picked the same locations,'' said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist, ''but it is not crazy for McCain to think that he can get Democratic votes that were unavailable to Bush in 2000 and 2004.'' 
 At the least, the trip is providing video for Mr. McCain's campaign commercials. Later in the day, for example, he was serenaded with old spirituals by the quilters of Gee's Bend, Ala., in a slow-moving ferry ride on the Alabama River.
 While a campaign camera crew recorded the scene from a pontoon boat, Mr. McCain stood on the ferry surrounded by a dozen black quilters who sang ''The Old Ship of Zion'' to the vaguely embarrassed candidate. He had just come from visiting their quilting center.
 One quilter, Mary Lee Bendolph, said she was leaning toward supporting Mr. Obama, but she praised Mr. McCain for turning up in Wilcox County, which locals say a presidential candidate has never visited. ''He came here and he did something, and you know what, nobody else did,'' Mrs. Bendolph said. 
 The vibrant Gee's Bend quilts became famous after they were exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2002 and 2003. Mr. McCain bought three on Monday. 
 His campaign would not say what he paid, but quilts of the similar large size in the Gee's Bend center were $2,500 each.
 Monday was the first time Secret Service agents joined Mr. McCain's campaign. It was unclear how many agents were assigned to Mr. McCain, but there appeared to be a handful. The number is likely to increase as the election nears.

HEADLINE: Financially Stressed Banks May Be Rethinking Asian Investments

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
After loading up on Asian assets, could financially troubled Western banks be forced to sell? 
 That is what analysts and bankers are asking as Bank of America considers reducing its 9 percent stake in the China Construction Bank. After reporting nearly $2 billion in write-downs related to bad loans on Monday, Bank of America executives said they were discussing a sale of the stake with the Chinese government. 
 John Wadle, Asian bank analyst for UBS in Hong Kong, said, ''People may have done these deals at a time when capital was plentiful and hope was abundant, but now they have to be realistic.'' 
 They should be showing investors, Mr. Wadle said, that they are making decisions based on ''what is core and noncore'' business.
 American and European banks acquired minority stakes in many Asian banks in recent years, hoping to capitalize on fast-growing economies that often had nascent consumer credit businesses. 
 For example, American Express, Goldman Sachs and the Allianz Group paid $3.8 billion for a stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006; the Royal Bank of Scotland bought 5 percent of the Bank of China for $1.6 billion in 2005; and Citigroup purchased 10 percent of the Indian bank HDFC in 2006. 
 China and India, among other fast-growing Asian economies, have restrictions on foreign bank business and limit foreign branches, making such deals a necessity for anyone that wants to do business there. 
 China limits individual foreign investors to 20 percent stakes in local banks, but it has discussed increasing that for securities and brokerage firms. 
 Foreign investors are allowed to own as much as 49 percent of private banks in India and 20 percent of state banks, and need approval for each branch they open. They own 40 percent of the largest private bank in India, Icici, and 26 percent of HDFC. 
 Whether Bank of America will actually sell its 9 percent stake, and start a succession of sales, is unclear. 
 ''You've seen a lot of banks suffering with subprime'' said Warren Blight, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in Hong Kong, ''but ultimately there is a lot of interest in China and the rest of Asia,'' and it would be odd for Western banks to abandon that now. 
 Still, Mr. Blight said, if a Western financial institution really needed to raise cash, Asian bank assets might be the way. 
 Many American and European banks took stakes in Chinese institutions before they went public and now have the makings of sizable gains, even after recent losses in the Chinese stock market, Mr. Blight said.
 Bank of America bought the 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank in 2005 for $2.5 billion. It is now worth several times that. 
 Banks often hold a wide variety of assets beyond loans and deposits, including real estate, venture capital and hedge funds, and equity of other companies.
 They have rebalanced these assets on a regular basis -- especially when losses came rolling in from their main businesses of lending money in their home markets. 
 In the 1980s, some American banks unloaded namesake buildings after suffering losses. In 1987, Citigroup's predecessor, Citicorp, saddled with billions in bad loans in developing countries, sold a two-thirds stake in Citicorp Center in Manhattan to the Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company of Japan. 
 In recent years, British banks have been selling branch offices and then leasing them back to free up capital. After deciding en masse to get into the insurance business in the late 1990s -- a pattern inspired perhaps by the combination of Citicorp and the Travelers Group -- banks started dumping those units. 
 In India, bank stocks are trading well off recent peaks. 
 Bhavesh Kanani, a research analyst with Sharekhan, a brokerage firm in Mumbai, said, ''I as an investor would not exit at this point unless the need for cash is pressing.'' 
 Indian investors are likely to pick up any shares that foreign banks sell. Their relatively low price ''makes them attractive for domestic institutions such as mutual funds, which are sitting on a cash pile,'' Mr. Kanani said. 
 Some analysts express doubt that American and European banks will significantly shed assets at this time. ''These banks are cash flow-positive and their cash positions are growing,'' Richard Bove, an analyst with Punk Ziegel, said. ''They will reduce employment in businesses where the outlook is weaker.'' 
 Selling Chinese assets could be difficult for American banks because they have made gains on these deals while Chinese investment groups that have bought into American financial companies have watched their investments decline in value.
 Whether foreign banks start selling stakes in their Asian counterparts may come down to how the original deal was negotiated.
 ''It all depends on the terms, and understanding and agreement banks have when they entered into these commitments,'' Mr. Wadle of UBS said.

HEADLINE: In Clinton vs. Obama, Age Is One of the Greatest Predictors

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Jay Leno recently made fun of a commercial for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, in which she referred to playing pinochle as a child at her grandfather's lake house in Pennsylvania.
 ''Pinochle?'' Mr. Leno said quizzically to his late-night audience. ''Well, that'll help with the young voters, huh? I mean, come on. What kids aren't playing pinochle now?''
 The joke about the old card game captured a truth about this year's Democratic primary: Mrs. Clinton has generally bypassed younger voters. And they have bypassed her, flocking instead to her rival, Senator Barack Obama. At the same time, she has attracted older voters, those who grew up in the pre-Internet era and might actually have played pinochle. 
 In a campaign where demographics seem to be destiny, one of the most striking factors is the segregation of voters by age. In state after state, older voters have formed a core constituency for Mrs. Clinton, who is 60, while younger voters have coalesced around Mr. Obama, who is 46. Age has been one of the most consistent indicators of how someone might vote -- more than sex, more than income, more than education. Only race is a stronger predictor of voting than age, and then only if a voter is black, not if he or she is white.
 Age is likely to play a particularly strong role in the Democratic primary Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The outmigration of young people has left the state with the second-highest proportion of people over 65 in the country, after Florida. Fifty-eight percent of registered Democrats are older than 45, a consistent dividing line in the race.
 As an enduring part of Mrs. Clinton's coalition -- which also includes blue-collar workers, Roman Catholics and women -- older voters are expected to vote lopsidedly for her.
 Rosalie Hertzog, 60, a teacher, saw Mrs. Clinton in West Chester over the weekend. ''I can recognize that same age area and what we've gone through as women together,'' Ms. Hertzog said. ''I'm not saying I'm voting for her just as a woman. But I recognize all the hardships that we've had to overcome, and to think we've even gotten this far is wonderful, it really is.''
 Experience also matters to Ms. Hertzog. 
 ''It's not that I don't like Barack,'' she said. ''I just don't think he's seasoned enough.''
 According to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky in the states that have voted so far, 57 percent of voters 65 and older have supported Mrs. Clinton and 36 percent have supported Mr. Obama. Most of the Clinton voters say they want a candidate with experience.
 Of voters age 30 and younger, 59 percent have supported Mr. Obama and 38 percent have supported Mrs. Clinton. Most of Mr. Obama's supporters say they want change.
 Part of the reason is simply identification with one's own age bracket, which both candidates have tried to exploit. 
 ''This is classic generational politics,'' said Gordon F. De Jong, a demographer at Pennsylvania State University. ''Their identification with one candidate or the other has to do with the time when voters were socialized.''
 Mrs. Clinton may not have appreciated it a couple of weeks ago when her husband suggested that she misstated the circumstances of her trip to Bosnia because she was 60, tired and forgetful; on the other hand, maybe some voters could relate.
 ''If I was in my 20s, maybe I'd support Obama,'' said Germaine Donahue, 64, who lives in Sullivan County, in northeastern Pennsylvania, and helps run a cleaning service. ''But life tempers you. I'm with Hillary.''
 Sullivan County has the highest concentration of people over 65 in the state, but it is sparsely populated and largely Republican. Only 1,770 people, or 39 percent of all registered voters in the county, are Democrats. Mrs. Donahue, who is the Democratic county vice chairwoman, gathered a few of them the other night in Laporte township to talk about the campaign.
 John Peterman, 85, a former Navy engineer, said he supported Mrs. Clinton because ''the world is not ready for a black president.'' His wife, Mary, 81, agreed with him.
 Noel Stein, 72, and his wife, Judy, 67, both like Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Stein said she liked her ''because she's a woman'' and Mr. Stein said he liked her because of her husband.
 Arla Hacker, 49, a bank teller, said she also liked Mrs. Clinton because she had Ms. Hacker's economic interests at heart. ''The people who are 18 and 20 years old don't know what it's like to sit in a gas line,'' she said. ''Kids today don't understand how tough it is. Obama just talks about it.''
 But Derek Davis, 68, said he was voting for Mr. Obama. He said Mrs. Clinton was too adversarial. ''Let's give the young guy a try,'' Mr. Davis said.
 Mr. De Jong, the demographer, said the state was older than most others because it had been losing a larger percentage of its young people for a longer time, largely because they were looking for jobs. That not only reduced the number of young people, it also lowered the birth rate.
 Neither campaign likes to say that it appeals chiefly to a particular age group. ''We're not conceding any demographic,'' said Nick Clemons, a senior adviser for Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania. 
 On the other hand, they cannot ignore the obvious, or the reliable cushion that it provides. 
 ''Barack Obama has no experience and no plans. He just works on emotions, and this is why young people like him,'' said Kimberly Romm, 44, who is self-employed and heard Mrs. Clinton speak at Haverford College. ''People who are more mature analyze things. They're wiser.''

HEADLINE: City Says the Kingsbridge Armory Will Become a Shopping Center

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
For years, the Kingsbridge Armory, a blocklong red brick castle with soaring turrets that dominates the West Bronx's low-rise streetscape, has been a neighborhood embarrassment.
 The nine-story Romanesque building on Kingsbridge Road at Jerome Avenue has been mostly vacant for more than a decade, a blemish on the working-class Kingsbridge Heights area not because of its appearance, but because it was not being used.
 But on Monday, the Bloomberg administration announced the latest in a series of city plans to use the landmark building, and says it has chosen a developer. The project includes a $310 million shopping center anchored by a large department store, as many as 35 smaller shops, a movie theater and restaurants. 
 The project, called the Shops at the Armory, will most likely also house various community organizations, including a small business incubator, city officials said.
 ''It is a beautiful building, and once the plan comes together, we think it will revitalize not only the immediate area, but the entire northwest Bronx,'' said Fernando Tirado, district manager of the local community board. 
 Even before the recent economic downturn, poverty in the area was high. A study by the Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance, a neighborhood and labor group, found that one-third of the families in the area live below the poverty line, and that 18 percent of adults are unemployed. 
 ''We have real needs here, and this building is an asset in the community that has not been used,'' said Desiree Pilgrim-Hunter, a resident of the area for 25 years who supports the plan.
 Most people in the neighborhood said on Monday that while the idea of potential shopping was a bonus, they were more focused on jobs.
 ''They have to provide jobs that pay, not low-paying jobs that continue the cycle of poverty,'' said Father Joseph Girone of St. Nicholas of Tolentine Roman Catholic Church, which is a few blocks from the armory.
 The Bloomberg administration's selection of the Related Companies to oversee the development was reported on Monday by The New York Post, and confirmed in an official announcement. Related is also building Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, a large retail complex on the site of the old Bronx Terminal Market, and recently completed a third shopping complex at the Hub, also in the Bronx.
 Seth Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that Related was chosen for the armory project because of its design proposal.
 ''The physical layout was superior -- you will walk into the armory and get a sense of the volume of the drill hall,'' Mr. Pinsky said, referring to the 180,000 square feet of open space used for training troops.
 While the city chose Related based on its experience and the amount it was willing to invest in the project, a task force of local residents and others compared proposals without knowing who the developers were, and also came up with Related, officials said.
 City officials said that despite a history of armory redevelopment plans falling through -- unsuccessful plans for the 575,000-square-foot building include a police academy, a sports complex, and several public schools -- they believe they have it right this time.
 ''The key to the success this time around was that from the very beginning of the process we've involved the local community,'' Mr. Pinsky said. 
 The armory was built by the city between 1912 and 1917. Like many others built around the turn of the century, it was used to store arms and ammunition and to train troops. 
 In 1917, the National Guard's Eighth Coastal Artillery Regiment moved from its own armory on 94th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan to the Kingsbridge Armory to gain space. 
 In 1974, the armory, noted for its Romanesque arches, vaulted ceilings, decorative brick and terra cotta and twin battlement towers -- was designated a city landmark. A moat once ran across the front of the building.
 The drill hall, which has a metal and glass roof, remains among the largest in the world.
 In the early 1990s, part of the building was used as a homeless shelter for women. Over the years, the building has been home to boat shows, dog shows and concerts, including one in 1971 by the Beach Boys.
 By 1994, however, the armory had a leaky roof and was in general disrepair. Eventually, its National Guard units left as well, deciding to train in two modern annexes behind the building. The state ceded title to the armory to the city in 1996. 
 The main armory building has been unused since about 2000.
 In the late '90s, the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, working with Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, devised a plan that included three schools, an indoor sports complex, a community center and retail space. Then in 2000, the Giuliani administration proposed a $110 million sports, entertainment and retail center, which was opposed by the neighborhood and eventually withdrawn. In the meantime, the city spent $30 million to replace the roof.
 Despite the high poverty rate in Kingsbridge Heights, Related and the city said a shopping development could work at the armory because Bronx residents had limited shopping options.
 The retailers have not yet been chosen. Negotiations are continuing, which call for Related to buy the building, retain the exterior and rebuild the interior. The plan requires approval by the City Council, which officials said probably would not be granted until next year.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Crucial Primary, Clinton Ad Invokes bin Laden

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: BLUE BELL, Pa. 

 BODY:
The six-week Pennsylvania primary drew to a contentious finish Monday as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton invoked images of Pearl Harbor and Osama bin Laden in a television advertisement that questioned Senator Barack Obama's ability to lead in a crisis.
 As she sought to spark a comeback in the Democratic nominating contest, Mrs. Clinton warned voters not to ''take a leap of faith or have any guesswork'' when they cast ballots Tuesday. 
 The Obama campaign accused her of employing ''the politics of fear.''
 With 158 pledged delegates at stake in Pennsylvania, the largest state remaining on the party's primary calendar, the candidates raced from Scranton to Pittsburgh to Philadelphia -- and a smattering of suburbs along the way -- to rally their supporters and win over a dwindling lot of undecided voters.
 While Mr. Obama spent nearly twice as much on television advertising in the state as Mrs. Clinton in the final days of the race, she broadcast a new commercial that used historic images from critical moments in the country's past to ask voters whom they could trust in the White House. It did not mention Mr. Obama, but closed with ''Who do you think has what it takes?''
 Mr. Obama, after three days of criticizing Mrs. Clinton with some of his sharpest language of the campaign, did not directly engage her. But his campaign quickly responded with an advertisement of its own that asked voters: ''Who in times of challenge will unite us -- not use fear and calculation to divide us?''
 Pennsylvania has become a major battleground in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination, with the future of Mrs. Clinton's campaign most likely resting on the outcome. Even a wide victory by her would not overcome her deficit in pledged delegates or in the popular vote of states that have held nominating contests, but it would ensure that the race moved on to contests in Indiana and North Carolina in two weeks, on May 6.
 As she spoke Monday in her father's hometown, Scranton, Mrs. Clinton reinforced the message of her advertisement, arguing that Mr. Obama was untested. ''I don't want you to take a leap of faith or have any guesswork'' about the next president, she said. ''We've had enough of that,'' she added. 
 Her commercial was the first in which a Democratic candidate had used Osama bin Laden in the presidential race, although Republicans, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, have done so. In her commercial, Mr. bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, is featured along with grainy images of the stock market crash of 1929, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the fall of the Berlin Wall and Hurricane Katrina.
 In an interview Monday with Larry King on CNN , Mrs. Clinton said the advertisement addressed the reality ''that the new president will inherit some of the most dangerous and difficult decisions that any president has had to make in a very long time.''
 ''I want people to think seriously about leadership, because that's what I'm offering in this campaign,'' she said.
 Bill Burton, an Obama spokesman, responded that Mrs. Clinton was invoking Mr. bin Laden ''to score political points.'' He added, ''We already have a president who plays the politics of fear, and we don't need another.''
 As Obama supporters worked to drum up support, they said they were still hearing rumors that Mr. Obama was Muslim and questions about his patriotism. At an evening campaign stop, a voter asked Mr. Obama how he could allay such concerns. 
 ''It frustrates me that people would even have a question about something like that, because they don't ask the same questions of some of the other candidates,'' said Mr. Obama, who told a story about an American flag he received at the funeral of his grandfather, a World War II veteran. ''If they don't vote for me, it should be because they think Senator Clinton or Senator McCain have better ideas. It shouldn't be because they think that I am less patriotic or because they question what my religious faith is.''
 The Clinton campaign manager, Maggie Williams, pleaded for volunteers Monday to help work phone banks and perform other get-out-the-vote tasks.
 ''To put it as simply as I can, more calls equal more votes,'' Ms. Williams wrote in an e-mail message to supporters.
 The central battlegrounds included Pittsburgh, where both candidates stopped Monday, and the Philadelphia suburbs, including Blue Bell, where Mr. Obama arrived Monday afternoon.
 He sat beneath a blossoming dogwood tree, surrounded by about three dozen people who had been invited by the campaign, and took questions about the economy, education and foreign policy. He did a series of television interviews but did not take reporters' questions. 
 ''Why can't I just eat my waffle?'' he said when asked about former President Jimmy Carter's meeting with Hamas officials. 
 David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, told reporters Monday evening that he believed it was ''very difficult'' for Mrs. Clinton to win the nomination. But he conceded that it was likely she would win Pennsylvania.
 ''It's one more stop along the way,'' Mr. Axelrod said.

PERSON: Geoffrey Polites 

HEADLINE: Geoffrey Polites, 60, Australian Ford Official

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
Geoffrey Polites, the chief executive of Jaguar and Land Rover who played a key role in arranging last month's deal to sell the brands to an Indian automaker, died Sunday in his hometown, Melbourne, Australia. He was 60. 
 The Ford Motor Company, based in Dearborn, Mich., confirmed his death, saying it followed a serious illness of more than two years; Mr. Polites had been quoted in industry publications as saying he had cancer. 
 Mr. Polites, who lived in Great Britain while running Jaguar and Land Rover since 2005, had traveled to Melbourne last week after the birth of his first grandchild, the Sydney Morning Herald reported; his health worsened unexpectedly before he could see the child and he was admitted to a hospital, where he died.
 Mr. Polites had been with Ford for nearly 40 years, as a product planner, dealer and executive. His tenure with the carmaker was expected to end this quarter, when Tata Motors of India plans to take control of Jaguar and Land Rover. Ford will receive $1.7 billion from Tata, about one-third of the total price it originally paid for Jaguar and Land Rover in 1989 and 2000, respectively.
 Ford said that David Smith, the chief financial officer of Jaguar Land Rover, would act as the brands' chief executive until a successor to Mr. Polites was selected.
 Ford Australia hired Mr. Polites as a product planner in 1970. He held several executive positions with Ford in Australia and Europe before leaving in 1988 to run the City Ford dealership in Sydney.
 In 1999, Mr. Polites became president of Ford Australia, where he often fraternized with factory workers and eliminated executive perks.
 Jaguar and Land Rover were money losers when Mr. Polites was appointed to head them in 2005. They made a profit in all four quarters of 2007, Ford said.
 ''His drive and determination, combined with his clear sense of vision for the business, played a huge role in turning round the business at Jaguar Land Rover and returning it to profitability,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. ''Geoff ensured that Jaguar Land Rover was not distracted and continued to focus on the fundamentals of the business during the recent sale process, despite at the time also fighting his own personal health battle.''
 Mr. Polites, who was born in Melbourne in 1948, received an economics degree from Monash University there.
 He is survived by his wife, Linda, and two sons.

 BODY:
DELTA'S HELICOPTER SHUTTLE It is now easier for Delta Air Lines passengers to book helicopter shuttle flights on US Helicopter between Kennedy International Airport and two heliports in Manhattan, thanks to a code-sharing agreement between Delta and US Helicopter. A one-way ticket for the eight-minute helicopter trip was $165 on Monday. For passengers flying on most international BusinessElite tickets, the helicopter ride is free, Delta said. 
 A FEE FOR A CHOICE SEATUS Airways will begin charging $5 to $15, depending on the length of a domestic flight segment, for select aisle and window seats, starting May 7. US Airways calls the new policy Choice Seats, and says passengers will have the option to buy them when checking in online. Preferred-status members of US Airways Dividend Miles frequent-flier program will still qualify for choice seats without charge, depending on availability. Preferred members will also continue to have ''exclusive access'' to exit row seats, US Airways said. 
 NEW YORK HOTELS DOING WELL The average occupancy rate at New York City hotels was 80.8 percent in February, compared with 77.9 percent in February 2007, says PKF Consulting. The average room rate in all segments of New York hotels was $264.50, up from $243.10 the previous February. In the top luxury segment of hotels, where room rates start at $350 a night, the average rate was $475.46, up from $455.06.
 SLOWDOWN AT MARRIOTTMarriott International reported that revenue per available room, an industry benchmark, rose 18.5 percent worldwide, but 6 percent in North America. ''Business and leisure travel demand remains robust in most markets around the world,'' said J. W. Marriott Jr., the chief executive. But, he added, ''performance at our U.S. hotels reflected slowing economic growth,'' although ''with the U.S. on sale through a lower dollar, international guest arrivals are energizing demand in several key markets.''
 NEW RED-EYE TO PARISAir France is adding a seasonal red-eye flight between Kennedy International Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris from June 23 to Sept. 28. The Paris-bound flight leaves Kennedy at 1 a.m. and arrives at de Gaulle at 2:10 p.m. The new westbound flight leaves Paris at 8:45 p.m. and arrives in New York at 10:50 p.m.

HEADLINE: CANADA: CENTRAL BANK REDUCES LENDING RATE

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark lending rate by one half of a percentage point, bringing it to 3 percent. It was the second consecutive cut in the rate and its announcement came with a warning about deteriorating economic conditions in the United States. ''The bank is now projecting a deeper and more protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy,'' it said. ''This has direct consequences for the Canadian economic outlook, with declining exports projected to exert a significant drag on growth in 2008.'' The central bank added that it did not expect the economy of the United States to stabilize until the middle of 2010.

HEADLINE: Nevada: Three-Count Indictment In Ricin Case

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A federal grand jury in Las Vegas has charged a man who was believed to have ricin poisoning with possessing the deadly toxin and weapons. The indictment against Roger Bergendorff lists three counts: possession of a biological toxin, possession of unregistered firearms and possession of firearms not identified by serial number. The charges carry a possible penalty of 30 years in federal prison. Mr. Bergendorff, 57, an unemployed graphic designer, has been jailed since last week when he was released from a hospital. The authorities say Mr. Bergendorff made the ricin as part of a scheme to hurt unspecified enemies.

HEADLINE: Real World Doesn't Give Even an Inch In Real Estate

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Not an inch of new space for exit stairs has been required in the office buildings that have gone up in New York since Sept. 11, 2001. The World Trade Center towers were only one-third occupied that morning. Had they been full, the stairways in each tower would have gotten so crowded that 14,000 more people probably would have died, a federal study determined. 
 The real world had shown that the old standards for exits would not hold up in a mass emergency. 
 In early 2002, a new city buildings commissioner, Patricia Lancaster, set up a group to find lessons for safety in high-rise buildings from the 9/11 calamity. The report from the World Trade Center Building Code Task Force made 21 recommendations -- among them, better signs for exits, inspections of fireproofing, enhanced evacuation plans and fire drills. 
 On the question of wider or more staircases, the task force suggested no new requirements.
 That was the real world speaking, too.
 The real estate industry did not want to surrender valuable space to staircases that hardly anyone uses. Most high-rise fires, after all, are contained to small areas, so thousands of people do not usually leave at once. And the staircases cannot be counted as rentable square feet: They are dead weight in the arithmetic of development. 
 At the time, Ms. Lancaster explained the industry's antagonism to expanding the exit stairs: ''One inch on every staircase in every high rise is hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
 Ms. Lancaster quit her job on Tuesday. Construction accidents have been climbing. In one case, a builder in Brooklyn claimed that he had poured a foundation of three 90-foot concrete slabs, and on 18 visits by building inspectors to the site, no one noticed that the slabs were not actually there. 
 A property owner in Harlem was ordered to secure a dangerous building, and for months no one noticed that nothing had happened. Then the building crumbled onto Park Avenue. Ms. Lancaster's department simply could not keep up with the city's real estate boom. The mayor all but threw her overboard on Monday with an icy public critique. 
 Many saw Ms. Lancaster as a determined reformer, patiently working the gears and mechanisms of government to make buildings safer. It took nearly two years just to reach agreement on how much luminescent paint to require on the edges of stairs. She spent nearly that much time lobbying to get the power to bar engineers and architects who were found to have filed phony paperwork.
 For a buildings commissioner who pushes forward, there are almost infinite forces that can drive him or her backward.
 In 1998, a developer was ordered to stop work on a condominium building on Heyward Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, because inspectors had found that it was five feet wider than code permitted. Political aides in City Hall intervened for the developer and demanded that the work be allowed to go forward, but the buildings commissioner for Brooklyn, Joseph Trivisonno, backed the inspectors.
 Eventually, the aides ordered the New York buildings commissioner to remove Mr. Trivisonno. The city commissioner refused. The City Hall aides then used their power to block pay increases and promotions in the department. The commissioner surrendered: Mr. Trivisonno was transferred out of his job in Brooklyn and left government. (In the end, the developer bought adjacent property that gave him enough space to legally complete the building at the same width.)
 At times, it can take decades to see the forces that shape safety and building. Forty years ago, the city adopted a new building code. At the urging of the real estate industry, the city lifted requirements for special exit stairways that had been part of high-rise construction for 50 years, since reforms that followed calamities like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. These special exits were called fire towers, and they can still be found in older skyscrapers -- staircases protected from smoke, encased in a strong structure that is a kind of miniature building within the building. 
 The fire stairs were expensive to build and meant a sacrifice of rentable space.
 With the 1968 code, the city eliminated the fire towers. The chairman of the City Council's building committee explained that this was a very positive step forward in economic development. As an example, he cited the Pan Am building, which had recently opened. 
 If the provisions of the new code had been in effect when it was under construction and the owners could have dropped the fire tower, they would have had 2 percent more rentable space. That would have been worth about $1.8 million annually in 1968, the councilman said.
 Those code changes came just in time for the builders of the World Trade Center, then in the planning stages. Although the trade center was not legally bound by the code because it was owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, officials had promised to comply with the city standard. And as soon as it was clear that the fire towers would not be required, they were eliminated from the trade center design.
 For years that decision meant more square feet available for rent at the trade center. On Sept. 11, though, it meant one fewer staircase for hundreds of people who had survived the plane crashes but were trapped on the upper floors with no way out. 
 Afterward, fire chiefs argued that the fire towers should once again be part of high-rise buildings. 
 No one else was ready to give an inch. The real world had spoken again -- louder than any firefighter or buildings commissioner.

HEADLINE: A Bit of Old Baghdad With a Western Twist

BYLINE: By OLIVER SCHWANER-ALBRIGHT

 BODY:
APARISIM GHOSH, a longtime foreign correspondent who is now the World editor for Time magazine, rates his global assignments by the food.
 Hong Kong was magnificent, London a disappointment. New York, where he has been stationed since September, is shaping up nicely, and he has been seeking out new tastes all over town. But he is a regular at La Kabbr, on Ninth Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets, a restaurant that takes him back to the city where he lived for more than four years.
 ''It's the only Iraqi restaurant in New York,'' said Mr. Ghosh, formerly the Baghdad bureau chief for Time (his byline is Bobby Ghosh). ''And it's better than most restaurants in Baghdad.''
 La Kabbr has become something of a clubhouse for journalists and officials who have spent time in Baghdad, and for Iraqi expatriates and Iraqi-Americans. On a recent night Mr. Ghosh was joined at La Kabbr by some of his Iraqi colleagues. 
 It was a busy night. Strangers sat next to one another at two communal tables while waiters set down platters of quzi (lamb shank with almonds and raisins) and masgouf (a whole freshwater fish split open and roasted); friends shared hookahs; and a live band, improbably squeezed into a corner, kept conversation at a playful shout. 
 It was, said a woman clapping to the music, ''just like Baghdad.'' She didn't explain that she was not talking about Baghdad today. She didn't have to.
 New York has many restaurants where people go to eat the food of the country they came from and to talk about what life was like there. What is different about La Kabbr is that the place they talk about -- Iraq before the war -- no longer exists.
 The phrase ''before the war'' turns up in many conversations in the restaurant, for better or for worse. 
 Before the war, imported food was scarce and canned goods were a luxury. Before the war, Iraqis could stay out after dark without fearing for their safety. Before the war, there were breweries, and restaurants sold beer. But now alcohol is illegal (although there is a brisk black market for it). 
 Mr. Ghosh and his friends started dinner with fresh juices: Halawy (carrot, celery, beet and parsley) and Hashoomy (carrot, apple and orange). 
 Before the war, one of them said, there were restaurants in Baghdad that were famous for their juices. They are gone now, the men agreed.
 Farouk Mansoor, a Basra-born chef, opened La Kabbr last year. Mr. Mansoor moved to Michigan in 1978, when he was 23, to live with his brother. 
 He opened what became one of the most popular restaurants in the Detroit area's large Arab-American community. When the economy soured, he decided to give Manhattan a try. He has found that the city offers many advantages over life in Michigan. For one, he said, ''you can see the streets in winter.'' 
 Few New Yorkers seem to notice that La Kabbr is an Iraqi restaurant, seeing it instead as a generic Middle Eastern place. And, in fact, La Kabbr attracts an ethnic mix, including many Arab-Americans. 
 Mr. Mansoor pointed out that he had hung flags from all the Middle Eastern nations on the walls, even though the Iraqi flag in the corner was the largest. ''We love Kuwaitis,'' he said. ''When Iranians come we give them a hug.'' 
 But most of the diners are from Iraqi, and some in the dining room tried to guess from a name who was, say, from Mosul. In Iraq such information can have ethno-sectarian overtones. Here it was essentially a parlor game. 
 The diners at the restaurant were warm and welcoming in conversation but almost all of them asked that their names not appear in this article out of concern for their families. 
 One of the men with Mr. Ghosh that night, Ali Mohammed Zeki, a former farmer, is the Baghdad bureau manager for Time. Like many farmers, he has strong opinions about food.
 ''The first thing you need to understand about the Iraqi meal is that there must be meat,'' he announced. ''Breakfast: meat. Lunch: meat. Dinner: meat. You go to other Arab countries and they have meat maybe twice a week, but in Iraq it's every meal.''
 Then he told what he said was a funny story: once, a journalist from the United States was in Baghdad shopping for dinner, and he bought a carrot. Mr. Ghosh laughed. ''In Iraq it is shameful to buy only one,'' Mr. Zeki explained. ''You want tomatoes, you buy a kilo, two kilos, five kilos. One is for beggars. You go to the market and ask for one, they give you one for free.''
 According to Mr. Mansoor, all cooking in his native country is home cooking, what one of his patrons called ''the big Iraqi meal.'' The point of dinner is to eat until hunger is a distant memory, then eat some more. As Mr. Ghosh later said, ''You must stagger out of the restaurant.''
 Mr. Ghosh, who was born in Calcutta, raised a socio-gastronomic question.
 ''I wonder why Iraqi cuisine is not more sophisticated,'' he said. ''It is essentially peasant food, which I happen to love because it fits my palate perfectly. But intellectually, you wonder why, with all of its influences, the food isn't more complex.'' 
 He outlined the culinary history of Iraq, from Babylon to the Ottomans, ending with Saddam Hussein's rise to power, when his followers from rural Tikrit became Baghdad's elite. ''The village came to the city and in very short order it dominated,'' Mr. Ghosh continued. ''You go to any Baghdad restaurant and they serve comfort food. The American equivalent would be if all the restaurants in New York served meatloaf.'' 
 Now much of Iraqi cuisine is indistinguishable from that found in the rest of the Middle East: tzatziki and baba ghanouj, kebabs and baklava. Falafel, now common in Iraq, first appeared there in the late 1960s, Mr. Zeki said, when some Palestinians opened a stand on Khayam Street, next to a popular cinema. 
 But there are distinctions. At La Kabbr the hummus comes with warm pita, but in Iraq it would be served with samoon, a nan-like bread that isn't to be found in New York.
 It was after midnight, and the restaurant was filled with laughter and lively maqam music anchored by a man playing the santur, a dulcimer. It was warm out and the restaurant opened onto the sidewalk, where three young women had stopped to dance. 
 Soon the entire restaurant was cheering them on, some diners snapping their fingers -- which in Iraq means clasping your hands and pressing your index fingers together -- a few ululations thrown in for good measure. 
 Mr. Mansoor brought out small glasses of strong Sri Lankan tea brewed with crushed cardamom. There was a round of ''ashat eedak,'' which translates as ''bless your hands,'' and is the same as saying ''my compliments to the chef.'' 
 ''Nobody in Baghdad will believe you when you tell them about this,'' said Mr. Ghosh, clapping to the music. 
 ''That in New York girls dance in the street to maqam in the middle of the night?'' Mr. Zeki said. ''No, they won't believe me.''

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Vs. the Euro Is Steep Tax For Europe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
The euro rose above $1.60 on Tuesday for the first time, contributing to a further increase in the price of oil as investors moved into commodities to hedge against inflation. 
 The dollar's decline against the euro also added to pressure on big European exporters to raise prices, and it drew admonitions from Germany toward governments seeking to encourage the European Central Bank to push the currency lower.
 The euro briefly crossed the $1.60 level in late afternoon trading in Europe, quoted just below 1.602. In New York later, it settled at $1.60, up from $1.5916 on Monday. 
 The euro's strength came after public comments by two bank governors in Europe, who said that interest rates in the euro zone could rise if inflation was not curtailed. A primary objective of the bank is to maintain price stability, and it seeks to hold the rate of inflation below 2 percent over the medium term. In March, the rate was at 3.6 percent, according to Eurostat.
 Whether through fear of inflation or speculation over the reliability of supplies, the price of oil rose to another record. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery, the last day for that contract, settled at $119.37 a barrel, up $1.89, or 1.6 percent. The June oil contract settled at $118.07 a barrel. The price of oil is up 24 percent this year.
 In a clear sign that the euro's sharp rise against the dollar is weighing ever more heavily on some exporters, Airbus said Tuesday that it would raise the price of its aircraft, which are priced in dollars. Not only is its main product priced in dollars, but the company is constrained politically from moving big chunks of production out of Europe to dollar-based countries to ease the currency pressure. Airbus has joint management in France and Germany and thousands of jobs in both countries.
 Airbus said its price increases -- up to $4 million on the flagship A380 superjumbo jet -- would go into effect May 1. It blamed the falling value of the dollar and the rising prices of commodities like steel and aluminum used in making aircraft.
 ''We have to keep pace with the world market price developments and secure profitable deals,'' said John Leahy, a chief operating officer.
 Its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS, has been struggling to reduce the effect of unfavorable exchange rates. It has also been trying to diversify its exposure and reposition its business to shift more costs into dollars.
 The dollar has lost about 15 percent of its value against the euro in the last 12 months while metals prices have gone up at least 6.5 percent, Airbus said in a statement. The company uses metals for about 40 percent of the construction of new planes, including titanium, steel, aluminum and aluminum-lithium.
 Airbus said the price increases would come on top of a normal increase in prices of 2.74 percent and would mean that customers would pay an additional $2 million for a single-aisle aircraft and $4 million for wide-body long-range planes, including the A380.
 Mr. Leahy said that even with the price increases, the company's line of efficient planes would deliver value for airlines in an environment where the price of fuel -- currently about 40 percent of an airline's operating costs -- has risen sharply.
 Concerns in the business world about the strong euro now threaten a rift of sorts in Europe. The biggest economy in the 15-nation euro area, Germany, rejected fresh calls to dilute the inflation-fighting mandate of the European Central Bank to help rein in the soaring currency. 
 The Germans, long defenders of central bank independence, said they categorically opposed a plea from the incoming Italian government for greater political control over the bank. 
 Germany's move seemed intended to pre-empt any effort by Italy and France to start a drive to help loosen central bank policy and pursue a more growth-oriented strategy.

HEADLINE: Inmate Count In U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations'

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population. But it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners.
 Indeed, the United States leads the world in producing prisoners, a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive American approach to crime and punishment. Americans are locked up for crimes -- from writing bad checks to using drugs -- that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries. And in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations.
 Criminologists and legal scholars in other industrialized nations say they are mystified and appalled by the number and length of American prison sentences.
 The United States has, for instance, 2.3 million criminals behind bars, more than any other nation, according to data maintained by the International Center for Prison Studies at King's College London. 
 China, which is four times more populous than the United States, is a distant second, with 1.6 million people in prison. (That number excludes hundreds of thousands of people held in administrative detention, most of them in China's extrajudicial system of re-education through labor, which often singles out political activists who have not committed crimes.)
 San Marino, with a population of about 30,000, is at the end of the long list of 218 countries compiled by the center. It has a single prisoner.
 The United States comes in first, too, on a more meaningful list from the prison studies center, the one ranked in order of the incarceration rates. It has 751 people in prison or jail for every 100,000 in population. (If you count only adults, one in 100 Americans is locked up.)
 The only other major industrialized nation that even comes close is Russia, with 627 prisoners for every 100,000 people. The others have much lower rates. England's rate is 151; Germany's is 88; and Japan's is 63. 
 The median among all nations is about 125, roughly a sixth of the American rate. 
 There is little question that the high incarceration rate here has helped drive down crime, though there is debate about how much. 
 Criminologists and legal experts here and abroad point to a tangle of factors to explain America's extraordinary incarceration rate: higher levels of violent crime, harsher sentencing laws, a legacy of racial turmoil, a special fervor in combating illegal drugs, the American temperament, and the lack of a social safety net. Even democracy plays a role, as judges -- many of whom are elected, another American anomaly -- yield to populist demands for tough justice.
 Whatever the reason, the gap between American justice and that of the rest of the world is enormous and growing.
 It used to be that Europeans came to the United States to study its prison systems. They came away impressed.
 ''In no country is criminal justice administered with more mildness than in the United States,'' Alexis de Tocqueville, who toured American penitentiaries in 1831, wrote in ''Democracy in America.'' 
 No more. 
 ''Far from serving as a model for the world, contemporary America is viewed with horror,'' James Q. Whitman, a specialist in comparative law at Yale, wrote last year in Social Research. ''Certainly there are no European governments sending delegations to learn from us about how to manage prisons.''
 Prison sentences here have become ''vastly harsher than in any other country to which the United States would ordinarily be compared,'' Michael H. Tonry, a leading authority on crime policy, wrote in ''The Handbook of Crime and Punishment.''
 Indeed, said Vivien Stern, a research fellow at the prison studies center in London, the American incarceration rate has made the United States ''a rogue state, a country that has made a decision not to follow what is a normal Western approach.''
 The spike in American incarceration rates is quite recent. From 1925 to 1975, the rate remained stable, around 110 people in prison per 100,000 people. It shot up with the movement to get tough on crime in the late 1970s. (These numbers exclude people held in jails, as comprehensive information on prisoners held in state and local jails was not collected until relatively recently.)
 The nation's relatively high violent crime rate, partly driven by the much easier availability of guns here, helps explain the number of people in American prisons.
 ''The assault rate in New York and London is not that much different,'' said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group. ''But if you look at the murder rate, particularly with firearms, it's much higher.''
 Despite the recent decline in the murder rate in the United States, it is still about four times that of many nations in Western Europe.
 But that is only a partial explanation. The United States, in fact, has relatively low rates of nonviolent crime. It has lower burglary and robbery rates than Australia, Canada and England.
 People who commit nonviolent crimes in the rest of the world are less likely to receive prison time and certainly less likely to receive long sentences. The United States is, for instance, the only advanced country that incarcerates people for minor property crimes like passing bad checks, Mr. Whitman wrote.
 Efforts to combat illegal drugs play a major role in explaining long prison sentences in the United States as well. In 1980, there were about 40,000 people in American jails and prisons for drug crimes. These days, there are almost 500,000. 
 Those figures have drawn contempt from European critics. ''The U.S. pursues the war on drugs with an ignorant fanaticism,'' said Ms. Stern of King's College.
 Many American prosecutors, on the other hand, say that locking up people involved in the drug trade is imperative, as it helps thwart demand for illegal drugs and drives down other kinds of crime. Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, for instance, has fought hard to prevent the early release of people in federal prison on crack cocaine offenses, saying that many of them ''are among the most serious and violent offenders.''
 Still, it is the length of sentences that truly distinguishes American prison policy. Indeed, the mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States at the top of the incarceration lists. If lists were compiled based on annual admissions to prison per capita, several European countries would outpace the United States. But American prison stays are much longer, so the total incarceration rate is higher.
 Burglars in the United States serve an average of 16 months in prison, according to Mr. Mauer, compared with 5 months in Canada and 7 months in England.
 Many specialists dismissed race as an important distinguishing factor in the American prison rate. It is true that blacks are much more likely to be imprisoned than other groups in the United States, but that is not a particularly distinctive phenomenon. Minorities in Canada, Britain and Australia are also disproportionately represented in those nation's prisons, and the ratios are similar to or larger than those in the United States.
 Some scholars have found that English-speaking nations have higher prison rates. 
 ''Although it is not at all clear what it is about Anglo-Saxon culture that makes predominantly English-speaking countries especially punitive, they are,'' Mr. Tonry wrote last year in ''Crime, Punishment and Politics in Comparative Perspective.''
 ''It could be related to economies that are more capitalistic and political cultures that are less social democratic than those of most European countries,'' Mr. Tonry wrote. ''Or it could have something to do with the Protestant religions with strong Calvinist overtones that were long influential.''
 The American character -- self-reliant, independent, judgmental -- also plays a role.
 ''America is a comparatively tough place, which puts a strong emphasis on individual responsibility,'' Mr. Whitman of Yale wrote. ''That attitude has shown up in the American criminal justice of the last 30 years.''
 French-speaking countries, by contrast, have ''comparatively mild penal policies,'' Mr. Tonry wrote.
 Of course, sentencing policies within the United States are not monolithic, and national comparisons can be misleading.
 ''Minnesota looks more like Sweden than like Texas,'' said Mr. Mauer of the Sentencing Project. (Sweden imprisons about 80 people per 100,000 of population; Minnesota, about 300; and Texas, almost 1,000. Maine has the lowest incarceration rate in the United States, at 273; and Louisiana the highest, at 1,138.)
 Whatever the reasons, there is little dispute that America's exceptional incarceration rate has had an impact on crime. 
 ''As one might expect, a good case can be made that fewer Americans are now being victimized'' thanks to the tougher crime policies, Paul G. Cassell, an authority on sentencing and a former federal judge, wrote in The Stanford Law Review. 
 From 1981 to 1996, according to Justice Department statistics, the risk of punishment rose in the United States and fell in England. The crime rates predictably moved in the opposite directions, falling in the United States and rising in England.
 ''These figures,'' Mr. Cassell wrote, ''should give one pause before too quickly concluding that European sentences are appropriate.''
 Other commentators were more definitive. ''The simple truth is that imprisonment works,'' wrote Kent Scheidegger and Michael Rushford of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in The Stanford Law and Policy Review. ''Locking up criminals for longer periods reduces the level of crime. The benefits of doing so far offset the costs.''
 There is a counterexample, however, to the north. ''Rises and falls in Canada's crime rate have closely paralleled America's for 40 years,'' Mr. Tonry wrote last year. ''But its imprisonment rate has remained stable.''
 Several specialists here and abroad pointed to a surprising explanation for the high incarceration rate in the United States: democracy.
 Most state court judges and prosecutors in the United States are elected and are therefore sensitive to a public that is, according to opinion polls, generally in favor of tough crime policies. In the rest of the world, criminal justice professionals tend to be civil servants who are insulated from popular demands for tough sentencing.
 Mr. Whitman, who has studied Tocqueville's work on American penitentiaries, was asked what accounted for America's booming prison population.
 ''Unfortunately, a lot of the answer is democracy -- just what Tocqueville was talking about,'' he said. ''We have a highly politicized criminal justice system.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: PRISON POPULATION AROUND THE GLOBE: The United States has the highest incarceration rate and largest number of criminals behind bars.
PRISONERS IN THE U.S.: The incarceration rate varies widely from state to state.
The incarceration rate has increased significantly while the crime rate has fallen in recent years. Efforts to combat illegal drugs, high levels of violent crime and longer sentences are some reasons legal experts offer for the exceptionally large prison population in the U.S.
REASONS FOR INCARCERATION: A majority of prisoners under federal jurisdiction have been convicted of a drug offense, while more than half of the state prisoners have been incarcerated for violent crimes, like murder and rape.

HEADLINE: Meat And Dairy Groups Now Back Downer-Cattle Ban

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
In a significant reversal, major meat and dairy industry groups backed a total ban on so-called downer cattle from entering the food supply. Calls for such a ban have come from watchdog groups and some lawmakers in the wake of the large beef recall from a Southern California slaughterhouse in February, but the industry had resisted. Current law bans slaughter of most cows that are unable to stand, or downers, but allows them in if they fall after passing a veterinarian's inspection and then are reinspected. Advocacy groups called that a loophole, but the Agriculture Department and the meat industry opposed changing it. Now, under pressure from Congress and outside groups, the industry has reconsidered. The American Meat Institute, the National Meat Association and the National Milk Producers Federation said they had petitioned the Agriculture Department to enact a total ban. ''We think that the time has come,'' said Jeremy Russell, spokesman for the National Meat Association, which represents some 400 packers and processors. ''We want to send a clear message to consumers that we're putting their welfare and concerns ahead of the economics.''

HEADLINE: Colombia Chief Hails Democratic and Economic Gains

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
His nation's trade deal with Washington is stalling. His cousin is fighting arrest on possible links to paramilitary death squads. Killings of union members continue. But when asked about his country's challenges, President Alvaro Uribe points to progress in strengthening democratic institutions and in giving economic growth a boost. 
 ''Colombia is not in the time of crisis, but in the time of remedies,'' Mr. Uribe said in an interview here Monday night at Casa de Narino, the presidential palace. He cited a judiciary strong enough to investigate widespread corruption, already resulting in the arrests of dozens of members of the Colombian Congress and Mr. Uribe's former intelligence chief. ''We have almost doubled the budget of the justice administration,'' he noted. 
 On Tuesday an arrest order was issued for Mario Uribe, a second cousin and confidant of the president and a former senator, on charges that he had met with a warlord about electoral campaigns aimed at benefiting the paramilitaries, groups responsible for some of the worst atrocities during Colombia's long internal war. 
 In a move potentially embarrassing to the president, Mario Uribe sought asylum in Costa Rica's embassy here, rather than surrendering for arrest. Costa Rica denied his request late on Tuesday. 
 In the interview, President Uribe did not address his cousin's actions. But he emphasized that there had been a sharp drop in murders and kidnappings across Colombia since he took power in 2002, developments he attributed in part to his government's demobilization of thousands of paramilitary combatants. 
 Fears have emerged that the paramilitary forces, which had formed to battle leftist guerrillas, are resurfacing in parts of Colombia with a focus on drug trafficking and extortion. The resurgent groups are thought to be responsible for a large part of the cocaine trade; Colombia still accounts for about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States. 
 But Mr. Uribe said his government had recovered ''the monopoly of the state to fight any illegal group,'' referring to these new armed groups as ''criminal gangs.'' Mr. Uribe, a lawyer who studied at Harvard and Oxford, carefully enunciated his words in strongly accented English. 
 Despite the scandal that has crept into Congress, his cabinet and his own family, Mr. Uribe remains widely popular here, with approval ratings above 80 percent. Many Colombians rallied around him after a diplomatic dispute in March with Ecuador and Venezuela over Colombia's bombing raid of a Colombian rebel camp in Ecuador. 
 Killings of trade union members in Colombia, though, have concerned some officials in Washington, where the issue, combined with partisan disagreements, has held up progress on a wide-reaching trade agreement. 
 When asked about the delays, Mr. Uribe, the Bush administration's top ally in Latin America, chose his words with caution. ''I have to be very prudent,'' he said. 
 ''But we need the recognition of the progress Colombia has made,'' he said. ''We need association with the United States, not to hide our problems, but to help us in solving them,'' he continued, citing the discovery of a union killing in northern Colombia on Monday, a crime for which Mr. Uribe said he was offering a reward of more than $40,000 to capture the perpetrators. 
 Even as Mr. Uribe's supporters are mounting an effort to amend the Constitution to allow him to run for a third term, another scandal emerged this week after a former member of Congress, Yidis Medina, said she had been offered illegal patronage favors in exchange for supporting an amendment that allowed Mr. Uribe to run for his second term, in 2006. 
 Adamantly denying the accusation, Mr. Uribe said, ''My government recognizes the right of political participation, never tolerates corruption.'' 
 He meandered into a discussion of the many challenges still facing Colombia when asked if he would seek a third term, an issue that has divided the country's political elite. He smiled widely when pressed on his response. ''In the long term, it is much better to have many leaders to usher the torch,'' Mr. Uribe concluded. 
 Expressing disdain for the leftist guerrillas still at war with the government, Mr. Uribe, whose father was reportedly killed by the rebels in a botched kidnapping attempt, said he expected revelations to emerge of ties between the rebels and some lawmakers in yet another facet of the connections between Congress and illegal armed groups. 
 The situation in Congress is already strained, with dozens of members vacating their seats because of the paramilitary scandal, and discussion of legislation at a standstill. But the arrests are also a rare display of institutional resilience, with few other countries in Latin America having a judiciary powerful enough to pursue corruption on such a scale. 
 Mr. Uribe pointed to Colombia's other differences from some of its neighbors, particularly Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela, which are ruled by leftist leaders with contrasting views on relations with the United States, rules regarding foreign investment and the role of market forces in the economy. 
 ''We recognize we are some kind of exception in Latin America,'' he said, explaining Colombia's openness to private investment from both domestic and foreign sources. ''Even with a great wealth in oil, in the long term it is impossible to build social cohesion,'' he said in a subtle dig at the socialist policies of President Hugo Chavez in oil-rich Venezuela, a leader with whom Mr. Uribe has feuded in recent months. 
 In the interview, Mr. Uribe returned to the theme of democratic institutions, which in his view make Colombia stand out in the region as a partner for the United States, despite how some of these institutions have been tarnished because of relationships in their ranks to warlords in the country's internal war. 
 ''Colombia has made decisions to overcome this long nightmare of violence,'' Mr. Uribe said, without suggesting that the end of the war was near. ''In Colombia, we have not insurgents against dictators,'' he said. ''We have terrorists against democracy.''

HEADLINE: As Protests Intensify, China May Give Up Attempt to Send Arms to Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER and DAVID BARBOZA; Celia W. Dugger reported from Johannesburg, and David Barboza from Shanghai.

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
As protests intensified across southern Africa against the shipment of Chinese-made arms intended for Zimbabwe, the government in Beijing said Tuesday that the ship carrying the arms -- owned by a large Chinese state-owned company, Cosco -- may return to China because of the difficulties in delivering the goods. 
 South Africa's High Court on Friday barred transport of the ammunition, rockets and mortar bombs across South Africa from the port of Durban to landlocked Zimbabwe, after an Anglican archbishop argued that the arms were likely to be used to crush the Zimbabwean opposition after last month's disputed election. 
 South Africa's dock workers also said they would refuse to unload the shipment, a call backed up by the country's powerful coalition of trade unions. On Friday, the ship, An Yue Jiang, left Durban for the open seas, and on Tuesday South Africa's Defense Ministry said it was somewhere off Africa's west coast.
 Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing in Beijing that the shipment was part of ''normal military trade'' between Zimbabwe and China, and called on other nations not to politicize the issue. But acknowledging the resistance to the shipment, she said China was considering shipping the arms back to China.
 According to documents provided to South African authorities and leaked to journalists here, Poly Technologies, Inc., a Chinese state-owned arms company, made the arms, weighing 77 tons and worth $1.245 million.
 The impromptu coalition of trade unions, church leaders and organizations trying to stop the delivery gained an important ally on Monday when Levy Mwanawasa, the president of Zambia, who heads a bloc of 14 southern African nations, called on other countries in the region not to let the ship dock in their ports. 
 ''He actually said that it would be good for China to play a more useful role in the Zimbabwe crisis than supplying arms,'' said a spokesman for the Zambian government, who asked not to be identified. ''We don't want a situation which will escalate the situation in Zimbabwe more than what it is.''
 Mr. Mwanawasa's statements, made to reporters as he returned from a regional conference in Mauritius, were remarkable because few African heads of state have been openly critical of Zimbabwe. The bloc he heads, the Southern African Development Community, has come under especially sharp criticism for failing to censure the Zimbabwean government for refusing to publish the results of the presidential election.
 The United States has also pressed countries in the region -- including Namibia and Angola, both allies of President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe -- not to accept the arms shipment. At a press briefing on Tuesday in Washington, Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman, said American officials had taken up the issue with China as well.
 ''We don't think it's appropriate at this point, given the political upheaval that's occurring in Zimbabwe, for anyone to be adding extra tinder to that situation by providing additional weapons to Zimbabwe security forces,'' Mr. Casey said.
 More than three weeks after an election in which the opposition is said by independent monitors to have defeated the party of Mr. Mugabe, the autocrat who has led the country for 28 years, election officials have yet to release results. 
 Deep in a long editorial on its Web site on Wednesday, The Herald, Zimbabwe's state-run newspaper, floated a proposal for a transitional national unity government led by Mr. Mugabe.
 Human rights groups and the opposition have reported that the government was coordinating a violent crackdown on the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change.
 Church leaders in Zimbabwe said Tuesday that organized violence had been unleashed throughout the country, including abductions and torture of opposition supporters, and called on the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations to intervene.
 ''We warn the world that if nothing is done to help the people of Zimbabwe from their predicament, we shall soon be witnessing genocide similar to that experienced in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and other hot spots in Africa and elsewhere,'' the church leaders said in a statement, Agence France-Presse reported. The statement was signed by the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference and the Zimbabwe Council of Churches.
 Shipping arms to Zimbabwe could further complicate China's efforts to avoid harsh international criticism before it hosts the Olympics this summer. At the same time China is trying to win allies in Africa, a source of natural resources it needs to fuel its economic boom. 
 The South African government, which was helping the Chinese ship clear customs in Durban last week before the ship left the port, has been criticized by trade unions and other organizations here for being complicit in getting weapons to Zimbabwe's military when senior Army officers were being accused of helping lead and coordinate suppression of the opposition.
 But South African officials said last week that they could not interfere with the shipment because there was no trade embargo against Zimbabwe.
 A South African government spokesman said Tuesday that the ship remained somewhere off the west coast of Africa.

HEADLINE: Making Money, the How-To Way

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
Learning how to turn a flashlight into a laser is not a top priority for most people. Yet Kip Kedersha's step-by-step instructional video that teaches how to do just that has been seen online by more people (1.88 million) than live in Manhattan (about 1.6 million). 
 Mr. Kedersha's online library of 94 videos includes tips on how to chill a Coke in two minutes, simulate a gunshot wound and start up a PC quickly. 
 Many of the clips have been played hundreds of thousands of times, turning Mr. Kedersha into the top earner on Metacafe, a video-sharing Web site that pays the makers of popular videos. In little more than a year, the site has written him checks totaling $102,000. 
 That puts Mr. Kedersha, a 50-year-old video producer from St. Petersburg, Fla., near the front of the latest online stampede: the rush to capitalize on the popularity of how-to videos on the Web. 
 ''You never know when something like this is going to go away,'' Mr. Kedersha said. ''I better ride the wave.''
 Some 25 years after ''Jane Fonda's Workout'' topped the home-video charts in the United States, Americans' fascination with instructional videos has shifted to the Internet, where a virtually unlimited amount of shelf space guarantees there is something for everyone. 
 Do-it-yourself tips, self-help, cooking and beauty advice, sports and musical instruction are all available in a smorgasbord that offers the serious alongside the satirical, the humorous and the esoteric. Viewers can learn how to swaddle a baby, grow plants hydroponically or teach their cat to use the toilet. 
 ''Almost everything we sell requires education and explanation and instruction,'' said Richard Revis, the co-owner of Black Jungle Terrarium Supply in Turners Falls, Mass., who is featured in more than 30 videos on how to feed, breed and care for poison dart frogs. 
 Most clips tend to run a few minutes or less -- but not all. In a series of videos running a total of more than five hours, an Australian veteran of the Vietnam War demonstrates in minute detail how to build a replica of a working Sherman tank at two-fifths its original scale.
 Plenty of entrepreneurs and financiers are hoping that the wave Mr. Kedersha has begun to ride is a long way from cresting. In the last two years, investors have put tens of millions of dollars into start-up companies with names like WonderHowTo.com, VideoJug, Howcast, ExpertVillage and Graspr, which are all hoping to become the YouTube of how-to video clips. Of course, a good share of these videos are on YouTube itself. And traditional media companies like Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Scripps Network are putting much of their own how-to content online.
 These start-ups have attracted former television executives and veterans of Internet giants like Google, Yahoo and MySpace. Most of them readily admit that, as with many Internet fads, profits remain elusive for now. 
 Scores of independent video producers, experts and self-styled experts are, meanwhile, vying to make a name for themselves in hopes of sharing in the expected profits. Plenty of others are making how-to clips just for fun or for a few minutes of Internet fame.
 For Meghan Carter, 23, how-to videos offer the chance to turn her love of home decorating into a career. Early last year, she began driving around the country to conduct on-camera interviews with experts on subjects ranging from concrete countertops to green homes. Gradually, she grew more comfortable in front of the camera and began taking on the role of expert herself. 
 In April, she began posting her ''girl next door meets Martha Stewart'' videos on YouTube under the name AskTheDecorator, and the clicks started coming. Her 87 tutorials include how to make a bow (81,000 views) and how to fold towels so they look just so (43,000 views). 
 ''That one really surprised me,'' Ms. Carter said of the towel folding video. ''We were playing with new cameras and did it for fun. Out of nowhere, it skyrocketed in popularity.''
 Ms. Carter is following in the footsteps of her father, Tim Carter. Mr. Carter's Ask The Builder franchise, which is more than a decade old, includes a nationally syndicated newspaper column, TV appearances and a popular Web site. Ms. Carter has a long way to go to catch up, but she is upbeat about her prospects. 
 ''It's not a real income kind of money,'' Ms. Carter said of the advertising revenue that YouTube shares with her. ''But I have no doubt it is going to take off at some point. We hope that in three years we will have a critical mass of videos that will help us turn a substantial profit.''
 Sites like ExpertVillage and Howcast are approaching the production of how-to videos as something of a manufacturing process. Working with hundreds of independent video producers around the country, ExpertVillage has created 90,000 how-to videos and is adding about 12,000 every month. Its ''channel'' on YouTube has 73,000 videos, far more than any other.
 ''It's what the Internet screams for,'' said Byron Reese, founder of ExpertVillage. ''People get up in the morning and type, 'how do I treat a sprained ankle?' 'how do I get a bee sting out of a kid's arm?' '' 
 Last year, ExpertVillage was acquired by Demand Media, a Los Angeles-based company whose chief executive, Richard Rosenblatt, was the chairman of MySpace's parent company before it was sold to the News Corporation. 
 Freelance video producers, like Paul Muller of Miami, sign up for assignments on ExpertVillage's Web site. Mr. Miller's favorite topics are performing arts, martial arts and fitness. He said he often used Google to find experts on any subject. Since he earns $20 a clip, the trick to making money is figuring out how to do multiple clips quickly. ''I prepare the expert ahead of time,'' he said. ''It is crucial that they have a list of 15 to 20 short segments.'' 
 The qualifications of the so-called experts vary widely. Michael Sanchez, a 34-year-old stand-up comedian and video producer from Chicago, found out about Howcast on Craigslist. He picked up a handful of assignments to earn ''a little extra cash here or there,'' he said. 
 Mr. Sanchez says he does not drink and does not cook much, but that did not stop him from creating clips on how to cure a hangover (25,000 views on YouTube and 1,000 on Howcast) and how to make brown rice (only 465 views). He also enlisted his girlfriend for a video on how to kiss with passion (227,000 views on YouTube and 4,600 on Howcast). 
 ''I'd be curious to know why people are clicking on them,'' Mr. Sanchez said. ''I would never go to a Web site to watch how to do things. I'm more apt to read about it.''
 But Stephen Chao, the chief executive of WonderHowTo, a site that aggregates instructional videos from across the Internet, says many of the clips are as much for entertainment as they are for instruction. 
 ''To me, it is a window into something I never thought about,'' said Mr. Chao, who helped create shows like ''America's Most Wanted'' and ''Cops'' when he was a top executive at Fox. ''I find it the most thrilling combination of video that I can find.'' For Mary Leon, 35, of Salinas, Calif., ExpertVillage has become a source of both entertainment and instruction. She said she had used the site to learn new hair-cutting techniques, crocheting, how to decorate and paint her new home, how to set a table and how not to overpack for a trip to Spain. 
 ''Oh my gosh, I've watched a lot of videos,'' Ms. Leon said. ''They are not trying to sell you anything. It's just how-to. That's what I love about it.''
 It is not clear that the genre will turn into big business. But some media executives suggest that how-to videos may be just the thing in a slowing economy. 
 ''People want to do more things for themselves,'' said Wenda Harris Millard, president for media at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. ''It is kind of timely.''

HEADLINE: Europe Turns to Coal Again, Raising Alarms on Climate Change

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: CIVITAVECCHIA, Italy 

 BODY:
At a time when the world's top climate experts agree that carbon emissions must be rapidly reduced to hold down global warming, Italy's major electricity producer, Enel, is converting its massive power plant here from oil to coal, generally the dirtiest fuel on earth. 
 Over the next five years, Italy will increase its reliance on coal to 33 percent from 14 percent. Power generated by Enel from coal will rise to 50 percent. 
 And Italy is not alone in its return to coal. Driven by rising demand, record high oil and natural gas prices, concerns over energy security and an aversion to nuclear energy, European countries are expected to put into operation about 50 coal-fired plants over the next five years, plants that will be in use for the next five decades. 
 In the United States, fewer new coal plants are likely to begin operations, in part because it is becoming harder to get regulatory permits and in part because nuclear power remains an alternative. Of 151 proposals in early 2007, more than 60 had been dropped by the year's end, many blocked by state governments. Dozens of other are stuck in court challenges. 
 The fast-expanding developing economies of India and China, where coal remains a major fuel source for more than two billion people, have long been regarded as among the biggest challenges to reducing carbon emissions. But the return now to coal even in eco-conscious Europe is sowing real alarm among environmentalists who warn that it is setting the world on a disastrous trajectory that will make controlling global warming impossible. 
 They are aghast at the renaissance of coal, a fuel more commonly associated with the sooty factories of Dickens novels, and one that was on its way out just a decade ago.
 There have been protests here in Civitavecchia, at a new coal plant in Germany, and at one in the Czech Republic, as well as at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent, which is slated to become Britain's first new coal-fired plant in more than a decade. 
 Europe's power station owners emphasize that they are making the new coal plants as clean as possible. But critics say that ''clean coal'' is a pipe dream, an oxymoron in terms of the carbon emissions that count most toward climate change. They call the building spurt shortsighted.
 ''Building new coal-fired power plants is ill conceived,'' said James E. Hansen, a leading climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ''Given our knowledge about what needs to be done to stabilize climate, this plan is like barging into a war without having a plan for how it should be conducted, even though information is available. 
 ''We need a moratorium on coal now,'' he added, ''with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades.'' 
 Coal's Advantages
 Enel and many other electricity companies say they have little choice but to build coal plants to replace aging infrastructure, particularly in countries like Italy and Germany that have banned the building of nuclear power plants. Fuel costs have risen 151 percent since 1996, and Italians pay the highest electricity costs in Europe.
 In terms of cost and energy security, coal has all the advantages, its proponents argue. Coal reserves will last for 200 years, rather than 50 years for gas and oil. Coal is relatively cheap compared with oil and natural gas, although coal prices have tripled in the past few years. More important, hundreds of countries export coal -- there is not a coal cartel -- so there is more room to negotiate prices.
 ''In order to get over oil, which is getting more and more expensive, our plan is to convert all oil plants to coal using clean-coal technologies,'' said Gianfilippo Mancini, Enel's chief of generation and energy management. ''This will be the cleanest coal plant in Europe. We are hoping to prove that it will be possible to make sustainable and environmentally friendly use of coal.'' 
 ''Clean coal'' is a term coined by the industry decades ago, referring to its efforts to reduce local pollution. Using new technology, clean coal plants sharply reduced the number of sooty particles spewed into the air, as well as gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide. The technology has minimal effect on carbon emissions.
 In fact, the technology that the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that add to global warning -- carbon capture and storage -- is not now commercially available. No one knows if it is feasible on a large, cost-effective scale.
 The Struggle to Be Green
 The task -- in which carbon emissions are pumped into underground reservoirs rather than released -- is challenging for any fuel source, but particularly so for coal, which produces more carbon dioxide than oil or natural gas. 
 Under optimal current conditions, coal produces more than twice as much carbon dioxide per unit of electricity as natural gas, the second most common fuel used for electricity generation, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. In the developing world, where even new coal plants use lower grade coal and less efficient machinery, the equation is even worse. 
 Without carbon capture and storage, coal cannot be green. But solving that problem will take global coordination and billions of dollars in investment, which no one country or company seems inclined to spend, said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. 
 ''Figuring out carbon capture is really critical -- it may not work in the end -- and if it is not viable, the situation, with respect to climate change, is far more dire,'' Mr. Sachs said. 
 There are a few dozen small demonstration projects in Europe and in the United States, most in the early stages. But progress has not been promising. 
 At the end of January, the Bush administration canceled what was previously by far the United States' biggest carbon-capture demonstration project, at a coal-fired plant in Illinois, because of huge cost overruns. The costs of the project, undertaken in 2003 with a budget of $950 million, had spiraled to $1.5 billion this year, and it was far from complete. 
 The European Union had pledged to develop 12 pilot carbon-capture projects for Europe, but says that is not enough. 
 Many have likened carbon capture's road from the demonstration lab to a safe, cheap, available reality as a challenge equivalent to putting a man on the moon. Norway, which is investing heavily to test the technology, calls carbon capture its ''moon landing.''
 It may be even harder than that. It is a moon landing that must be replicated daily at thousands of coal plants in hundreds of countries -- many of them poor. There is a new coal-fired plant going up in India or China almost every week, and most of those are not constructed in a way that is amenable to carbon capture, even if it were developed. 
 Plants that could someday be adapted to carbon capture cost 10 to 20 percent more to build, and only a handful exist today. For most coal power plants the costs of converting would be ''phenomenal,'' concluded a report by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
 Then there is the problem of storing the carbon dioxide, which is at some level an inherently local issue. Geologists have to determine if there is a suitable underground site, calculate how much carbon dioxide it can hold and then equip it in a way that prevents leaks and ensures safety. A large leak of underground carbon dioxide could be as dangerous as a leak of nuclear fuel, critics say. 
 As for its plant here, Enel says it will start experimenting with carbon-capture technology in 2015, in the hopes of ''a solution'' by 2020. 
 ''That's too late,'' Mr. Sachs said.
 In the meantime, it and other new coal plants will be spewing more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere than ever before, meaning that current climate predictions -- dire as they are -- may still be ''too optimistic,'' Mr. Sachs said. ''They assume the old energy mix, even though coal will be a larger and larger part.'' 
 An Efficient Plant
 On many other fronts, the new Enel plant is a model of efficiency and recycling. The nitrous oxide is chemically altered to generate ammonia, which is then sold. The resulting coal ash and gypsum are sold to the cement industry.
 An on-site desalination plant means that the operation generates its own water for cooling. Even the heated water that comes out of the plant is not wasted: it heats a fish farm, one of Italy's largest. 
 But Enel's plan to deal with the new plant's carbon emissions consists mostly of a map of Italy with several huge white ovals superimposed -- subterranean cavities where carbon dioxide potentially could be stored.
 The sites have not been fully studied by geologists as yet to make sure they are safe storage sites and well sealed. There is no infrastructure or equipment that could move carbon into them. 
 The new Enel plant here opens its first boiler in two months. It will immediately produce fewer carbon emissions than the ancient oil boiler it replaces, but only because it will produce less electricity, officials here admit. 
 Unhappy Neighbors
 In the towns surrounding Civitavecchia, the impending arrival of a huge coal plant, with its three silvery domes, is being greeted with a hefty dose of dread. 
 ''They call it clean coal because they use some filters, but it is really nonsense,'' said Marza Marzioli of the No Coal citizens group in the nearby ancient Etruscan town of Tarquinia. ''If you compare it to old plants, yes it's better, but it's not 'clean' in any way.'' 
 The group says that Enel has won approval for a dangerous new coal plant by buying machines for a local hospital and by carrying out a public relations campaign. Enel advertisements for the project show a young girl erasing a plant's smokestack. 
 Most people who took part in a 2007 local referendum voted no, but the plant went ahead anyway, the group said. 
 The European Union, through its emissions trading scheme, has tried to make power plants consider the costs of carbon, forcing them to buy ''permits'' for emissions. But with the price of oil so high, coal is far cheaper, even with the cost of permits to pollute factored in, Enel has calculated. 
 Stephan Singer, who runs the European energy and climate office of WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund, in Brussels, said that math was shortsighted: the cost of coal and permits will almost certainly rise over the next decade.
 ''If they want coal to be part of the energy solution, they have to show us that carbon capture can be done now, that they can really reduce emissions'' to an acceptable level, Mr. Singer said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 1, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 23 about the resurgence of coal-fired power plants referred incorrectly to the number of countries that export coal. It is in the dozens -- not hundreds -- and of those, 10 account for 94 percent of coal exports. (They are Australia, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, China, Colombia, the United States, Canada, Kazakhstan and Vietnam, according to the International Energy Agency.)

HEADLINE: For Haiti's Jobless, No Cost to Play. But Losers Pay.

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
There was pain in Jean Francois's eyes, real suffering, an awful look of woe.
 It might have been that he had little to eat that day, or his lack of a job or any real hope of securing one. Perhaps it stemmed from the squalor in his neighborhood, a sprawling and rather depressing slum of tin-roofed houses.
 Looking on, one wanted to help this desperate 29-year-old man, console him, somehow help him break out of what was clearly a deep funk. 
 But there was nothing to be done. It turns out that Mr. Francois's life was not the immediate source of his desperation. It was his losing streak -- and the dozens of clothespins clipped onto his face, arms and belly.
 In marked contrast to Mr. Francois's glum look, the other men crowding around a raucous domino game under way in Port-au-Prince's Cite Soleil neighborhood on a recent afternoon were smiling with glee. They doubled over in laughter every time they looked at Mr. Francois. A chorus of roars rang out each time he lost another game and more of the clips were attached to his ears, cheeks, chin, forearms and midriff.
 The ears, everyone agreed, are particularly painful when clipped. Eventually, after losing and then losing some more, Mr. Francois could take no more. ''It hurts so bad,'' he said, rising from the rickety table and pulling off the clips one by one. Another player quickly moved in, nudging Mr. Francois aside and taking a turn. Everybody needs an escape, and in Haiti, where times are always tough and where food riots broke out across the country recently, dominoes offers just that.
 ''It kills time,'' said Tousaint Chavane, 61, a father of seven children who was playing, and winning, on a recent afternoon. ''It helps you forget.'' Those who have some money to spend might go to cockfights or play the lottery, which uses the same winning numbers as the New York State Lottery just to avoid any claims of fixing.
 But the beauty of dominoes is that it requires not even a single gourde, Haiti's currency, to compete. That is not to say, however, that there is no price to pay.
 Dominoes are played in two-person teams or with each player competing individually. Clothespins are merely one of many techniques Haitians employ to punish those who lose four games in a row.
 Some approaches focus less on pain and more on ridicule, like forcing a losing player to wear an empty sugar sack over his head or a brightly colored oversized hat. Other losers might have powder wiped on their faces, turning their brown skin white, or be forced to wear a heavy coat so they suffer in the heat.
 The particular method of suffering depends on the rules at a particular table that day, which vary widely across the country.
 Losers are sometimes made to salute any person who approaches the table.
 Or to drink a glass of water every time they lose a game, with no bathroom breaks.
 Or to fetch any domino that another player tosses away from the table, even if it happens to land in a sewage ditch.
 On any given day, the players say, anyone can end up a loser.
 ''You can't really say who's the best,'' said Harry Degrave, 38, a father of six and regular at the domino tables of Cite Soleil. ''One day it might be him. One day it's that guy. Then it might be me. What we don't like is someone who brags too much. We all want him to lose, and to suffer.''
 At another game, in the Juvenat neighborhood, the players were throwing back homemade liquor, and the effects were clearly evident.
 As a rather competitive match went on under a shade tree, Excellent Fontus, 67, was clowning around and talking about how good things were in the old days, before most of the young players had been born.
 ''You're all playing dominoes, and when you get home you'll still be hungry!'' he taunted them.
 Pulling a coin out of his pocket, he said: ''Back in the day, you could buy so much with this. Now you need a bag of money, and even that doesn't go so far.''
 Everybody nodded, although the clank of the dominoes being slammed hard on the table did not let up as the old man spoke.
 The clothespins in this particular match were affixed only to the losers' forearms, a variation on the game. Francois Mondesir, 40, an occasional construction worker who plays dominoes during those many days that he cannot find work to do, had not won in a while. 
 ''It makes the game fun,'' he said, after he had been ousted from the table and was rubbing his sore arms. ''The longer you have those things on, the more they hurt. It makes you forget all that's bothering you.''
 Over by the National Cemetery, the unemployed gravediggers and groundskeepers used a different technique to punish losing players. Metal weights -- actually pieces of iron from the cemetery gate -- were tied to a rope and then thrown over the loser's shoulder. As time went on, the strain of the load was obvious.
 ''We don't have any jobs,'' complained Yves Beauvil, 58, a father of three who was losing that day. ''If we weren't playing dominoes, what would we do?''
 As for the load on his left shoulder, Mr. Beauvil shrugged it off as a mere inconvenience. ''I can handle it,'' he said, prompting his fellow players to break out in smiles.

HEADLINE: Markets Dip Despite Some Good Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Oil prices reached fresh highs and a rush of quarterly results from bellwethers like AT&T, DuPont and McDonald's failed to impress investors Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 100 points. 
 AT&T's earnings met Wall Street's forecast, and McDonald's and DuPont reported numbers that were stronger than expected. But DuPont said a United States slowdown would offset growth abroad, and McDonald's said an important metric of its sales showed a decline for March. All three companies are among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow.
 With hundreds of companies still to report results, investors are anxious over what the figures might say about the prospects for the economy.
 Investors appeared little moved by news of continued weakness in the housing sector. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell 2 percent in March and the median sales price dropped for a seventh consecutive month.
 But oil's seemingly relentless march higher -- light crude for May delivery settled at $119.37, up $1.89 -- raised the possibility of higher inflation that would lead consumers to cut back their discretionary spending. It would also make the Federal Reserve less likely to keep lowering interest rates.
 The Dow fell 104.79, or 0.82 percent, to 12,720.23.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.23, or 0.88 percent, to 1,375.94, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 31.10, or 1.29 percent, to 2,376.94.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.29, or 1.99 percent, to 703.71.
 Some of the latest earnings reports appeared to confirm concerns about the economy, analysts said.
 ''It takes a while for the economy's situation to work its way down to the companies,'' said Alexander Paris, economist and market analyst for Chicago-based Barrington Research. ''What's going on is earnings are reflecting the reality of a slowing economy, and that should go on until the second half of the year.''
 In other corporate news, the CIT Group, a financial services company, fell $1.99, or 15.6 percent, to $10.75 after it said it would raise $1.5 billion from an offering of common and preferred stock. The company has been hit by strains in the mortgage and credit markets.
 AT&T rose 22 cents, to $37.81, after reporting that its first-quarter earnings rose 22 percent, partly on growth in the company's wireless division. 
 The rising price of oil again sent energy stocks higher. Exxon Mobil rose 13 cents, to $94.39, while Chevron rose $1.33, to $94.03. But the UAL Corporation, parent company of United Airlines, dropped $7.88, to $13.55, as efforts to raise fares failed to keep pace with escalating fuel costs.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to 98 14/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.69 percent, from 3.73 percent.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auctions of four-week bills and five-year inflation-protected notes:

HEADLINE: High School Project on Genocide Was a Portent of Real-Life Events

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
Samuel G. Freedman is a professor of journalism at Columbia University. His e-mail is sgfreedman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In 1993, when Travis Hofmann was a freshman of 15, he had traveled little beyond the sand hills that surrounded his hometown, Alliance, Neb. He was the son of a railroad engineer, a trumpeter in the high school band, with a part-time job changing the marquee and running the projector at the local movie theater. 
 In Travis's class in global geography at Alliance High School, however, the teacher introduced the outside world with the word and concept of genocide. The teacher, Tim Walz, was determined that even in this isolated place, perhaps especially in this isolated place, this county seat of 9,000 that was hours away from any city in any direction, the students should learn how and why a society can descend into mass murder. 
 Mr. Walz had already taught for a year in China, and he brought the world into his classroom in the form of African thumb pianos and Tibetan singing bowls. For the global geography class, he devised something far more ambitious than what the curriculum easily could have been -- the identification and memorization of capitals, mountain ranges and major rivers. It was more ambitious, too, than a unit solely on the Holocaust of the sort many states have required.
 ''The Holocaust is taught too often purely as a historical event, an anomaly, a moment in time,'' Mr. Walz said in a recent interview, recalling his approach. ''Students understood what had happened and that it was terrible and that the people who did this were monsters.
 ''The problem is,'' he continued, ''that relieves us of responsibility. Obviously, the mastermind was sociopathic, but on the scale for it to happen, there had to be a lot of people in the country who chose to go down that path. You have to make the intellectual leap to figure out the reasons why.''
 So Mr. Walz took his students -- Brandon Bell, the wrestler; Beth Taylor, the cheerleader; Lanae Merwin, the quiet girl always reading some book about Queen Elizabeth; and all the other children of mechanics, secretaries and a town dentist -- and assigned them to study the conditions associated with mass murder. What factors, he asked them to determine, had been present when Germans slaughtered Jews, Turks murdered Armenians, the Khmer Rouge ravaged their Cambodian countrymen?
 ''It was different and unusual, certainly not a project you'd be expecting,'' Mr. Hofmann, now 31, of Phoenix, remembered recently of the class. ''The biggest part was just the freedom to explore things. No matter how abnormal or far-fetched an idea might sound, you can form an opinion. Instead of just going in and having a teacher say, 'Here's information, learn it, know it, you'll be tested on it,' it was, 'Here's an idea, run with it.' ''
 For nine weeks through the winter and early spring that school year, through the howling blizzards and the planting of the first alfalfa on the plains, the class pored over data about economics, natural resources and ethnic composition. They read about civil war, colonialism and totalitarian ideology. They worked with reference books and scholarly reports, long before conducting research took place instantly online. 
 Most, like Mr. Hofmann, had spent their entire lives in and near Alliance. A few had traveled to Washington, D.C., with the school marching band. A few had driven four hours to Denver to buy the new Nirvana CD. Mostly, though, the outside world was a place they built, under Mr. Walz's tutelage, in their own brains. 
 When the students finished with the past, Mr. Walz gave a final exam of sorts. He listed about a dozen current nations -- Yugoslavia, Congo, some former Soviet republics among them -- and asked the class as a whole to decide which was at the greatest risk of sliding into genocide.
 Their answer was: Rwanda. The evidence was the ethnic divide between Hutus and Tutsis, the favoritism toward Tutsis shown by the Belgian colonial regime, and the previous outbreaks of tribal violence. Mr. Walz awarded high marks.
 Then summer arrived and school let out. The students did what teenagers did in Alliance over the summer. They water-skied at the reservoir, swam in the Bridgeport sand pits and mostly ''cruised the Butte,'' endlessly driving up and down Box Butte Avenue.
 THE next April, in 1994, Mr. Walz heard news reports of a plane carrying the Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, being shot down. He told himself at the time, ''This is not going to end up good.''
 It did not. Over the next three months, militant Hutus killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The reports reached even The Alliance Times-Herald, the local daily newspaper. Mr. Walz's students, now juniors, saw their prophecy made into flesh and blood.
 ''It was terribly chilling,'' Lanae Merwin, now 31, of Hastings, Neb., recalled in a recent interview. ''But, to us, it wasn't totally surprising. We'd discussed it in class and it was happening. Though you don't want a prediction like that to come true.''
 Mr. Hofmann remembered having a similar reaction. ''It was just strange to know that something was discussed not too long before that could actually happen,'' he said. ''Just a surreal feeling. To everyone else, it's 8,000 miles away -- no one cares. How can you grasp it? But to us, it was, we talked about it. For us, it was something that reached us directly.''
 Years have passed. Mr. Walz left Alliance and moved to his wife's home state, Minnesota; he is the only active teacher now serving in the United States Congress. His former geography students have moved as adults to Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and New York. Ms. Taylor lived in Poland for a while.
 Now, in 2008, April has come again. It is, among other things, the month for genocide remembrance -- the month when Rwanda was convulsed, when the Khmer Rouge conquered Cambodia, when Armenians commemorate what they call the Great Catastrophe, when Yom HaShoah, Holocaust memorial day, almost always falls. (Though this year, because of the Jewish lunar calendar, it will be observed on May 1.) The lessons of a classroom in Alliance 15 years ago still matter.
 ''You have to understand what caused genocide to happen,'' Mr. Walz said, with those grim anniversaries in mind. ''Or it will happen again.''

HEADLINE: Surging Energy Costs Take a Big Toll on Airline Earnings

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The parent company of United Airlines, the UAL Corporation, reported a $537 million loss in the first quarter on Tuesday, bigger than expected, as a 51 percent increase in fuel costs overwhelmed furious efforts to raise fares at the country's second-largest carrier.
 UAL shares closed down $7.88, to $13.55. 
 Unless oil prices unexpectedly retreat, there is no relief in sight for airlines, and nearly the entire industry is expected to lose money this year.
 United, based in Chicago, plans to reduce employment by 1,100 by the end of the year, as airlines begin a new round of layoffs. United increased the number of planes it plans to shed to 30, from an earlier estimate of 15 to 20, in hopes of constraining capacity and driving fares up further.
 JetBlue Airways and AirTran Holdings, two formerly fast-growing discount carriers, also posted first-quarter losses. JetBlue, which operates from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, reduced its growth plans for the year, hoping to keep raising fares.
 And AirTran, operating from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, said it would delay growth plans in the 16 months beginning in September. That move could help it raise fares and conserve cash.
 AirTran, where shares have fallen in the wake of bankruptcy filings by some smaller carriers, said it would sell notes and stock to raise about $110 million and bolster its cushion against the downturn. 
 But the share sale, after the stock has already fallen, will dilute existing shareholders. AirTran shares fell 95 cents, to $3.61.
 With a recent rash of bankruptcies at smaller airlines and expected losses at every big carrier but Southwest Airlines, the industry has swiftly entered a steep decline because of oil priced above $100 a barrel and the inability to pass on those higher costs to price-sensitive travelers.
 The entire industry is now focused on constraining capacity and raising fares. AirTran managed a 5.2 percent increase in its average fare, to $99.06 during the quarter, as it expanded its capacity by 10.8 percent.
 JetBlue did better, its average fare rising 22.4 percent to $135.64 compared with a year earlier, even as its capacity expanded by almost 14 percent. But now it is hunkering down, planning to increase overall capacity by 3 to 5 percent in 2008.
 The slowing economy will make fare increases more difficult. Demand for travel typically falls after a recession has started. To date, airlines have not seen a significant decline in demand.
 At United, first-quarter fares rose more than 11 percent over the year-ago period, as the carrier reduced domestic capacity by about 6 percent. That sent revenue up 7.7 percent to $4.71 billion for the quarter.
 But a $534 million increase in fuel costs, to $1.58 billion for the quarter, led to a loss. The company has $2.9 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments, a slimmer cushion than the $3.6 billion it held Dec. 31, 2007.
 Of the planned employee cuts, 500 would be managers and 600 union-represented workers, Glenn Tilton, United's chief executive, said in a recorded message to his workers. ''In this extraordinary environment, we recognize the pace of change needs to accelerate,'' he said.
 United hopes to merge with another airline -- Continental Airlines and US Airways are leading candidates -- in order to compete against the proposed combination of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. Tuesday, in his message to workers, Mr. Tilton called industry consolidation ''one of the changes required to address the gap between where we stand today and profitability and sustainability.''

 To Stand Behind Iraq
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq made an urgent appeal for greater international support to Iraq, and he voiced frustration with fellow Arab nations for failing to send ambassadors and relieve Iraq's debts. ''It is hard for us to understand why our Arab brothers do not exchange diplomats with Iraq,'' Mr. Maliki said at a gathering of Iraq's neighbors. PAGE A7

 The Chinese government said it may return a shipment of arms headed to Zimbabwe by ship following protests across southern Africa. Dock workers in South Africa said they would refuse to unload the shipment.

 Faced with a widening scandal over ties between his political supporters and paramilitary death squads that has resulted in an arrest order for his second cousin, President Alvaro Uribe stridently defended his government's progress in attacking corruption.

 TAX POLICY HAUNTS BRITISH LEADER
 Gordon Brown's announcement last year that he was lowering an income tax rate has led to a political crisis that threatens to unravel the Labor Party. The reforms were supposed to ease the burden on working people but have raised their taxes instead. Some analysts are questioning Mr. Brown's political future. PAGE A5 
 DOMINOES AND PUNISHMENT
 Some losers must wear clothespins clipped to their skin. Others are made to wear an empty sugar sack over their head, or a brightly colored oversize hat. Still others might have powder wiped on their faces, or be forced to wear a heavy coat in the heat. The beauty of dominoes is that it requires not even a single gourde, Haiti's currency, to compete. That is not to say, however, that there is no price to pay. PAGE A6

 SECT MEMBERS GIVE DNA SAMPLES 
 In Effort to Determine Family Ties
 Present and former members of a religious polygamous sect whose compound was raided by Texas authorities showed up for DNA testing outside a government building in Eldorado, Tex. Lab workers continued to harvest samples of the DNA of the 437 children who were seized in the raid, following accusations that the group's middle-aged men were marrying under-age girls, in an effort to determine their parents and establish custody.

 WHITE HOUSE AIMS TO BUY LOANS
 With the peak season for student loan applications a few months away, the Bush administration is sending a letter to lawmakers in Congress asking for authorization to buy billions of dollars of federal student loans. The administration wants to make sure that increasingly stringent lenders don't block borrowing for higher education. According to the Education Department, 43 lenders have left the federal loan program. PAGE A11
 REVIVING DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS
 Las Vegas is set to break ground on an installation of sewer, water and power lines on a 61-acre plot of land that was a former brownfield that the Union Pacific Railroad used as a chemical dumping ground. The city hopes it will be the first part of a project meant to slow the decline of the downtown --the site of government offices and oldest casinos. PAGE A11 
 PROPOSED CHANGES TO 'NO CHILD'
 The Education Department proposed a series of fixes to the No Child Left Behind Law, including requiring that all states use a single formula to calculate and report high school graduation rates by the 2012-2013 school year.

Kennedy, who is chairman of the Congressional education committees, has offered only tepid support for the changes. PAGE A15
 SCANDALS IN GEORGIA
 Georgia's powerful transportation department has been rocked by two sex scandals in the last week. The transportation board chairman, who recently won a heated re-election contest to keep his seat on the board, stepped down after violating a rule that forbids relationships between intimates and superiors. But the man who was picked to replace him had to step down after news spread of a sexual harassment complaint filed against him by two department employees. PAGE A13

 A tight race for a vacated Congressional seat in Mississipppi between a conservative Democrat and the Republican mayor of Southaven appears to be headed for a run-off after neither candidate gained the 50 percent needed to win.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Set to Block Bill Easing Limits on Pay Discrimination Suits

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans said on Tuesday that they were confident they would be able to block legislation intended to reverse a Supreme Court ruling last year that established tight time restrictions on lawsuits over pay discrimination.
 Even if the bill stalls, the fight over the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- named for the Alabama woman who lost her case at the Supreme Court -- is likely to resurface in both the presidential and Congressional campaigns. Democrats and others argue that the legislation is needed to ensure pay equity, an important issue with women.
 But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other Republicans said the bill, which is opposed by the business community and the Bush administration, could create a flood of lawsuits. 
 ''We think that this bill is primarily designed to create a massive amount of new litigation in our country,'' said Mr. McConnell, the minority leader. 
 Leadership aides and other Republicans said they expected to be able to deny backers of the bill the 60 votes needed to bring it to the floor in a showdown scheduled for Wednesday.
 Democrats and some Republicans say that the bill, approved by the House last year after the court ruling in May, was necessary to give those who believe they were discriminated against a fair opportunity to challenge their employers in court. 
 Backers of the bill say the court overlooked extensive precedent when it dismissed the claim of Ms. Ledbetter, a worker at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Plant in Gadsden, Ala., because she had not acted within six months of the first instance of pay discrimination, even though she was unaware of it at the time. 
 Supporters of the legislation said the court decision did not reflect the reality that many people do not know how their pay compares to that of their co-workers.
 ''It is a critical issue for women, and it has been a longstanding, persistent problem and is all the more important right now,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and a co-sponsor of the bill, referring to the current economic downturn. Ms. Snowe said efforts to derail the measure by her fellow Republicans were unfortunate.
 Other supporters said the bill would simply restore the legal playing field to where it was before the ruling, with a two-year limit on claims for back pay. It declares that discrimination can occur each time a person is paid and that a challenge does not have to be filed within six months of the first instance of bias. 
 ''I can't think of anything more in keeping with American ideals of fairness than equal pay for equal work,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a lead sponsor of the bill.
 Both candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, are expected to vote Wednesday to open debate on the measure. In fact, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Tuesday that the Senate would not convene until 5 p.m. Wednesday to make certain the two candidates could be on hand for the crucial procedural vote, which typically is scheduled one hour after the Senate opens. 
 Republican aides said they did not expect Senator John McCain of Arizona, the party's presumptive presidential nominee, to vote.
 Democrats were also prepared to make pay equity an issue against Republicans in Senate races. The liberal advocacy group People for the American Way is already using Ms. Ledbetter's case in an advertisement criticizing Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, for his support of the Bush administration's judicial nominees.
 Ms. Ledbetter, who said she long received far less pay than her male colleagues for doing the same job, would not get any benefit under the bill.

HEADLINE: Insurer Says Economy Has Dented Its Prospects

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It is never a good thing if many of your customers can no longer afford what you are selling. 
 The UnitedHealth Group, which announced disappointing first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, said the weakening economy was causing fewer businesses and employees to sign up for its health insurance. UnitedHealth, whose stock fell sharply on the report, also cut its overall profit outlook for 2008. 
 ''We are clearly being impacted by the declining economic outlook,'' Stephen J. Hemsley, the company's chief executive, told investors Tuesday. 
 While he acknowledged the company's own missteps, Mr. Hemsley said that fewer employers -- particularly small businesses -- were offering health coverage to their workers, and that when they did, fewer employees were choosing to enroll. 
 As one of the nation's largest insurers and the first to report earnings this period, UnitedHealth's results have raised anxiety about the industry's challenges. While some analysts say UnitedHealth has simply hit a trough in the industry's normal business cycle, others are worried about more fundamental challenges to the insurance business model. 
 In recent years, despite soaring medical costs, insurers have made big profits by keeping premiums well ahead of health care inflation. But analysts say that business strategy may be reaching its limits, with companies finding it harder to raise prices without losing substantial numbers of customers. 
 ''The market is not growing -- it's shrinking,'' said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst for CRT Capital Holdings in Stamford, Conn. 
 The market for employer-purchased coverage remains a large one, accounting for 158 million people. But Ms. Skolnick says that UnitedHealth, like many insurers, has priced its product beyond the reach of too many people and is now fighting with its competitors over a shrinking pool of customers. 
 Investors in insurance stocks have been particularly anxious since WellPoint, another big player, warned last month that it expected disappointing first-quarter earnings. 
 UnitedHealth's profit report on Tuesday, which felt short of expectations, started a sell-off of its shares, which carried over to smaller declines in the stock of competitors like Aetna and WellPoint. Shares of UnitedHealth fell $3.66, or nearly 10 percent, to $34.15, which was near the 52-week low of last month. 
 UnitedHealth earned $994 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $20 billion for the first quarter. Although that was a 5 percent increase in earnings per share over last year, the company cut its 2008 profit outlook by 40 cents, to $3.55 to $3.60 a share. 
 It cited, in part, the decline of its core commercial insurance business, estimating it may lose about 700,000 customers this year. That would reduced its core commercial business to about 10 million insured people.
 The main issue facing UnitedHealth is how much it can protect its profits as it loses customers for its traditional health insurance. ''The issue for them is growth, and where is the growth going to come from?'' asked Les Funtleyder, the health care strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, who rates the stock as neutral.
 Analysts disagree on whether UnitedHealth has already weathered the worst of the business cycle, or is at the onset of what could be two to three years of a difficult environment. Matthew Borsch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, thinks the competition for customers is likely to make it hard for insurers like UnitedHealth to raise prices. 
 The economy makes it even harder, said Charles Boorady, an analyst with Citigroup Investment Research.
 But while Mr. Boorady said he expected more earnings disappointments from other insurers -- WellPoint is scheduled to report results on Wednesday and Aetna on Thursday -- he predicts the cycle will be on the upswing as soon as next year, as profits stabilize. And while he says UnitedHealth's shares could continue to be a poor performer for a time, he judges them to be cheap at the current price. 
 UnitedHealth has also struggled since the departure of the company's chief executive, William W. McGuire, who agreed to leave in October 2006 after being caught up in an options trading scandal. 
 The company has received sharp criticism from many of its customers as well as the hospitals and doctors with whom it contracts for care. Regulators are also looking into some of the company's business practices, including an inquiry by the New York state attorney general into the UnitedHealth unit that helps insurers determine how much of a doctor's bill to pay. 
 ''It's the litany,'' said Ms. Skolnick, who argued that the company has expanded into too many businesses to be well managed. ''There's too much going on.''
 On Tuesday's conference call some of the company's major shareholders raised doubts about some of management's decisions, arguing that UnitedHealth should pay shareholders a sizable dividend on shares instead of buying it back, or should consider selling some of its businesses that might be worth more as separate companies. 
 ''We have not executed well and have not executed well over the last two years,'' said Mr. Hemsley, who emphasized that the company would consider a variety of moves. 
 Mr. Boorady said UnitedHealth had not been as receptive as it should be to outside ideas, saying executives were ''tone deaf to their customers and their shareholders.'' 
 And even if companies like UnitedHealth are not convinced that they need to do anything fundamentally different, Mr. Funtleyder said, there is a chance that the politicians will. For the insurers, that might not be a bad thing, he said. 
 A new administration in Washington could decide to address the increasing number of uninsured Americans by asking the private insurers to play a role. The companies would benefit from a new pool of potential customers. ''The hail Mary may be that we turn to some sort of universal care,'' he said. 
 Still, he recommends holding off on buying shares since he, too, thinks that there could be a tougher environment ahead. ''There's no sense in buying now if there's more risk to come,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Low Road to Victory

 BODY:
The Pennsylvania campaign, which produced yet another inconclusive result on Tuesday, was even meaner, more vacuous, more desperate, and more filled with pandering than the mean, vacuous, desperate, pander-filled contests that preceded it.
 Voters are getting tired of it; it is demeaning the political process; and it does not work. It is past time for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to acknowledge that the negativity, for which she is mostly responsible, does nothing but harm to her, her opponent, her party and the 2008 election. 
 If nothing else, self interest should push her in that direction. Mrs. Clinton did not get the big win in Pennsylvania that she needed to challenge the calculus of the Democratic race. It is true that Senator Barack Obama outspent her 2-to-1. But Mrs. Clinton and her advisers should mainly blame themselves, because, as the political operatives say, they went heavily negative and ended up squandering a good part of what was once a 20-point lead. 
 On the eve of this crucial primary, Mrs. Clinton became the first Democratic candidate to wave the bloody shirt of 9/11. A Clinton television ad -- torn right from Karl Rove's playbook -- evoked the 1929 stock market crash, Pearl Harbor, the Cuban missile crisis, the cold war and the 9/11 attacks, complete with video of Osama bin Laden. ''If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen,'' the narrator intoned.
 If that was supposed to bolster Mrs. Clinton's argument that she is the better prepared to be president in a dangerous world, she sent the opposite message on Tuesday morning by declaring in an interview on ABC News that if Iran attacked Israel while she were president: ''We would be able to totally obliterate them.'' 
 By staying on the attack and not engaging Mr. Obama on the substance of issues like terrorism, the economy and how to organize an orderly exit from Iraq, Mrs. Clinton does more than just turn off voters who don't like negative campaigning. She undercuts the rationale for her candidacy that led this page and others to support her: that she is more qualified, right now, to be president than Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama is not blameless when it comes to the negative and vapid nature of this campaign. He is increasingly rising to Mrs. Clinton's bait, undercutting his own claims that he is offering a higher more inclusive form of politics. When she criticized his comments about ''bitter'' voters, Mr. Obama mocked her as an Annie Oakley wannabe. All that does is remind Americans who are on the fence about his relative youth and inexperience. 
 No matter what the high-priced political operatives (from both camps) may think, it is not a disadvantage that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton share many of the same essential values and sensible policy prescriptions. It is their strength, and they are doing their best to make voters forget it. And if they think that only Democrats are paying attention to this spectacle, they're wrong. 
 After seven years of George W. Bush's failed with-us-or-against-us presidency, all American voters deserve to hear a nuanced debate -- right now and through the general campaign -- about how each candidate will combat terrorism, protect civil liberties, address the housing crisis and end the war in Iraq.
 It is getting to be time for the superdelegates to do what the Democrats had in mind when they created superdelegates: settle a bloody race that cannot be won at the ballot box. Mrs. Clinton once had a big lead among the party elders, but has been steadily losing it, in large part because of her negative campaign. If she is ever to have a hope of persuading these most loyal of Democrats to come back to her side, let alone win over the larger body of voters, she has to call off the dogs.

As a child growing up in Philadelphia in the 1950s, Laurence C. Siegel regularly took in the Christmas show at John Wanamaker, the downtown department store where his father was a manager, and watched with rapt attention as a spectacle unfolded in the ornate 12-story atrium.
 ''The show was very high-tech for its time,'' Mr. Siegel recalled. ''I was unbelievably impressed by the lights, the water, the angels and the stars.''
 Decades later, Mr. Siegel made a name for himself as a developer who uses various year-round entertainment attractions as a means of getting shoppers to spend more time, and therefore more money, at his malls. But his public company, the Mills Corporation, foundered after it branched out and took on more projects than it could handle -- notably the 2.4-million-square-foot shopping and entertainment center known as Meadowlands Xanadu, which is nearing completion in the swamps of northern New Jersey. 
 Mr. Siegel, 55, stepped down as chief executive of Mills in October 2006, a few months before the company was sold to Simon Property Group, but he remains the leading creative force behind Meadowlands Xanadu, the nation's costliest mall and his biggest extravaganza yet. Now owned by private investors led by Colony Capital, a real estate investment firm based in Los Angeles, the long-delayed $2.3 billion project is scheduled to open in November. It is in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, at the intersection of Route 3 and Interstate 95, where the Giants and Jets are building a new football stadium. 
 During a recent tour of the construction site, the energetic Mr. Siegel expressed confidence that a new generation of children, and their parents, will be dazzled by the array of attractions that he and his team have assembled. These include the nation's first indoor ski slope; a wind tunnel where sky diving will be taught; a machine that creates a wave for indoor surfing; and a 287-foot-high wind-powered Ferris wheel, which will offer sweeping views of Manhattan during a 25-minute ride. 
 Gazing down at the huge area that will house an Egyptian-themed movie multiplex, the first theater in the New York area for Muvico, an upscale chain, he said: ''Look at the majestic nature of this space. You're going to come here just for the 'omigod' factor.'' 
 Just months before the mall's opening, however, the animosity that has dogged the project from the outset remains apparent. Though the project is not being directly subsidized, it is being built on state-owned land, and a company spokesman said that about $81.3 million is being spent on roadway and other improvements at or near the site. Questions continue to be raised about whether a minor league baseball park will ever materialize, as promised. (The developers say they are committed to bringing in a team.)
 And as the industrial-looking buildings with their multicolored anodized aluminum exteriors began to take shape several weeks ago, some public officials and other critics described the project in terms ranging from ''hideous'' to ''honky tonk'' to ''yucky-looking,'' as Richard J. Codey, president of the State Senate, put it.
 The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority recently summoned representatives of the design team, which includes Adamson Associates, Kiku Obata & Company and the Rockwell Group, to defend their work at a contentious public presentation.
 Mr. Siegel said criticism of the project's appearance was premature -- like ''judging the Sistine Chapel after Michelangelo put on the first coat of paint.'' The bright colors will be hidden in part by the Ferris wheel, sponsored by Pepsi-Cola, as well as signs and landscaping, he said, but the project will still be eye-catching and festive, to make it clear that Xanadu is ''not your grandmother's regional mall.'' 
 Several real estate brokers and consultants, most of them reluctant to criticize the project openly, said its prospects were uncertain. Consumer spending is down, and some retail chains are filing for bankruptcy protection or curtailing expansion plans. Mall operators, too, are deferring some of their plans. 
 Mr. Siegel said 60 percent of the space at Xanadu has been leased, with negotiations under way for an additional 20 percent or so. Because of the dense population and relatively strong economy in the New York area, even retailers that are cutting back have not shelved their plans to open at Xanadu, he said.
 He declined to say just how many of the 250 retail spaces were still available. But another executive associated with the project said that the pace of leasing has slowed because of the economic downturn. 
 Brokers say that tenants have gained the upper hand; mall operators have been forced to lower rents or let retailers pay an agreed-upon percentage of sales instead of rent. Referring to Xanadu, Howard L. Davidowitz, a New York retailing consultant, said, ''It's not realistic to believe that they are getting anywhere near what they expected a year and a half ago when they were planning this out.''
 But Mr. Siegel said he has not had to offer rent reductions or percentage deals, even to anchor tenants. He conceded, however, that the company was contributing more than expected to the cost of finishing off the stores and restaurants. ''It might be costing us a little more than it would have otherwise,'' he said. ''That's where tenants push.''
 Carl J. Goldberg, chairman of the New Jersey sports authority, predicted the project would be a success because it would offer experiences that neither a traditional mall nor the Internet could match. 
 A visitor who has just learned to surf, for example, can go home with a surfboard, Mr. Goldberg said. Someone who tries out the ski slope can go directly to a bookstore to buy a book about the sport. ''It is not a mall, it will not operate like a mall, and people won't go to it like a mall,'' he said. ''That's the difference.''
 Cooking demonstrations and lessons will take place in a defined area of Xanadu devoted to retail associated with the home. Other sections will be dedicated to entertainment, fashion, young people and sports. In the sports area, visitors will be able to watch games on a huge screen while observing a range of activities, including archery and rock-climbing inside the 202,000-square-foot Cabela's sporting goods store.
 Among the attractions in the children's section will be an elaborate role-playing concept called Wannado City that Mr. Siegel discovered in Mexico City, and brought first to Sawgrass Mills, in Sunrise, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale. 
 Unlike the Mills malls, where outlet stores are a prominent part of the mix, Xanadu will have only full-price stores in its fashion section. ''Regular-price retail can afford to pay more rent,'' Mr. Siegel said. Stores will be closed on Sunday in observance of Bergen County's blue laws, though entertainment sites can remain open, he said.
 Despite the carping, one broker, Chuck Lanyard, the president of the Goldstein Group, a brokerage company in Glen Rock, N.J., that specializes in retailing, said the Xanadu project seemed to have turned a corner and may do better than expected.
 ''Is this a challenging time to open a mall?'' Mr. Lanyard said. ''No question, and especially when it's one as ambitious as this, with all those entertainment features.
 ''But when you open a mall like this, you're not looking at the next year or two. You're in it for the long haul.''

HEADLINE: Government Seeks to Buy Loans Made To Students

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The Bush administration is proposing that Congress authorize it to buy billions of dollars in federal student loans to make sure the nation's credit crunch does not block borrowing for higher education.
 The proposal, outlined in a letter to be sent Wednesday to members of Congress from the Education and Treasury Departments and the Office of Management and Budget, endorses a provision in a bill passed by the House this month. It is the latest sign of deepening concern that the combination of tougher standards for borrowers, lender withdrawals from federal student loan programs and falling housing prices poses a threat to families struggling to cope with rising tuition. By buying loans, the government would provide capital to lenders to make new loans.
 ''I want to make double-dog sure that we have the tools necessary'' to make sure federal loans continue to be available, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said in an interview on Tuesday. ''If we don't need to use them, so be it.'' 
 Ms. Spellings said she was not sure under what circumstances the Education Department would actually begin to buy the loans. ''This is dynamic,'' she said. ''We don't know.'' 
 It is difficult to determine whether the credit crunch will prevent students from obtaining the financing they need because the peak season for loan applications is still a few months away. According to the department, 43 lenders have left the federal loan program. But others, like Bank of America, have renewed their commitment to the program.
 Financial aid administrators at traditional four-year colleges have said they have seen few problems for students seeking federal loans. Officials at commercial colleges, however, have been raising alarms about their students' ability to borrow. In the interview, Ms. Spellings said some companies had begun to limit lending to students at certain universities or types of institutions, like commercial colleges. 
 ''The student-lending market turmoil is having a harmful impact now -- not at some point down the road,'' wrote Harris N. Miller, president of the Career College Association, a trade group that represents for-profit colleges and universities, in a letter to lawmakers last week. ''Our students are on the leading edge of the crisis, the canaries in the coal mine.''
 The administration's evident willingness to provide capital to lenders to keep federal loans available is also an example of another way the federal government is expanding its role as guarantor-in-chief to keep the economy on an even keel. The Federal Reserve has already stepped in to help keep the investment bank Bear Stearns from outright collapse, and lawmakers are weighing steps intended to help homeowners facing potential foreclosure.
 The House bill authorizes the Education Department to buy federally guaranteed loans through July 2009. The Senate has not yet taken up its version of the bill, introduced by Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the education committee. 
 The Education Department is also working out the details of a ''lender of last resort'' program under which students could borrow from guarantee agencies -- the nonprofit companies and state agencies that guarantee federal loans on behalf of the federal government. But Ms. Spellings said that because that program had never been used on a wide scale, the department's ability to buy federal student loans could help head off problems.
 The administration has not proposed buying private student loans, which a growing number of families have used to fill the gap between financial aid and the full cost of tuition. Last year students and their families borrowed more than $17 billion in private loans, according to the College Board; they borrowed nearly $60 billion in federal loans.

HEADLINE: Up With the New: A Second Center City for Las Vegas

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
As other cities look to replace their blighted downtowns with new development, Las Vegas, known for its extravagant facsimiles of European and American landmarks, has come up with an unusual approach: Build another downtown, right next to the decaying one.
 On Thursday, the city will formally inaugurate a new urban core on a 61-acre, undeveloped parcel of land -- a project that some experts say is unprecedented in city planning. Called Union Park, its supporters hope it will revive the historic downtown just to the east, where the region's courthouses, government offices and oldest casinos are clustered.
 More than $6 billion in mostly private money has been announced for five ambitious projects: an Alzheimer's research center, designed by Frank Gehry; a 60-story international center for jewelry trading; a hotel by the celebrity chef Charlie Palmer; a casino-resort; thousands of residential units and square feet of office space, and, as its centerpiece, a $360 million performing arts center. 
 Construction on the rippled Gehry building and utility lines is under way on this former brownfield, once a chemical dumping ground for the Union Pacific Railroad. 
 ''It's quite unusual that there's a big swath of downtown ground just sitting there without having to go through a whole rigmarole to acquire,'' said Bill Hudnut, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute in Washington. Mr. Hudnut, the former mayor of Indianapolis, recalled that acquiring just three blocks of that city ''involved some legal fights and eminent domain, the demolition of buildings, numerous deals with numerous owners.'' In Las Vegas, he added, ''they're just building new stuff.'' 
 It is an approach recommended to the mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, a criminal defense lawyer famed for defending mafia figures, by major developers brought in to tutor him in redevelopment after his election in 1999. The mayor, who admits he ran ''almost as a game'' to win, said he quickly realized that reversing the downtown area's decline could become his most important legacy. (Downtown Las Vegas is immediately north of the Strip.)
 ''They all told me I couldn't do anything because I didn't have what I needed,'' which was land, recalled Mr. Goodman, now in his third and final term. ''I despaired. Then I looked out my window and saw this fallow 61 acres of brownfield.''
 The city acquired it by swapping other land with the holding company that owned the parcel. But it would take five years and several failed deals with developers before the city signed with Newland Communities to manage and design the site.
 In the meantime, the city's acquisition spurred other developers to snap up vacant land nearby. Union Park is now surrounded by an outlet mall and 3 of 10 buildings planned for the $3 billion World Market Center, a furniture-industry exposition space. The city's plans ''created the credibility of a Las Vegas that's open for business outside of the Strip,'' said Robert J. Maricich, chief executive and president of World Market Center. 
 But the national economic downturn may play a role in how soon all of Union Park is realized. Already, the opening date for the $700 million World Jewelry Center has been pushed back one year, and questions abound as to whether the more than 3,000 residential units planned to be built will sell in a state with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the United States.
 ''There's no question that the Union Park property is going be developed,'' said Matt Ward, editor of the weekly Las Vegas Business Press. ''The question is whether some of these projects that were supposed to break ground this year will do so. We're mainly talking about delays, I think. Are you going to see business leaders in town talking openly about that? Probably not.''
 Mr. Goodman has brought his boisterous personality and decades of friendships in the community to bear, persuading the region's top liquor distributor, Larry Ruvo, to build the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute. The research center, named for Mr. Ruvo's father, who died of Alzheimer's disease, is a partnership with the University of Nevada School of Medicine.
 The linchpin, though, is the Smith Center for the Performing Arts, Las Vegas's first stab at a Lincoln Center-style facility that can be home for ballet and philharmonic companies. It will break ground in August.
 ''We don't have a cultural hub right now,'' said Rita Brandin, the vice president and development director for Newland. ''This provides that community gathering place.''
 Union Park does have skeptics, including Dave Hickey, culture critic for Vanity Fair, who is baffled by how the development will interconnect with the older downtown area and help in its resurgence. Mr. Hickey's wife, Libby Lumpkin, is executive director of the Las Vegas Art Museum, and Mr. Hickey noted that Ms. Lumpkin rejected efforts to move that museum to Union Park.
 ''The idea is that they're going to put in these public buildings and this is going to make a respectful downtown for Las Vegas without all the glitz and glamour, I guess, but I think it'll be a ghost town,'' Mr. Hickey said. ''I don't see how the comings and goings will be facilitated. And those open spaces that landscape architects so love are not really conducive to the desert climate.''
 It also leaves the question of whether the city is abandoning the historic downtown, where all of Las Vegas was born 100 years ago. 
 Defenders like Ms. Brandin counter: ''We've got an existing downtown. This is an urban core. It's complementary.''
 And Mr. Goodman said the Union Park effort had helped kick off a decade of redevelopment in the older downtown region, which he expects to connect to Union Park via pedestrian bridges over the railroad tracks that run along the site's eastern edge. Several casinos have new owners spending millions to upgrade, a bar district is starting to blossom and an old post office is being restored for use as a museum focused on mafia history, complete with interactive wiretapping exhibits. Most important, the mayor noted, are the half-dozen condominium towers nearing completion there.
 ''They wouldn't have given you a plugged nickel eight years ago that there would ever be a high-rise residential building in downtown Las Vegas,'' Mr. Goodman said with a laugh. ''It was unheard of.''
 And Union Park is now desirable enough to be a bargaining chip. Next month, the City Council is expected to finalize a plan in which a developer will build a new $150 million City Hall in the older downtown area in exchange for a parcel in Union Park where a casino-hotel can be built.
 Still, the enduring down-at-the-heels reputation of the old downtown was a factor in Mr. Palmer's decision to build in Union Park instead of the old downtown. ''I call it the new Las Vegas,'' said Richard Femenella, chief financial officer of the Charlie Palmer Group. ''They say they're revitalizing downtown, but truthfully, everything west of the railroad tracks is all brand new. It was dirt.'' 
 Whether the old downtown is left behind is a concern of Linda Lera-Randle El, an activist for homeless people, who said that none of the residential units in Union Park were designated as affordable housing and that she worried that homeless people who squat on the vacant land would be displaced.
 Not all of the mayor's dreams have come to fruition. Several attempts to get a developer to build a sports arena, first at Union Park and then elsewhere, appear to have stalled. Mr. Goodman aggressively courted the Cleveland Clinic to take up residence, only to have the respected hospital pass. But the results of Union Park nonetheless stand to rewrite the national impression of Mr. Goodman as a Vegas caricature given to outlandish acts like suggesting that graffiti artists be de-thumbed or running a seminar on making martinis.
 ''I don't always agree with Oscar, but I do think that Union Park is going to make it,'' said a councilwoman, Lois Tarkanian, one of Mr. Goodman's most vocal detractors.
 ''Even if you disagree with him on this or that,'' Ms. Tarkanian said, ''you have to give him credit for the part of his personality that can get this done.''

HEADLINE: Unsafe at Any Height?

 BODY:
After a string of deadly accidents and disclosures of bureaucratic incompetence, Patricia Lancaster, New York City's buildings commissioner, made the right decision on Tuesday to resign. The department now needs a major overhaul. 
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg has championed robust development, and New York City's economy has benefited. But the city's Buildings Department has not kept up with the pace. It has too few inspectors, a culture of lax enforcement and a history of putting the needs of developers and contractors above public safety concerns. Construction goes forward even when sites have numerous citations (there were more than 30 code violations at the building where a worker fell to his death last week), and fines are set too low to enforce better practices. 
 It is especially worrisome when New York's residents are more vigilant than the regulators. That was the case on the Upper East Side. Exasperated neighbors there spent months calling the department to raise concerns about the construction of a 43-story tower. They said the building was too tall for the neighborhood and its enormous crane seemed tenuously attached. 
 They were right on both counts. The crane broke from its brace and collapsed last month, killing seven people. An inspector has since been charged with falsifying inspection records. The department has also acknowledged that the tower's height violated zoning rules and the plans should never have been approved. 
 So far this year, 13 people have died in construction-related accidents, more than the 12 fatalities in all of 2007. Human error or equipment failure is usually blamed. But there are also concerns that some builders may be rushing jobs as costs for materials and fuel skyrocket. It is the department's responsibility to ensure corners aren't being cut and risks taken.
 Ms. Lancaster made some important reforms, including updating the city's haphazard building code for the first time in 40 years and making use of the Internet to share information with the public. She doubled the number of building inspectors to about 400, which is still not enough. 
 Jessica Lappin, the City Council member who represents the district where the crane fell, has suggested that the department hire some independent experts who might audit paperwork and tour construction sites. That may be necessary, but it is not a long-term fix. What New York needs is a fully staffed Buildings Department with a culture of vigilance and honesty.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Chief Accepts Criticism for Weak Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ERIE, Pa. 

 BODY:
-- Less than two weeks after the General Electric Company shocked investors by reporting a 6 percent loss in first-quarter profit, the chief executive Jeffrey R. Immelt, told more than 1,000 shareholders that he was disappointed that G.E. would not deliver a promised 10 percent increase in earnings for 2008. 
 The company, he said at G.E. annual meeting, would ''learn from our successes and failures to get better.''
 He pledged that the company would increase its planned cost cutting from $2 billion to $3 billion.
 ''We are in the toughest economy since 2001 and the worst housing crisis since the Depression,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''Banks have written off more than $250 billion. ... Days of easy credit have turned into months of no credit at all. While I am confident about the economy long term, we could see even more difficult times ahead.''
 Earlier, Mr. Immelt said he accepted criticism from analysts who said the quarterly results damaged his credibility. Until the earnings report, G.E. had a strong record of meeting its earnings targets.
 ''I just think it is what it is, right?'' he said. ''My track record over a long period in this company has been good. I expect it to be good in the future. You don't do a job like this if you can't take a punch.''
 G.E.'s first-quarter earnings report triggered a plunge that wiped out more than $46 billion of its market capitalization and saw the company's stock fall nearly 13 percent.
 The report was more surprising because Mr. Immelt promised investors in March earnings growth of 10 percent in 2008. After this month's decline in earnings, G.E. dropped its projected earnings to be 5 percent or less.
 ''This has triggered a tough reaction and it should,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''I can assure you that we look in the mirror and ask ourselves some very tough questions.''
 Mr. Immelt said G.E. executives were making changes in operations and planning, including more frequent business forecasting, with Mr. Immelt reviewing businesses weekly.
 ''This will ensure that there are no time gaps between how we describe the company and what we deliver,'' he said.
 ''And we have had detailed discussions with all leaders in the company to describe what happened in the quarter and make sure it doesn't happen again,'' he said.
 Mr. Immelt also defended the company's performance and brushed aside questions he would approve further spin-offs from the industrial and commercial conglomerate.
 ''I would ask people to keep something in mind,'' he told reporters Wednesday morning. ''In the last five or six years I've sold 50 or $60 billion of business. I've acquired 70 or $80 billion of business. This has probably been the most active portfolio change in the history of the company and it would be hard to find another industrial company that's done anything close to what we've done.''
 Under Mr. Immelt, G.E. sold off the company's plastics and insurance businesses and has been increasing its market share in emerging markets like Asia and Latin America.
 Erie is the site of G.E.'s transportation business headquarters.

HEADLINE: Weighing A McCain Economist

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va. 

 BODY:
-- When Douglas Holtz-Eakin took over in 2003 as the director of the Congressional Budget Office -- the nation's bean counter in chief -- he walked right into a firestorm. 
 For years, Republicans had been pushing the budget office to change the way it estimated the cost of a tax cut. Rather than looking only at the revenue lost, they argued, the office should also consider how tax cuts would change behavior. With lower tax rates, businesses would invest more, workers would work more -- and the government would thus get a tax windfall. This, in a nutshell, is supply-side economics.
 A bearded academic, Mr. Holtz-Eakin had just finished a stint in the Bush administration and had spoken favorably about dynamic analysis. So his appointment excited Republicans almost as much as it scared Democrats. Senator Kent Conrad went so far as to call it ''a mistake.''
 But it turns out that both parties underestimated Mr. Holtz-Eakin. He did indeed begin using dynamic analysis, which makes a lot of sense, since tax rates really do alter people's behavior. Yet he used it as it should be used. 
 What the budget office found, as study after study has shown, was that any new revenue that tax cuts brought in paled in comparison with their cost. This is why the deficit jumped under the last two tax-cutting presidents (Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush) and fell under the last two tax-raising presidents (George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton).
 As Mr. Holtz-Eakin told Congress in 2003, a dynamic analysis of the White House's tax and spending proposals made essentially no difference. The impact of such analysis, he later said, had been ''overblown.'' When he left the budget office in 2005, Senator Conrad told The Hill newspaper that Mr. Holtz-Eakin had been ''an exemplary leader.''
 Today, Mr. Holtz-Eakin again finds himself in a firestorm. He is the top economic adviser to John McCain's presidential campaign, and some fiscal conservatives have begun wondering what happened to the Douglas Holtz-Eakin who was a teller of unpleasant truths. For that matter, they're wondering what happened to the John McCain who was a fiscal conservative himself, the man who not only railed against profligate spending but also voted against Mr. Bush's deficit-creating tax cuts.
 ''We've been taking some hits,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin acknowledged. 
 Last week, Senator McCain laid out his economic vision in a speech in Pittsburgh. He talked about wasteful spending, but the newest, most detailed part of the speech dealt with a package of tax cuts that would cost about $300 billion a year. They would come on top of $350 billion a year in Bush tax cuts that Mr. McCain wants to make permanent. To put these numbers in perspective, the Iraq war has been costing roughly $200 billion a year. 
 So on Tuesday I visited Mr. Holtz-Eakin at the McCain campaign headquarters, on the top floor of an office building in suburban Virginia. We talked for more than an hour (in the empty office of the campaign's strategist Charlie Black, because Mr. Holtz-Eakin doesn't have his own office). 
 But I really had only one question that mattered: Are there any fiscal conservatives anymore?
 One of the first things that people notice about Mr. Holtz-Eakin is his laugh. It's hearty, it bursts out every few minutes, and it sometimes follows a joke that Mr. Holtz-Eakin has made at his own expense. 
 Now 50, he is about a decade older than the typical economic ringleader in a presidential campaign. ''I'm too old for this,'' he said to Mr. McCain at one point. ''You can't say that,'' replied the 71-year-old Mr. McCain. 
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin grew up near Pittsburgh, where his father was a Navy veteran who had risen through the ranks to become the manager of a Jones & Laughlin steel plant. In the 1980s, his father oversaw the closing of that plant, which Mr. Holtz-Eakin calls ''the most horrific thing I've ever seen'' and which influenced his own decision to become an economist focusing on public policy.
 As a graduate student and junior professor at Princeton, he worked with Harvey Rosen and, eventually, John Taylor, two top-tier Republican economists. Mr. Holtz-Eakin's own academic work often examined the effect of taxes -- a favorite Republican subject -- but it was still relatively apolitical. ''It's very empirical; it's very data-based,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''He doesn't theorize. He goes to the data to find out how things actually work.''
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin came into Mr. McCain's orbit during the 2000 presidential campaign, and the two men were a good match. Both of them are economic conservatives who focus more on the need to restrain government spending than on the social good it may accomplish. And they're absolutely right that spending is the main long-term problem. 
 In all, federal taxes now equal about 19 percent of the nation's economic output, which is in line with the historical average. But the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, on their current path, would require that number to rise to an unmanageable 30 percent, and beyond, in coming decades. 
 ''We as a nation cannot tax our way out of this problem,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin says. ''It's just not an option.''
 To deal with the deficit, Mr. McCain has said that he will get tough on year-to-year spending, both in military programs and domestic ones. Then he will try to remake Medicare and Medicaid so that, as Mr. Holtz-Eakin puts it, they no longer pay doctors ''based on what they do to people, instead of what they do to make people well.'' It's a fine idea.
 The problem is that the campaign has been far, far more detailed about its tax cuts, which would worsen the deficit, than its spending cuts, which would reduce it. Mr. McCain has proposed the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (at a cost of $60 billion a year), new child tax deductions ($65 billion), a corporate tax cut ($100 billion) and faster write-offs for corporate investments in new equipment ($50 billion to $75 billion). 
 On the spending side, the senator talks broadly about cracking down on pork barrel projects and holding agencies accountable for their budgets. These steps, Mr. Holtz-Eakin told me, could eventually bring $150 billion a year in savings. He added that given Mr. McCain's history of fighting against wasteful spending, he deserved the benefit of the doubt.
 It would be easier to give him that benefit, though, if he weren't so vague. For decades presidential candidates have been promising to cut waste, fraud and abuse, and no one has yet made a noticeable dent in the federal budget. 
 As Mr. McCain's plan currently stands, The Economist magazine concluded that it ''will not come anywhere close to paying for the tax cuts.'' Most telling, I spoke over the past week with several other economists who admire Mr. McCain and have advised him over the years. None would defend his current fiscal package (or be quoted).
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin says the mistake that people are making is treating the McCain platform as if it were a finished piece of work. ''It's April,'' he said. ''We have until November.'' The campaign will later unveil ''base broadeners'' in the corporate tax code -- that is, loopholes it will eliminate -- that will pay for the faster investment write-offs, for example. 
 It's easy to imagine how Mr. McCain could be laying the groundwork to run as a true fiscal conservative, now that he has locked up the Republican nomination. He could present himself as the one candidate who believesthat the nation can afford neither Mr. Bush's endless tax cuts nor the Democrats' big new government programs. He has the perfect adviser to help him make that case.
 But it's not the case he's making, at least not yet. Instead, when you add up the numbers that have been released so far, you're left wondering if he is the least fiscally conservative candidate still in the race.

HEADLINE: The Bruising Will Go On for the Party, Too

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Megan Thee, Marjorie Connelly and John M. Broder contributed reporting.

DATELINE: For better or worse 

 BODY:
and many Democrats fear it is for worse -- the race goes on.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton defeated Senator Barack Obama in Pennsylvania on Tuesday by enough of a margin to continue a battle that Democrats increasingly believe is undermining their effort to unify the party and prepare for the general election against Senator John McCain. 
 Despite a huge investment of time and money by Mr. Obama and pressure on Mrs. Clinton by the party establishment to consider folding her campaign, she won her third big state in a row. Mrs. Clinton showed again that she is a tenacious campaigner with an ability to connect with the blue-collar voters Mr. Obama has found elusive and who could be critical to a Democratic victory in November. 
 Mrs. Clinton's margin was probably not sufficient to fundamentally alter the dynamics of the race, which continued to favor an eventual victory for Mr. Obama. But it made clear that the contest will go on at least a few weeks, if not more. And it served to underline the concerns about Mr. Obama's strengths as a general election candidate. Exit polls again highlighted the racial, economic, sex and values divisions within the party. 
 To take one example, only 60 percent of Democratic Catholic voters said they would vote for Mr. Obama in a general election; 21 percent said they would vote for Mr. McCain, exit polls show.
 ''This is exactly what I was afraid was going to happen,'' said Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat who has not endorsed anyone in the race. ''They are going to just keep standing there and pounding each other and bloodying each other, and no one is winning. It underlines the need to find some way to bring this to conclusion.''
 The Democratic Party, so energized and optimistic just a few months ago, thus finds itself in a position few would have expected: a nomination battle unresolved, with two candidates engaged in increasingly damaging attacks. At a time when the Democratic Party would dearly like to turn its attention to Mr. McCain, it now faces continued damage to the images of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 That said, the fears confronting Democrats could be swept away reasonably soon. Even with her comfortable victory on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton still faces significant, though certainly not insurmountable, hurdles to securing the nomination, and it remains possible that her candidacy could come to an end in as little as two weeks, when Indiana and North Carolina vote. Should that be the case, the Democratic Party would presumably have the time and the motivation to heal its wounds. 
 ''We have problems going both ways, but that is going to get healed,'' said Joe Trippi, who was a senior adviser to the presidential campaign of John Edwards, who quit the race earlier this year. ''If it doesn't get healed, we have problems.''
 Still, the voting patterns on Tuesday underlined what has been one of Mrs. Clinton's central arguments to Democratic Party leaders in asserting that Mr. Obama would have trouble as a general election candidate. Once again, as in Ohio six weeks ago, he is struggling to win support from the kinds of voters that could be critical to a Democratic victory in the fall. Mrs. Clinton posed the question bluntly on Tuesday.
 ''Considering his financial advantage, the question ought to be, why can't he close the deal?'' Mrs. Clinton said outside a polling place in a northern suburb of Philadelphia. ''Why can't he win in a state like this?''
 Mr. Obama continues to hold a lead over Mrs. Clinton in the total popular vote cast, as well as in pledged delegates. Those factors will weigh heavily on the superdelegates, elected Democrats and party leaders whose votes will be needed to give Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama the 2,025 total for the nomination.
 Still, there were some worrisome signs for Mr. Obama after what has been several rough weeks for him on the campaign trail. At the least, he would have some work to do going into the fall if he wins the nomination, a point made even by his supporters. 
 ''The negative attacks have had a little damage,'' said Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. ''I do believe it's recoverable, mainly because of his theme of unity and bringing people together.''
 Mr. Richardson added, ''Senator Clinton's negative attacks have hurt her as well, as recent polls have shown.''
 The results of the exit poll, conducted at 40 precincts across Pennsylvania by Edison/Mitofsky for the television networks and The Associated Press, also found stark evidence that Mr. Obama's race could be a problem in the general election. Sixteen percent of white voters said race mattered in deciding who they voted for, and just 54 percent of those voters said they would support Mr. Obama in a general election; 27 percent of them said they would vote for Mr. McCain if Mr. Obama was the Democratic nominee, and 16 percent said they would not vote at all.
 After weeks in which Mr. Obama was pressed to explain what his opponents sought to characterize as disparaging remarks about gun owners and church-goers, Mrs. Clinton defeated him among those voters. About 20 percent of voters in those groups said they would choose Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama in a general election. And Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Obama overwhelmingly among Catholics, a constituency that will be critical in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 ''They both have great strengths, and they also have weaknesses,'' Mr. Bredesen said. ''The sooner it is we end this and try to figure out how to address those weaknesses, the better.''
 Mrs. Clinton, exuberant in victory, was quick to vow that she would push on to the next big races. Yet if the outcome threw her enough of a line to keep going, it probably did not do much to help her accomplish two top goals: narrowing Mr. Obama's overall lead in the popular vote, or his lead in delegates elected in caucuses and primaries.
 Mrs. Clinton's strategy all along has been to play for time, hoping that something would happen that might get uncommitted superdelegates to think twice before supporting Mr. Obama. Mr. Bredesen, in calling for an end to the contest, was hardly alone in suggesting that this might be damaging for the party as it heads into the fall election. 
 But Mrs. Clinton shows no sign of going away any time soon -- and as long as she continues posting victories like the one she did Tuesday, Democratic Party officials are going to be hard-pressed to make the case that it is time for her to go.

HEADLINE: Clinton Clearly Outduels Obama in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton scored a decisive victory over Senator Barack Obama on Tuesday in the Pennsylvania primary, giving her candidacy a critical boost as she struggles to raise money and persuade party leaders to let the Democratic nominating fight go on.
 If Mrs. Clinton did not emerge from the bruising six-week campaign with a race-turning landslide -- she still trails Mr. Obama in the popular vote and the delegate count -- her victory nonetheless gives her a strong rationale for continuing her candidacy in spite of those Democrats who would prefer to coalesce around Mr. Obama.
 Indeed, in her victory speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton used the words ''fight,'' ''fighter'' and ''fighting'' repeatedly -- not only to promise financially struggling Americans that she would protect them, but also to convey that she had the resolve and confidence to stay in the race. 
 As for Mr. Obama, the loss only hardened the determination of his advisers to overwhelm Mrs. Clinton's campaign with his substantial financial advantage -- he took in $42 million in March to her $21 million -- and with the cold calculus that he is still solidly ahead in their pursuit of the 2,025 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. In his concession speech, he kept the focus on the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, a subject Mrs. Clinton avoided in her address. 
 Incomplete returns from Pennsylvania showed Mrs. Clinton leading 55 percent to 45 percent, with her victory propelled by her strong performance among women, older voters and less affluent and less educated voters; among white union members with no college education, she won almost three-quarters of the vote, polling showed. 
 Even as she celebrated, Mrs. Clinton nodded to the stiff challenges ahead for her campaign, not the least of them Mr. Obama's financial advantage. In her speech, she implored her supporters to log onto her fund-raising Web site and ''and show your support tonight because the future of this campaign is in your hands.'' (Campaign officials said late Tuesday that they were having their best night ever in fund-raising online, bringing in $2.5 million in less than four hours.)
 And she also defiantly acknowledged the Democrats and the pundits who have called on her to end her candidacy.
 ''Some people counted me out and said to drop out, but the American people don't quit, and they deserve a president who doesn't quit either,'' Mrs. Clinton said to fervent cheers and applause at her victory party, where she was joined by former President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, as well as two key supporters in the state, Gov. Edward G. Rendell and Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia.
 While Mrs. Clinton repeatedly sounded economically populist notes in her speech, Mr. Obama touched on those themes but was also more expansive in his remarks on Tuesday night, sharply criticizing Mr. McCain, as offering ''more of the same'' of President Bush's policies. Mr. Obama left Pennsylvania late Tuesday to make his remarks in Indiana, which holds its primary on May 6, along with North Carolina. 
 Returning to his long-standing themes of unity and hope, Mr. Obama said: ''We can continue to slice and dice this country into red states and blue states. We can exploit the divisions that exist in our country for pure political gain. Or this time, we can build on the movement we've started in this campaign.''
 Yet Mr. Obama also faces challenges ahead: According to Republican Party officials, party members in North Carolina -- which holds its primary on May 6 -- are considering running an advertisement against Mr. Obama that highlights his ties to controversial figures like his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. That ad could have the effect of adding a racially divisive element to that Southern state's primary.
 The Indiana primary, on the same day, poses another make-or-break moment for Mrs. Clinton, according to several of her advisers, who said they would urge her to quit the race if she lost that state. Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Clinton and their allies have campaigned frequently in Indiana in recent weeks, and she has some important endorsements, including support from Senator Evan Bayh, the state's former governor.
 ''She has to win Pennsylvania and Indiana -- pretty much everyone in the campaign agrees on that,'' said one senior Clinton adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign's electoral expectations.
 The Pennsylvania race turned into a mammoth political battle in recent days, with both candidates pouring millions of dollars into television advertising -- much of it negative -- and criticizing each other relentlessly on the campaign trail. Mrs. Clinton questioned Mr. Obama's electability and attacked him for saying that struggling Americans were ''bitter,'' while Mr. Obama tried to shave her lead in opinion polls.
 Mrs. Clinton faces major challenges: her campaign is essentially out of money, with unpaid bills piling up, and she faces growing frustration among some Democratic officials who would prefer her to end her campaign in recognition of Mr. Obama's lead in the overall popular vote of the primaries and caucuses so far, as well as his continuing edge toward amassing the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the nomination. And Tuesday's night's results likely did little to cut into his edge on that front.
 Mrs. Clinton's campaign spent Tuesday planning a fresh fundraising drive to trying to capitalize on her performance in Pennsylvania, while other aides mapped out political strategy and staff movement to Indiana and North Carolina. 
 Clinton advisers said they realized they had tough challenges ahead. Chief among them, besides paying bills and financing new advertising, was persuading impatient Democratic superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials -- to remain neutral in the contest and let the remaining primaries play out through early June.
 The Pennsylvania Democrats who cast their ballots in Tuesday's primary did so with the economy weighing heavily on their minds, according to surveys of voters leaving polling places. Those surveys showed that more than half the voters questioned believe that the worsening state of the American economy is the most important issue confronting the country, with about 90 percent saying the United States has already slipped into a recession.
 Half of those polled also said that they were looking for a candidate who could bring about change, which has been the main theme of Mr. Obama's campaign. Mr. Obama leads in delegates, but has consistently trailed Mrs. Clinton in polls taken in Pennsylvania, though the gap had been closing in recent days.
 About one-quarter of those who participated in the exit polling, conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for five television networks and The Associated Press, endorsed the idea that experience, which Mrs. Clinton has emphasized in her campaign, is the most important quality to be sought in a candidate. For the polling, the margin of sampling error in the sample of 40 precincts across the state was plus or minus four percentage points.
 Both candidates performed strongly among the same constituencies that have supported them in other primary states. Mr. Obama was backed overwhelmingly by black voters and also scored well among voters younger than 45 and college graduates, the results show. Trailing Mr. Obama over all in both the national popular vote and in the competition for delegates, Mrs. Clinton's advisers said Tuesday that they were girding for a tough spring.
 Most difficult would be amassing enough delegates to overcome Mr. Obama's lead on that front -- he now has about 150 more delegates over all. His advisers say that in the coming days, they also plan to roll out additional Obama endorsements from superdelegates, the party leaders and elected officials who have an automatic vote in deciding the nomination and the discretion to choose a candidate.
 Clinton advisers said they were already picking states, cities and towns to dispatch staff members and volunteers from Pennsylvania, and budgeting for television advertising. They are also planning a busy travel schedule for the Clintons, their daughter and an army of surrogates; they are expected to focus heavily on Indiana, and to a lesser extent in North Carolina, where Mr. Obama is widely seen as strongly positioned.
 A greater concern in the shorter term for Mrs. Clinton is fundraising: Her campaign faces a cash squeeze as unpaid bills mount and she spends more money than she is taking in, according to new campaign finance filings. 
 The Pennsylvania race was volatile into its final hours. Mrs. Clinton, for instance, surprised some Democrats with a remark about Iran on ABC on Tuesday, when she broke with her practice of avoiding hypothetical questions and commented on a situation in which Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons.
 ''I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran,'' she said. ''In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them.''

HEADLINE: Next-Door Neighbors Back Bush on Expanding Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
President Bush pulled the leaders of Mexico and Canada into an unusually direct involvement in his domestic political efforts to expand free trade on Tuesday when his two North American allies joined him in a foray into both Congressional politics and the presidential campaign.
 President Felipe Calderon of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada lent their weight to what has been something of a lonely campaign by the president as he has traveled the country to make pro-trade speeches and angry statements about the ''petty politics'' that he sees threatening one of his administration's major legacies. 
 They joined Mr. Bush in sharply criticizing a decision by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to scuttle a vote on a free trade agreement with Colombia. And indirectly but unmistakably, they rebuffed calls by the two Democratic presidential candidates to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta.
 ''We talked a lot about the Nafta, and of course we agreed that this is not the time to even think about amending it or canceling it,'' Mr. Calderon said, appearing with his two counterparts after two days of meetings here in New Orleans in which they trumpeted what they described as the irrefutable economic progress in each of their countries since the agreement was reached in 1994.
 ''This is the time to strengthen and reinvigorate this free trade agreement among our three countries,'' the Mexican president added.
 Mr. Bush has always made his views on trade abundantly clear, but his increasingly critical comments underscored a mounting frustration that the trade issue has stalled in Congress and come under attack by the two Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama.
 Without mentioning either by name, Mr. Bush dismissed criticism of Nafta as ''a throwaway political line,'' suggesting, as one of Mr. Obama's own advisers reportedly told Canadian officials, that opposition to free trade involved electoral politics more than policy questions.
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, facing off in Pennsylvania, where the effects of trade had become a pointed campaign issue in the weeks leading to the primary on Tuesday, repeated their pledges that they would seek to renegotiate the terms of Nafta. Both Mr. Calderon and Mr. Harper made it clear that they would not support reopening the agreement.
 ''Of course, it's the United States who needs to make a decision about this election,'' Mr. Harper said, ''but I think that in the end, Canada really is confident that the next president will also understand the importance of Nafta.''
 Both leaders also echoed Mr. Bush's warnings that rejecting a free trade agreement with Colombia would undercut not only economies in the region, but also its security.
 Trade, long politically divisive in the United States, has become a more charged issue than usual because of the confluence of the presidential campaign and an economic slowdown that has increased anxiety about job losses.
 It has also divided Democrats. While Mr. Bush reveled in the expected support of American business executives who gathered in New Orleans under the auspices of the United States Chamber of Commerce, he also found an ally in this city's Democratic mayor, C. Ray Nagin, who on Monday evening said trade benefited the city, still reeling under the ravages of Hurricane Katrina.
 Ms. Pelosi has suggested that the House would consider a vote on the Colombia agreement if the administration would consider an expansion of unemployment benefits and an increase in training programs to assist those who lose their jobs as companies move operations overseas.
 ''The American people want solutions on the economy and less partisan rhetoric from the president,'' Ms. Pelosi said in a statement responding to Tuesday's criticism. ''Democrats have repeatedly told the president we are willing to work with him in good faith to create jobs and restore our economic strength.''
 The White House has rejected that idea. Officials say the administration had worked with Congress on an economic stimulus package and that the agreement with Colombia would create jobs by opening that country's market to American exports.
 ''She's effectively killed it,'' Mr. Bush said of Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday, reiterating his arguments that failure to approve the deal would also affect regional security by weakening Colombia's president, Alvaro Uribe, and strengthen leaders like Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez.
 Mr. Calderon and Mr. Harper both emphasized that it was not their role to insert themselves in the American political debate, let alone the presidential campaign. Mr. Harper said that Canada would consider a request to renegotiate Nafta by the next president, though he said his government would not support such a step. He also noted, at a time of popular anger over rising fuel prices, that Canada was the United States' largest supplier of oil.
 Mr. Calderon warned that hindering trade would harm Mexico's economy, leave North America uncompetitive and intensify pressure on immigrants to seek work in the United States, another volatile political issue.
 ''This,'' he said, ''is a decision that is solely in the hands of the Americans.''

HEADLINE: EBay Files a Stockholder Lawsuit Against Craigslist

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Relations are strained in eBay's extended family.
 EBay, based in San Jose, Calif., filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Tuesday against Craigslist, the online classified advertising company in which it owns a minority stake. 
 In a statement, eBay said that in January, Craigslist executives took actions that ''unfairly diluted eBay's economic interest'' in the company. EBay did not specify what those actions were but said they diluted its 28.4 percent share in the company by more than 10 percent. EBay bought an interest in Craigslist in 2004 for an undisclosed sum. 
 ''The recent actions by the Craigslist directors have disadvantaged eBay and its investment in Craigslist,'' Michael Jacobson, eBay's senior vice president and general counsel, said in a written statement.
 ''Since negotiating our investment with Craigslist's board in 2004, we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder, so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''We are asking the Delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect eBay's stockholders and preserve our investment.''
 EBay said the complaint was filed under seal because confidentiality restrictions cover some information in it about Craigslist.
 In a blog entry posted on its site Tuesday night, Craigslist said it was ''surprised and very disappointed'' by what it said were eBay's ''unfounded allegations.''
 ''We have always treated eBay very fairly as a minority shareholder, and plan to continue doing so, despite this unfortunate development,'' the blog item said.
 Despite their financial ties, eBay and Craigslist have a history of frosty relations. Craigslist, based in San Francisco, is run as an unconventional business by Craig Newmark, its founder, and Jim Buckmaster, the current chief executive. Most of its services are free, and it has little ambition to increase profits or even redesign its quaint user interface.
 In what appears to be frustration, eBay has unveiled numerous rival advertising sites, like Kijiji.com, to compete with Craigslist around the world.
 Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder, and Josh Silverman, the head of its Skype unit, have sat on the Craigslist board at different times. But eBay said it no longer had a seat on the board.
 Even the story of how eBay acquired its stake in Craigslist has been disputed. Mr. Newmark originally said that an early employee left the company and sold his shares to eBay without consulting Craigslist. But eBay said in its statement on Tuesday that it negotiated its original investment with the Craigslist board.
 Craigslist is privately held and does not reveal its revenues.

To the Editor: 
 Re ''McCain on the Economy at Carnegie Mellon University'' (text, The New York Times on the Web, April 15): 
 There's one key fact the public ought to know in judging Senator John McCain's economic plan: one of the major ways he plans to offset his tax cuts is by eliminating earmarks. And Senator McCain, to his credit, doesn't ask for earmarks himself. 
 But let's review the math. Earmarks, by the estimate of Citizens Against Government Waste, account for about $17 billion a year. That's a lot of money, to be sure. But the projected federal deficit this year is $400 billion (and that's a low projection), while the McCain campaign's own estimate is that his tax cuts would cost $200 billion (and that's not counting extending the Bush tax cuts, which Senator McCain supports). 
 We're not defending earmarks at all; they feed public cynicism that leaders in Washington routinely waste money and don't care about the good of the country as a whole. But eliminating earmarks doesn't get you very far in balancing the budget or stopping the gush of red ink new tax cuts will produce. 
 Two-thirds of the federal budget goes to just five things: Social Security, defense, Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the national debt. Everything else -- the discretionary programs Senator McCain wants to freeze for a year and review -- only adds up to a third of total spending. 
 To get the country's exploding debt under control, we're going to have to focus on where the money actually is.

 IRAN-TRAINED GROUPS BLAMED
 For Most Attacks on U.S. Troops
 Senior officers in the American division that secures Baghdad said that almost three-quarters of fatal and other harmful attacks on American troops over the past year were caused by roadside bombs planted by so-called ''special groups,'' a term used to describe groups trained by Iran that fight alongside the Mahdi Army, but do not obey the orders of the group's figurehead, Moktada al-Sadr.

 As Beijing prepares to welcome 1.5 million visitors to the Olympic Games, security officials are tightening controls and introducing visa restrictions that are causing anxiety among 250,000 foreigners in the city. The visa rules, which were introduced last week with little explanation, restrict many visitors to 30-day stays. PAGE A14 
 BUSH MEETS WITH KING OF JORDAN
 President Bush and King Abdullah of Jordan met privately, as the White House tries to resuscitate the Middle East peace talks before Mr. Bush leaves for Israel next month. The White House would not release details, but the Jordanian embassy said the king told Mr. Bush negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis ''should be based on clear grounds and fixed time frames,'' language that closely echoes the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. PAGE A12 
 LOCAL GOVERNANCE IN AFGHANISTAN
 A turnabout in an Afghan province where there had been broad distrust of local officials has become an important test of one of the most pressing issues that could determine the outcome of the war in Afghanistan: local governance. The buzzword has become shorthand for extending the government's presence in the provinces, making it perform better and provide much-needed public services. PAGE A6

 A Syrian cabinet minister said that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert sent a message to President Bashar al-Assad that Israel would be willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights in return for peace with Syria. Israeli officials did not deny the statement but would not confirm it either. ''Israel wants peace with Syria. We are interested in a negotiated process,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Olmert. PAGE A12

 Federal prosecutors in Miami said that they would try for a third time to convict six men accused of conspiring to destroy the Sears Tower in Chicago and join Al Qaeda.

HEADLINE: As Economy Slows, So Do Laser Eye Surgeries

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Call it the Lasik indicator. With the weak economy forcing consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, the number of laser vision-correction surgeries has been falling -- as it did during the last recession.
 More than 800,000 Americans underwent Lasik surgery in 2007, a slight increase from 2006. But the numbers started slumping along with the economy in the second half of last year. And industry analysts are now predicting a Lasik recession. 
 ''We're forecasting a 17 percent drop for 2008,'' said David Harmon, president of Market Scope, an eye surgery market research house. 
 Mr. Harmon said that when first-quarter data becomes available next month, he expects it to show an even sharper decline in Lasik surgeries than in 2001. That time around, the sour economy led to a three-year slump in the laser procedures, which are typically not covered by insurance. 
 Lasik -- for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis -- typically costs anywhere from $800 to $3,000 or more per eye. 
 Earlier this year, two main players in the business -- Advanced Medical Optics, a leading maker of laser surgery equipment, and LCA-Vision, which owns a chain of laser surgery centers -- warned of a market slowdown. 
 Besides the economic challenge, the industry is contending with a small but growing number of complaints about the results of Lasik procedures -- an issue to be discussed at a federal regulatory hearing on Friday.
 Mr. Harmon's forecast is based on the relatively strong correlation in recent years between Lasik procedures and the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence in the economy. 
 Doctors and analysts said a wide range of elective medical procedures, including breast implants and skin treatments like Botox injections, are also being affected. 
 ''People are just being a little more conservative about their finances,'' said Dr. Robert Cykiert, a New York ophthalmologist who does both eye surgery and Botox injections. 
 In the case of Botox, for example, Dr. Cykiert's existing patients are not spacing out their periodic treatments, he said, but some who are interested in Botox have been hesitant to start treatments. 
 So far, though, Lasik procedures are the most measurably affected. 
 Advanced Medical Optics, which gets more than one-third of its revenue from laser surgery systems and related gear, cut sales and earnings forecasts for the year in February, saying then that it expected a 10 percent drop in procedures in 2008. Its stock, which closed Wednesday at $20.16, is down more than 13 percent since the February warning. 
 That same month, LCA-Vision, the surgery center owner, said it had cut its work force by 16 percent in anticipation of slowing business. Shares of LCA-Vision closed Wednesday at $12.28, down more than 75 percent since last July. The stock of a competitor, TLC Vision, closed at $1.26, down more than 79 percent from a peak of $6.10 last May.
 Lawrence Biegelsen, a medical device analyst for Wachovia Capital Markets, said Advanced Medical Optics' stock could be hit again as complaints by Lasik patients are heard at Friday's hearing by the Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel on ophthalmic devices.
 Federal regulators have received reports of Lasik patients with dry eyes, double vision and distorted night vision, among other problems. Web sites like www.lasik-flap.com and www.lasermyeye.org/forums/index.php carry sobering tales of more serious eye damage or cases of vision improvement seeming to disappear within a few years. 
 The F.D.A. is asking the panel for advice on ways to get more doctors, patients and hospitals to report problems stemming from laser surgery or lens implants. One goal cited in documents the agency released Wednesday is to gather more Lasik data through SightNet, an online network of ophthalmologists who are voluntarily linked to the agency's Medical Product Safety Network.
 Lasik involves cutting a flap in the surface of the cornea to gain access to the central portion of the eye's natural lens, which is then reshaped by the laser. Lasik can reduce or in many cases eliminate nearsightedness, far-sightedness and astigmatism.
 Lasik practitioners say a recent analysis of past studies showed 95 percent satisfaction rates. But with 12 million patients having undergone the procedure in the United States since it was approved in 1995, the sheer number of individuals with unhappy outcomes is growing steadily. And more of their stories are gaining public attention.
 ''My eyes are damaged beyond repair,'' Pamela C. Barncastle, 62, of Albuquerque said in a phone interview. Mrs. Barncastle said she underwent the surgery in 2001 and now has double vision and sees halos and bursts of blurred light at night that keep her from driving after sundown. 
 She said she needed to undergo a corneal transplant, which would be paid for by a settlement with her doctor. But for now, she said, she is making do with her vision problems because she is the sole caregiver for her father and for her husband, an Alzheimer's patient.
 Mrs. Barncastle said she was also worried about the large number of Lasik patients she has talked to who seem to be developing cataracts. ''There needs to be a lot more monitoring of the industry and studies of the long-term effects,'' she said.
 In the last year, the F.D.A. has been working with the National Eye Institute, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons and the American Academy of Ophthalmology to design a large trial that will track patients who undergo Lasik or receive implanted contact lenses. 
 Most past studies have focused on the degree of vision correction attained and medical complications like infection, rather than everyday matters like night vision that can affect quality of life. 
 One result, said Dr. Kerry Solomon, the co-chairman of the committee trying to develop the study design, might be to further clarify which patients are not good candidates for Lasik. 
 But as long as the economy slumps, even many of the suitable patients may never walk in the Lasik doctor's front door. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 25, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the role of the weak economy in the declining number of patients who correct their vision with Lasik surgery misidentified the part of the eye that gets reshaped. It is the inner part of the cornea, not the lens. The article also overstated the scope of a medical study being designed by federal regulators and doctors' groups. The study would look at only the outcomes of Lasik procedures. It would not include patients who have received implanted contact lenses.

HEADLINE: Amazon Gains, Despite An Economic Slowdown

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
An economic slowdown has not affected the nation's largest online retailer, Amazon.com. 
 The company reported revenue grew 37 percent in the first three months of the year and also raised expectations of investors that revenue would continue to grow at nearly the same rate in the current quarter. 
 The Internet retailer, which is based in Seattle, reported that net income in the first quarter rose 30 percent, to $143 million, or 34 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter. 
 The company said sales climbed to $4.13 billion. The results were above the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted net income of 32 cents a share and revenue of $4.08 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial. 
 The company also raised its forecast for the year. It now says 2008 sales are expected to be $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, or an increase of 29 to 35 percent from 2007. That is up slightly from a growth rate of 26 percent to 33 percent that Amazon projected for 2008 at the end of last year. But it said operating profit would remain relatively unchanged, partly because of increased costs associated with acquiring Audible.com, an online seller of digital audio books.
 The company's executives did not discern strength in the overall economy from its results. ''We don't have a lot of data points about the economy specifically,'' said Thomas J. Szkutak, the company's chief financial officer. ''What we are seeing in our business is very solid, as you see from the growth rates.''
 Shares of Amazon rose $1.40, to $81. In anticipation of a positive quarter, share of Amazon had already increased about 30 percent in the last 60 days. 
 ''Over all, it was a good quarter but expectations were pretty high,'' said Aaron Kessler, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. ''It's a case of expectations getting a little bit ahead of fundamentals.'' 
 Amazon's growth was driven primarily by its Amazon Prime discount shipping program, foreign exchange rates that make overseas sales appear more valuable in dollar terms and an increase in sales from third-party retailers who sell on the site.
 ''Our sales growth this quarter was driven by low prices and millions of in-stock items available for immediate shipment,'' said Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in a prepared statement. ''We're grateful to our customers.''
 But investors have been worried about Amazon's operating margins. They fear that as Amazon invests more of its capital in future businesses like Amazon Web services, a collection of online tools that other companies can use to run their businesses, profits will decline. 
 In the last year, Amazon has also invested heavily in digital media, introducing its MP3 digital music store in September. The four big record labels quickly signed on, in part to create an alternative to iTunes, but Amazon's digital store has an overall share of the American music market of only about 2 percent. 
 Amazon began selling its Kindle digital book reader last December. The company unveiled its digital TV and movie store, Amazon Unbox, in the fall of 2006 and gave TiVo owners access to the service directly from their televisions last summer. 
 But more than half of the company's $15 billion in sales last year came from books, CDs and DVDs.

HEADLINE: Farmers' Income Rises, as Do Food Prices, but It's Mostly Politics as Usual

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Americans are in sticker-shock over grocery prices, while people in developing countries are rioting over food shortages. And across the heartland, American farmers are enjoying record incomes, but losing sleep over rising expenses and turbulence in the commodity futures markets. 
 Here on Capitol Hill, though, it is pretty much farm politics as usual. 
 As Congress works toward final passage of the farm bill, it is poised to continue most of the existing farmer subsidy programs, including about $5.2 billion a year in so-called ''direct payments'' that will be disbursed even as net farm income is projected to hit a historic high in 2008. 
 The farm bill, which comes along once every five years and will cost upward of $300 billion, in fact will do little to address many of the most pressing concerns. It will not change biofuel mandates that are directing more corn to ethanol and contributing to a global rise in food prices. 
 It will do little to ease worldwide food shortages. And at a time of high volatility in the futures markets, it will not require tougher regulation. 
 In other words, Congress seems oblivious. And longstanding critics of American policy are piling on. 
 ''It really is astounding,'' said Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, who has pushed for broad changes in farm subsidy programs. ''It's as if this farm bill is being negotiated in a vacuum.'' 
 Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, which maintains a database showing how farm subsidies mostly benefit a small number of wealthy producers, blamed Congressional leaders outside the agriculture committees. 
 ''There really doesn't seem to be any intervention that reflects these broader crises,'' Mr. Cook said. ''They are sound asleep at the leadership level.'' 
 The White House, too, has joined the criticism, sharply criticizing Congress for proposing to spend $16 billion more than was initially allocated for the farm bill -- mostly for increases in food stamps -- at a time when high profits would seem to allow cuts in subsidies. 
 ''With record farm income, now is not the time for Congress to ask other sectors of the economy to pay higher taxes, in order to increase the size of government,'' the White House said in a statement Tuesday calling for a one-year extension of the current farm law. 
 Defenders of the bill say it makes a number of crucial improvements, including a roughly $10 billion increase in food stamps and other nutrition programs, as well as expanded land conservation and rural development programs and new aid for growers of fruits and vegetables, who have never gotten assistance from a farm bill. 
 But even strong proponents of the bill, like Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, concede that farm interests are deeply entrenched and that there is little appetite for change among many farm state lawmakers, especially when it comes to the direct payment program. 
 The direct payments are based on the amount of land that certain farmers own, and Mr. Harkin, who has sought to eliminate the payments, said that many recipients of the money then use it to acquire more land and qualify for more payments. 
 ''It's like the black hole in space that astronomers talk about: everything gets sucked in and nothing ever comes out,'' he said. ''This is the black hole of agriculture. It doesn't make sense, but farmers continue to get it.'' 
 Mr. Harkin said there was not much he could do because ''I don't have the votes,'' adding, ''People love free money.'' 
 Defenders also say that expecting the huge farm bill to address current challenges is like asking a farmer to go out and grow corn for tonight's supper. 
 Other bills -- on energy, foreign aid, even economic stimulus -- have the potential to be more nimble or, in some cases, to cause more harm. 
 The senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Viriginia, said Democrats were to blame for the jump in food prices because of mandates for higher ethanol production that they included in an energy bill last year. 
 ''When corn prices go as high as they were going, people shift their production out of wheat into corn, out of soybeans into corn, out of rice into corn, even out of cotton into corn,'' Mr. Goodlatte said. ''The mandate basically says ethanol comes ahead of food on your table, comes ahead of feed for livestock, comes ahead of grains available for export.''
 But as lawmakers trying to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the farm bill struggle to meet a Friday deadline when a short extension of the current law will expire, there is little in the bill to help slow the ethanol-driven price increases. In recent weeks, corn prices have hit record levels of $6 a bushel and more. 
 And lawmakers are fighting over whether to create a pilot program to buy $25 million in food grown locally in poor countries. Environmentalists and antipoverty experts say that would be a step toward a more effective food aid program than the current practice of shipping American products. 
 There is also no movement to require tighter regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of futures markets. Many farmers suggest that hedge fund money is building a speculative bubble in farm commodities and causing wide swings in futures prices, making it more expensive for them to use futures to lock in crop prices. Farmers fear that the bubble could burst, like in the housing market.
 ''It's a train wreck waiting to happen,'' said Tom Buis, the president of the National Farmers Union.
 Many experts say the biggest step Congress could take would be to eliminate the direct payments in favor of a new revenue assurance program that would help farmers in times of need, but save money in boom years when crop yields are strong and prices high. 
 It is a step that even many farmers say would make sense. 
 ''As a farm leader, I can't justify why someone should receive a guaranteed payment from the federal government, with the high prices they are getting from the marketplace,'' Mr. Buis said.

HEADLINE: Only Your Money is Not Pretend

BYLINE: By MIKE ALBO

 BODY:
THE first time you go to the Grove, the immensely successful and completely fabricated commercial center in Los Angeles, you will try to hate it. But then you will watch the old-fashioned trolley passing by, or the dancing fountain as it splurts jovially to the cadence of a Sinatra song, and you will drop your snobby urban integrity and walk around consuming things in a mouth-breathing stupor just like everyone else. 
 ''You want to hate the Grove, but you just can't,'' one Angeleno friend said. 
 ''The first rule of L.A. is to stop hating the Grove,'' another said. 
 ''You have to go to the Grove!'' everyone else gushed.
 The Grove is everything that is horrible and spectacular about our brand-saturated American lives. It's a living version of every pretentious theory you may have read back in grad school: a facsimile of a space, a scripted zone, a generic city, a vituperative quote by Baudrillard or Deleuze. But it's also totally great!
 I always end up here when I visit Los Angeles. This time I went with my cousin Reginald Veneziano, an actor. Right away, he bought a sensibly hip $44 cardigan at the Gap to wear for auditions. Then we absently entered the Apple Store. The Apple Store here is the same as any other, with well-trained geek-clerks in matching T-shirts and 16-GB iPhones for $499, so we left the Apple Store. We did this kind of brain-dead wandering for three hours.
 Everyone is like that here. Three young women, in huge Olsen twin sunglasses and painfully high cork-soled pumps, stood outside the Coach store. The shortest one let out a groan: ''I'm so tired. Let's go get Frappuccinos.'' They shuffled off obediently, carrying three bags each.
 This fake village is small enough to do in one Frappuccino. It is made up of just over 40 stores you know -- Nordstrom, Anthropologie, Quiksilver -- mixed in with some you may not know, like Davante (eyewear) and Arden B. (women's apparel). They all sit side by side like nifty neighbors.
 Walking up and down the curved, unspontaneous street, you can buy a single Haagen-Dazs ice cream cone for $3.49 or go to Michael Kors and get a gold lame knitting satchel for $1,695. There are lots of kiosks where you can buy all sorts of trinkets: little plastic Pocahontas backpacks, a T-shirt that says Hollywood in snazzy metallic beads for $17.99. 
 Next to the fountain, there is a little plot of grass, a small Central Park-like bridge and a stage area for live performances. It all adds up to a cute, completely unreal township where the word ''recession'' has been deeply repressed.
 People here in Consumerland are very friendly. At Kiehl's, the saleswoman flirted with my cousin. ''You have beautiful eyes,'' she said as I stood by like his sexless, doddering aunt. To compensate, I bought large bottles of Creme de Corps and Ultra Facial Moisturizer. 
 Next door, a shirtless stud stood in the doorway of Abercrombie & Fitch and greeted us as if he almost cared. Braving the loud-loud music, we walked around the dimly lit store and thumbed through ''vintage destroyed'' polos ($49.50) and ''casual luxury'' pendants on leather bands ($14.50 to $19.50) while every store person made sure to say hello. 
 A vast Diego Rivera-style mural extended up the stairs, depicting more shirtless and impossibly fit men, with a few women thrown in like parsley garnish for their narcissistic perfection. ''They look like the Lost Colony of Equinox,'' my cousin said. We began to feel we were in a place of deep cynical evil and quickly left.
 The Grove opened next to the gracefully old Farmers Market in 2002, the brainchild of Caruso Affiliated and its chief executive, Rick J. Caruso, a government commissioner turned real estate developer. The 575,000-square-foot retail park quickly became a much needed public space in this coiffed yet lonely city. According to Caruso Affiliated, 18 million people visit annually and spend an average of $169 per visit. This seemed like an outlandish number until I realized I had spent $83 on Kiehl's moisturizer in under an hour, and trust me, I am always on the pathetic end of any income statistic.
 With its old-time trolley, jazzy music, familiar storefronts and manufactured midcentury nostalgia, the Grove, as is often pointed out, borrows much of its aesthetic from Disneyland's Main Street, U.S.A.
 But if Walt were to return from the dead and take a tour, he would freak out. There are no signs for milkshakes or hot dogs or Mickey Mouse ears here. In this happy consumer village, desires are organized by brand and brand alone, and unless you are familiar with the Nike swoosh, the Gap's blue square or Crate & Barrel's clean logo, you will walk around shoeless, naked, with no respectable flatware. 
 Sure, the Grove is creepy and fake, but at least it's honest about it. Nearly every week we are shown a new computer-rendered architectural plan of a super futuristic building designed by Santiago Calatrava or Zaha Hadid and are told we are looking at the future. But as long as we continue barreling along our path of unmitigated consumerism, the future will not look smooth, white and sleek. It will look like the Grove: a Frankensteinian hodgepodge of branded facades that we walk into and out of, forgetfully.
 Actually, the future is already here. On May 2, Caruso Affiliated is scheduled to open a retail complex in nearby Glendale, off Brand Street. The almost 1-million-square-foot $400-million outdoor shopping and dining destination, aptly named the Americana at Brand, will have luxury homes above the stores. Residents will be able to use their key cards to buy goods, order food from restaurants, have their dry cleaning delivered. It sounds like another preposterous place I know, named Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Maker of Data Storage Gear Posts Strong Revenue Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The EMC Corporation, the top maker of corporate data storage equipment, reported strong revenue growth in both overseas and American markets on Wednesday, despite concerns over corporate spending in a weakened United States economy. 
 The company reiterated full-year financial targets that it issued in January, and its shares rose.
 EMC executives also dismissed speculation that the company would spin off its majority stake in VMware, a rapidly growing maker of business software, early next year.
 EMC's first-quarter revenue climbed 17 percent, to $3.47 billion, gaining across geographic regions and all major product areas despite fears of a pullback in technology spending. Sales in North America rose 14 percent from a year earlier, while overseas revenue grew 21 percent.
 Net income fell as the company took charges for acquisitions and other costs, dropping to $268.8 million, or 13 cents a share, from $312.6 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier.
 Profit excluding a charge for research and development was 16 cents a share in the latest quarter, or 23 cents a share before other one-time items.

HEADLINE: After the Smoke Cleared, Where Did All the Bingo Players Go?

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM; Carolyn Marshall and Claudia Rowe contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Banning smoking at charity bingo games may have health benefits, but it is proving harmful to earnings.
 In Minnesota, which adopted a statewide ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces in October, revenue from all charity gambling dropped nearly 13 percent in the last quarter of 2007, compared to the same quarter the year before, according to state officials. More than half of the drop -- the equivalent of about $100 million annually -- was attributed to the new law, they said. 
 Charlie Lindstrom, who runs the bingo nights at an American Legion post in Fergus Falls, Minn., said some of his former customers now drove to casinos on Indian reservations, where they can puff away, or across the border to Fargo, N.D., where veterans' organizations are exempt from that state's smoking ban. 
 On a good night, Mr. Lindstrom said, bingo at the post used to attract 50 to 75 players. Nowadays it is more like 30 or 40. 
 ''It's had a profound effect on us here,'' Mr. Lindstrom said. ''We've sponsored several baseball teams here in the past, but we can't give as much now because the smoking ban has really reduced our revenue.'' 
 Mr. Lindstrom is not alone. Managers of charity bingo games in California, New Jersey, New York and Washington State also say their states' smoking bans have forced cutbacks in their budgets and in their support for various causes.
 Few believe they can cultivate new nonsmoking players. They say smoking goes with bingo like peanut butter with jelly. Michael J. Surwill, bingo chairman at Elks Lodge No. 2501 in Ocean Springs, Miss., estimated that smokers outnumbered nonsmokers three to one at the lodge's weekly game. 
 Last year, his bingo game produced $23,000 that supported a shelter for abused women, a drug awareness program and a camp for young cancer survivors, Mr. Surwill said, adding, ''I'm sure we wouldn't raise nearly that much if we banned smoking.'' 
 Veterans' organizations like the American Legion, fraternal groups like the Shrine and Moose clubs, local drum and bugle corps and churches have long depended on revenue from gambling, though it has been on the decline -- and not solely because of smoking. A proliferation of casinos on reservations, changes in state gambling regulations and, now, a faltering economy have all played a role.
 Some advocates of smoking bans said the costs of smoking to the state in terms of public health and productivity greatly outweighed the losses to charity. And some argue that the revenues will return in over the long run. 
 ''Around the country,'' said State Representative Thomas Huntley, Democrat of Duluth and a chief sponsor of Minnesota's Freedom to Breathe Act, ''whenever places have put in smoking bans, there is a six-month period where there is a drop in business in bars and restaurants, which is where this gambling takes place, and after that, it starts to rebound.'' 
 But bingo managers in states where bans on smoking have been in effect longer say nonsmokers cannot make up for the decline in revenues from smokers. Instead, they say, their industry has undergone a wave of forced consolidation.
 ''We actually benefited from it, but for the wrong reason -- my competition was forced to close,'' said Clyde Bock, bingo manager for the Ruth Dykeman Children's Center in Seattle.
 When Washington's ban on smoking took effect in 2005, Mr. Bock was able to partially enclose a porch where bingo players could still smoke, and he got it approved as a separate facility. ''It cost me $8,000, but it protected my customer base,'' he said. ''Other games weren't so lucky.''
 Still, revenues are down. In 2006, the bingo operation at the children's center, which then belonged to Big Brothers Big Sisters, generated about $325,000 a year, after expenses, and employed 17 people. A year later, under the auspices of the center, it produced $150,000 and employed 13 people.
 ''People underestimate the impact smoking bans will have,'' Mr. Bock said. 
 Washington used to be home to 100 bingo halls that raised money for charity. Now there are fewer than 20.
 Bret Rios, director of operations for the Blue Devils, a nonprofit drum and bugle corps in Concord, Calif., says his organization, too, has felt the effects. ''A lot of people who play bingo like to smoke,'' Mr. Rios said
 Bingo is the largest source of revenue for the Blue Devils, which operates musical groups that involve more than 500 children each year. In 2005, bingo provided $1.2 million for the organization's activities, covering more than half its costs.
 Mr. Rios said bingo revenues were down about $10,000 a month since Contra Costa County imposed more stringent restrictions on smoking in 2006. Attendance at the nightly games has fallen to about 225 on average, compared to 300 or more before the ban took effect.
 The Blue Devils had spent roughly $70,000 to create a specially ventilated separate room for smoking bingo players, which the county ordered closed under its new regulations. The organization replaced it with a covered patio in its parking lot, but smokers are not happy with it, Mr. Rios said. 
 ''You've got to get up and down, up and down, to go out and smoke,'' said Judy Aiello, 53, who has played bingo at the Blue Devils parlor for about 20 years. 
 Ms. Aiello said friends who used to play at the Concord center now went to American Indian-owned casinos or bingo parlors in the adjacent county, which has less stringent smoking restrictions than Contra Costa.
 Ms. Aiello and other smokers also spoke of tensions between smokers and nonsmokers. Some nonsmoking bingo players have complained that the smell of smoke wafts in from outside, and the Blue Devils group was recently forced to place notices at entrances, reminding smokers that the county forbid them to light up within 20 yards of doorways.
 ''Why do all the nonsmokers have all the rights and the smokers have none?'' said Rhonda Convino, 37, who smokes but has remained loyal to the Blue Devils games.
 Mr. Rios said he felt caught between a rock and a hard place.
 ''I'm not a smoker, and I'm not fond of smoking,'' he said. ''I wouldn't go to a place that smelled of smoke and spend a lot of time there. But they've gone way too far -- you know, they're even thinking about passing a law that would make it illegal to smoke in your own home.''
 Told about that idea, Representative Huntley of Minnesota chuckled. ''I don't think I'll take that idea up,'' he said. ''I'm still pulling the knives out of my back from the last time.''

HEADLINE: With First Car, a New Life in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHUANG MIAO, China 

 BODY:
Li Rifu packed a lot of emotional freight into his first car. Mr. Li, a 46-year-old farmer and watch repairman, and his wife secretly hoped a car would improve the odds of their sons, then 22 and 24, of finding girlfriends, marrying and producing grandchildren.
 A year and a half later, the plan seems to be working. After Mr. Li purchased his Geely King Kong for the equivalent of $9,000, both sons quickly found girlfriends. His older son has already married, after a short courtship that included a lot of cruising in the family car, where the couple stole their first furtive kisses.
 ''It's more enclosed, more clandestine,'' said Li Fengyang, Mr. Li's elder son, during a recent family dinner, as his bride blushed deeply.
 Western attention to China's growing appetite for automobiles usually focuses on its link to mounting dependence on foreign oil, escalating demand on natural resources like iron ore, and increasing emissions of global warming gases. 
 But millions of Chinese families, like millions of American families, do not make those connections. For them, a car is something both simpler and more complicated. 
 J. D. Power & Associates calculates that four-fifths of all new cars sold in China are bought by people who have never bought a car before -- not even a used car. That number has remained at that level for each of the last four years. By contrast, less than a tenth of new cars in the United States are purchased by people who have never bought a new car before, and fewer than 1 percent of all new cars are sold to people who have never bought a new or used car before. 
 China's explosive growth in first-time buyers is the driving force behind the country's record car sales, up more than eightfold since 2000. It is the reason China just passed Japan to become the world's second-largest car market, behind the United States. 
 One change in Chinese attitudes is already clear and likely to have broad implications worldwide: even first-time buyers are becoming more sophisticated and want better cars.
 China's domestic carmakers like Geely and Chery, once feared by Detroit and European automakers as eventual exporters to Western markets, have watched their sales gain modestly, stagnate or drop in the last year -- even while the overall Chinese market has continued to grow roughly 20 percent a year.
 The beneficiaries have been the joint ventures of multinationals that sell cars here that are designed overseas, like the Buick Excelle, Volkswagen Jetta and Toyota Camry. Practically every auto expert had expected the multinationals to lose market share rapidly to low-cost domestic automakers.
 Instead, Chinese car buyers, including first-time buyers, have become more discriminating about the comfort, styling and reliability of the cars they buy. As a result, instead of planning to conquer overseas markets, local manufacturers are having to redouble their efforts in this market. 
 ''Customers are moving up, they want the bigger, more established brands,'' said Michael Dunne, the managing director for China at J. D. Power. ''They'd rather wait, save and buy higher on the ladder instead of buying a smaller car.''
 Back in the fall of 2006, the Li family did not want to wait, especially Mr. Li. 
 When the Li family bought their car, they agreed to extensive interviews with each family member in Shuang Miao, a rural village in east-central China's Zhejiang Province. They later agreed to follow-up telephone interviews over the last year and a half and then a long family dinner in Shuang Miao last week to review their experience as first-time car owners. What emerges is a portrait of the rapidly expanding role of cars in the fast-changing ways in which China's people socialize, marry, raise families and, possibly, die.
 Li Rifu was so excited on the day that he bought his first car in September 2006 that he woke before dawn. He fixed breakfast for his wife and two grown sons, then climbed on his white motorcycle for a short trip he had been anticipating for many years.
 Mr. Li had spent most of his life here in his ancestral farm village, nestled at the base of a steep hill. The embodiment of China's version of the American dream, he is largely self-taught. He learned to fix watches, and got a job as a foreman in a coal mine in nearby Anhui Province by fixing the mine owner's watch. After saving some money, he came home to start a successful business that now employs five peasants raising flowers for landscapers.
 That September morning, Mr. Li rode down the dirt alleys of his village and over a muddy, bamboo-lined stream where local women washed clothing on rocks jutting out into the sluggish current. He reached a four-lane paved road, then a six-lane road, and puttered on to his destination in the nearby city of Taizhou: a car dealership.
 Over the course of the half-hour journey, Mr. Li was too excited to heed the persistent and unexplained pain at the base of his back.
 He had really wanted a black car. But his sons preferred white, saying that it was a more popular choice for their generation, and Mr. Li had given in before he ever set out for the dealership.
 ''Without this car, my two sons wouldn't be able to find wives -- the girls would not marry them,'' he said, recalling that when he courted his wife in the early 1980s, he needed only a bicycle. He ruined a half-dozen tires carrying her on the back of the bicycle for their outings.
 Mr. Li took a white Geely King Kong compact sedan for a short test drive, then returned to the dealership and climbed three flights of stairs to a cashier's office. He pulled a stack of currency thicker than a brick out of a black shoulder bag and paid the equivalent of $9,000 for the car; he would later pay an additional $1,000 for a license plate.
 ''The next few days, everyone will want to drive it,'' he said proudly, a prediction that proved true. Mr. Li talked of his dream of someday driving across China to visit Beijing and Tibet, while acknowledging he would need more driver's education classes before those days-long journeys would be possible.
 Car ownership helped Mr. Li bid for bigger contracts for more flowers. ''My customers said, 'Wow, you came to visit me in a car' -- it puts the negotiation on a whole different level,'' he said.
 Several months after he bought the car, Mr. Li's elder son, Fengyang, did indeed find a girlfriend, Jin Ya, a beautiful young saleswoman for China Mobile, a cellphone service. In the space of five months, they had gone to the local marriage registry and been legally wed. Today, both say they want a child someday.
 At the family dinner this week, Ms. Jin bridled at the idea that young women in China consider a man to be marriage material only if he can take them on dates in a car. 
 ''Not me, not me!'' she said passionately, before reluctantly acknowledging that ''other girls do say that you need a car.''
 But as their Geely King Kong was bringing the Li family new joy -- Mr. Li's increased business, Fengyang and Ya's courtship -- tragedy struck: Li Rifu and his wife, Chen Yanfe, were each found to have cancer.
 Ms. Chen's reproductive tract cancer has gone into remission after $7,000 in medical bills. But Mr. Li's fist-size malignant prostate cancer tumor -- which turned out to be the cause of the mysterious back pain that was bothering him when he first bought the car -- has resisted two operations and four rounds of chemotherapy. The cost: more than $40,000. 
 With payments from the local health insurance fund capped at $4,300 a person per year, Mr. Li has had to sell many of his possessions, and still he has had to go into debt. He wore a cap to the family dinner this week, self-conscious about the loss of his hair from chemotherapy. 
 In two weeks, he will go to a leading hospital in Shanghai for more surgery, a five-hour drive to the north, followed by two more rounds of chemotherapy. But he will not be going in the family car: he sold it for nearly $8,000 last year to help cover his medical expenses. 
 It is a common occurrence in this country, nominally communist, but with little or no safety net. While many families are scrambling into the middle class and buying cars, others are falling out of the middle class because of business reversals, medical bills or other problems, and are unable to buy replacements for their first car.
 Zhu Jinyung, a machinery repairman who lives close to Shuang Miao, said that his family had bought a cheap domestic car in 1994 after enjoying initial success in the plastic injection molding business. 
 ''The business didn't work out,'' and the car had to be sold, he said.
 Sadly, the Li family has known new tragedy recently. Their younger son, Fengwei, had also found a girlfriend with the help of the family car, the daughter of a manager at a large factory, an impressive person to Li Rifu. But the girlfriend's father was killed two weeks ago when a construction crane at the factory accidentally dropped its load on him after a steel pin broke.
 Despite it all, Li Rifu tries to remain optimistic. He now dreams of regaining his health, earning back the money he has spent on medical care and then -- like a growing number of his countrymen -- buying a bigger, more impressive car than the Geely compact he had to sell. 
 ''If I get another car,'' he said, ''I'll get a better-quality car, with even nicer seats and better steering.''

HEADLINE: Survivalist Spirit In Milan

BYLINE: By ALICE RAWSTHORN

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
 DARK clouds hovered above Milan in mid-April, and not just the ones that drenched the city in rain. Recession. Credit crunch. Real estate slump. None of them boding well for the world's furniture industry, whose fortunes depend on persuading the rest of us to splurge on things we don't necessarily need. 
 Yet there was barely a whiff of pessimism in the frenzied booths of the cavernous Rho-Pero fairgrounds outside Milan, or at the scores of fringe shows spread out across it, as the industry descended on the city for its most important annual event, the Milan Furniture Fair, which ran from April 16 to 21. It attracted a record 348,000 visitors, 28 percent more than last year, according to the organizer, Cosmit.
 Nor was there any shortage of new products and ventures. Many if not most of these, of course, were hatched before the recession loomed. But if orders were down last week, no one was admitting it, and manufacturers were quick to argue that any slowdown in the industry's key markets of North America and Western Europe should be countered by continued growth in emerging markets, such as China and India. 
 ''We've had a fantastic start to the year, even in the U.S., but we have to be realistic,'' said Piero Gandini, chairman of Flos, the Italian lighting company. ''Other sectors are down there, and sooner or later it could affect us, too. But Asia is still strong, and there is great potential there.'' 
 Even the political drama of Silvio Berlusconi's election victory seemed like a sideshow to the frenetic activity of the city's design scene, particularly after the fashion designer Miuccia Prada and her industrialist husband, Patrizio Bertelli, swamped the Italian media with their plans to convert a Milan distillery that's no longer in use into a vast cultural center designed by Rem Koolhaas. (Ms. Prada also upstaged the furniture crowd by giving the chicest party of the week in a spruced-up wing of the distillery, where Damien Hirst, Carsten Holler and other artists dined beneath carnival light sculptures by the German artist Andreas Slominski.)
 Back at the fair, there were few remnants of the bling-y braggadocio of last year's super-size, surreally decorative objects, at least few convincing ones. The Spanish designer Jaime Hayon did his best with a gigantic fantasy aircraft clad in Bisazza mosaic and a quilted leather chair for Established & Sons, as did the Dutch design team Studio Job, with a giant globe sparkling with thousands of Swarovski crystals. Yet even they reflected the darkening mood in more sober pieces for Moooi and Royal Tichelaar Makkum, respectively.
 The dominant theme at the fair might best be described as survivalist: in piece after piece, designers explored how they can help us (and themselves) navigate the perils of contemporary life -- in particular, the big problems of recession, environmental crisis and design's neurosis about its role in a saturated consumer culture. 
 Young designers, especially, responded to these issues by adopting a rugged, improvisational approach to design and a slightly forlorn, goth-inspired style with dark colors and fractured shapes. They made the most of materials by recycling or reimagining them, often in objects with multiple functions. Nacho Carbonell, a 27-year-old Spaniard, transformed abandoned plastic chairs into his Evolution seats-cum-cocoons by adding metal frames and coating them with papier-mache made from old newspapers. ''I wanted to make a seat where you could escape from everything,'' he said. 
 Julia Lohmann, a 30-year-old German designer based in London, set up an impromptu kelp laboratory at the design gallery Nilufar, where she made lamps from strips of seaweed. ''It's such a beautiful material that it seemed a shame not to use it,'' said Ms. Lohmann, who discovered it during a residency at Sapporo in Japan last year, and had shipped it over to Milan from there and from Ireland.
 And Maarten Baas, also 30, who rose to fame four years ago with his Smoke series of charred wooden furniture, staged one of the liveliest and most talked-about satellite shows, in a grungy Milan garage. (''We've left it exactly as we found it -- including the girlie calendars on the walls,'' he said cheerfully.) One of his menacingly cartoonish furniture pieces for Established & Sons, from a series called the Chankley Bore, shared space with a staccato collage of Chinese wooden furniture for Contrasts Gallery in Shanghai and the garage's equipment; handwritten captions identified each object.
 Even more established figures working with major European manufacturers -- Konstantin Grcic for Cassina, Flos and Plank; Hella Jongerius for Vitra; Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec for Kartell and Magis -- showed production pieces with a raw, angular aesthetic that suggested the survivalist spirit. The work seemed better suited to a rougher, tougher future than the sleek sci-fi futurism of years past.
 A FEW compelling projects struck an escapist rather than survivalist note, including two stunning collections of objects by contemporary designers using historical materials and techniques -- one for Mallett, a venerable London antiques dealership with an outpost on Madison Avenue, and the other for the Netherlands's oldest ceramics manufacturer, Royal Tichelaar Makkum.
 So many of Mallett's customers were expressing interest in contemporary design that it asked two London-based creative directors, Louise-Anne Comeau and Geoff Monge, to commission designers to develop the Meta collection, made with the materials and techniques that Mallett uses to restore 18th- and 19th-century antiques.
 The Dutch designer Tord Boontje created a fantastical wardrobe for the line, covered in 616 enameled glass fig leaves. It costs more than $500,000, but each leaf does take six hours to paint. Matali Crasset, the Paris designer, revived the Chinese metal paktong, used in European furniture in the 18th century, for a beautifully simple hanging lantern, and the British team of Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby designed their elegant Cupola table to be made at the Venini glassworks in Venice. The blue-hued steel forged in the Russian city of Tula during the late 1700s for Catherine the Great's court was reformulated for the Ivo--03 table, designed by the New York architecture firm Asymptote.
 One of the showstoppers at the fair was Royal Tichelaar Makkum's series of Delftware flower pyramids created by four Dutch designers. Each of them -- Jurgen Bey, Hella Jongerius, Studio Job and Alexander van Slobbe -- drew inspiration from a pair of 17th-century flower towers that Makkum recently restored for the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. ''The restoration was very complex,'' said Jan Tichelaar, a 13th-generation manager of the company. ''We learned so much from it that we decided to use our knowledge again.'' 
 Studio Job drew on the eccentricity of the pyramids' patterns, mixing what it called ''happy and horrible'' symbols with blasts of industrial smog. Ms. Jongerius depicted the decline of craftsmanship in a tower heavily decorated at the base, with patterns fading towards the top. 
 It took Makkum's workforce more than 6,000 hours to make all four pyramids, the most expensive of which -- Studio Job's -- costs more than $120,000. Nonetheless, Mr. Tichelaar sold the first full set on the second morning of the fair, and New Yorkers will be able to see them all at Moss in SoHo next month.
 Other venerable European manufacturers revived their own, more recent histories by raiding their archives for examples of modernist design (a move that makes commercial sense at a time when 20th-century designs are breaking records at auction, and Europeans are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from their cheaper, increasingly efficient Chinese competitors). Porro, an 83-year-old, family-run Italian company, reintroduced a sleek 1960s trolley by Bruno Munari, and the Finnish company Artek, founded in 1935, reissued mid-20th-century organic modernist pieces, including a table by Tapio Wirkkala and a lounge chair by Kaj Frank. 
 Another welcome revival came from the French silverware maker Christofle, for which the Italian architect Gio Ponti designed throughout his career. That company is bringing out 25 of the silver objects Ponti created for it between 1928 and 1978, the year before his death. Thesesculptural vases, masks and cutlery were displayed in an exhibition that ran from April 16 to the 21st at the Triennale museum in Milan.
 For all its strengths, the 2008 Milan Furniture Fair didn't quite pull off the combination of stellar commercial and fringe pieces needed for it to be a vintage event, like last year's. The problem was that too many of the new products seemed, as the New York retailer and design impresario Murray Moss put it, ''tentative.'' This might have been partly due to recessionary fears, but it was also related to one of the darkest clouds looming over Milan -- the furniture industry's struggle to meet the growing demand for sustainable products. 
 The fair was awash with ''eco'' claims, not all of which were convincing. For consumers, ''good design'' now involves more than simply good looks and functionality; they also want the reassurance that their furniture has been ethically designed, made and shipped, and that they'll be able to dispose of it responsibly. Retailers like Marks & Spencer in Britain and Wal-Mart in the United States have responded to these concerns, but manufacturers are lagging behind. 
 ''The furniture industry could be a leader in sustainable design, but it hasn't acted cleverly,'' said Mirkku Kullberg, managing director of Artek, one of the few major manufacturers to have embraced sustainability in a serious way. ''Many brands talk about it, but there is a risk of them considering it too nonchalantly.''
 The very idea of sustainability is problematic for an industry whose history is steeped in materiality and innovation. It also raises practical challenges for existing systems of sourcing, supply, production, shipping and disposal. ''Sustainability is a very important development, but it won't be easy or quick to transform the production process and the final product,'' said Matteo di Montezemolo, vice president of the Poltrona Frau Group, the Italian manufacturer, which has opened a factory to develop environmentally responsible materials and techniques.
 Still, some companies seem to have a head start. Artecnica, based in Los Angeles, unveiled Tord Boontje's Witches Kitchen cooking utensils, made from sustainable materials by artisans in Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia. (Mr. Moss was so impressed that he's rushing them to New York.) 
 And Artek showed a determined restraint with its small selection of old and new products, framed by a tower of 750 Stool 60s. (Designed 75 years ago by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, the 60 has been made in the same factory from wood grown in the same forest ever since.) Nothing tentative about that.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Tightens Curb on Smoking

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
Ending a battle of more than a year, the City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday to ban smoking on the gambling floor at all 11 Atlantic City casinos, starting on Oct. 15. 
 In a 9-to-0 vote, the Council did away with the last major loophole to a tough statewide ban on smoking in public buildings that had exempted gambling halls.
 But patrons will still be able to light up in smoking lounges away from the gambling tables and slot machines, if the individual casinos choose to build them.
 Casino workers -- many wearing T-shirts with the slogan, ''Nobody deserves to work in an ashtray'' -- burst into sustained applause when the votes were counted, and chanted: ''Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!''
 ''The employees of Atlantic City's casinos have hit a jackpot of their own tonight,'' said Dr. Arnold M. Baskies, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society in New Jersey and New York.
 ''Hard-working casino employees have been keeping Atlantic City's multibillion-dollar casino industry on a roll, but have been gambling with their lives for far too long,'' Dr. Baskies said.
 Mayor Scott Evans said he would sign the ordinance within 10 days.
 ''We're going to save lives with this,'' he said. ''People are going to be able to come here and enjoy a nice smoke-free environment.''
 More than two dozen states nationwide regulate smoking in casinos, eight ban smoking altogether in the gambling halls, and two others will impose a total ban starting in 2009, according to Karen Blumenfeld, policy director of the New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution.
 In January 2007, Atlantic City tried to pass its own law banning smoking in the casinos, but backed down under pressure from the casino industry, which claimed the measure could cost them 20 percent of their revenue and mean the loss of as many as 3,400 jobs. The City Council then enacted a compromise law restricting smoking to no more than 25 percent of the casino floor.
 But that has not worked. The smoking areas are still not walled off and separated from nonsmoking areas, as last year's law ordered, and smoke still wafts throughout the casino floor. Smokers feel persecuted, and casinos fret about losing business in an already bad economic climate, which is being worsened by the growing success of slot machine parlors in nearby Pennsylvania and New York.
 Joe Corbo, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, declined to comment on the vote.
 Kim Hesse, a Caesars dealer and opponent of smoking, predicts that when the ban takes effect there will be some drop-off in the number of smokers who come to gamble, but she feels it will be insignificant.
 ''Think back just a few years ago: You could smoke in malls, you could smoke in restaurants, you could even smoke in hospitals,'' she said. ''Now you can't, and it's become the norm. People are used to it. ''

HEADLINE: For Bronx Water Plant Being Built 10 Stories Down, a Towering Price Tag

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
In a city of big projects, it ranks among the biggest. New York City's Department of Environmental Protection is building one of the largest water filtration plants in the world in a 10-story-deep hole it blasted out of bedrock in the Bronx. When completed in 2012, the plant, capable of purifying 300 million gallons of water a day, will be buried there.
 But the plant, which will filter water from the Croton watershed in Westchester County, is no Bronx treasure chest. Even as construction moves forward, questions about soaring costs and delays continue to plague the project.
 The cost is now estimated at nearly $3 billion, a huge jump from the $660 million city officials estimated when they announced an audacious plan in 1998 to build the plant below the surface of Van Cortlandt Park. They vowed that the park would be made as good as new, even if that meant replacing whatever was lost during construction. They now plan to rebuild a driving range on top of the buried plant. 
 Some officials and others fear the final tab could climb even higher, and in the process push up water rates. On April 1, the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., announced that he was starting an independent audit to determine whether city officials understated the original price, to get the plant built in the Bronx rather than Westchester. Besides scrutinizing the complicated accounting, Mr. Thompson will have to sort through accusations by some residents and officials of deliberate distortions of costs, and intimations that the project has been tainted by mob influence, though nothing has been proved.
 His would not be the first effort at monitoring the expenses since work on the big hole began in late 2004. The city's Independent Budget Office examined the project and came up with a cost estimate last September of $2.8 billion, significantly higher than the Bloomberg administration's last previous estimate of $2.1 billion. The budget office is now comparing its cost estimate with the city's earlier projections and is expected to report on it in the next few months. 
 The city's Department of Investigation hired a law firm, Stier Anderson L.L.C., last year to monitor the progress of the construction. The law firm is now affiliated with Thacher Associates, a fraud detection company. Keith Schwam, a spokesman for the department, said the firm was keeping track ''of various contractors, subcontractors and personnel'' at the Bronx site.
 While the plant's opponents concede that it is too late to stop the work in Van Cortlandt Park, they say that shining more light on the project's financing will reveal whether there was any wrongdoing in the site selection process. 
 ''We were blindsided by the whole thing,'' said Karen Argenti, a resident of the Bronx and a longtime opponent of the project. She, like many other residents, says that city officials deliberately underestimated costs to make it seem that building the plant underground in the Bronx would be cheaper than building it above ground on land the city owns in Westchester. 
 ''Intuitively, no one ever believed that it could be cheaper to dig a huge hole and build it here,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz of the Bronx, who for more than a decade has fought against putting the plant in the borough. ''When we look back at this project years from now, it will rank up there with the Tweed Courthouse as a monument to municipal incompetence and worse.'' 
 City officials say the original figure of $660 million was the ''roughest of estimates'' and should not be used in any evaluation of true costs. They say the starting point should be the $992 million that was included in the project's final environmental impact statement in 2003. 
 ''I can understand how this comes as almost a surprise,'' said Steven W. Lawitts, first deputy commissioner of environmental protection. 
 ''Unless you spend a good part of your time tracking this market, tracking the trends,'' he continued, ''it comes across as, and often is portrayed as, the D.E.P. underestimated the project.''
 Mr. Lawitts said the $992 million estimate was in 2003 dollars, not adjusted for inflation, and was labeled as such in the document. 
 But in several places, the final environmental report, available on the department's Web site, clearly states that the $992 million estimated cost of building the filtration plant in the park was ''based on a 2.75 percent annual inflation rate.'' Community residents have accused city officials of deliberately misleading the public with contradictory explanations. 
 Mr. Lawitts said the $992 million construction cost was, in fact, not adjusted for inflation. The annual inflation rate of 2.75 percent was applied to the cost of operating the plant over 30 years. He did concede that charts in the 2003 statement were confusing and that the footnote about the inflation rate was misplaced. 
 But the inflation factor does not fully explain the cost increases. The city's explanation, outlined in several meetings with Bronx residents in the past year, is that the cost of concrete, steel and other raw materials, and the cost of labor, have gone up by as much as 14 percent since the environmental statement was completed. 
 Mr. Lawitts said that the city has continually updated its estimates, but that no one anticipated the building boom for big projects in the metropolitan region, like the sports stadiums under construction, which has driven up the prices of materials. With four more years of construction ahead, the costs may well continue to rise above even the best estimates now. 
 On the nine-acre construction site, a vast amphitheater has been blasted out of an ancient stone called Fordham gneiss (pronounced nice), which now forms the pit's 10-story-high walls. Trucks carrying concrete -- behemoths when they rumble through city streets -- look like toys inside the pit. The pipe that will bring in untreated water from the Croton reservoir system is 12 feet in diameter. The two outflow pipes have 9-foot diameters. The water will be purified in a ''stacked dissolved air flotation system''; that, said the project manager, Bernard J. Daly, is standard technology and uses several layers of filters to remove impurities, but is being done here on a gigantic scale. 
 The city was forced to build the plant because water from the Croton watershed did not meet federal standards for safety and purity. Although the Croton system can supply nearly 30 percent of the city's 1.1 billion gallons a day of drinking water, generally it supplies just 10 percent, mostly in the Bronx and northern Manhattan. The rest of the city's water comes from the Catskill Mountains and the Delaware River, and is so clean that the city last year won a 10-year exemption from federal regulations requiring that all surface drinking water be filtered. 
 Opponents of the Bronx plant have also expressed concern about the federal indictment in February of a key manager for the Schiavone Construction Company, which was the principal contractor responsible for digging the pit and putting in the water tunnels. The company's offices were raided by federal agents, who seized files, and the manager, Anthony Delvescovo, was charged with having committed extortion beginning in February 2005 -- around the time that work was beginning on the Croton project.
 Mr. Delvescovo's lawyer, Avi Moskowitz, said he would fight the charges. ''The government has produced hundreds and hundreds of hours of consensually recorded conversation, none of which involve him, and we expect that at the end of the day, when he has his day in court, he will be completely exonerated,'' Mr. Moskowitz said.
 Officials say the indictment of Mr. Delvescovo has not had any effect on the project, and the Schiavone company continues to work on the tunnels. 
 Mr. Dinowitz has called for an independent investigation by the Bronx district attorney and others into every aspect of the filtration plant, saying the cost of the project has a direct impact on water rates. Officials announced this month that they would ask for a rate increase of 14.5 percent, higher than expected, to take effect July 1. 
 ''There may be nothing here, but it smells,'' the assemblyman said. ''And the people who in the end are going to have to pay the price are the ratepayers.''

HEADLINE: Humming Praises For the Wild Bee

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
I'VE been watching the bumblebees flying around the kitchen porch of our old farmhouse in Maryland, and wondering if they have a nest nearby, maybe under the eaves. They like shady spots, protected from the wind and the rain. There are probably some mason bees, too, holed up in the old boards of the barn, or in holes drilled by wood beetles in the trunks of dead trees. 
 The bumblebee and other native wild bees are all the more important in the garden now that the population of honeybees is in such decline -- down to 2.4 million colonies last year from 5.5 million in 1945, according to the Department of Agriculture, due mainly, scientists say, to mites infesting the hives and, lately, to a mysterious epidemic called colony collapse disorder. 
 Native bees pollinate everything from pear and cherry trees to blueberries, tomatoes and eggplant. They are also fascinating to watch. 
 So the next time a bumblebee buzzes around your head, don't swat at it. Follow it around. You might see it mating, or gathering nectar and pollen and flying off to its nest. 
 There are more than 4,000 species of native bees, according to ''The Status of Pollinators in North America,'' a 2007 report by the National Research Council in Washington. 
 Their total numbers are difficult to estimate because native bees are ''hard to identify -- they're small, they fly under people's radar,'' said Scott Black, an entomologist and the executive director of the Xerces Society, an organization that studies insects. 
 But native bees are on the decline too and we need to encourage them, now that there are fewer honeybees. (The society has compared field studies from the 1950s through the 1970s with more recent studies, he said, and found ''drastic decline'' in at least three species of bumblebees: the Western bumblebee, the rusty-patched bumblebee and the yellow-banded bumblebee.) 
 The European honeybee, Apis mellifera, was brought here by the colonists in the early 1600s to make honey, said Tristram Seidler, the staff ecologist for the New England Wild Flower Society. ''Its pollination service was only recognized later on,'' he said.
 Until then, from the time the first flowering plant was pollinated by a bee 120 million years ago, native bees had been doing the job just fine. In fact, Mr. Seidler said, they are at least 10 times more efficient than honeybees.
 ''They visit more plants per hour, at a fast speed, and make pollen more available,'' he said.
 Native bees fly farther between flowers, thus doing a better job at cross-pollinating than do honeybees.
 And honeybees are at a disadvantage when it comes to certain flowers, like the blueberry. ''Its petals are joined, with a very small opening, so the bee can't even force himself inside,'' Mr. Seidler said. ''That's why buzz pollination'' -- the bumblebee's specialty -- ''is more effective.''
 Buzz pollination is a process that sounds very nice for both flower and bee: Bumblebees and some other native bees ''use their flight muscles to vibrate the flower until the pollen is shaken loose,'' Mr. Seidler said. Like honeybees, they use their middle pair of legs to gather the pollen into pollen sacks. ''You can see these on bees when they're flying by.''
 Sometimes they sit on the flower and vibrate; sometimes they hang upside down and do their thing. And when they fly off to other flowers, some of that pollen just naturally falls off and pollinates the plants.
 Mason bees don't have pollen sacks. ''They have rows of stiff hairs on their lower abdomens,'' Mr. Seidler said. ''They use their legs to pack the pollen into those hairs, so that when they're crawling around on other flowers, the sticky stigmas will get the pollen.''
 That makes them better pollinators than honeybees, he said, because they are small and can really get down into those flowers.
 Honeybees, however, build large colonies of 20,000 to 100,000 bees, so they have the numbers to pollinate huge commercial orchards or fields of tomatoes or strawberries. So growers have long rented them from commercial beekeepers, who truck in their hives, much like migrant workers, to pollinate the flowers when they open. When the job is done, they haul them out again, and the growers can spray the crops without harming the bees, which are sensitive to pesticides.
 But now growers have an economic incentive to reduce their pesticide use -- to help encourage the native bees in their area, which are not, of course, trucked in and out of their habitat.
 ''We do think that pesticides could very well be one of the stress factors on the honeybee,'' said Dennis vanEngelsdorp, the acting state apiarist with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. But as with habitat loss, another logical stress factor, it is difficult to prove a direct connection.
 Growers are also planting long strips of native plants, like lupine, poppies and goldenrod, to feed the native bees and help them flourish.
 Gardeners can do the same thing, in backyards and terraces.
 ''You need to have continuous blooming, especially in early spring and late fall,'' Mr. Seidler said. ''Plant natives with a mix of flower shapes to accommodate a variety of pollinators.'' 
 Different native bees have different life cycles, some only a few weeks long, which is why a mix of plants that bloom from spring through fall will keep a variety of bee species well fed.
 There are a few basic tenets for the bee gardener to keep in mind: First, limit the use of pesticides, or stop using them altogether. That includes spraying the lawn with herbicides.
 Provide a source of water and clay because mason bees build their nests with mud.
 ''You don't need much,'' Mr. Seidler said. ''Dig a tiny hole -- a couple shovelfuls of clay soil -- and add water every couple days. They'll find it if it's there.'' If you have no clay soil, go to an art supply store and buy some potter's clay.
 Some native bees seek out patches of bare ground, especially sandy banks that face south or east, where they can get sun. Others will nest in standing snags or dead trees, if the bark is removed. 
 They like brush piles too, particularly with hollow-stemmed plants like sumac, teasle or bamboo, which have nodes in the stems that make natural compartments for the bees.
 It's funny what happens when you start paying attention to one thing and it leads to another. 
 I haven't found out where those bumblebees outside the kitchen door are nesting. But when I sat down on an old bench in the barn to take off my garden boots, I saw a little black bee crawling into a hole in the wood. 
 I think it was a mason bee -- and I welcomed her.
 Care and Feeding of Local Bees
 You can help native bees by building them shelters. Bundle sticks of sumac and bamboo, with the open ends all going one way and the closed ends going the other. Then place the bundle where it is sheltered from the rain. 
 To make houses for mason bees, drill holes of different sizes in a block of wood. Bumblebee boxes are a bit more complicated: they resemble bird houses, but with a smaller hole, and are filled with some kind of nesting material, like cotton batting. (Instructions for building both nests are at xerces.org/Pollinator--Insect--Conservation/xerces--publications.htm.)
 Two excellent guides to bee gardening are the Xerces Society's ''Pollinator Conservation Handbook'' and ''The Wildlife Gardener's Guide'' from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
 As luck would have it, the plants bees love are pleasing to humans, too: trees and shrubs like dogwoods, sweet pepperbush, elderberries, blueberries and viburnums, especially Viburnum dentatum, V. cassionoides and V. lentago. 
 Flowers that bees like include monkshood, aster, Indigo, buckwheat, great blue lobelia, blazingstar, lupine, Virginia bluebells, penstemon and salvia.
 As for herbs, try anise hyssop, borage, marjoram, oregano and rosemary. Bees will nuzzle some exotics too, especially the old-fashioned single-flowered snapdragons, lavenders, catmints, Russian sage and speedwell.

HEADLINE: Liberty Mutual Is Bidding $6.2 Billion for Safeco

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Liberty Mutual Group said on Wednesday that it would buy the Safeco Corporation for $6.2 billion in a deal that would make Liberty Mutual the fifth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States. 
 Each share of Safeco will be exchanged for $68.25 cash, nearly a 51 percent premium to Safeco's closing stock price of $45.23 on Tuesday.
 Liberty Mutual is the sixth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States, based on its 2007 direct written premium (total premiums, not including any reinsurance premiums) of $20.2 billion. Safeco had a 2007 direct written premium of $5.9 billion.
 Liberty Mutual sells a range of insurance products, including automobile, homeowners, general liability, surety, workers compensation, assumed reinsurance and fire.
 Safeco, which provides insurance for individuals and for small and midsize businesses, would become part of Liberty Mutual's Agency Markets business unit. Combined, the organization would have about 15,000 independent agencies.
 A combination of strong balance sheets and scarce growth prospects in a slowing economy will probably lead to other deals in the property and casualty insurance industry, said Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who called the transaction a great deal for Safeco.
 The deal is subject to approval by Safeco shareholders, as well as regulatory approvals.

HEADLINE: From Cubicles in India Come Pleas for U.S. Debtors to Pay

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: GURGAON, India 

 BODY:
In a glass tower on the outskirts of New Delhi, dozens of young Indians are on the telephone, calling America's out of work, forgetful and debt-stricken and asking for cash. 
 ''Are you sure that's all you can afford?'' one operator in a row of cubicles asks politely. ''Well, how do you take care of your everyday expenses?'' presses another. 
 Americans are used to receiving calls from India for insurance claims and credit card sales. But debt collection represents a growing business for outsourcing companies, especially as the American economy slows and its consumers struggle to pay for their purchases.
 Armed with a sophisticated automated system that dials tens of thousands of Americans every hour, and puts confidential information like Social Security numbers, addresses and credit history at operators' fingertips, this new breed of collectors is chasing down late car payments, overdue credit card debt and lapsed installment loans. Debt collectors in India often cost about one-quarter the price of their American counterparts, and are often better at the job, debt collection company executives say. 
 ''India will be the only place we grow this year,'' said J. Brandon Black, the chief executive of the Encore Capital Group, a debt collection company based in San Diego. India is the company's largest operating area, with about half the company's collection force of more than 300.
 Although the stereotype of a collector may be ''some guy with chains and a cut-off shirt,'' Mr. Black said, collectors in India are ''very polite, very respectful, and they don't raise their voice.'' He added, ''People respond to that.'' 
 Companies like Encore buy bad loans from banks and credit card issuers for pennies on the dollar and pocket the cash they collect. The delinquent borrowers often owe at least a thousand dollars. 
 So far just a tiny fraction, maybe 5 percent, of American debt collection is done outside the country, industry executives estimate. But new business is in the pipeline. 
 Financial services clients are saying, ''We want you to collect my debt, to analyze it and change the way that we sell'' the loans, said Tiger Tyagarajan, executive vice president at Genpact, the business processing company spun off from General Electric that has roots in India. Genpact, which works with lenders to get customers to pay, rather than buying loans directly like Encore, employs thousands of debt collectors in India, Romania, Mexico and the Philippines, and is hiring in all those locations. 
 In the past, the prevailing wisdom about wringing money from late payers has been ''if you're calling the Midwest, you want someone from the Midwest to twist their arm,'' said Mark Hughes, an analyst with Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey who covers the industry. That theory is changing as the pool of trained phone professionals in India and other locations deepens, and companies look outside the United States for lower costs. 
 Telephone debt collection represents new, more aggressive territory for India. ''This is really a sales job,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''It is commission-intensive, and you're paid on your ability to collect.'' 
 Like many sales teams, Encore's collectors in India gather for a daily pep talk before their shift. In one recent session, they were schooled on the intricacies of American tax policy. 
 ''One hundred thirty million U.S. families will get a tax rebate this season'' as part of the new economic stimulus package, Manu Sharma, the team leader, explained to a roomful of top-earning collection agents, most in their 20s. Those who qualify for the rebates will get as much $600 a person or $1,200 a household, he said, and ''the I.R.S. is going to start paying this money in May.'' 
 Start bringing up the rebate during calls, he told them. ''This gives you an advantage so you can increase your wallet share,'' he went on. ''Get them set up on minimum balance arrangements'' based around their tax rebates. 
 Once the calls start flowing, Encore's Gurgaon office resembles nothing less than the headquarters for an enthusiastic fund-raising telethon. Just minutes after collectors have put on their headsets, a supervisor yells out ''Rajesh, for $35 a month for three months.'' All employees enthusiastically respond by clapping three times, and Rajesh is the first on the day's sales board. 
 Companies like Encore often schedule dozens of payments and make dozens of calls before the loan is paid off. 
 Encore -- which also operates as Midland Capital Management -- also files sheaves of lawsuits against customers who do not respond. Sometimes the debt is so old that the statute of limitations for filing a suit has passed, and it may already have vanished from a person's credit report. If the debtor makes a new payment, though, the statute of limitations starts all over again. 
 Credit counselors in the United States say more and more of their clients are being contacted by debt collectors based in India. Sometimes, it can cause problems. When clients ''run into someone who doesn't speak English well or there is a communication gap, it can add to the frustration of the customer,'' said Bill Druliner, manager and financial counselor for GreenPath Debt Solutions in Milwaukee. 
 Debt collection, no matter who does it, can have ''a devastating impact on people's lives,'' Mr. Druliner said, because calls can stress family relationships and sometimes debtors are pressed into paying late bills instead of buying necessities like prescriptions. Still, he said, he had not run into any specific problems with overseas debt collectors. ''What they may lack in authority or ability to handle slang, they do handle the process very well and are very well spoken,'' he said.
 Mortgage loans, which involve complex state and national laws, are nearly always handled by collectors in the United States. But credit card, auto and other debt are prime candidates for collection overseas. 
 Just over 4.5 percent of all bank credit card accounts were delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2007, according to the Federal Reserve, up from 3.5 percent two years before. Businesses in the United States put $141 billion in delinquent consumer debt up for collection in 2005, according to a PriceWaterhouseCoopers survey commissioned by an industry group, and debt collection agencies collected $51 billion that year. They kept nearly a quarter of that in profits. 
 Collection veterans are seeing an unusual phenomena in this economic downturn. ''People are walking away from their homes and hanging on to their credit cards, because that is their lifeline,'' said Rajinder Singh, the head of global analytic services for Genpact. 
 Encore hires people with call center experience in India, and then trains them in unexpected skills like sympathy. Clients ''get very abusive, very emotional, very sad,'' said Manu Rikhye, vice president at the Encore unit in Gurgaon. The collector's job is to ''try to empathize with the consumer,'' he said and try to figure out, if they're angry, why. ''Maybe it's us, maybe it's someone else,'' he said. ''You have to hear what they have to say.'' 
 Collectors are taught to handle abuse by telling debtors: ''This attitude is not going to get you anywhere. We can either work with you or refer you for further action,'' implying a lawsuit. Collectors who raise their voices or try ''tough'' tactics are warned, Mr. Rikhye said, and those who misrepresent facts can be fired. 
 Manju Muddanna, 27, who uses the name Michelle Green when she is on the phone, is one of Encore's best collectors. With laced-up stiletto sandals, wood bangles and a wad of chewing gum, she wheedles work and cellphone numbers out of debtors' relatives to track them down. Like most Encore collectors, Ms. Muddanna handles several hundred calls a day, but actually makes contact with only a handful of borrowers. 
 Ms. Muddanna's telephone voice veers to the school-marmish, her learned American accent into Blanche DuBois territory . When people on the other end of the phone mumble, she upbraids them, politely, ''Ahhh just can't understand you, ma'am.'' 
 Encore pays its collectors in India an average base salary of 17,000 rupees ($425) a month, and they earn bonuses -- sometimes more than $1,000 a month -- for getting customers to pay. In contrast, collectors in the United States, make about $6,500 a month. Thanks to the income, a windfall in India, where the average monthly income is $63, collectors are amassing some of the status symbols that probably got their clients into trouble in the first place -- new scooters, iPods, Swatch watches and exotic vacations.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about American debt collection companies that are outsourcing the work to other countries misidentified, in some editions, the employer of Rajinder Singh, who commented on the trend. He works for Genpact, which employs thousands of debt collectors in India and other countries -- not GenTech.

HEADLINE: Video Links North Koreans To Syria Reactor, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After seven months of near-total secrecy, the White House is preparing to make public on Thursday video evidence of North Koreans working at a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor just before it was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike last September.
 Until now, the administration has refused to discuss the video or the attack, other than in a highly classified briefing for a few allies and crucial members of Congress. 
 But senior officials in Israel and the United States have said the target was a nascent nuclear reactor that had been under construction for years. Israeli and American analysts had concluded that it was loosely modeled on the reactor North Korea used to obtain the fuel for its small nuclear weapons arsenal. 
 Israeli jets destroyed the site on Sept. 6, and the Syrians, after issuing some protests, bulldozed the area and constructed a building on the exact footprint of the old one. They have refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location.
 The timing of the administration's decision to declassify information about the Syrian project has raised widespread suspicions, especially in the State Department, that Vice President Dick Cheney and other administration hawks were hoping that releasing the information might undermine a potential deal with North Korea that would take it off an American list of state sponsors of terrorism.
 ''Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,'' said one senior administration official who would not speak on the record because the White House and the State Department have declared there would be no public comment until the evidence is released. ''And that's just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.'' 
 But another senior official said it was possible that the revelations would force the North Koreans to describe their actions in Syria more fully when they issued a long delayed declaration of their nuclear activities.
 That proposed deal, negotiated by Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and the primary interlocutor with North Korea, has become the latest battleground in a seven-year struggle within the Bush administration over North Korea policy.
 That policy has veered from efforts to squeeze North Korea in hopes that the government of Kim Jong-il will collapse, to negotiating with the country alongside Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, each of which has pursued a somewhat different approach toward the North. 
 Mr. Hill was put in charge of the talks more than three years ago in the hope of finding a new way to deal with the North Koreans. But support for him has wavered, and President Bush has repeatedly warned aides not to agree to anything that ''makes me look weak,'' according to former officials who sat in on meetings with him on North Korea.
 Mr. Cheney's office and other conservatives have argued that Mr. Hill's proposed deal would amount to a huge concession. In return for a minimal declaration from North Korea -- an accounting of how much plutonium it has produced -- it would be removed from the terrorism list and would no longer be subject to economic sanctions under the Trading With the Enemy Act.
 North Korea has refused to say what, exactly, it provided to the Syrians, or what happened to an effort to start a second pathway to building arms, using uranium. 
 The deal would allow the North to continue to fudge on those matters, leaving unexplained the question of why it appeared to be buying uranium enrichment equipment from Pakistan. That equipment, many experts believe, was intended to help North Korea build a second path to a bomb, in case it was forced to give up its plutonium program.
 In a presentation on Thursday to crucial members of Congress, and then in a presentation to reporters, American intelligence officials are expected to show images from a video, believed to have been obtained through Israeli intelligence services. The video, which Mr. Hill has shown to senior South Korean officials, shows Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant.
 Other pictures, officials say, show what appears to be the construction of a reactor vessel inside the building that Israel later destroyed. It is unclear what the administration is willing to release. Syria's ambassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha, did not answer messages left for him on Wednesday. 
 For weeks after the Israeli attack in September, neither Israeli nor American officials would talk about the attack, Israel's first on a nuclear site since the 1981 attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.
 When The New York Times published a lengthy account of the Syria attack on Oct. 14, revealing that Israeli and American analysts judged that the target was a partly constructed nuclear reactor, Mr. Bush and the White House refused to answer questions about it. Later, officials said they feared that the Syrians would retaliate against Israel if they felt publicly humiliated. 
 It is not clear what has changed, apart from the politics of the moment. Mr. Hill's boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has not voiced strong support for Mr. Hill's effort to coax the North Koreans along, granting them rewards for steps along the way to compliance with a deal that calls, ultimately, for the country to give up its weapons.
 Ms. Rice has been a strong critic of the 1994 agreement between North Korea and the Clinton administration, complaining that it was ''front loaded'' with rewards for the North.
 That is exactly what critics say she and Mr. Hill have done in the most recent agreement. But Mr. Hill has argued in private that the Syrian episode and the uranium enrichment are side shows, and that the critical issue is stopping North Korea from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has. But his State Department colleagues say that he has been told not to defend the deal, or even explain it.
 ''He's feeling pretty abandoned by Rice and Bush,'' one of his colleagues said Wednesday. Mr. Hill did not respond to messages.

HEADLINE: Warehouse Stores Restrict Rice Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The two biggest warehouse retail chains, Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale, are limiting how much rice customers can buy. 
 Sam's Club is a division of Wal-Mart Stores, but the broader chain has no plans to limit food purchases. 
 American rice futures are hitting record highs amid global food inflation, although one rice expert said the warehouse chains might be reacting less to any shortages than to stockpiling by restaurants and small stores.
 Sam's Club declined to say if this was first time it had restricted sales of bulk foods. The limits affect 20-pound bags, not retail-size portions. Costco could not immediately be reached for comment on its limits, which affect bulk purchases in some stores.
 Sam's Club said it would limit customers to four bags at a time of imported jasmine, basmati and long-grain white rice.
 A Sam's Club spokeswoman, Kristy Reed, said she could not comment on whether the problem had been caused by short supplies or by customers stocking up in anticipation of higher prices.
 A USA Rice Federation spokesman, David Coia, said there was no rice shortage in the United States. A smaller chain, BJ's Wholesale Club, said it was not imposing limits for now.

HEADLINE: McClatchy Reports Loss on Ad Sales Slump

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
McClatchy posted a net loss on Wednesday because plunging advertising sales hurt newspapers in some of its most important markets. The company also said the ad slump would continue in the second quarter. 
 McClatchy said it would buy back for cash up to $250 million of its public debt, much of which it took on in its ill-timed purchase of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain in 2006.
 The shares fell 6.4 percent, to $8.30, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 ''We do understand that we face a double-barreled challenge of both the structural shift as the Internet takes share from existing media, including newspapers, and the economic downturn,'' the chief executive, Gary B. Pruitt, said in a conference call. ''And we understand that the economic downturn is not permanent. It is short term, but nonetheless painful.''
 McClatchy publishes the Bee newspapers in Sacramento, Fresno and Modesto, Calif., and The Miami Herald. Both California and Florida have been hard hit by the real estate crisis, posing serious problems for newspaper publishers like McClatchy, Media General and the Tribune Company.
 Those two states account for a third of McClatchy's ad revenue, but were responsible for 56 percent of its decline in the quarter, McClatchy said.
 The first-quarter net loss was $849,000, or 1 cent a share, in contrast to a year-ago net profit of $9 million, or 11 cents a share.
 McClatchy reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.6 million, or 2 cents a share, short of Wall Street expectations of 4 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Revenue declined 13.8 percent, to $488.3 million, below analysts' expectations of $493.1 million on average.
 First-quarter ad revenue fell 15.3 percent, to $404 million, from last year. Circulation revenue fell 5.6 percent, to $67.9 million.
 Online advertising rose 10.6 percent in the first quarter compared with last year, Mr. Pruitt said.
 McClatchy also said that cash expenses fell 10.5 percent because of staff reductions and lower newsprint costs, among other things.

Signs of a consumer slowdown abound in the United States, but Apple customers appear not to have noticed. 
 Buoyed by unusually strong Macintosh sales, the company grew notably faster than the rest of the computer market worldwide in the first three months of the year. Revenue increased 43 percent from the same period a year ago, the company reported. Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, characterized the quarter as the strongest in Apple's history.
 He attributed the growth to higher traffic in the company's 181 stores in the United States. The company reported that it had 33.7 million visitors to its stores in the United States, up 57 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Mr. Jobs said that belied the gloom that was being expressed about the American economy. 
 ''We're not economists, so we don't have any more insight than everyone else, but there were sure a lot of people in our stores last quarter,'' Mr. Jobs said in an interview.
 Despite new products like the iPhone, variations of the iPod and the Apple TV set-top box, this was a Macintosh quarter. Apple shipped 2.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, 51 percent more than in the quarter a year ago. Revenue on those computers increased 54 percent. 
 But it also said it sold 10.6 million iPods during the quarter, flat with the year-ago quarter. Analysts said iPod sales were within their expectations and that it was a sign that the product category was maturing, 
 ''The big question was, would Apple really feel the pinch from a weakening U.S. consumer? And the somewhat unequivocal answer was, no, not yet,'' said A. M. Saggonaghi Jr., a senior analyst at Bernstein Research
 Apple said that net income in its second quarter rose 36 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $1.05 billion or $1.16 a share, on revenue of $7.51 billion.
 The results far exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.07 cents a share and revenue of $6.96 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.
 The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also forecast strong sales in the coming months. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, said the company expected third-quarter revenue of about $7.2 billion and earnings of about $1 a share.
 Apple's stock has declined 17.9 percent since the beginning of January when it peaked near $200 a share. After drifting below $120 a share, the stock has begun to recover since March. Shares on Wednesday closed up, rising $2.69 to $162.89, but then declined 26 cents, to $162.63 in after-hours trading over concerns that Apple's profit margins were weaker than analysts expected.
 If there is a weak spot in the company's battle plan, it may be the iPhone smartphone, which has had stellar sales in the United States, but has showed weakness in Europe. Apple said it sold 1.7 million iPhones for the quarter. ''In my mind iPhone sales were soft,'' said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. ''It's a question of the distribution model and of the price. The price clearly has to come down.''
 Apple's executives said the sales of iPhones exceeded internal company projections during the quarter.
 Analysts and the industry are expecting Apple to introduce a higher performing version of the iPhone within the next two months, made for faster 3G data-oriented cellular networks. Mr. Jobs is under pressure to meet his 10 million iPhone sales forecast by the end of 2008. To meet that goal the company needs a second-generation iPhone, and it may also need to push the price of the existing $399 iPhone down significantly or introduce a stripped-down model.
 Analysts have said that as the second quarter progressed, demand for Apple's iPhone increased and that the computer maker was unable to keep up with demand. The supply issue could have been affected by the limited availability of 16-gigabyte flash memory chips, Mr. Wolf speculated. 
 He said that the more interesting story for the quarter may be the gains that Apple is making in PC market share, predominantly in the laptop computer segment. 
 International Data Corporation's survey this month showed Apple with a 6 percent share of the American market in the first quarter, compared with 4.9 percent a year ago. Apple's strong Macintosh growth comes as Microsoft struggles with its Windows Vista operating system, which was released last year to largely critical reviews. ''I think people are really noticing the difference between Mac OS X and Windows to a greater degree than ever before,'' Mr. Jobs said. ''The more people understand that there is an alternative, the more people are choosing a Mac.''
 On Wednesday, Apple confirmed that it had acquired PA Semi, a Silicon Valley chip company with expertise in low-power microprocessors, an essential technology for future iPhones. Forbes.com first reported the acquisition, which it said was for $278 million in cash. Neither company disclosed the amount of the deal. 
 The chip maker had originally hoped to supply Apple with chips intended for a microprocessor used in earlier Macintosh computers and by I.B.M. However, when Apple began using Intel microprocessors for the Macintosh, PA Semi was left without a major customer.
 The decision to buy PA Semi is likely to be a blow to Intel, which recently introduced a new low-power chip called Atom.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves $15 Billion Foreclosure Bill

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democrats pushed a $15 billion housing bill through a House committee Wednesday over the objections of Republicans, who called it a government bailout.
 The measure would send federal loans and grants to cities and counties hit hardest by the housing crisis so they could buy and fix up foreclosed properties. It passed the Financial Services Committee 38-26, mostly along party lines. 
 Democrats said it would prevent blight in distressed neighborhoods, but the Bush administration and Republicans view it as a government giveaway for lenders and speculators that could lead to even more foreclosures.
 The plan is aimed at complementing a broader housing overhaul package whose centerpiece would let hundreds of thousands of struggling homeowners refinance into more affordable, government-insured loans. That bill is expected to get a committee vote next week, and both measures are expected to move through the House the week after.
 The bill approved Wednesday would provide $15 billion, half in loans and half in grants, to states with high foreclosure rates. Money would go to the most populous cities and counties based on their foreclosure rates, and to smaller towns that are severely affected. Low- and middle-income neighborhoods would be a priority and aid would be focused on the poorest people and those who had already lost their homes to foreclosure.
 Republicans said the measure was too costly and would not help homeowners.
 ''The principal beneficiaries of this type of plan would be private lenders who now own the vacant and foreclosed properties,'' said Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.
 The measure could become ensnared in a broader partisan dispute over whether to provide another economic rescue package on the heels of the tax rebate plan President Bush signed in February. Democrats contend a ''second stimulus,'' including items like housing assistance, a jobless benefits extension and food and heating aid for the poor, is needed. But Bush and congressional Republicans are loath to embrace more spending.
 Only three Republicans -- two from Ohio, stricken with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country -- crossed party lines to back the plan.
 The Financial Services panel also approved a bill Wednesday designed to encourage lenders to help struggling homeowners transition into more affordable mortgages.
 That bipartisan measure, offered by Representative Michael N. Castle, a Delaware Republican, and Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat, would shield mortgage holders from legal liability if they took a loss to allow a borrower to refinance. It is designed to address a fear among those who bundle mortgages into securities that investors will sue them if they modify the loans.

HEADLINE: For Indiana Voters, Talk Of Change May Fall Flat

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Amanda Cox contributed reporting from New York, and Kitty Bennett from Washington.

DATELINE: KOKOMO, Ind. 

 BODY:
With all the talk among the Democratic presidential hopefuls about change, they may wish to consider this as they wander Indiana: People here practically revolted a few years ago when their governor, Mitch Daniels, pushed to change to daylight saving time like most of the country.
 Change, it seems, may not carry quite the same political magic in this state as it has elsewhere. 
 ''We hold onto a lot of traditional values,'' said Brian L. Thomas, 39, as he bought a cup of coffee along the courthouse square here on Wednesday. ''Saying you're ready to change is probably not the best or only thing you would want to say around these parts. Frankly, we want it to be like it used to be.''
 Many of the two dozen voters interviewed in this central Indiana manufacturing city of 46,000 expressed queasiness over the notions of change that both Democratic candidates have proudly pledged elsewhere. Though residents bemoaned economic conditions that have taken away thousands of factory jobs and given the state the 11th-highest rate of foreclosures, they also said they worried about doing things -- anything -- very differently.
 ''What are we going to change to?'' asked Ron O'Bryan, 58, a retired auto worker who said he was still trying to decide which Democrat to vote for in the May 6 primary. ''You mean change to some other country's system? What do you think they mean?''
 Jeremy Lewis, a 28-year-old window washer, said simply, ''Old-fashioned can be in a good way.''
 As the Democratic presidential hopefuls turned to Indiana as a new battleground in the fight for the nomination, they find themselves facing a different audience in places like Kokomo, a blue-collar city in the middle of endless expanses of farms north of Indianapolis. In some ways, these are voters not so unlike those in other Rust Belt states, like Pennsylvania, but with an added dose of nostalgia and a practical, Midwestern sensibility.
 ''We are manufacturing workers, farmers, beer drinkers, gun owners, pickup drivers,'' said Karen Lasley, 64, who was volunteering on Wednesday morning in Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's field office in Kokomo (one of 28 Mrs. Clinton has opened around the state along with Senator Barack Obama's 22, including one just down the street). ''We are full of pride for this country.''
 Politically, though, Indiana is by no means monolithic: its terrain is more of a quilt, as elaborate as its tangled time-zone map, complicating matters for the campaigns as they decide where to devote time and money.
 Northwest Indiana, often viewed as an extension of suburban Chicago and sharing Chicago's television market, is seen as strong territory for Mr. Obama, who lives on the South Side of Chicago. Indianapolis, the state capital, which includes a large segment of Indiana's 9 percent African-American population, is also expected to lean toward Mr. Obama. In the blue-collar, rural parts south of Indianapolis, where the residents often have stronger links to Kentucky than to Illinois (or even Indiana), Mrs. Clinton is expected to have the advantage.
 As with so many recent primaries, no one -- here or elsewhere -- ever anticipated that Indiana's presidential primary would matter much. For 40 years, the primary here has come too late, so the change comes as a shock to voters who rarely had seen presidential campaign advertisements, to political organizers and to overwhelmed election registrars. 
 And unlike some other states, including Pennsylvania, Indiana has mostly been ignored in general elections, too. It has long been written off by both parties as so reliably Republican in presidential races as to not be worth much note. After 1936, a Democratic presidential candidate has won the general election here only once, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.
 ''Every year, two minutes after our polls close, they declare Indiana for the Republicans and that's that,'' Bob Stephenson, the local Democratic chairman said. ''This is really something special to have people listening.''
 There are 72 delegates at stake, and this is an open primary; in practice, anyone may choose a Democratic ballot, though state officials say technically there is a provision allowing voters to be challenged if they are believed to be switching party affiliations at the polls. Some 4.3 million voters are registered in the state, including 200,000 new voters this year. More than 50,000 people have already cast ballots in early voting.
 Mr. Stephenson has fretted over whether there will be enough ballots printed here to handle the expected onslaught of voters and has struggled to find enough poll workers who are not already volunteering for the Clinton or Obama campaigns. 
 Around the state, the candidates are battling for endorsements. Lee H. Hamilton, the former congressman, has endorsed Mr. Obama, while Mrs. Clinton has the support of Senator Evan Bayh, and Dan Parker, the state party chairman. Some political analysts here, though, played down the significance of the state party's political apparatus for getting out the vote. 
 Even Greg Goodnight, the new mayor of Kokomo, said he had been astonished by the telephone calls he had been getting lately: Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton each sought his blessing. He shows visitors a separate letter from former President Bill Clinton, still in its envelope, on his desk, but he has yet to take sides. 
 Mr. Goodnight and others here say the race is certain to hinge on the economy. Indiana has lost about one in six of its manufacturing jobs since 2001, and Kokomo has similarly struggled. One plant here employed 300 people not long ago, Mr. Goodnight said; today, 20 workers tend to a warehouse of products imported from other countries.
 ''Indiana and Kokomo are a good reflection of the rest of the country,'' said Mr. Goodnight, a Democrat who once worked in a factory and whose office bookshelf includes a biography of Harry S. Truman; ''Dude, Where's My Country?'' by Michael Moore; and the Bible. ''Places like Kokomo cannot handle even four more years of these economic policies.'' 
 Everyone in this town -- everyone of a certain age, at least -- seems to remember exactly where they were the last time a presidential primary election in this state counted for anything. Some recall skipping class or slipping out of work. The year was 1968, and the eventual winner, Robert F. Kennedy, came right through Kokomo and spoke on the courthouse square.

HEADLINE: Fresh Off Pennsylvania Victory, Clinton Raises Millions, Mostly Online

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JOHN M. BRODER; Jeff Zeleny reported from New Albany, and John M. Broder from Indianapolis.

DATELINE: NEW ALBANY, Ind. 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's fund-raising roared to life on Wednesday, with her campaign collecting $10 million in the hours after she won the Pennsylvania primary, and the fresh infusion of cash immediately went to helping her mount a vigorous fight in Indiana, the next primary state.
 Senator Barack Obama, relying on an already strong financial advantage, barely mentioned his Democratic rival -- or his defeat -- as he filmed new television commercials here, reassured superdelegates that he was still the front-runner and deployed scores of campaign workers to Indiana, North Carolina and the half-dozen other states that remain on the primary calendar. 
 Mr. Obama said Democrats should be concerned that ''there's been some time lost'' in turning the party's focus to Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. But he said again and again that Mrs. Clinton was trailing in pledged delegates and the popular vote and that he would fight through the nine remaining contests ''to wrap up this nomination as quickly as possible.''
 Mrs. Clinton's overnight fund-raising success, however, gave her the means to compete on a more level field with Mr. Obama. Campaign officials said they raised $10 million in online donations in the 24 hours after her Pennsylvania victory, the campaign's best one-day money haul. The contributors included at least 70,000 new donors, the officials said.
 While Mr. Obama had started April with more than $40 million, Mrs. Clinton's campaign was essentially broke, with millions of dollars in debt. Her dire financial straits had threatened to derail her campaign before her nine-point victory in Pennsylvania allowed her to make a fresh case to voters and party leaders that she would be the strongest Democratic presidential nominee.
 The Clinton campaign was scrambling to milk the jump in contributions, transforming its home page to a donation page, something it had experimented with for several days last month with great success.
 Indiana, like North Carolina, holds its primary on May 6. Mrs. Clinton is seeking to replicate her campaigns from Ohio and Pennsylvania to win over voters there who share many similarities and concerns. She arrived in Indianapolis on Wednesday sharply focused on the economy, by far the chief concern of Democratic voters across the country, according to exit polls. She promised that as president she would deliver ''jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs'' across the Rust Belt, which has seen a severe erosion of manufacturing jobs in recent decades.
 A senior Clinton aide said that she would tailor her message in Indiana to appeal to lower-income workers in the cities and to voters in rural areas and small towns.
 The aide said Mrs. Clinton would continue to raise questions about Mr. Obama's readiness to face the many economic and national security challenges facing the country. He did not rule out running some version of an advertisement that the campaign ran in the final days of the Pennsylvania race showing images of the Great Depression, Pearl Harbor and Osama bin Laden and questioning Mr. Obama's fitness to lead in perilous times.
 She has two advertisements on the air in Indiana, both focusing on trade and the loss of jobs.
 Her campaign is also circulating fliers in Indiana criticizing Mr. Obama's health care plan, claiming that it would leave 15 million Americans uncovered, a claim Mr. Obama disputes.
 As they campaigned Wednesday in Indiana, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama intensified their vigorous behind-the-scenes fight for superdelegates, with them and their surrogates making calls to win over people who are uncommitted or suddenly unsure of whom to support.
 Mr. Obama drew the support of Gov. Brad Henry of Oklahoma, who said squabbling among Democrats would ''be disastrous for the party.'' A superdelegate from Nebraska also endorsed Mr. Obama, as did a group of supporters of former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, while Mrs. Clinton received new support from one superdelegate.
 Mr. Obama argued that he had made progress in the Pennsylvania primary, despite his defeat. And he sought to play down questions about whether he can win in the general election, claiming that he would draw support from independent voters and Republicans eager for a change in Washington.
 ''Don't worry about the party being divided in November,'' Mr. Obama told voters in this southeastern Indiana town. ''The Democratic Party is going to recognize, as soon as we have a nominee, that there is too much at stake for us to be divided.''
 While polls show Mr. Obama comfortably ahead in North Carolina, polls in Indiana indicate that the race is tight, with each candidate enjoying countervailing advantages. Mr. Obama is from neighboring Illinois and is better known in Indiana than in many other states because of the overlap of media markets. Mrs. Clinton begins with a sizable base of middle- and lower-income, less-educated voters that have rallied behind her elsewhere in the Midwest, and she has been working to expand her appeal to higher-income suburbanites, according to party officials here.
 Sarann Warner, the vice-chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Hamilton County, in suburban Indianapolis, said there had been a surge in Democratic Party registration in the county, long a Republican bastion.
 ''Democrats are coming out of the woodwork,'' she said, adding that she had no idea whether they were Clinton or Obama supporters. She said she was neutral in the contest.
 Kip Tew, a former state Democratic Party chairman who supports Mr. Obama, said 150,000 new voters had registered as Democrats since January. He said Indiana was unique politically and geographically, but more like Ohio and Missouri than Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama narrowly won the Missouri primary while Mrs. Clinton won in Ohio by 10 points. Mr. Tew said that he expected Mrs. Clinton to run strongly in small towns and rural areas. 
 ''It's hard to predict how they will vote,'' he said. ''People have consistently underestimated the power of the Clinton brand in Democratic politics.''

HEADLINE: For Democrats, Questions Over Race and Electability

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Jeff Zeleny and Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Reflecting on her victory in the Pennsylvania primary, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday neatly summed up the chief political rationale of her enduring candidacy.
 ''I won the states that we have to win -- Ohio, now Pennsylvania,'' Mrs. Clinton said on CNN about her successes over Senator Barack Obama, in one of her six appearances on morning news shows. ''It's very hard to imagine a Democrat getting to the White House without winning those states.''
 Mrs. Clinton says her popularity among blue-collar workers, women and Hispanics makes her the candidate to beat Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, in the swing states that decide presidential races. Along with Ohio and Pennsylvania, she also cites her success in Michigan and Florida -- even though the Democratic Party disqualified those contests, and Mr. Obama was not on the Michigan ballot -- to claim an edge in crucial battlegrounds. 
 Yet for all of her primary night celebrations in the populous states, exit polling and independent political analysts offer evidence that Mr. Obama could do just as well as Mrs. Clinton among blocs of voters with whom he now runs behind. Obama advisers say he also appears well-positioned to win swing states and believe he would have a strong shot at winning traditional Republican states like Virginia.
 According to surveys of Pennsylvania voters leaving the polls on Tuesday, Mr. Obama would draw majorities of support from lower-income voters and less-educated ones -- just as Mrs. Clinton would against Mr. McCain, even though those voters have favored her over Mr. Obama in the primaries.
 And national polls suggest Mr. Obama would also do slightly better among groups that have gravitated to Republican in the past, like men, the more affluent and independents, while she would do slightly better among women.
 Mr. Obama may lead in the national popular vote and among delegates needed to win the nomination, but his inability to ''close the deal'' with voters -- a phrase Mrs. Clinton skewered him with Tuesday -- has been widely discussed in light of the Pennsylvania results. Mr. Obama found himself on the defensive over the issue Wednesday, and he countered that the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania had worked their political networks on behalf of Mrs. Clinton.
 ''Among all these groups that people have been focused on -- blue-collar workers, white working-class folks -- we did better in Pennsylvania than we did in Ohio, so we're continually making progress,'' Mr. Obama told reporters in Indiana, which holds its primary on May 6. ''If you look at these states that I'm supposed to win, if you look at the polling, I actually do if not as well then better than Senator Clinton relative to Senator McCain.''
 In recent weeks, Clinton advisers have been challenging Mr. Obama's electability in a general election, and her victories in Ohio and Pennsylvania are perhaps her best evidence yet to argue that she is better suited to build a coalition across income, education and racial lines in closely contested states.
 But the Pennsylvania exit polls, conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for five television networks and The Associated Press, underscore a point that political analysts made on Wednesday: that state primary results do not necessarily translate into general election victories.
 ''I think it differs state to state, and I think either Democrat will have a good chance of appealing to many Democrats who didn't vote for them the first time,'' said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not affiliated with either campaign. ''Take Michigan. It has a Democratic governor, two Democratic senators, and many Democratic congressmen, so it's probably going to be a pretty good state for the Democrats in a recession year.''
 Mr. Hart, as well as Obama advisers, also say that Mr. Obama appears better poised than Mrs. Clinton to pick up states that Democrats struggle to carry, or rarely do, in a general election, like Colorado, Iowa, Missouri and Virginia, all of which he carried in the primaries. Obama advisers say their polling indicates he is more popular with independents, and far less divisive than Mrs. Clinton, in those states.
 ''Hillary goes deeper and stronger in the Democratic base than Obama, but her challenge is that she doesn't go as wide,'' Mr. Hart said. ''Obama goes much further reaching into the independent and Republican vote, and has a greater chance of creating a new electoral map for the Democrats.''
 Indeed, if Mr. Obama does become the first African-American nominee of a major party, the electoral landscape of the South could be transformed with the likelihood of strong turnout of black voters in Republican-leaning states like Georgia and Louisiana, which Mr. Obama carried this winter. (Mrs. Clinton has also argued that, given the Clinton roots, she could put at least Arkansas in play in the fall.)
 Obama advisers have also argued that swing states like Ohio are winnable this fall because they have been increasingly leaning Democratic and have been struggling economically under President Bush. Indeed, some Obama allies hope he will pick Ohio's popular governor, Ted Strickland, as his running mate if he wins the nomination, both to help carry Ohio and to unify the party (Mr. Strickland is supporting Mrs. Clinton).
 And the record-setting voter registrations among both Democrats and independents across the nation also suggest that each candidate is capable of stirring excitement among voters in the fall and would be positioned to defend their bases of support against Mr. McCain, who is a popular figure among many independents and some Democrats.
 Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a strong backer of Mr. Obama, said she believed that the thousands of new voters being drawn into the primaries would coalesce around the Democratic nominee once the candidate and the party begin to define Mr. McCain better on issues like the war.
 ''I think that will turn the tide for the people who are going in that direction,'' Ms. DeLauro said of Democrats who have said they could not vote for Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton.
 But Clinton supporters come back to the fact that Mr. Obama has had months of primaries -- as well as a sharp fund-raising advantage -- with which to beat Mrs. Clinton in more swing voter groups, and yet has failed. Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, said he saw her economic message as resonating more strongly with working-class voters than Mr. Obama's.
 ''She is connecting better with some of these blue-collar Democrats, the base of the party,'' Mr. McGovern said.

Senator John McCain walked in the literal footsteps of President Lyndon B. Johnson on Wednesday as he stood near the now-abandoned Appalachian front porch where Johnson declared a war on poverty. Forty-four years later, Mr. McCain said, ''We have a lot to do.''
 Mr. McCain, who was on the third day of a weeklong tour of America's ''forgotten places,'' held out the promise of better Internet service and job training in community colleges to this economically depressed coal-mining town of less than 650 people. 
 While he offered few other poverty-fighting specifics in a speech that was largely focused on trying to connect to voters in one of the poorest parts of the United States, he sought to project himself to independents and moderate Democrats across the country as a different kind of Republican.
 His camera crew recorded much of the day for future campaign commercials.
 ''I cannot claim that the circumstances of our lives are similar in every respect,'' Mr. McCain told an exuberant crowd packed into an upstairs room of the Martin County Courthouse, which had been painted and freshened up with flowers for the occasion. ''I'm not the son of a coal miner. I wasn't raised by a family that made its living from the land or toiled in a mill or worked in the local schools or health clinic. I was raised in the United States Navy, and after my own naval career, I became a politician. My work isn't as hard as yours.''
 But Mr. McCain told the crowd that ''you are my compatriots,'' and added, ''that means more to me than almost any other association.''
 Mr. McCain, who was in the county seat of the largely Republican Martin County, also jumped at the chance at a town-hall-style meeting after his speech to take another political swipe at one of his Democratic competitors, Senator Barack Obama, for making what Mr. McCain again called ''elitist remarks.'' Mr. McCain was referring to comments Mr. Obama made in San Francisco this month that people in small towns ''cling'' to guns or religion because they have become bitter about their economic circumstances.
 At the meeting, Mr. McCain was asked by Brandon Smith, a Republican state senator from Hazard, what he thought of Mr. Obama's comments. Mr. McCain quickly turned the question back to his fellow politician.
 ''Do you think those comments reflect the views of your constituents?'' Mr. McCain asked.
 ''I think it reflects the comments of somebody who doesn't understand this neck of the woods,'' Mr. Smith replied, to big applause and loud whistles.
 Mr. McCain concluded, ''I think those are elitist remarks, to say the least.''
 In his formal remarks, Mr. McCain distinguished himself from Johnson as a Republican who would not turn solely to government for solutions to poverty. ''I have no doubt President Johnson was serious and had the very best of intentions when he declared the war on poverty in America,'' Mr. McCain said. ''But the army that he enlisted was mostly drawn from the ranks of government bureaucracies.''
 In contrast, Mr. McCain called for a ''People Connect Program'' that would provide tax breaks to private companies and federal loans and low-interest bonds to small towns to help provide high-speed Internet service to isolated communities like Inez -- a way, he said, ''to knit together all of the United States with 21st-century information networks'' that ''will make location less of a factor in the potential for economic success.''
 Afterward, at least one Democrat in what appeared to be a majority Republican crowd said she liked what she heard.
 ''Oh, I just loved him, he gave all the right answers,'' said Greta Ward, 39, a Martin County magistrate, who said she would vote for Mr. McCain if Mr. Obama was the Democratic nominee and for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton if Mr. Obama was not. Asked about her misgivings about Mr. Obama, Ms. Ward replied, ''He views things differently.''
 After his remarks at the courthouse, Mr. McCain went on a minivan tour of the surrounding countryside, including the porch of the onetime Inez resident Tom Fletcher, Johnson's site for his antipoverty speech.
 At least one of the locals was disappointed in Mr. McCain's decision to stop at the house, which now has a ''No Trespassing'' sign on the porch railing and a padlock on the front door.
 ''The war on poverty is in our past,'' Eric Mills, an Inez city commissioner, told reporters who were traveling with him in a car behind Mr. McCain's minivan.

 Re ''Clinton Clearly Outduels Obama in Pennsylvania'' (front page, April 23):
 Let's see. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign is very short of funds. You report that Barack Obama ''took in $42 million in March to her $21 million.'' And he more than doubled Mrs. Clinton's budget on television advertising in the weeks before the Pennsylvania primary.
 But on the morning after, against such great odds, Mrs. Clinton has won that same primary by 10 percentage points, 55 to 45 percent. 
 Doesn't that say anything about which of these candidates has the better chance of winning in November? Hint: It isn't Mr. Obama. Robert Morris
 Brooklyn, April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''The Bruising Will Go On for the Party, Too'' (news analysis, front page, April 23) says that Hillary Rodham Clinton's substantial victory over Barack Obama in Pennsylvania, thus continuing the battle, is believed by many Democrats to hurt their (our) election chances against John McCain. 
 But I, as a Democrat, would rather find out now rather than later who would be the weaker candidate for the general election, given the advertisements and speeches I expect from the Republicans. 
 I would love to see the battle go on until the Democratic National Convention, restoring what conventions used to be, with the general public enthralled with the discussion. 
 Then, and only then, the superdelegates should do what they were set up to do -- decide who the better candidate is to represent the Democratic Party in the general election.

 Re ''The Low Road to Victory'' (editorial, April 23):
 Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton never liked it when Republicans used the politics of personal destruction in an effort to destroy them, but the Clintons now have no qualms about using the same negative means to bring down a fellow Democratic presidential hopeful. 
 At the risk of further damaging her party and its chances of winning the presidency, Mrs. Clinton will undoubtedly throw the remaining parts of the kitchen sink at Barack Obama during the rest of the primary campaign. 
 At this critical time in our history, America needs a peacemaker like Mr. Obama as commander in chief. He must take the high road to victory. 
 Paul L. Whiteley Sr.
 Louisville, Ky., April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing her country and her party a service by exposing the poor foundation on which this romance with Senator Barack Obama is based. 
 Those Democrats who seek to harness the country to a man with nice looks, a good education, a strong liberal political philosophy and a silver tongue without testing him to see if he has the guts to be a strong and effective president are playing dangerously with all of our safety. 
 Who is this man when the going gets tough? What we now see from Mr. Obama is not pretty. Kathleen H. Casey 
 Pearland, Tex., April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thank you for decrying Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in fostering the negative and increasingly demeaning tone of the Democratic race. Her personal attacks on Senator Barack Obama have come as no surprise, as it was clear from the start she would do anything to win the nomination. 
 But her recent tactic of deriding him as some sort of weakling who ''can't take the heat,'' simply because he doesn't want to roll around in the muck with her, is just plain insulting. 
 Mrs. Clinton, we know what it is to have a schoolyard bully in the White House. The American people want a president with a little dignity and restraint. John J. Holden 
 Albany, April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Give me a break. As a longtime supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, I have had to endure the nastiest, most vile, brutal, sexist, outrageous and vicious comments tossed at her from the Obama camp for months and months and months -- on blogs, in e-mail messages, in articles and via a variety of spokespeople. 
 How dare you tell Mrs. Clinton to tone it down. She fought back, and fought back hard, because the mainstream media gave Barack Obama a free pass. 
 Voters can tell the difference between a clean counterargument and something below the belt.
 Both campaigns have had their less-than-stellar moments. But nowhere was Pennsylvania one of the dirtier campaigns. Jean B. Grillo 
 New York, April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You're shocked, shocked that Hillary Rodham Clinton has run a negative campaign against Barack Obama. Really? Was the evidence not there when you endorsed her before Super Tuesday?
 Mrs. Clinton has simply escalated the tactics she began in New Hampshire. No tears this time, though, just the threat of nuclear retaliation against Iran. 
 Isn't it time to call for an end to this dreadful campaign by the Clintons? That's the only way the negativity will stop. Janice Bailey 
 Portland, Me., April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial is more of the same Clinton-bashing I'm getting used to this political season. The race-baiting and negativity started from Barack Obama's camp after New Hampshire.
 This is politics, not patty-cake. Hillary Rodham Clinton has had the audacity to expose truths about Mr. Obama. The advertisement Mrs. Clinton ran in Pennsylvania was fair -- there are problems that our leaders will face that they must show they can deal with. 
 I am sick of Democrats who are so namby-pamby they won't address the real challenges facing us, including Osama bin Laden. Maybe if Al Gore or John Kerry had run tougher campaigns, we wouldn't have had eight disastrous years of President Bush.

HEADLINE: Better Roses Than Cocaine

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
 For seven years, Democrats have rightfully complained that President Bush has gratuitously antagonized the world, exasperating our allies and eroding America's standing and influence.
 But now the Democrats are doing the same thing on trade. In Latin America, it is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton who are seen as the go-it-alone cowboys, by opposing the United States' free-trade agreement with Colombia.
 Some Democrats claim that they are against the pact because Colombia has abused human rights. Those concerns are legitimate -- but they shouldn't be used to punish people like Norma Reynosa, a 35-year-old woman who just may snip the flowers that go into the Mother's Day bouquet that you buy. 
 Human rights aren't abstract to Ms. Reynosa. Two of her relatives were killed in the brutal warfare and insecurity that plague her home region in Colombia's South. A third was killed by a land mine, and a fourth was kidnapped at age 12 to work for guerrillas in the National Liberation Army, or the ELN. Ms. Reynosa ran a small restaurant but had to flee when the guerrillas demanded that she pay more extortion money than she could afford.
 ''They said they would kill us,'' she recalled. ''They didn't say how. Mostly they just shot people and threw their bodies in the river.''
 So in June 2005, Ms. Reynosa and her husband abandoned their home and fled to the outskirts of the capital to see if they could get jobs in the booming flower industry. Colombian cities like Medellin were the most dangerous cities in the world in the 1980s and '90s, but now they are thriving and homicide rates are well below those of some American cities.
 One reason is those bouquets you buy, entering duty-free from Colombia. These days Colombia is the world's second-largest exporter of flowers after the Netherlands, and almost 200,000 people work in the flower industry. Up to 28 cargo planes a day carry flowers from Colombia to the U.S.
 Better carnations than cocaine, no?
 Critics of the free-trade pact worry that it would hurt American workers. But Colombian goods already enter the U.S. duty-free; what would change is that American exporters would get access to the Colombian market. 
 (Colombia is pushing hard for the pact not because of any immediate trade benefit but because its duty-free access to the U.S. must be regularly renewed. Businesses are reluctant to invest in flower farms or garment factories unless they know that they will be able to export to the U.S. for many years to come.)
 Some Democrats point out that Colombia's government has been tied to paramilitary units that kill union members. It was important for Democrats to raise these concerns -- forcing the Colombian government to crack down on paramilitaries and prosecute those who murder unionists.
 But Colombia's progress has been immense. Assassinations of union members, while still a problem, have fallen 80 percent since 2002. Last year, the murder rate for union members was 4 per 100,000, reaching levels far below the homicide rate for the general public.
 As she clips flowers in a vast greenhouse, Ms. Reynosa knows that her future depends on access to the American market. She agrees that Colombia has human-rights problems, but she argues passionately that the free-trade agreement is the way to register continued improvements. More trade will mean more jobs and more security and human rights, she argues.
 The last few years have seen enormous gains in security and the quality of life in Colombia -- and that's why President Alvaro Uribe has an 85 percent approval rating.
 I asked President Uribe on Monday if there was concern among Latin leaders that Democrats in Congress are tugging the U.S. away from its historic commitment to free trade. He said bluntly: ''I don't want to imagine this scenario. It would be devastating for the good relationship between the United States and our region.''
 To their credit, a large group of prominent Democrats from previous administrations have strongly endorsed the trade accord, declaring that it is ''in both our vital national security and economic interests.'' But the presidential candidates aren't listening.
 Democrats instinctively criticize Mr. Bush when he harms America's standing in the world. That's easy. But a test of intellectual honesty is your willingness to hold your own side to the same standard and to point out pandering in those politicians you normally admire.
 One of President Bush's most costly actions was his flat rejection of the Kyoto climate treaty; it symbolized a my-way-or-the-highway approach that bolstered anti-Americanism around the world. If the Colombia free-trade pact is rejected and the U.S. backs away from its commitment to expanding trade, that may be the Democrats' equivalent of Kyoto, signaling a retreat from internationalism.
 It would be seen as the United States thumbing its nose at the world.

HEADLINE: Empty Talk on Taxes

 BODY:
One of the toughest questions that will face the next president is what to do about taxes. There can be no real progress on health care, rebuilding the military or any other major issue without dealing with rising budget deficits and mounting debt from nearly eight years of profligate spending and tax breaks for the wealthy. 
 And that is why it has been so distressing to see all three of the presidential hopefuls pretend they can make good on their promises without broadly raising taxes.
 This is the reality: 
 To restore the health of the budget, let alone keep ambitious campaign pledges for spending more money, the next president, regardless of which party wins, will have to tax the American people more than any of the candidates has been willing to admit. 
 Senator John McCain's tax talk is particularly divorced from reality. 
 The presumed Republican nominee has been offering a free-lunch extravaganza -- hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax breaks per year, on top of extending President Bush's tax cuts, with no credible way to make up for the money the government will lose. The more criticism he has faced, the more nonsensical his justifications have become.
 Among his more peculiar recent comments is his insistence that today's superlow tax rates on capital gains -- which overwhelmingly benefit the very richest Americans and which he wants to preserve -- are important for working people with 401(k) retirement plans. Memo to Mr. McCain: 401(k) savers get no benefit from a low capital gains rate. All of the money in those plans is eventually taxed at ordinary income tax rates, not at the special reduced rate for capital gains. 
 Sadly, blundering and blustering on taxes is a nonpartisan affliction. In their debate before the Pennsylvania primary, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama both took the bait when George Stephanopoulos, one of the ABC News moderators, asked them about a ''read-my-lips,'' no-new-taxes pledge. 
 Mrs. Clinton promised to not raise taxes on ''middle-class Americans, people making less than $250,000 a year.'' Mr. Obama pledged to cut taxes starting at incomes less than ''$200,000 and $250,000.'' 
 Apart from their rather odd definition of middle class, neither candidate's numbers add up. In the United States today, anyone making anywhere near a quarter-million dollars a year is in the top 3 percent or so of taxpayers. (The median income is about $50,000.) Even in the states with the largest percentage of taxpayers making above $200,000 -- Connecticut and New Jersey -- only 6 percent of the population makes that much. 
 In effect, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are saying that they can pay for their promises mainly by raising taxes on the top 3 percent of taxpayers. That's neither politically nor economically plausible.
 Perhaps the candidates are afraid the American people can't handle the truth about what it would take to meet the nation's economic challenges. Or perhaps they are underestimating those challenges. 
 In either case, it's hardly confidence-inspiring at a time of war and economic crisis.

 To the Editor:
 I am glad to see that you do not wear blinders. Your endorsement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries was understandable -- after all, she is one of New York's two senators. But her campaign tactics are increasingly reminiscent of Lee Atwater and Karl Rove, and I commend you for calling her on it. 
 Mrs. Clinton's most recent ad, with its image of Osama bin Laden, is something no Democrat can be proud of. By running ads like this, she reveals her desire to win at any cost, rather than to promote a Democratic agenda that will win in November. 
 As a woman, I am sad that the first viable woman candidate for president is barely discernable from her male Republican predecessors. 
 Lauri Steel Los Altos, Calif., April 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You express well the true cost of the Pennsylvania primary. Hillary Rodham Clinton ''won'' the state, but the state lost the opportunity for, as you said, a ''nuanced debate'' that could have clarified the issues better for us all. For this, Mrs. Clinton's against-the-math ambition is primarily to blame. 
 Cinderella's stepsisters, per the Brothers Grimm, were so desperate for life in the palace that they were willing to cut off parts of their own feet to wear the glass slipper. Why is it so easy to see Hillary and Bill Clinton with such knives in their hands? 
 Yet the wisdom of fairy tales also consoles: the stepsisters lose, and the one who is a more natural fit wins. 
 I suppose the only question remaining is how much damage the Clintons are willing to do to themselves and their party before they accept defeat.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Chief Faces Investors After Disappointing Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ERIE, Pa. 

 BODY:
General Electric's chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, delivered a mea culpa to investors and analysts at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday after the company failed to hit first-quarter goals. 
 The disappointing earnings report less than two weeks ago prompted a sell-off that wiped out more than $46 billion of G.E.'s market capitalization.
 ''This has triggered a tough reaction, and it should,'' Mr. Immelt told about 1,000 shareholders. ''I can assure you that we look in the mirror and ask ourselves some very tough questions.''
 He pledged that the company would increase its planned cost-cutting by 50 percent, to $3 billion from $2 billion, and adjusted G.E.'s expected 2008 earnings growth to 5 percent or less.
 G.E. had reported a 6 percent reduction in first-quarter profit, a month after the company promised investors 10 percent earnings growth in 2008.
 Analysts downgraded G.E.'s stock and its share price fell nearly 13 percent. The company's former chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., fueled the fire by saying he would ''get a gun out and shoot'' his successor if he allowed G.E. to miss its targets again.
 In speaking to shareholders Wednesday, Mr. Immelt noted the weak American economy and said G.E.'s financial services earnings had dropped 28 percent.
 Executives are making changes in the company's operations and planning that include more frequent business forecasting, and Mr. Immelt is reviewing businesses weekly instead of monthly.
 Meeting with reporters, Mr. Immelt praised officials in G.E.'s commercial finance business, but would not rule out staff changes.
 Shareholders questioned Mr. Immelt about G.E.'s falling stock price and challenged him to protect pensions despite the economy's downturn. G.E. traded at more than $42 when Mr. Immelt took over in 2001, but closed at $32.36, up 3 cents, on Wednesday.
 Mr. Immelt said G.E.'s earnings had more than doubled, revenue was up 70 percent and cash flow had almost tripled in his nearly seven-year tenure since succeeding Mr. Welch.
 ''We've built a better company,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''That's what C.E.O.'s are supposed to do, is build companies for the long term.''

HEADLINE: Pressed by the Economy, Starbucks Lowers Its Forecast

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
For some consumers, not even the morning cup of coffee is immune from economic woes.
 Citing a decline of about 5 percent in sales last quarter, Starbucks projected weaker-than-expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast on Wednesday, sending the company's stock down nearly 11 percent in after-hours trading. 
 The company now projects a fiscal second-quarter profit of 15 cents a share, down from 19 cents a share in the quarter last year. Wall Street analysts had expected 21 cents a share. The costs of store closings and new initiatives cut earnings by 3 cents a share, the company said. 
 Starbucks also said it expected full-year earnings per share to be ''somewhat lower'' than the prior fiscal year's 87 cents. Echoing other retailers, Starbucks said the imprecise guidance was a result of a ''lack of visibility into near-term economic conditions.'' The company will report financial results on April 30.
 The announcement was another indication that luxuries like $4 Frappuccinos are looking less appealing to consumers. 
 Howard Schultz, the chief executive, called the current economic environment the weakest in the company's 37-year history, ''marked by lower home values, and rising costs for energy, food and other products that are directly impacting our customers.''
 The company noted that 31 percent of its stores are in California and Florida, where the housing market has been especially hard hit.
 Mr. Schultz returned as chief executive in January to try to turn around the company's sagging stock price. 
 Last month he announced a series of changes, including a new brewed coffee, an improved automatic espresso machine, a rewards program for customers and a Web site where visitors could make suggestions to enhance ''the Starbucks experience.''
 In the company's announcement, Mr. Schultz said those initiatives were in their early stages and were not reflected by the earnings. 
 Citing company research and alluding to the increased competition from Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's and other fast-food outlets, he said customers were not substituting Starbucks purchases with ''coffee products from others.''
 Instead, he said, they are just not ordering lattes and cappuccinos as often. 
 Larry Miller, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said sales at Starbucks had eroded more than those at other food and beverage chains.
 ''As they're entering a period of experimentation to re-establish their brand and pricing power,'' he said, ''some things are going to go right, and some things are going to go wrong. It's going to be a very rocky road.'' 
 Stock in Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, closed market trading up 15 cents, at $17.85 a share, but fell 10.7 percent, to $15.94, in after-hours trading.

BYLINE: JENNIFER RITTNER and BRIDGET ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students share opinions about various facts related to incarceration, and use statistical data to analyze factual information and presumptions about the state of crime and justice in the United States. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students share opinions about various facts related to incarceration, and use statistical data to analyze factual information and presumptions about the state of crime and justice in the United States.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Bridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Share opinions about several facts concerning incarceration.
2. Learn about current incarceration statistics in the United States compared with other countries by reading and discussing the article "Inmate Count in U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations'."
3. Collect and create a series of charts and graphs highlighting statistics on incarceration in the United States.
4. Write reflection papers that analyze the statistics gathered in class.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
-classroom board
-student journals
-blank maps of United States regions and/or states (one per student as directed in the main lesson)
-graph paper (several sheets per student)
-markers and other tools for making color-coded maps (enough for the class to share)
-copies of the article "Inmate Count in U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations'" found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080424thursday.html (one per student)
Activities / Procedures:
Note to teachers: The following lesson may be adapted to apply to any news story related to social science research, such as education and testing, the occurrence of disease or adolescent behavior.
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW
Before class, write the following prompt on the board for students to respond to in their journals: "Do you think that the threat of jail time is a deterrent to those who might commit a crime? Why or why not?"
Give students a few minutes to write, then ask them to share their responses.
Then, have them brainstorm answers to the following questions, and write their answers on the board:
a) How many people do you think are currently incarcerated in the United States?
b) What country in the world do you think has the highest rate of incarceration (number of people in prison as compared with the general population)?
c) Which country do you think has the lowest rate of incarceration?
d) What do you think is the number one reason for incarcerations in federal prisons in the United States?
e) What percentage of criminals incarcerated in state prisons do you think are there for committing violent crimes?
Prompt students to consider that the current United States population is over 300,000,000, according to the Census Bureau.
(Correct answers: The answers are a) 2.3 million, b) United States, c) San Marino, d) drugs and e) 52.1%)
Before you read the answers, ask students to vote on which of the suggested answers they think is correct. Then read the answers.
Prompt them to consider that the total number of individuals incarcerated in the United States, 2.3 million, is only slightly lower than the entire population of Nevada (2.5 million), considerably more than Montana (under 1 million), around 5 times the current population of Miami (just under 400,000) and slightly less than half the current population of Finland (5.2 million).
Are they surprised by any of this information? Why or why not?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Inmate Count in U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations'" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080424thursday.html), focusing on the following questions. As they read, have them underline or highlight the statistics for future reference:
a. How does the United States' approach to crime and punishment compare with practices in other countries?
b. What ratio of the United States population is currently incarcerated?
c. How does this statistic compare with other major countries?
d. How do prison sentences compare between the United States and other countries?
e. What role do drugs play in explaining the rate of crime and incarceration in the United States?
f. Why are some analysts, like Michael H. Tonry, concerned about these statistics?
g. Why does Vivien Stern refer to the American war on drugs as "ignorant fanaticism?" How do you feel about her statement?
h. Why might capitalism, democracy and "Protestant religion with strong Calvinist overtones" be cited to explain the American approach to crime and punishment? Explain your answer.
Review the graphic "Prison Population Around the Globe," found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/22/us/20080423_PRISON_GRAPHIC.html, focusing on the following questions:
i. According to the central graphic, which American states have the highest rate of incarceration and which have the lowest?
j. In what year did the incarceration rate in the United States spike?
k. In what year did the homicide rate reach its peak and what was the rate of incarceration that year?
l. By how much did the overall crime rate fall between 1980 and 2006? During that period, what was the lowest point it reached and how many people per 100,000 were incarcerated that year?
m. Approximately what percentage of federal prisoners were incarcerated because of a violent crime in 1985? By how much did that number change between 1985 and 2006?
n. How many more federal prisoners were incarcerated because of a drug-related crime in 1995 than they were in 1985?
o. Compared with federal prisoners, what percentage of drug-related crimes were the cause of incarceration for prisoners held in state facilities?
p. How do the state and federal statistics compare in terms of violent crime?
3. Explain to students that they will collect and analyze incarceration statistics for states in the United States (for the most recent year available) in order to determine what story or message those statistics might tell about crime and justice in the United States. Students create a series of charts and graphics based on their findings, then bring their data together to create a consolidated, color-coded map.
To begin, arrange the class into seven groups and assign each group a region of the United States, as follows: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, Mountains and West Coast. Provide each group with a blank map of the region and/or blank maps of the individual states in the region. Advise groups to select students to find the statistics for each state.
If the technology is available, provide students with the link to the following Web sites or print out the information and provide them with the relevant pages.
-Correction Statistics, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/correct.htm.
-Prisoners in 2006, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/p06.pdf and Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2005 can be printed as a PDF from http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pjim05.pdf.
-The United States Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics offers a range of statistics at http://www.fedstats.gov/.
-Federal statistics can also be found on the Bureau of Prisons' Web site at http://www.bop.gov/locations/weekly_report.jsp.
-State statistics can also be found on each state's Department of Corrections Web site.
Using the interactive graphic "Prison Population Around the Globe," found at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/22/us/20080423_PRISON_GRAPHIC.html, compile the following statistics for your state:
-Incarceration rate for the state (total)
-Homicide rate
-Overall index crime rate
-Reason for incarceration
-Average length of jail time
-Ratio of men and women incarcerated
-Breakdown of age groups (17 and under, 18-35, 36 and over)
In addition to the statistics from the corrections system, collect the following statistics, which can be found on the U.S. Census Bureau Web site at http://www.census.gov/:
-Population of largest city in the state
-Breakdown of income in the state
Have students prepare a series of graphs and charts based on their findings. Toward the end of class, have the groups discuss the data they collected for their region, focusing on the following questions:
-Which state in your region has the highest incarceration rate?
-What is the most common cause of incarceration in your region?
-How do you think your region might compare with other regions in the United States in terms of rate of incarceration? In terms of the cause of incarceration?
-Might citizens in this region need to be concerned about the way in which the criminal justice system handles crime? Why or why not?
Then have them compile their state information onto a wall map, mural or collage to represent the entire United States.
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK
Individually, students write an analysis paper based on what they learned in class, focusing on how they perceive crime and punishment in the United States. Some questions to address (written in their journals before the end of class) are:
-What assumptions might you make about crime and justice in the United States if you only had the statistics you investigated in class?
-If you only had statistics about the United States but not the individual state data, what assumption might you make about criminality in the United States?
-How might your state's statistics reflect or debunk assumptions about incarceration and crime in the United States?
Have students submit their analysis papers in the next class.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-What preconceived notions do you have about people who are incarcerated?
-Do you feel that the United States is made more or less safe because of the numbers of people in prison? Explain your answer.
-How effective do you think the current corrections system is in deterring crime or providing options? Explain your answer.
-What is meant by the term "white-collar" crime? How does it differ from other types of crimes, if at all? Should "white-collar" criminals be treated similarly or differently from other types of criminals? Explain your answer.
-Is there such a thing as a victimless crime? Explain your answer.
Evaluation/Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thoughtful contribution in developing their data and completing their collages, and insightful reflection papers.
Vocabulary:
Incarcerated, criminologists, extrajudicial, median, anomaly, delegations, rogue, fanaticism, imperative, thwart, per capita, punitive, monolithic.
Extension Activities:
1. Visit Justice Learning (http://www.justicelearning.com) and listen to one broadcast. Write a summary of the presentation to share with the class, as well as two questions to pose to the class for discussion.
2. Learn about crime prevention programs in your community. Volunteer your time to work with youth at risk and publish your experience on a blog (keeping the names and identities of the people you encounter anonymous).
3. Investigate prisoner assistance programs in the state you investigated in class, including programs designed to help those in prison (such as drug counseling, job training and educational resources) as well as those who have been released, such as housing resources and work release. What statistics have been gathered to support or refute the usefulness of these programs? Gather the statistics and write an analysis based on your findings.
4. Investigate one private prison management company such as Corrections Corp of America or the Geo Group. Which state or federal prisons does the company manage? What are their sources of income and profit? Review their annual report to learn their annual earnings in 2007. What role does the company play in relation to the state or federal prison system? What questions or challenges have been raised by the company's management of state or federal prisons? Prepare an economic report on the company that includes a statement outlining your thoughts on the privatization of the prison system.
5. Are there alternatives to incarceration? Are there other ways to deal with people who commit crimes? Is a society without prisons possible? Write a two-page reflection paper that addresses these questions.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Geography - Identify the nation of San Marino on a map and prepare an illustrated report on the country's history and culture.
Global History - Investigate one foreign country's corrections system. What strategies have they employed to keep their crime and incarcerations low? Based on your findings, write a letter to the Department of Justice that outlines any lessons that might be learned.
Language Arts -Read a letter from jail from any political prisoner, such as the "Letter from Birmingham Jail" by Martin Luther King Jr., "A Prisoner in the Garden" by Nelson Mandela, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" by Malcolm X, or selected letters from Gandhi. Why was the author imprisoned? What impact did that have on the subject and intent of his writings? What questions, insights, proclamations or indictments did the author raise in his writing? To whom were the writings directed? What impact did the author's incarceration have on himself and society? Write an analysis paper based on your findings.
-Read "Monster" (Amistad) by Walter Dean Myers and conduct a classroom discussion around the issues raised in the book. How does your reading impact your analysis and/or understanding of the statistics you collected in class?
Media Studies - Watch one television show that revolves around arrests or imprisonment, such as "America's Most Wanted," "Cops" or "Prison Break." How are the individuals (law enforcement, victims and those accused of crimes) portrayed on the show? How are issues of personal justice, social justice, judgement, heroism, victimization, safety and fear presented? What other ideas or themes are raised? What general message do you think is being presented about the role of crime and justice in American society? Prepare a collage of words and images that you think best represent the issues raised in the show and present it with an explanation to the class.
Teaching with The Times - The article "Inmate Count in U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations'" is one in a series called American Exceptions. Read other articles in the series, which can be found at http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/american_exception/index.html. Highlight key issues raised in those articles and prepare a list of keywords. Read the National section of The Times every day for one week and look for the keywords you highlighted to learn how these issues are addressed in the news on a daily basis. How do they relate to the issues raised in the articles in the series? Report your findings to the newspaper as a follow-up to the article you read in class by sending an e-mail to The New York Times Learning Network at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/letters/index.html.

HEADLINE: Where The Fingers Are Pointing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
When money managers make good investments, they are happy to take credit for brilliance. When they make bad investments, they would rather the blame go elsewhere.
 The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing this week to beat up on the credit rating agencies and to push the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose tough regulations on them as quickly as possible.
 Many of the new rules the S.E.C. is likely to consider are good ideas, but the responsibility for this debacle goes far beyond the rating agencies. 
 When the dust settles, it is probable that there will be S.E.C. rules mandating that a company giving information to one rating agency be required to give it to any agency. It is not clear if the information will have to be made public. If not, there could be questions of trading on inside information, particularly since some new rating agencies will finance their work by releasing opinions only to the investors who hire them.
 There will also be rules aimed at forcing the agencies to do a better job of checking the information they are given. The agencies now complain that those who manufactured mortgage-backed securities lied to them. But a committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, known as Iosco, concluded that in some cases the agencies should have realized the information failed to pass a ''sniff test.''
 There are also likely to be rules to make the agencies do a better job of keeping their ratings up to date. That could prove costly if the market for structured finance products remains moribund. With little income coming in from new ratings and more money going out to monitor old ratings, profits could be under severe pressure. 
 Finally, there is likely to be some kind of database to make it easier to see how accurate the ratings turned out to be.
 If anything, anger at the rating agencies appears to be greater in Europe than in the United States, and pressure for tough rules is especially strong in Germany, where the banks would like to blame Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- all hailing from America -- for the bad investments they made. 
 A few years ago, some European companies, angry at what they saw as unduly tough ratings, mounted a campaign for more regulation of the credit agencies. That led to international efforts to force the agencies to disclose their rating criteria. Those disclosures probably made it easier for Wall Street to tailor structured finance products to get desired ratings.
 At the Senate hearing, there were only limited indications that anyone other than the rating agencies was responsible for the current crisis.
 There was a brief discussion regarding the need for an investigation into the way investment banks put together the structured finance products that the rating agencies misrated. But there was no talk about the decisions by Congress and the various regulators to leave those securities virtually unregulated while the credit boom was going on.
 Nor were there harsh words for the institutional investors who snapped up these securities without doing much, if any, homework. As the Iosco report put it, ''There are serious questions whether institutional investors, either through ignorance or lax internal governance and risk management, relied excessively on credit ratings, with little regard for the underlying risks of the financial instruments they bought, sold and in some cases even designed.''
 Instead, the agencies took the rap. ''Because rating agencies underestimated the risks of subprime-based securities, these securities were allowed to spread throughout our financial system without their real risk being detected before it was too late,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut who is the committee chairman, practically begged Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, to ask for new legislative authority. He suggested that perhaps it would be a good idea to leave credit rating to some kind of nonprofit agency that would not have conflicts of interest. Both he and Senator Shelby suggested that the S.E.C. should revoke the operating license of a credit rating agency that was wrong too often.
 It looks as if the rating agencies are well on their way to becoming the scapegoat for this disaster, much as securities analysts took much of the blame for the technology stock bubble whose bursting led to the last recession. 
 That the rating process was badly flawed is now clear. But so was much else. 
 Mortgage brokers made loans to people who could not hope to repay them unless house prices continued to rise, sometimes using inflated appraisals to get the loan approved. Wall Street packaged the loans into securities, and the credit rating agencies blessed many of them with high ratings based on foolish assumptions. Regulators and congressmen cheered on the whole process because it was enabling more people to buy homes and allowing the commercial banks to use the securities to transfer risks to others.
 Little is being done about most of those sinners. There are new rules to prevent foolish mortgage loans, but those rules came after the debacle had already assured that such loans would no longer be made. The Treasury Department thinks the Federal Reserve, which refused pleas to intervene in the subprime lending boom when it might have done some good, should get more power over the financial system. 
 The credit rating system did help to make the disaster possible. The agencies could issue ratings only if issuers hired them to do so. Had one of the Big Three somehow seen what was coming, and refused to freely hand out AAA ratings, that agency would have gotten no business and been far less profitable than its competitors.
 Under the rules that the S.E.C. is expected to propose this summer, rating agencies will be able to try a different business model, one that relies on payments from investors rather than issuers.
 It will be interesting to see if institutional investors are willing to support such agencies. Had they been willing to pay for research before -- and to buy securities only from issuers that released enough information to allow informed investment decisions -- this disaster might never have happened.

HEADLINE: A Visit to Old China, Before It Drowns

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Imagine the Grand Canyon turned into a lake. That image is summoned by Yung Chang, the Chinese-Canadian director and occasional narrator of ''Up the Yangtze,'' an astonishing documentary of culture clash and the erasure of history amid China's economic miracle. 
 The film explores the incalculable human impact of the giant Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze, China's longest river. When completed, the 600-foot-high dam will be the largest hydroelectric project in the world. As we watch the steadily rising water swallow more and more of the landscape, the film conveys an ominous sense of a society changing too fast in its stampede into an unknown future. 
 The dam, suggested by Sun Yat-sen and later supported by Mao Zedong, but not begun until 1994, is expected to be finished sometime in 2011. Not since the Great Wall has China undertaken such a massive engineering project. 
 By the time the dam is completed as many as two million people will have been relocated to new homes from the flooded area. As one struggling merchant forced to move from his riverside home explains before breaking down in tears, the Chinese people are expected to ''sacrifice the little family for the big family.'' 
 ''Up the Yangzte'' is the second recent film based around the project. ''Still Life,''Jia Zhangke's haunting docudrama, was about a man and a woman who never meet while searching for their mates in Fengjie, a town in the process of demolition. It was drenched in a mood of despair. 
 The more sociologically oriented ''Up the Yangzte'' is largely set aboard a ship making what are billed as ''farewell cruises'' up the river. Many of the tourists, we are told, come expecting to see the ''old China'' before it disappears. As the boat sails upriver, the landscape is spectacular. At the same time the yellowish haze over the water suggests China's already serious air pollution problem. There are brief glimpses of cities whose gaudy wall-to-wall signs match those of the Las Vegas Strip or Times Square. In these cities what remains of the old China is hidden by the glitter.
 Beyond Mr. Chang's reflections on the country as described to him by his grandfather, the movie refuses to editorialize. It lets the images demonstrate the degree to which the old China has already disappeared. What emerges is a country in the throes of rampant economic development and the global homogenization it augurs. 
 The movie offers an ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' view of life aboard the vessel, which is crowded with well-to-do American and European tourists catered to by a Chinese staff that is minutely drilled on proper etiquette: Never compare Canada and the United States; never call anyone old, pale or fat (plump is O.K.); never talk about politics. 
 The movie observes the culture shock felt by two young employees. Yu Shui, the 16-year-old daughter of illiterate peasants who can't afford to send her to college, is a reluctant dishwasher. Like the other employees she is given a Western name, Cindy. Miserable, sullen and homesick, she has a difficult time adjusting. Meanwhile her parents, who are forced to leave the riverbank where they have survived by growing vegetables and fishing, are shown carrying out the backbreaking labor of moving to a new location. 
 Chen Bo Yu, renamed Jerry, is a cocky, good-looking go-getter from a middle-class background. We are told he is an example of the ''little emperor'' phenomenon in which male products of the country's one-child policy grow up spoiled and entitled. Shortly after Mr. Chen begins receiving generous tips, his cheerful but hard-nosed boss confronts him with complaints from tourists that he is soliciting tips. As he engages an American teenager in small talk about girls and sports, he seems eager to shed his national identity and make money: the more the better. 
 All the while the water continues to rise.
 UP THE YANGTZE

HEADLINE: That Book Costs How Much?

 BODY:
College students and their families are rightly outraged about the bankrupting costs of textbooks that have nearly tripled since the 1980s, mainly because of marginally useful CD-ROMs and other supplements. A bill pending in Congress would require publishers to sell ''unbundled'' versions of the books -- minus the pricey add-ons. Even more important, it would require publishers to reveal book prices in marketing material so that professors could choose less-expensive titles. 
 The bill is a good first step. But colleges and universities will need to embrace new methods of textbook development and distribution if they want to rein in runaway costs. That means using digital textbooks, which can often be presented online free of charge or in hard copies for as little as one-fifth the cost of traditional books. The digital books can also be easily customized and updated. 
 Right now, textbook publishers are calling the tune. They add as many bells and whistles as they can and pump out new editions as quickly as possible -- as a way of making perfectly good textbooks obsolete. Not every book can be cheap. A specialized text that only a few people know how to write and that reaches a small audience will be costly by definition. But there is no reason for an introductory textbook to carry a price tag of, say, $140 in an area like economics where the information changes little from year to year. 
 Schools are beginning to balk at outrageous pricing. Rice University offers textbooks for some classes free online and charges a nominal fee for the printed version. A new company called Flat World Knowledge, based in Nyack, N.Y., plans to offer online textbooks free and hopes to make its profit by selling supplemental materials like study guides and hard copies printed on demand. 
 A study being carried out by the geographer Ronald Dorn at Arizona State University suggests that students who use free online textbooks perform as well academically as students who buy expensive copies from traditional publishers. Colleges and universities should take advantage of these new developments. 
 Cash-strapped students and their families need all the relief they can get.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell 8.5% in March, to Lowest Level Since Early '90s

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The worst days of the housing slump may lie ahead. Buyers vanished from the housing market in March, as sales of new homes plummeted to the lowest level since the housing recession of the 1990s, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 
 Builders are faced with the biggest backlog of unsold homes in more than a quarter-century, a sign that house prices may continue to drop. 
 ''People are obviously reluctant to buy so long as prices continue to fall,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group. ''They have no desire to buy a house that is going to be worth less two months later.''
 Even those who want to buy may be stymied, Mr. Baumohl added, as lenders tighten their credit standards amid broad financial trouble.
 Sales of new homes fell 8.5 percent, a sharper decline than economists had forecast. The drop-off may be related to the downturn in the job market; employers cut 80,000 jobs in March, the most so far this year. 
 ''That has a very profound psychological impact on people,'' Mr. Baumohl said. ''They are not likely to make a major investment if they are uncertain about job security and income growth.'' 
 Home sales are running at an annual pace of 526,000, after adjusting for seasonal factors, the lowest since October 1991. At the current sales pace, it will take 11 months for builders to work off the backlog, the biggest inventory pileup since 1981.
 Joseph Brusuelas, an economist at IdeaGlobal, wrote in a note to clients that ''the housing sector will continue to act as dead weight on overall growth throughout the remainder of 2008.'' 
 Sales dropped in every region of the country, with the Northeast having the steepest drop, 19.4 percent. Sales in the Midwest and the West fell about 13 percent, and 5 percent in the South.
 Adding to the gloom, the Commerce Department lowered its estimate for February sales, to a drop of 5.3 percent from a drop of 1.8 percent. Prices continued to fall as well, which could discourage some prospective buyers from re-entering the market. The median price of a new home dropped in March to $227,600, down 13.3 percent from a year earlier. 
 The housing slump has weighed heavily on manufacturing, as Americans shy away from large purchases. The Commerce Department said Thursday that manufacturing orders fell in March, the third consecutive monthly decline. 
 Orders for durable goods dipped 0.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $212.2 billion, down $700 million from February.
 Although some economists had expected a small rise in durable goods orders, the report was considered relatively mild after the results of recent months. 
 Rob Carnell, an economist at ING Bank in London, said the data could lend support to the optimistic camp of analysts who maintain that the nation will avoid a prolonged recession.
 Separately Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 33,000 last week, to 342,000. The four-week moving average, which tends to smooth out weekly volatility, fell by 7,250 claims, to 369,500.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Lower Jobless Claims and Ford's Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied Thursday after weekly unemployment claims fell and Ford Motor reported a profit in the first quarter, injecting some optimism about the economy into the market.
 Investors looked past weak forecasts from Amazon.com and Starbucks and a Commerce Department report that new-home sales fell in March to the lowest level in more than 16 years. 
 Sellers held sway early in the session, after the home sales report, sending the Dow down nearly 57 points. But as the session wore on, the market reversed course, perhaps because there were no major surprises in the day's negative news. Oil and other commodities' prices fell as the dollar rose to its highest level against major currencies since January, also helping to bolster stocks.
 The Dow rose 85.73, or 0.67 percent, to 12,848.95.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.89, or 0.64 percent, to 1,388.82, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 23.71, or 0.99 percent, to 2,428.92.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.96, or 1.27 percent, to 717.07.
 The dollar rose for the second consecutive day, regaining ground from its record low against the euro on Tuesday amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve would pause in its string of interest rate reductions after its meeting next Wednesday. The euro brought $1.5686 in late New York trading, down from $1.5896 Wednesday and $1.6018 on Tuesday.
 A drop in oil prices was particularly reassuring for Wall Street. Crude's surge toward $120 a barrel this week compounded already rising concerns about inflation and its impact on consumer spending. Light crude fell $2.24 to settle at $116.06 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Amazon had worried investors over its profit margins, while Starbucks warned that its second-quarter profit will probably fall short of Wall Street's expectations because of weak consumer spending.
 Their forecasts were delivered after the closing bell Wednesday. Amazon fell $3.31, or 4.1 percent, to $77.69, while Starbucks dropped $1.86, or 11 percent, to $15.99.
 But Ford said strong results from Europe and South America helped make up for a slower American economy. The automaker's performance was its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2007. Ford rose 88 cents, or 12 percent, to $8.40.
 The 3M Company, maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes, fell $1.50, to $79.13, after reporting that its first-quarter profit fell 28 percent from a year earlier, when it benefited from a gain on the sale of one of its branded pharmaceutical businesses in Europe.
 Motorola slid 30 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $9.25 after reporting that its first-quarter loss widened and its mobile business declined 39 percent.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 24/32, to 97 11/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.82 percent from 3.73 percent.
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Fitting Luxe Into the Well-Stretched Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
IF your tastes run toward pampering spa surroundings, but your budget doesn't, there are other ways to economize besides taking time off midweek to snare an off-peak discount. 
 One option is to visit a hotel or resort's fancy spa just for the day.
 ''At most resort and hotel spas, even with just the cost of one treatment you can stay in the spa and relaxation area pretty much the whole day,'' said Julie Sinclair, editor in chief of Spa magazine. ''You book the treatment for 2 o'clock and you show up at 10.''
 I used that strategy to visit the spa at the Breakers Hotel and Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in March. If you book at least a 50-minute treatment, you can also use the outdoor lap pool and Jacuzzi (both of which overlook the beach), join a yoga class in the courtyard, and use the steam room and sauna.
 The indoor facilities were disappointing: a steam room that resembled the one at my gym and a surprisingly grim relaxation area with curtains that blocked the ocean view. I also had to ask to use the outdoor pool area, which was the only justification for paying $195 for a 50-minute massage (itself rather mediocre). But that price also included valet parking, normally $30, and the chance to wander the grounds of the historic hotel.
 At the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa in Chandler, Ariz., you do not even have to book a treatment to use the spa's pools, Jacuzzis, steam rooms, saunas and fitness center; hotel guests can buy a day pass for $20 ($35 for nonguests).
 Another tip is to ask for a discount if you are traveling with a group, even if it is just a few friends. 
 ''Almost every spa will do a discount for a group, and the group doesn't have to be that large,'' said Susie Ellis, the president of the Web site SpaFinder.
 Many other deals are designed for just two people, like the package offered by the Cal-a-Vie spa in Vista, Calif., where the second person gets half off the normal weekly rate of $7,395 during certain weeks. (O.K., so that's not exactly cheap, but even wealthy spa-goers like to save.)
 There are also a handful of spas that frequently show up on lists of affordable retreats, like the Oaks at Ojai in Ojai, Calif.; the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah; the New Age Health Spa in Neversink, N.Y.; Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe, N.M.; and Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, which claims it was ''the world's first destination spa.'' 
 SpaFinder lists more than 50 spas in its ''affordable'' category, which means they typically cost less than $300 a night, and some less than $200.
 For that price, you generally get a lower staff-to-guest ratio and less luxurious accommodations, which aren't necessarily as important for this type of vacation.
 As Ms. Ellis pointed out, ''You're there to exercise and have spa treatments, so you're not spending a lot of time in your room.''

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Helps 3M, but Maybe Too Much

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The diversified manufacturer 3M reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, but its shares fell on investor concern that the weak dollar accounted for too much of the company's growth. 
 3M, whose products include cellphone circuits and Post-it notes, said foreign currency conversion accounted for 6.1 percentage points of its 8.9 percent rise in quarterly sales.
 Also, the company backed away from a previous goal of 5 to 8 percent volume growth this year excluding the effect of the weak dollar. It said the goal was unrealistic in ''today's economic world.''
 Investors scrutinize results from big manufacturers like 3M, which makes products for both industry and consumers, to gain insight into the health of the American economy.
 The company's first-quarter net income was $988 million, or $1.38 a share, beating analysts' average forecast of $1.35 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Foreign currency translation accounted for 7 cents a share.
 Sales totaled $6.5 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $6.32 billion. But organic growth disappointed, falling domestically and coming in weaker than expected internationally, said a Morningstar analyst, Adam Fleck.
 Shares of 3M fell $1.50, to $79.13, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: The Listings

BYLINE: By VIVIEN SCHWEITZER

 BODY:
YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHORUS OF NEW YORK CITY Most composers lust after commissions from orchestras, opera companies and string quartets. Fewer have children's choirs high on their wish lists. But Francisco J. Nunez hopes to change that with his remarkable Young People's Chorus of New York City, above, and its Transient Glory series, which continues on Sunday at the Miller Theater. 
 Mr. Nunez founded the choir in 1988 with kids of diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds. In 2001 he inaugurated Transient Glory (named after the fleeting beauty of developing voices) to expand the serious repertory for children's choirs and to encourage composers to write for the medium. Since then the ensemble has commissioned dozens of works by an eclectic range of notable composers, including Steve Reich, George Crumb, Judith Weir, Bright Sheng, Milton Babbitt and David Del Tredici. 
 The chorus is split into several divisions, including the Concert Chorus for boys and girls ages 12 to 18, which will perform a typically eclectic Transient Glory concert on Sunday. Mr. Nunez will lead the group in the premieres of five commissions, including Joan Tower's first choral piece with text, as well as music by Douglas J. Cuomo, Ko Matsushita (which will be sung in Japanese) and Bora Yoon, whose work is billed as ''a choral sound installation.''
 The program also includes the premiere of a multimedia version of Michael Gordon's ''Every Stop on the F Train'' (a collaboration with the filmmaker Bill Morrison), ''The Song I Sing'' by Stephen Flaherty and ''In Paradisum'' by Lynn Ahrens and Ernst Krenek. 
 These young singers are notable for the beauty of their youthfully pure voices and for their technical sophistication. ''Transient Glory II,'' the choir's latest CD, highlights their talents in works ranging from Ms. Weir's evocative ''I Carry Your Heart With Me'' to Tod Machover's harmonically and rhythmically challenging ''I Dreamt a Dream.''

HEADLINE: A Town Loved for What It Is -- and Isn't

BYLINE: By CHARLES PASSY

 BODY:
WHEN local residents talk about the lure of Stuart, a dot-on-the-map place on the southeast coast of Florida, they often start by noting what it lacks: as in buildings taller than four stories or a downtown fast-food restaurant. 
 But all that is meant to showcase what the city and area -- Stuart is the seat of Martin County -- really offers: uncluttered shoreline; a historic downtown with boutiques and chic restaurants; and a former silent-movie theater, the Lyric, that has been refashioned into a jewel of a contemporary performing arts center. 
 Perhaps most important, though, is the local population, which appreciates Stuart for what it is -- and isn't -- and has fought hard to preserve its quiet, free-spirited character. ''There are a lot of independent souls here,'' said John Loesser, the longtime executive director of the 500-seat Lyric.
 Mr. Loesser added that he can tell as much from his audiences. They not only devour a cultural diet of everything from southern rock to the Borscht Belt shtick of Jackie Mason, they also stand and cheer for just about every performer. That's a rarity in South Florida, where theater patrons are known to leave before the end of a show to beat the traffic. 
 Then again, Martin County isn't like sprawling Palm Beach County, its mobbed neighbor to the south, where the emphasis is more on the chattering social scene associated with the condo-community and country-club lifestyle. And it's also not like St. Lucie County, its increasingly crowded neighbor to the north, which has gained a reputation as a poor man's Palm Beach.
 ''We're the rose between the thorns,'' said Dave Derrenbacker, a broker with Water Pointe Realty Group in Stuart.
 All three counties, which rely on seasonal winter and spring residents from the North to fuel the local economy, have seen growth slow in the past year, as a once-booming real estate market has stalled. But in Stuart and nearby towns like Jensen Beach and Palm City, the slump has been less noticeable because growth has always been kept in check, local real estate agents say. 
 That means that those who buy second homes in the area today, ranging from million-dollar waterfront estates to close-to-downtown single-family homes priced below $500,000, are able to enjoy much the same lifestyle as buyers from a decade or two ago. 
 And that relaxed attitude of the local residents can't be overlooked. That's why John Olson, a lifelong resident of the New York region, bought a second home here in 2001 -- a three-bedroom house for around $500,000. 
 He had looked at wealthy Palm Beach County to the south (and similarly well-heeled Indian River County to the north) and didn't like what he saw compared with Martin County. ''It's like you had to wear your balance sheet on your sleeve,'' he said.
 The Scene
 Downtown Stuart remains the city's -- and county's -- focal point. Aside from the shopping, dining and entertainment, it's simply a great place to stroll. Not only are there historic buildings aplenty -- the Lyric dates from 1926 -- but downtown streets lead to a promenade along the St. Lucie River. Community events like jazz concerts and arts and crafts shows are often held along the streets or on the promenade. 
 At the same time, a more cosmopolitan element comes into play downtown, where a New Urbanist-style redevelopment plan was put in place two decades ago that encouraged pedestrian-friendly design and welcomed merchants of all kinds: a sandal shop, a pottery studio, an ice cream parlor and fudge emporium. The result is both homey and upscale -- think Opie gone yuppie -- that's vaguely reminiscent of the Greenwich Village of decades ago. 
 Or so it might seem to Michael Braid, a New York real estate developer who bought property in downtown Stuart a few years ago. He still has an apartment in New York, but for all intents and purposes, Stuart is home. ''It's my own mini-Manhattan,'' he said.
 But there's also an emphasis on all things aquatic in Stuart, because Martin County not only fronts the Atlantic, but also incorporates parts of the St. Lucie and Indian Rivers and extends all the way west to Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater lake in the South. 
 ''We offer world-class fishing in all three genres -- freshwater, inshore saltwater and offshore saltwater,'' said Mike Holliday, a local charter-boat captain. But Martin also has outdoor adventures of other kinds, from horseback riding to hiking, particularly at local preserves and state parks, like Jonathan Dickinson State Park.
 Pros
 In addition to the obvious -- waterfront access, fewer people -- Stuart is also convenient to Palm Beach County, particularly the social and entertainment hubs of Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. 
 Cons
 Say what you will about Palm Beach County -- or the rest of South Florida -- but it still has better shopping and dining and a livelier cultural scene than Stuart, which lacks a major art museum, or even a decent music club or two. And its limited-growth philosophy notwithstanding, the city has its share of sprawl. Drive along the busiest stretches of Route 1, and you'll find the same strip malls and fast-food restaurants that are a fact of life in the rest of South Florida. 
 The Real Estate Market
 No doubt about it: Stuart has taken a hit during the real estate downturn. Figures from the Realtor Association of Martin County show that prices of single-family homes have dropped by 17 percent -- from a median figure of $265,250 to $221,910 -- in the past year. 
 Housing in the heart of downtown, within a block or two of the Lyric, is limited. But within a short walk or drive are leafy neighborhoods, with homes built decades ago that retain an old Florida feel. (But not old Florida pricing: the ones along the St. Lucie River can easily go well beyond $1 million.)
 Beyond downtown, there are a couple of other compass points to consider. To the east, you'll find such stretches of prime shoreline as Sewall's Point, a well-to-do town on a tip of land that's bordered by the St. Lucie and Indian Rivers, and Hutchinson Island, which fronts the Atlantic and includes one of the region's most exclusive gated communities, Sailfish Point. 
 Homes near or in downtown Stuart range from $350,000 to $2 million, while those in Sewall's Point and Sailfish Point go for between $500,000 and $25 million. To the west, you'll find newer communities of the sort typical throughout South Florida. One interesting exception is in Palm City, a western suburb of Stuart. The recently unveiled Canopy Creek has homes with slightly more breathing space than the norm (there are just 300 residences, starting at around $600,000, planned for the 700-acre space) in a nature preserve-like setting.
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION 16,155, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate.
 SIZE 8.5 square miles.
 WHO'S BUYING Like most South Florida towns, Stuart attracts many retirees from the Northeast. Where it differs, real estate agents say, is that it attracts an equal number from the Midwest.
 WHERE Stuart is in southeast Florida, about 40 miles north of West Palm Beach.
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING A handful of midprice hotel chains have properties in the area, but if you're looking for something a cut above, the Hutchinson Island Marriott Beach Resort & Marina (555 N.E. Ocean Boulevard, 772-225-3700; www.marriott.com) is widely considered the best option in town, with rooms starting at $279 a night in season and $159 during the off-season.

 'THE HUMAN FACE IS A MONUMENT' Titled after a 1965 movie by the underground filmmaker Stan VanDerBeek (1927-1984), ''The Human Face Is a Monument'' is a lively group show at Guild & Greyshkul that could be subtitled ''And Glossy Magazines Are a Feminist Gold Mine.'' 
 May Wilson (1905-1986) is represented by several little-known collages from the late 1960s, whose latticelike layering of images create a kaleidoscopic mix of voyeurism, patterning and interior. In Sarah Charlesworth's ''Figure Drawings,'' a work initiated 20 years ago, 40 small, individually framed figurative silhouettes -- mostly sculptures -- catalog poses, gestures and meanings. 
 Dana Hoey's latest, possibly transitional, work contrasts different female roles and the passage of time in loose-limbed quilts of images. Sara Greenberger Rafferty uses pictures of fried eggs to accent the absurdity of some of the roles women play. In a 1982 video Martha Rosler dismembers an issue of Vogue magazine, verbally and unaided by scissors. And, finally, ''The Geeks 2008,'' right, a large new work by Anya Kielar, uses fabric, paint and inkjet prints to create pale female silhouettes that invoke both a Greek chorus and the alert, sharp-elbowed women of Picasso's ''Demoiselles D'Avignon.'' 
 In a separate area, collages and films made between 1950 and 1980 by Mr. VanDerBeek -- father of two of the three artists in charge of this gallery -- reverberate with nearly everything on view, reintroducing a neglected artist and confirming that neither feminism nor collage is exclusively female terrain. (Through May 3, Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, 212-625-9224, guildgreyshkul.com.) ROBERTA SMITH 
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'DARGERISM: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AND HENRY DARGER,' through Sept. 21. The great Outsider Henry Darger (1892-1973) was completely unknown as an artist during his own lifetime. Now his epic adventure, ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion'' is famous and a big influence on mainstream artists. This intriguing exhibition presents 12 of Darger's gorgeous, bizarre watercolors and works by 11 contemporary artists who have been inspired by him, including Justine Kurland, Trenton Doyle Hancock and, most surprisingly, Paula Rego. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'DESIGNED FOR PLEASURE: THE WORLD OF EDO JAPAN IN PRINTS AND PAINTINGS, 1680-1860,' through May 4. Organized by the Japanese Art Society, this show anchors the ''floating world'' of ukiyo-e prints firmly in economic and social reality. It includes works by well-known artists, including Hokusai and Hiroshige, and emphasizes the entrepreneurial role of print publishers and the relationship between printmaking, painting and literature in the Edo period. Because the prints are sensitive to light, ''Designed for Pleasure'' will be shown in two installments. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: '$;MURAKAMI,' through July 13. Bring the kids and the shopping-centered tweens. This survey of Takashi Murakami, the artist frequently called the Japanese Andy Warhol, has it all: immense, toylike sculptures; an animated cartoon that rivals Disney; and a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique (Brooklyn's first!) selling Murakami bags. But it also elucidates the trajectory of an artist who began by recycling Japanese popular culture and then gradually figured out how to go deeper, harnessing Japanese traditions of painting, craft and spirituality. The art-commerce, high-low conundrums are fun, but the steady improvement in the paintings is the real heart of the matter. Along with the animated cartoons, which should please aesthetes of all ages, there is a moral component as well. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,' through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ARCHIVE FEVER: USES OF THE DOCUMENT IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' through May 4. You need no grounding in art theory to understand the messages generated by this powerful brain-pincher of a theme show. The archive of the title is less a thing or a place than a concept, an immersive environment: the sum total of documentary images, mostly photographic, circulating in the culture, on the street, in the media and finally in what is called the collective memory. From an Andy Warhol silk-screen of a black civil rights demonstrator attacked by police dogs, to a gallery wallpapered with the front pages of international newspapers reporting on the destruction of the twin towers, truth, untruth and their consequences make up the riveting story here. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'THE COLLECTIONS OF BARBARA BLOOM,' through May 4. Instead of the walk-in installations for which Ms. Bloom is best known, this survey displays pieces from different phases of her career as discrete works of sculpture, assemblage, collage, photography and design. This is confusing, but attentive viewers will profit from studying her ideologically subversive, dryly humorous and formally inventive play with many different forms of representation, from faux-antique plaster self-portrait busts to a found-object sculpture in the form of a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (See above.) (Johnson)
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'THE GENIUS OF JAPANESE LACQUER: MASTERWORKS BY SHIBATA ZESHIN,' through June 15. In Japan, before there was plastic, there was lacquer. Shiny, waterproof and lightweight, it made an excellent coating for wooden cups, bowls, utensils and food storage containers. In the hands of a skilled, ingenious artisan like Shibata Zeshin (1807-1891) it was a high art. This beautiful show presents almost 75 objects -- many dumbfoundingly sumptuous -- and paintings by this man, considered the greatest of all Japanese lacquer artists. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'WARHOL'S JEWS: TEN PORTRAITS RECONSIDERED,' through Aug. 3. In 1980 Andy Warhol produced a series of portraits of famous Jews, including Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and the Marx Brothers. When they appeared at the Jewish Museum that year, the critics hated them. But they were warmly received by Jewish audiences when they were exhibited in museums and Jewish institutions around the country. Viewing them in this return engagement, it is hard to imagine anyone growing very excited for or against such bland, posterlike images. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GUSTAVE COURBET,' through May 18. Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion and dissent. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JASPER JOHNS: GRAY,' through May 4. Since his paintings of targets and American flags took the art world by storm 50 years ago, Jasper Johns has been a cultural fact and the subject of numerous museum exhibitions. But this is one of the best. Moody, opulent and eloquent, it singles out his many paintings in gray, the color at the core of his sensibility, along with numerous sculptures, drawings and prints that are inherently gray. Together they chronicle his maturation from brilliant, methodical young artist to a deeper, more lyrical, less predictable one. And frankly, it is almost a relief to follow the incessant unfolding of this singular career without the brightly colored, better-known masterpieces. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS,' through May 11. If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 THE MET: 'SILVERSMITHS TO THE NATION: THOMAS FLETCHER AND SIDNEY GARDINER, 1808-1842,' through May 4. Blending neo-Classical kitsch, patriotic flair and superb craftsmanship, the Philadelphia silversmiths Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner pumped up the genre of the commemorative cup to works of awesome, small-scale monumentalism. Standing almost 30 inches from its hairy paw feet to the furrowed brow of a bellicose eagle mounted on the lid of its soup tureen bowl, an urn made in 1813 to honor Capt. Isaac Hull was at the time the heaviest, tallest and most complex work in silver ever produced in North America. It is still pretty impressive. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: DREAD SCOTT: 'WELCOME TO AMERICA,' through June 1. Dread Scott's installation with an American flag on the floor caused a flap in 1989 when the first President Bush disapproved, and this New York artist continues to make issue-specific work in a classic political-art mode. The installations, sculptures and videos in this survey dramatize Hurricane Katrina, the incarceration of black males and the Iraq war as if they were all part of a single national problem, and he argues forcefully that they are. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COLOR CHART: REINVENTING COLOR, 1950 TO TODAY,' through May 12. Organized by Ann Temkin, a curator in the museum's department of painting and sculpture, color functions as a ready-made in ''Color Chart'' -- something to be bought or appropriated, rather than mixed on a palette. The show is a rejoinder to the notion of color as the province of formalists, and to the idea that Minimal and Conceptual art comes only in shades of black, white and gray. In the upper section of the lobby a floor created by the artist Jim Lambie surrounds concentric strips of brightly hued tape. In the galleries there are postwar classics by Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Sherrie Levine. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'TAKE YOUR TIME: OLAFUR ELIASSON,' through June 30. Near the end of a decade crammed with junk-art collectibles geared to junk-bond budgets, we get bare walls, open space, light and color in this survey of work by an artist, born in Denmark in 1967, who is well known for creating immaterialist magic through bare-bones means: literally, in some cases, mist and mirrors. As optically enchanting as the results are, though, in the end we are left wanting more from Mr. Eliasson's less. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I.'' Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt's most famous painted mural, the ''Beethoven Frieze''; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist's signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'WIENER WERKSTaTTE JEWELRY,' through June 30. Founded in 1903, the Wiener Werkstatte, or Vienna Workshops, set out to prove that the modern world still needed fine craftsmanship and good design. Its first product was jewelry, of which this stunning exhibition presents 40 gorgeous examples. Works in gold, silver and semi-precious stones by the workshop's co-founders, Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser, and others -- including, most notably, Dagobert Peche -- magically blur the line between personal ornament and miniature sculpture. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'TOMMA ABTS,' through June 29. The small, hard-edged abstractions by this German-born painter, who is based in London and was the 2006 Turner Prize winner, are not showy, but they are intensely absorbing. Basic, formal elements like stripes, arcs, circles, planes and polygons are carefully layered, juxtaposed and interwoven in all sorts of subtly eccentric ways. Ms. Abts's colors are muted but seductive, and she adds highlights and shadows, creating mysterious, three-dimensional illusions. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LIBRARY: 'MONUMENTAL FRANCE: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDOUARD BALDUS' AND SKETCHES ON GLASS: CLICHES-VERRE FROM THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,' through June 28. This pair of exhibitions focuses on the experimental period after the birth of photography (the 1850s through the 1870s). Film had not yet been invented, but glass-plate and paper negatives allowed artists to micromanage the camera's performance or to bypass it entirely. ''Monumental France: The Photographs of Edouard Baldus'' gathers 38 artisanal prints of French architectural landmarks. ''Sketches on Glass: Cliches-Verre From the New York Public Library'' presents prints made with hand-drawn glass plates on light-sensitive paper (no camera required). Together these shows reveal that artists in mid-19th-century France blurred the distinction between the photograph and the unique object. Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 930-0830, nypl.org (Rosenberg)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through May 25. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION,' through May 12. This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FLOW,' through June 29. Afropolitanism is the modish tag for recent work by young African artists. What unites them is a shared view of Africa, less as a place than as a concept, a cultural force -- one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean, part of the whole, but with its own tides and temperatures. This idea, or something like it, lies behind ''Flow,'' a fine-textured survey of 20 artists who, with a few exceptions, were born in Africa after 1970 but who now live in Europe or the United States. The show is a worthy successor to ''Freestyle'' and ''Frequency,'' benchmark surveys of new African-American art. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'DAN FLAVIN: THE 1964 GREEN GALLERY EXHIBITION' We're used to seeing Dan Flavin's fluorescent light sculptures in spiffy and august museum settings, where they can look sleek and grand, with no hardware-store bloodlines showing. But when the work initially appeared more than 40 years ago, it made a different impression. And we can sense what it might have been from this re-creation of Mr. Flavin's first solo -- at the Green Gallery, owned by Richard Bellamy, in the late fall of 1964 -- using fluorescent tubing as the sole medium. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through May 3. (Cotter)
 'WINE, WORSHIP AND SACRIFICE: THE GOLDEN GRAVES OF ANCIENT VANI' In small but elegant new galleries, a study center founded in 2006 under the auspices of New York University presents its inaugural exhibition. This show offers more than 100 objects unearthed from ancient graves in Vani, a cosmopolitan city established in Colchis -- modern-day Georgia -- in the eighth century B.C. It includes beautiful, intricate gold jewelry discovered in grave sites of the rich and powerful; the life-size bronze torso of a youth made in classic Hellenistic style; and two strikingly exotic bronze lamps with functional parts in the form of elephant heads. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7810, nyu.edu/isaw, through June 1. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 ASHLEY BICKERTON In garish digital photographs printed on canvas, partly overpainted and presented within wide, wooden frames elaborately decorated to resemble Indonesian tourist kitsch, Mr. Bickerton stars as an Ugly American in a South Pacific paradise. His skin is blue, and he is accompanied by voluptuous female islanders whose partly nude bodies are painted in tropical hues. The question is, does unchecked hedonism lead to erotic utopia or moral insanity? Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923, lehmannmaupin.com, through May 3. (Johnson)
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'DETROIT' The McDermott & McGough Wayback Machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Nicholas Robinson consists of extraordinarily lucid, richly colored staged photographs resembling stills from an old film about teenage love, desire, wanderlust and guilt. Nicholas Robinson, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com, through May 17. (Johnson)
 THOMAS NOZKOWSKI At 64, Mr. Nozkowski has erased the division between geometric and organic form -- an early Modernist bugaboo -- melding them into a signature style unburdened by a signature motif. Each painting feels like a new adventure in shape, space, color and suggested meaning, and also like a joke on Modernist seriousness that is also serious, most of all in its visual richness and telling surface variations. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through May 3. (Smith)
 SCOTT OLSON The small paintings in this artist's first solo show filter a loosely Constructivist geometry through the scale and turned-in concentration of manuscript illumination. Their outsize emphasis on process, amplified by contrasting techniques, colors and surfaces, makes them extra engrossing, especially for canvases not much larger than your face. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, taxterandspengemann.com, through May 10. (Smith)
 PIOTR UKLANSKI One of the bad boys of contemporary art goes big time and sustains quite a bit of his badness. Diverse works in a labyrinth of galleries move through the pomp and circumstance of the Communist, Roman Catholic and Modernist beliefs; Polish Christmas traditions; and the Solidarity movement, with a closing reference to the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Germans. Festivalist identity-art spectacle is a target; yet a sense of Polish suffering and pride comes across. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com, through May 17. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 ALICE O'MALLEY: 'COMMUNITY OF ELSEWHERES' An old-style space on the rapidly gentrifying Lower East Side gives a sense of undergrounds present or recently past in this show of Alice O'Malley's full-length portrait photographs. Artists (Nicole Eisenman, Justine Kurland, Jocelyn Taylor); poets (Eileen Myles); performers (Dean Johnson); party givers (Kenny Kenny); and professional partygoers (Viva) mingle in a display organized by the singer Antony that catches a still gritty cross-dressing, reverse-grandeur moment that wasn't so long ago -- about 2001 -- but is fading fast. Participant Inc., 253 East Houston Street, (212) 254-4334, participantinc.org, through May 4. (Cotter)
 BLAKE RAYNE The abstract paintings in this show, an important one for this impressive New York artist, were made with aerosol spray directed at folded, cut and stitched-together canvas. And the pictures are only part of a larger conceptual package that includes the display of the paintings' shipping containers and has involved closing the gallery for a week. Mr. Rayne's taking apart of art conventions is erudite, visually effective and of a piece: the installation looks like a cross between a paneled library and a spreading bruise. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com, through May 18. (Cotter)
 'UNDER PAIN OF DEATH' This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including ''The Last Supper,'' an Errol Morris-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrom, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org, through May 10. (Johnson)
 'YOU & ME, SOMETIMES ...' In this intriguingly textured group show, organized by Sandra Antelo-Suarez, history, politics, pop culture and conceptualism do a dance, and objects glance off one another without quite touching. Cool shows tend to work this way at present, to be about something but not. And any show with Minerva Cuevas, Allan Kaprow, Karin Schneider and Francisco de Goya tends to work well, and it is even better when the show includes work by artists not often seen here: in this case the young Bosnian conceptualist Sejla Kameric; the New Zealand filmmaker Darcy Lange; Mario Garcia Torres of Mexico City; and the Italian-born Claudio Perna (1937-1997).

 Out of Town
 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM : 'COLOR AS FIELD: AMERICAN PAINTING, 1950-1975,' through May 26. An overdue, if far from perfect, reconsideration of Color Field painting reintroduces the joyful pictorial derring-do of an art movement partly done in by the single-minded advocacy of its biggest fan, the great American art critic Clement Greenberg. It is wonderful to see some of the best of this work float free of the Greenbergian claims for greatness and inevitability, propelled by the fantastic soft power of brilliant color, big scale and judicious amounts of pristine raw canvas -- especially as wielded by Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski. Perhaps humorless power-lust prevented Greenberg from seeing that if, as he said, Abstract Expressionism was Baroque, then Color Field might be Rococo: beautiful, sometimes frivolous and even comedic. Eighth Street and F Street, NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 ANNA CRAYCROFT: 'THE AGENCY OF THE ORPHAN' In her impressive solo debut Ms. Craycroft systematically explores why so many protagonists of 19th- and 20th-century fiction have been orphans. A wraparound installation displays 295 framed photographic portraits of orphan heroes from literature, movies and animated cartoons, and Victorian-style fountains feature heads of weeping children. Ms. Craycroft's provocative book, combining semiotic and Jungian analysis, explains what it all means. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com; closes on Friday. (Johnson)
 JIM DOW: 'OLD SCHOOL' Jim Dow has taken large color photographs of Southern courthouses, baseball stadiums and the men's clubs of New York City. Here he visits the formative halls of power: lecture theaters, cafeterias, library carrels and dorm rooms at East Coast universities and schools like Phillips Academy, Tufts and Yale Law. Sometimes they look innocuous -- as if they could be anywhere -- but usually they definitely do not. Occasionally they resemble installation pieces by Mark Dion. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, janetbordeninc.com, closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 MICHAELA EICHWALD: 'ERGRIFFENES DASEIN: ARTIST WRITER MENTALIST' In her first New York solo this young Cologne artist works small, oscillating between Expressionism, Neo- and neo-Neo-Expressionism, with some punk rawness thrown in for good measure. Lacquer links the paintings to ceramics and enamels, while the sculptures often combine small found objects, sometimes cast in resin. In all cases a spirited, sardonic compactness results. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, at Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, reenaspaulings.com; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 TONY FEHER A poet-engineer of the everyday, Mr. Feher works with secondhand marbles, plastic bags and straws, bottles and jars of every sort, coat hangers and chair legs, often achieving a startling and ingenious beauty. His scrappy little sculptures are surprisingly at home in this fancy uptown space; perhaps because their formal economy, humor and modesty echoes that of Pace familiars like Saul Steinberg, Joseph Cornell and Alexander Calder. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'PARMIGIANINO'S ''ANTEA'': A BEAUTIFUL ARTIFICE' Exhibitions don't come any smaller than ''Parmigianino's 'Antea': A Beautiful Artifice.'' A painting, a wall text, a nugget of a scholarly catalog, and that's it. It's enough. Certain pictures, like certain performers, don't need troops of extras to make a large effect. Solo suits them. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; closes on Thursday. . (Cotter)
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'BECAUSE OF HIM' The McDermott & McGough Wayback Machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Cheim & Read presents smoothly painted scenes from midcentury Hollywood melodramas and a terrific room whose walls are covered by more than 180 mirrors. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF TIME: EUROPEAN CLOCKS AND WATCHES FROM THE COLLECTION' This enthralling, compact show presents about 90 European timepieces, ranging from pocket watches to grandfather clocks and dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries. There are traditional mantel clocks in wooden, peaked-roofed houses and extravagantly fanciful forms like one from 1579 that has a revolving globe engraved with star charts and figures of the zodiac held up on the wingtips of a flying horse, all beautifully fashioned in silver. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: 'PRICKED: EXTREME EMBROIDERY' The second in a series of exhibitions (following last year's ''Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting''), ''Pricked'' makes another case for needlecraft without the ''craft.'' The show places widely known contemporary artists like Laura Owens and Ghada Amer alongside Elaine Reichek and others who have been working with thread and textiles since the '70s. In the best works historical and technical concerns overlap, just as they do in traditional embroidered samplers. 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.

 'RE-ORIENTATIONS: ISLAMIC ART AND THE WEST IN THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES' There have been major exhibitions on the influence of Islamic culture on Europe. But relatively few have traced influence the other way, which is what this small, scholarly show, the product of a Hunter College art history seminar, does. Using little-studied objects from the Metropolitan Museum's Islamic collection, it looks at art produced in India, Iran and Iraq in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Western colonial influences were flowing in. Far from being an aesthetically dim era, it was one of fascinating, complex change. Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery, Hunter College, 68th Street at Lexington Avenue, (212) 772-4991, hunter.cuny.edu; closes on Saturday.. (Cotter)
 'THANK YOU FOR COMING: TRIPLE CANDIE: 2001-08' Manhattan's most interesting alternative space -- maybe its only real one -- is closing its doors with a backward look at its own history. The show includes contributions from artists who did projects there, along with remnants of the space's most innovative offerings: a series of ''nonart'' exhibitions ranging from an unauthorized David Hammons retrospective composed of photocopied catalog pages; a permanent collection show made up of art magazine clips; and a posthumous survey of the work of the fictional artist Lester Hayes. Triple Candie's program of puncturing notions of genius, authenticity and value whizzed straight by most of the art establishment, but will surely end up in the history books. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 865-0783, triplecandie.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 MARTHA WILSON: 'PHOTO/TEXT WORKS, 1971-74' In 1976 the conceptual artist and performer Martha Wilson opened her TriBeCa loft to the public as Franklin Furnace, a nonprofit documentary center, archive and exhibition space for artists' books and ephemera that housed some of the most intriguing and fleeting work in town. More than 30 years later, Ms. Wilson is having a show of her own 1970s work, which was in sync with early feminist concerns about distorted and self-distorting images of women. But it also explored what it meant to be self-created and constantly self-revised as an artist and as a person. It's her first solo ever, and it's a gem. A pioneer in preserving art turns out to be a pioneer in creating it. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Conoco Gains on Oil Prices, Not So Much on Gasoline

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent as soaring oil and natural gas prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production.
 Oil prices have increased nearly sixfold since 2002 on surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the weak dollar. 
 Net income in the quarter rose to $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, from $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, in the same period a year ago.
 Revenue in the quarter rose 33 percent, to $54.88 billion.
 Excluding one-time items, the company earned about $2.56 a share. Analysts, on average, had expected it to bring in about $2.41 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Gene Pisasale, who helps manage $12 billion at PNC Capital Advisors, said the company's exploration and production results were a ''blowout,'' and made up the difference between the reported results and analyst estimates.
 Benchmark oil prices in the United States averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up almost 70 percent from a year earlier.
 But margins to produce gasoline have plummeted as refiners have struggled to push through the higher crude costs to customers. According to federal data, first-quarter gasoline prices rose only 33 percent year over year, less than half the increase in the price of crude.
 Profits from the company's exploration and production business rose 24 percent, to $2.89 billion, in the quarter. ConocoPhillips said earnings from its refining and marketing business fell nearly 55 percent, to $520 million.
 Net income from the company's 20 percent stake in the Russian oil company Lukoil stake nearly tripled, to $710 million.
 Oil and gas production, excluding the Lukoil stake, was down more than 11 percent, to 1.79 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, mostly because of the loss of projects that were taken over by the Venezuelan government.
 Shares of ConocoPhillips fell $1.59, or 1.9 percent, to $82.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Loan Problem Is a Benefit for Some
 Investment bankers may be worried about layoffs, but it looks as if an awful lot of lawyers stand to benefit from the subprime mortgage crisis. A study released by Navigant Consulting found that nearly as many subprime-related federal lawsuits were filed in the first quarter of 2008 as in the last six months of 2007: 170 in the three months ended March 31, compared with 181 in the six months ended Dec. 31. Those numbers may well understate the total, because they do not include claims filed in state courts. 
 The current pace of lawsuits -- which the study's author, the Navigant managing director Jeff Nielsen, calculated as two lawsuits per day since Jan. 1 -- means it is almost certain that more cases will be filed in the current financial crisis than resulted from the savings and loan collapses of the early 1990s. The study breaks the litigation into several categories. Nearly half of the cases filed in the quarter -- 46 percent -- were class-action suits on behalf of borrowers, many of whom contend that lenders provided inadequate disclosure of loan terms. Another 26 percent of the cases are securities suits, and more than half of those were class actions contending securities fraud. 
 Perhaps most interestingly, the portion of filings involving contract disputes, usually between buyers and sellers of securities backed by assets including mortgage loans, fell in the quarter to just 10 percent of the total from 22 percent last year. The decline could mean that buyers view the cases as not worth filing -- or that they are still trying to figure out the size of their losses and whom to blame. JONATHAN GLATER
 Big Difference
 With the credit market still in lockdown and the equity market on a downswing, taking a company public might seem a bit loopy. Two companies that actually took the plunge, American Waterworks and Intrepid Potash, exemplify how much of a split personality this market has. 
 There has been much hand-wringing about the horrible environment for initial public offerings -- but the reality is a bit more nuanced. At $24 billion, the volume of new issuances in the United States actually doubled in the first quarter from a year earlier. But excluding the stock sale from Visa, the total value in the first quarter was about $4.6 billion, down 62 percent from last year, according to Dealogic. 
 Those that did brave the market have experienced wildly different outcomes. Like American Waterworks, which hit the market Wednesday. The spinoff of the German utility giant RWE might normally have attracted a lot of attention from risk-averse institutional investors.
 But it was far from popular. The stock was priced at $21.50, or 40 percent below what it originally thought it could grab last year. And shares then fell as much as 6 percent.
 On the other hand, the stock of Intrepid Potash, which makes fertilizer, popped as much as 60 percent in its debut Tuesday. Commodity-crazed investors fell over each other to buy a piece of the agricultural company, whose main product, potash, has registered a 131 percent increase in seven months.

 Catching On
 Rights issues are all the rage. The Royal Bank of Scotland announced a nearly $24 billion rights offering to shore up its capital base. And last week, Blockbuster made a $1.35 billion all-cash offer to buy Circuit City, with part of that to be financed by a rights offering.
 While it is undeniably huge, the offering by the Royal Bank of Scotland is not unusual. Rights offerings are common in Europe, unlike in the United States. Blockbuster's announcement is particularly interesting, because it may provide a preview of a financing mechanism for American companies in times of dry credit markets. 
 In a typical rights offering, a publicly traded company issues rights to a company's shareholders to buy stock at a discount in a certain amount of time. The rights are often transferable and trade on the stock market during this take-up period. Shareholders have an incentive to exercise the rights or otherwise be diluted by the issuance of new equity. 
 But an offering can be dangerous business. Back in 1987, Blue Arrow of Britain financed its purchase of Manpower with a rights issue. But only 38 percent of Blue Arrow's rights issue was taken up, and the underwriter, National Westminster Bank, was forced to purchase the remainder -- at a loss of almost $:100 million. 
 So why would Blockbuster suggest using this financing technique? First, it reflects the difficulty of obtaining debt financing. At this point in the credit crisis, and especially after the Genesco-Finish Line fiasco, no bank will entirely finance a minnow swallowing a whale -- and Circuit City is twice the size of Blockbuster.
 And a straight-out private investment in public equity would be difficult for Blockbuster. If the $1.35 billion offer were fully financed by equity, Blockbuster would be issuing more than 100 percent of its equity. 
 There are reports that Carl C. Icahn, above, a director of Blockbuster and its largest shareholder, may backstop a Blockbuster rights offering. But the underwriting risks for an investment bank are high. So if the offering ever happens, there is a possibility that Mr. Icahn may end up owning a significant interest in the combined Blockbuster and Circuit City.
 All of this may be purely theoretical, because the Blockbuster offer appears dead on arrival. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF
 Fully Funded
 If the private equity business is in a coma, nobody seems to have told investors.
 Warburg Pincus just closed a $15 billion buyout fund, $3 billion more than it had originally sought, making it the fourth-largest buyout pool in the United States, according to Private Equity Intelligence. The announcement is the latest sign that although private equity deals are scarce, institutional investors, pension funds and university endowments are eagerly writing checks to private equity funds. And with fewer investment opportunities, a lot of this cash is building up. 
 Private Equity Intelligence calculates that buyout funds currently have a combined $820 billion in uninvested capital. And there is another $290 billion in the pipeline. That is more than a trillion dollars. CYRUS SANATI

HEADLINE: Soft-Price Pampering: Spas Reflect the Economy

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
SPAS have been working hard over the past few years to market themselves as a necessary part of a healthy lifestyle, not an indulgence.
 But now that consumers are feeling anxious about paying for even more basic needs -- like gas, house payments and butter -- some spas are responding with a different strategy to appeal to stressed-out, maxed-out customers: discounts. 
 ''We kind of looked at this recession we're in and said, look, for the next few months, or until this recession can somehow be evaded, let's cut our core program price in half,'' said Alan Coombs, owner of the Green Valley Spa in St. George, Utah.
 A recent headline on the spa's Web site read, ''RECE$$ION DEPRESSION?'' and Mr. Coombs said he has had a great response to the offer: $248 a night per person for the All About Fitness program, which includes lodging, meals, fitness classes and daily hikes in the nearby canyons and desert. (Weekend rates and spa treatments are extra.) 
 ''Even in recessions or difficult times, spas are busy because people need what we have to offer,'' Mr. Coombs said, an observation few people suffering from economically induced tension would challenge.
 Whether the most anxious consumers can spring for a relaxing massage is another matter, but a growing number of spas are offering deals to attract customers during tighter times, a trend that may have as much to do with technology as with the economy. 
 ''I think the Internet has been kind of a win-win for both spas and consumers,'' said Susie Ellis, president of SpaFinder, a Web site that publishes spa reviews and deals.
 ''A lot of spas are just sending certain specials to people who are on their e-mail list,'' Ms. Ellis said, adding that many spas use these lists to promote deals that aren't advertised on their Web sites. Twice a month, SpaFinder also sends out an e-mail newsletter listing specials at various spas.
 Following the example of airlines and hotels, which have long relied on technology to adjust their prices based on changing supply and demand (a practice called ''revenue management''), more spas are using this strategy to beef up their bookings during slow times. For the most part, these deals involve midweek and off-season discounts, last-minute specials and packages that are cheaper than booking several services a la carte. 
 While destination spas have traditionally offered lower room rates Sunday through Thursday or during their low seasons, like summer in a hot climate, these types of discounts are now spreading to treatment prices as well.
 For instance, the Oasis Day Spa in New York City has been running a Two for Tuesday special for the past two years. Customers who book two 60-minute treatments on a Tuesday, usually a slow day, get the second one for half price. This year, the spa is also doing a Wednesday promotion with selected massages and facials priced at 1998 levels.
 ''We've always run specials, but more so now,'' said Niki Tortoreti, Oasis Day Spa's marketing director, noting that Tuesday and Wednesday are now just as busy as Saturday. 
 That's not marketing hype. I recently took advantage of the Wednesday special to get a 60-minute Swedish massage for just $70. It was a great deal (the regular price is $110) and a great massage, but the relaxation area felt like the waiting room at a crowded doctor's office, with a dozen people in bathrobes listening for a therapist to pop in and call their name.
 Sometimes, these midweek discounts are small, like the $15 you can save on a 50-minute massage at the spa at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City ($195 Monday through Thursday).
 But when these deals include lodging, the savings can be substantial. Summer rates at the Miraval resort in Tucson, Ariz., are about $200 less than during peak season (about $600 a night, including meals, programs and a $125 spa credit). And when customers bring a friend between June 16 and Sept. 22, they both can save an additional 20 percent off that rate.
 One of the best current midweek deals is at the Equinox Resort in Manchester Village, Vt. Through May 22, their Cloud 999 special costs $999 and includes three nights of lodging for two people, plus a $999 credit toward spa treatments. (This package is only valid for Sunday through Tuesday arrivals.)
 There are some tradeoffs with these off-peak specials, like less appealing weather outside the temperature-controlled treatment rooms, or sometimes eerily empty grounds.
 For instance, I stayed at the Ojai Valley Inn and Resort on the Thursday after Labor Day last September and did not encounter another soul while using the steam room, Jacuzzi and lounge before my massage. At first I felt giddy having the whole place to myself, but by the next morning at the pool, my friend and I were a bit bored by the sparse selection of people to watch. (Yet we only paid $274 for the night, versus the typical weekend rate starting at $400.)
 Rather than letting rooms remain empty and appointment calendars half-full, some spas are running last-minute specials, usually promoted online or via e-mail newsletters. For instance, the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah, publishes Last Minute Hot Deals on its Web site, highlighting dates these deals are available during the coming month.
 A recent offer included lodging, meals, guided hikes, fitness and nutrition classes and use of the resort facilities for $269 a person per night (with a two-night minimum). Most of the March and April dates that qualified for this offer were weekdays, but Easter weekend was also an option.
 Susie Ellis, SpaFinder's president, said some spas were even posting deals on-site to fill empty time slots, rather than letting staff they are already paying for the day sit idle. 
 ''At the Norwich Inn in Connecticut, they have what they call 'blackboard specials,' '' she said, ''and I think we're going to see a lot more of those.'' 
 As it turns out, these deals are actually printed on a sheet of paper that is displayed at the spa's reception desk, not written on a blackboard, and they're usually only available Tuesday through Thursday, since the spa is typically booked on weekends. 
 The goal is to entice guests who have already booked one treatment to add an extra service for a discounted price, 10 to 35 percent off the regular rate. 
 ''It helps us be able to book our therapists when it's quiet, and secondly, it allows the guests themselves to try something they may not have normally tried,'' said Betty Loiacono, the spa's director. ''And that turns into a win-win situation for everyone.''
 Although Ms. Loiacono mentioned the industry's traditional aversion to the word ''discount,'' she described herself as a big believer in revenue management, and is even looking into buying software that would allow the spa to charge different prices for treatments based on the time of day.
 ''With any business, you're going to have peak times and slower times,'' she said. ''And if it's tied to the economy, you need to recognize that as well.'' 
 MORE INFORMATION
 IF your tastes run toward pampering spa surroundings, but your budget doesn't, there are other ways to economize besides taking time off midweek to snare an off-peak discount.
 One option is to visit a hotel or resort's fancy spa just for the day.
 ''At most resort and hotel spas, even with just the cost of one treatment you can stay in the spa and relaxation area pretty much the whole day,'' said Julie Sinclair, editor in chief of Spa magazine. ''You book the treatment for 2 o'clock and you show up at 10.''
 I used that strategy to visit the spa at the Breakers Hotel and Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in March. If you book at least a 50-minute treatment, you can also use the outdoor lap pool and Jacuzzi (both of which overlook the beach), join a yoga class in the courtyard, and use the steam room and sauna.
 The indoor facilities were disappointing: a steam room that resembled the one at my gym and a surprisingly grim relaxation area with curtains that blocked the ocean view. I also had to ask to use the outdoor pool area, which was the only justification for paying $195 for a 50-minute massage (itself rather mediocre). But that price also included valet parking, normally $30, and the chance to wander the grounds of the historic hotel.
 At the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa in Chandler, Ariz., you do not even have to book a treatment to use the spa's pools, Jacuzzis, steam rooms, saunas and fitness center; hotel guests can buy a day pass for $20 ($35 for nonguests).
 Another tip is to ask for a discount if you are traveling with a group, even if it is just a few friends. 
 ''Almost every spa will do a discount for a group, and the group doesn't have to be that large,'' said Susie Ellis, the president of the Web site SpaFinder.
 Many other deals are designed for just two people, like the package offered by the Cal-a-Vie spa in Vista, Calif., where the second person gets half off the normal weekly rate of $7,395 during certain weeks. (O.K., so that's not exactly cheap, but even wealthy spa-goers like to save.)
 There are also a handful of spas that frequently show up on lists of affordable retreats, like the Oaks at Ojai in Ojai, Calif.; the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah; the New Age Health Spa in Neversink, N.Y.; Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe, N.M.; and Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, which claims it was ''the world's first destination spa.'' 
 SpaFinder lists more than 50 spas in its ''affordable'' category, which means they typically cost less than $300 a night, and some less than $200.
 For that price, you generally get a lower staff-to-guest ratio and less luxurious accommodations, which aren't necessarily as important for this type of vacation.
 As Ms. Ellis pointed out, ''You're there to exercise and have spa treatments, so you're not spending a lot of time in your room.''

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'DARGERISM: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AND HENRY DARGER,' through Sept. 21. The great Outsider Henry Darger (1892-1973) was completely unknown as an artist during his own lifetime. Now his epic adventure, ''The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion'' is famous and a big influence on mainstream artists. This intriguing exhibition presents 12 of Darger's gorgeous, bizarre watercolors and works by 11 contemporary artists who have been inspired by him, including Justine Kurland, Trenton Doyle Hancock and, most surprisingly, Paula Rego. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS,' through May 11. If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) 
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: DREAD SCOTT: 'WELCOME TO AMERICA,' through June 1. Dread Scott's installation with an American flag on the floor caused a flap in 1989 when the first President Bush disapproved, and this New York artist continues to make issue-specific work in a classic political-art mode. The installations, sculptures and videos in this survey dramatize Hurricane Katrina, the incarceration of black males and the Iraq war as if they were all part of a single national problem, and he argues forcefully that they are. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'TAKE YOUR TIME: OLAFUR ELIASSON,' through June 30. Near the end of a decade crammed with junk-art collectibles geared to junk-bond budgets, we get bare walls, open space, light and color in this survey of work by an artist, born in Denmark in 1967, who is well known for creating immaterialist magic through bare-bones means: literally, in some cases, mist and mirrors. As optically enchanting as the results are, though, in the end we are left wanting more from Mr. Eliasson's less. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.

 Galleries: Uptown
 'DAN FLAVIN: THE 1964 GREEN GALLERY EXHIBITION' We're used to seeing Dan Flavin's fluorescent light sculptures in spiffy and august museum settings, where they can look sleek and grand, with no hardware-store bloodlines showing. But when the work initially appeared more than 40 years ago, it made a different impression. And we can sense what it might have been from this re-creation of Mr. Flavin's first solo -- at the Green Gallery, owned by Richard Bellamy, in the late fall of 1964 -- using fluorescent tubing as the sole medium. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through May 3. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 THOMAS NOZKOWSKI At 64, Mr. Nozkowski has erased the division between geometric and organic form -- an early Modernist bugaboo -- melding them into a signature style unburdened by a signature motif. Each painting feels like a new adventure in shape, space, color and suggested meaning, and also like a joke on Modernist seriousness that is also serious, most of all in its visual richness and telling surface variations. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com, through May 3. (Roberta Smith)
 SCOTT OLSON The small paintings in this artist's first solo show filter a loosely Constructivist geometry through the scale and turned-in concentration of manuscript illumination. Their outsize emphasis on process, amplified by contrasting techniques, colors and surfaces, makes them extra engrossing, especially for canvases not much larger than your face. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, taxterandspengemann.com, through May 10. (Smith)
 PIOTR UKLANSKI One of the bad boys of contemporary art goes big time and sustains quite a bit of his badness. Diverse works in a labyrinth of galleries move through the pomp and circumstance of the Communist, Roman Catholic and Modernist beliefs; Polish Christmas traditions; and the Solidarity movement, with a closing reference to the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the Germans. Festivalist identity-art spectacle is a target; yet a sense of Polish suffering and pride comes across. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com, through May 17. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 BLAKE RAYNE The abstract paintings in this show, an important one for this impressive New York artist, were made with aerosol spray directed at folded, cut and stitched-together canvas. And the pictures are only part of a larger conceptual package that includes the display of the paintings' shipping containers and has involved closing the gallery for a week. Mr. Rayne's taking apart of art conventions is erudite, visually effective and of a piece: the installation looks like a cross between a paneled library and a spreading bruise. Miguel Abreu Gallery, 36 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com, through May 18. (Cotter)
 'YOU & ME, SOMETIMES ...' In this intriguingly textured group show, organized by Sandra Antelo-Suarez, history, politics, pop culture and conceptualism do a dance, and objects glance off one another without quite touching. Cool shows tend to work this way at present, to be about something but not. And any show with Minerva Cuevas, Allan Kaprow, Karin Schneider and Francisco de Goya tends to work well, and it is even better when the show includes work by artists not often seen here: in this case the young Bosnian conceptualist Sejla Kameric; the New Zealand filmmaker Darcy Lange; Mario Garcia Torres of Mexico City; and the Italian-born Claudio Perna (1937-1997). Lehmann Maupin, 201 Chrystie Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-0054, lehmannmaupin.com, through May 3. (Cotter) 
 Last Chance
 ANNA CRAYCROFT: 'THE AGENCY OF THE ORPHAN' In her impressive solo debut Ms. Craycroft systematically explores why so many protagonists of 19th- and 20th-century fiction have been orphans. A wraparound installation displays 295 framed photographic portraits of orphan heroes from literature, movies and animated cartoons, and Victorian-style fountains feature heads of weeping children. Ms. Craycroft's provocative book, combining semiotic and Jungian analysis, explains what it all means. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com; closes on Friday. (Johnson)
 JIM DOW: 'OLD SCHOOL' Jim Dow has taken large color photographs of Southern courthouses, baseball stadiums and the men's clubs of New York City. Here he visits the formative halls of power: lecture theaters, cafeterias, library carrels and dorm rooms at East Coast universities and schools like Phillips Academy, Tufts and Yale Law. Sometimes they look innocuous -- as if they could be anywhere -- but usually they definitely do not. Occasionally they resemble installation pieces by Mark Dion. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, janetbordeninc.com, closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 MICHAELA EICHWALD: 'ERGRIFFENES DASEIN: ARTIST WRITER MENTALIST' In her first New York solo this young Cologne artist works small, oscillating between Expressionism, Neo- and neo-Neo-Expressionism, with some punk rawness thrown in for good measure. Lacquer links the paintings to ceramics and enamels, while the sculptures often combine small found objects, sometimes cast in resin. In all cases a spirited, sardonic compactness results. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, at Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, reenaspaulings.com; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 TONY FEHER A poet-engineer of the everyday, Mr. Feher works with secondhand marbles, plastic bags and straws, bottles and jars of every sort, coat hangers and chair legs, often achieving a startling and ingenious beauty. His scrappy little sculptures are surprisingly at home in this fancy uptown space; perhaps because their formal economy, humor and modesty echoes that of Pace familiars like Saul Steinberg, Joseph Cornell and Alexander Calder. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'PARMIGIANINO'S ''ANTEA'': A BEAUTIFUL ARTIFICE' Exhibitions don't come any smaller than ''Parmigianino's 'Antea': A Beautiful Artifice.'' A painting, a wall text, a nugget of a scholarly catalog, and that's it. It's enough. Certain pictures, like certain performers, don't need troops of extras to make a large effect. Solo suits them. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; closes on Thursday. . (Cotter)
 MCDERMOTT & MCGOUGH: 'BECAUSE OF HIM' The McDermott & McGough Wayback Machine is now parked in the American 1950s. Though predictably campy, the duo's treatment of this destination is impressively suave and emotionally complex. This exhibition at Cheim & Read presents smoothly painted scenes from midcentury Hollywood melodramas and a terrific room whose walls are covered by more than 180 mirrors. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: 'PRICKED: EXTREME EMBROIDERY' The second in a series of exhibitions (following last year's ''Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting''), ''Pricked'' makes another case for needlecraft without the ''craft.'' The show places widely known contemporary artists like Laura Owens and Ghada Amer alongside Elaine Reichek and others who have been working with thread and textiles since the '70s. In the best works historical and technical concerns overlap, just as they do in traditional embroidered samplers. 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. 
 (Karen Rosenberg)
 'RE-ORIENTATIONS: ISLAMIC ART AND THE WEST IN THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES' There have been major exhibitions on the influence of Islamic culture on Europe. But relatively few have traced influence the other way, which is what this small, scholarly show, the product of a Hunter College art history seminar, does. Using little-studied objects from the Metropolitan Museum's Islamic collection, it looks at art produced in India, Iran and Iraq in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Western colonial influences were flowing in. Far from being an aesthetically dim era, it was one of fascinating, complex change. Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery, Hunter College, 68th Street at Lexington Avenue, (212) 772-4991, hunter.cuny.edu; closes on Saturday.. (Cotter)
 'THANK YOU FOR COMING: TRIPLE CANDIE: 2001-08' Manhattan's most interesting alternative space -- maybe its only real one -- is closing its doors with a backward look at its own history. The show includes contributions from artists who did projects there, along with remnants of the space's most innovative offerings: a series of ''nonart'' exhibitions ranging from an unauthorized David Hammons retrospective composed of photocopied catalog pages; a permanent collection show made up of art magazine clips; and a posthumous survey of the work of the fictional artist Lester Hayes. Triple Candie's program of puncturing notions of genius, authenticity and value whizzed straight by most of the art establishment, but will surely end up in the history books. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 865-0783, triplecandie.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 MARTHA WILSON: 'PHOTO/TEXT WORKS, 1971-74' In 1976 the conceptual artist and performer Martha Wilson opened her TriBeCa loft to the public as Franklin Furnace, a nonprofit documentary center, archive and exhibition space for artists' books and ephemera that housed some of the most intriguing and fleeting work in town. More than 30 years later, Ms. Wilson is having a show of her own 1970s work, which was in sync with early feminist concerns about distorted and self-distorting images of women. But it also explored what it meant to be self-created and constantly self-revised as an artist and as a person. It's her first solo ever, and it's a gem. A pioneer in preserving art turns out to be a pioneer in creating it. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242, mitchellalgus.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Lease Ends Uncertainty for Red Hook Cargo Docks

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The long-running battle over the future of the cargo docks in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is over.
 After a five-year effort to stave off eviction and the redevelopment of the Red Hook container terminal, American Stevedoring, which has operated at least four piers in Brooklyn since 1994, signed a 10-year lease on Thursday with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 The lease will allow the company to continue operating Piers 7 through 10 and the gantry cranes that sit between Atlantic and Sackett Avenues, unloading cocoa, lumber, steel, specialty foods and other cargo destined for New York City, Long Island and New Jersey. 
 The Bloomberg administration had long wanted to oust American Stevedoring and redevelop the Brooklyn waterfront with distributors, restaurants, luxury housing, marinas and other maritime uses, saying that most of the cargo should have been unloaded in the Port Authority's bigger port, in New Jersey. 
 The battle in Red Hook mirrored the struggle under way on the Far West Side of Manhattan, and in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where once industrial neighborhoods are giving way to residential developers and gentrification.
 But American Stevedoring hung on tenaciously -- even as business declined because of the company's uncertain future -- filing lawsuits and lining up support from local community groups and powerful elected officials, including United States Representative Jerrold L. Nadler.
 ''We saved the Brooklyn port,'' Mr. Nadler, a longtime advocate for the maritime industry, said on Thursday. ''This is a great day for jobs in Brooklyn and for the future of maritime commerce on this side of the river. No one can turn it into a condo anymore.''
 Under the terms of the lease, the Port Authority said, American Stevedoring will pay about $41 million in rent over the life of the lease. The rent, based on the volume of cargo, starts at about the same amount that it did in 1994, and escalates as the volume increases. The Port Authority will also continue to lease four container cranes and two barges to American Stevedoring.
 At Port Newark in New Jersey, American Stevedoring will pay an additional $28.9 million over 10 years for the use of 30 acres and two berths, although it will relinquish 30 acres that it had used under a prior lease.
 The Port Authority also agreed to New York's request that it provide $5.6 million for economic development initiatives on the Brooklyn waterfront and subsidies for the barge operations used by American Stevedoring. Nearly half the money, $2.6 million, would serve as a credit against back rent owed by the company.
 The agreement brings an end to the litigation between the Port Authority and American Stevedoring. In addition to back rent, it requires the posting of new letters of credit.
 But the company will have to rebuild a business that has suffered substantially in recent years.
 ''We're happy the fight's over,'' said Matt Yates, a director of American Stevedoring. ''We now want to focus on putting our business back together in the best way possible.''
 Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said on Thursday, ''Last year, after E.D.C. decided not to take control of the Red Hook piers, we focused our resources on activating and adding industrial maritime jobs at other strategic waterfront properties in Brooklyn, such as the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal and Bush Terminal in Sunset Park.''
 Until the 1960s, much of the shipping industry in New York Harbor docked in Red Hook and South Brooklyn. But most of the waterfront jobs disappeared as the Port Authority built a modern container port on the other side of the Hudson River in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., a decision viewed with profound bitterness in Brooklyn.
 New York built a small container port that opened in Red Hook in 1981 and retained a half-dozen piers for cargo operations. But critics and the Port Authority complained that it had to spend millions of dollars a year to subsidize a barge that transported containers from Brooklyn to New Jersey. The Bloomberg administration explored whether the piers might be better used by other operators and for other purposes.
 Sabato F. Catucci, the president of American Stevedoring, countered that at its peak in 2003 his company moved 110,000 shipping containers, up from 18,221 in 1994, and created what was at one time the biggest cocoa port in the country. Even today, more than half the lumber coming into New York City lands on the Red Hook docks, company officials say. 
 American Stevedoring says that it employs 623 dockworkers, warehouse workers and truck drivers in Brooklyn, while some city and Port Authority officials puts the company's payroll at closer to 160.
 In 2005, a German cargo company backed out of a deal to bring about 60,000 freight containers a year to the Red Hook docks. The company said that the city had refused to guarantee that the terminal would continue to operate through 2009.
 The city gained control of Pier 12, which had originally been under Mr. Catucci's lease, and built a cruise ship terminal there. It planned to open a second terminal on Pier 10, but last July, city officials conceded that there was no immediate need to build the second cruise ship terminal.
 The apparent death knell for the city's plans came last fall when 21 elected officials, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and Councilman David Yassky sent a letter to the Port Authority demanding that it provide American Stevedoring with a 10-year lease and drop its plans to sell the piers to the city.

HEADLINE: The Pain Spreads

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
This wooded town of roughly 60,000 on Long Island Sound -- home to dozens of hedge funds, many millionaires and more than a few billionaires -- is one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country. But even Greenwich is not immune to the wave of home foreclosures sweeping the nation.
 On Stanwich Road, for example, a house worth $2.6 million is close to going on the block. On Hettiefred Road, the owner of a 2,720-square-foot, four-bedroom colonial featuring a luxury kitchen, swimming pool and tennis court, has been threatened with foreclosure for months. Several dozen other owners in Greenwich have received foreclosure notices this year.
 But there is a difference from most other communities. Auctioning off such homes is a far greater challenge here than elsewhere, as affluent but cash-squeezed owners often find ways to delay losing their homes, sometimes by coming up with just enough to make last-minute payments avoiding a final sale -- for a while, anyway. 
 Just ask John Thygerson, who parked his Jeep sport utility vehicle in front of the empty house on Hettiefred Road on the flawless spring day last Saturday. 
 As a foreclosure auctioneer, he was scheduled -- for the third time since January -- to sell the house. But the owner, a construction business owner who has fallen on hard times, made a last-minute mortgage payment and the foreclosure was postponed yet again.
 So Mr. Thygerson was there to shoo prospective buyers off the property, nod at inquisitive neighbors and stake out a new spot for a fourth set of foreclosure signs after the first three had been mysteriously torn down.
 ''We never had a case that had gone through three separate sales attempts,'' he said, still dazed that the auction failed to take place. ''Greenwich being Greenwich, foreclosures are a rare occurrence.''
 Rare, perhaps, but not unheard-of, as the housing industry collapse starts to claim victims among the affluent. Personal traumas like business reversal, illness and divorce play a role. There's no real pattern, with people as diverse as builders, restaurateurs and poker players at risk of losing their homes.
 The town, which typically has about half a dozen foreclosure notices each month, recorded 34 filings in January, according to RealtyTrac.
 But even the most financially stressed of Greenwich homeowners have generally been able to ward off actually losing their homes.
 RealtyTrac data shows that owners of seven homes received notices of default last month, and another home is about to be auctioned in this town where the average single family home that sold this year went for $3.1 million. The owners of all of them had received notices of pending litigation but were still hoping to rescue their positions. In the last 30 days, none of the three Greenwich properties listed for auction were actually sold.
 As millions across the nation face the threat of losing their homes, the few Greenwich owners in trouble are tapping into other resources that most people cannot call upon to help prevent the ultimate indignity. 
 In Greenwich, foreclosure filings were made against 100 homes last year, according to RealtyTrac. That translates into less than half of 1 percent of Greenwich's 24,511 households, compared with a rate higher than 1 percent nationwide. 
 Already one of the richest cities in the country in 2000, when the Census Bureau recorded a median household income of $99,086 -- more than double the national average -- the town has become far wealthier in recent years, with the exponential growth of many of the hedge funds that have set up business here. A new generation of wealthy Wall Street executives has moved in as well. By 2007, the Connecticut Economic Resources Center reported, the median household income had risen to $122,849, with many homeowners earning far more. 
 The tearing down of existing homes to make room for new ones has continued despite the mortgage crisis that began last summer. And while prices and sales volume are dropping, Greenwich is not suffering as badly as nearby towns.
 Through April 23 this year, 160 co-ops, condos and single-family homes sold for $290,000 to $30 million. That compares with 240 sales, from $385,000 to $12 million, for the period in 2007, according to the Greenwich Multiple Listing Service.
 But with the financial system straining under extreme pressure, some Greenwich residents may be facing tougher times in the near future. The New York Independent Budget Office predicts that Wall Street will lose more than 20,000 jobs by the end of 2009. Some start-up hedge funds are having trouble raising capital.
 Still, lawyers working on Greenwich's early foreclosure cases predict that most will never reach the auction stage because their homeowners almost always have other options. 
 Burt Hoffman, a lawyer in Stamford, Conn., is helping one such Greenwich homeowner sell his property as a ''short sale,'' in which the price is expected to fall short of the value of the mortgage securing the home. He is also trying to buy three troubled Greenwich homes before they are sold at auction and fielding calls from clients hoping to pick up a bargain. 
 Similarly, Eileen Pate, a Greenwich lawyer, recently helped one client avoid foreclosure by arranging a short sale with his bank, which agreed to accept payment over time for the difference between the outstanding mortgage and the price the house fetched.
 As for the four-bedroom colonial that just avoided going on the block, Zbigniew Skwarek, the 41-year-old owner, came up with his own money to postpone the auction. Court records show he stopped paying on his mortgage on Feb. 1, 2007. But three days before the scheduled auction, he said, he gave his lender a check for $50,000. 
 Mr. Skwarek may not live in one of Greenwich's most coveted neighborhoods. But like many residents here, he owns other properties, including an apartment in Greenwich and a home in Florida, and he can tap into that equity.
 ''I don't want to lose this house,'' Mr. Skwarek said in a telephone interview. 
 Mr. Skwarek rented out the house after he divorced his wife, Renata, in 2004, because, he said, it felt too big to live in alone. But last year, he said, his renters, John and Arline Josephberg, stopped paying their monthly rent of $10,000.
 While living there, Mr. Josephberg -- who previously ran the financial firm Josephberg Grosz & Company -- was put on trial, accused of not paying his taxes for 29 years. He was sentenced to 50 months in prison. By the time the couple moved out in January, they owed Mr. Skwarek $90,000. Calls made to Mrs. Josephberg and to the couple's daughter were not returned.
 But public records show that Mr. Skwarek had trouble paying his bills even before he rented out his home. Court documents show that he also owes construction and supply companies more than $200,000 for unpaid bills on his home.
 In the past four years, he has been in court several times over unpaid bills. He has a felony conviction for not paying wages to his workers and a misdemeanor for issuing a bad check. He was sued in small claims court for not paying his divorce lawyer. His former wife said that his money troubles contributed to the end of their marriage.
 ''I was sick about how he took care of the bills,'' Ms. Skwarek said. ''He didn't change.''
 A few of Mr. Skwarek's neighbors can relate to his financial troubles. Two other homes on the same road have appeared in preforeclosure filings in the past year.
 Vincent Scorese, who owns a house next door and also faces the risk of foreclosure, moved out and rented out his home after he went through a divorce. He said that as a builder he became overextended and found it difficult to make his mortgage payments on the five properties he owns in the area. So he has put them all up for sale.
 ''I feel bad for him,'' Mr. Scorese said. ''So many guys are in trouble, even guys you wouldn't expect.''
 Mr. Skwarek says he is eager to hold onto his home, especially because it represents the culmination of his longstanding immigrant dream. Mr. Skwarek said he grew up outside of Warsaw and studied construction in Germany, France and Britain.
 He arrived in New York in 1993 and soon started his firm, Bishek Construction. In 1998, he bought his Greenwich house for $495,000. He added a second floor and a luxury kitchen to the 53-year old home.
 Arline Schmaling, who lives across the street, said that she hoped that Mr. Skwarek figures out a way to return to his home. As she sat on her front porch, she talked about how Mr. Skwarek plowed her driveway and helped install handicap bars for her husband in the bathroom before he died from cancer.
 Ms. Schmaling said she missed Mr. Skwarek's two daughters and son. She liked to bake cupcakes with the girls, who are now teenagers, and play Boggle with them.
 ''They were like second grandkids,'' she said. ''It was so fun to have kids in the neighborhood.'' 
 Mr. Skwarek has still not figured out how he will hold on to his home. He will try to rent it again, he said. If that doesn't work, he plans to move in and rent out his apartment. He remains optimistic that foreclosure will never happen and that his lender will help him find a way to escape his financial trap.
 ''They want to work with people like me,'' he said.
 Mr. Thygerson, the auctioneer, agrees that he may never get a chance to do his job.
 ''You look at this place,'' he said, ''and foreclosure does not come to mind.''

 YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHORUS OF NEW YORK CITY Most composers lust after commissions from orchestras, opera companies and string quartets. Fewer have children's choirs high on their wish lists. But Francisco J. Nunez hopes to change that with his remarkable Young People's Chorus of New York City, above, and its Transient Glory series, which continues on Sunday at the Miller Theater. 
 Mr. Nunez founded the choir in 1988 with kids of diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds. In 2001 he inaugurated Transient Glory (named after the fleeting beauty of developing voices) to expand the serious repertory for children's choirs and to encourage composers to write for the medium. Since then the ensemble has commissioned dozens of works by an eclectic range of notable composers, including Steve Reich, George Crumb, Judith Weir, Bright Sheng, Milton Babbitt and David Del Tredici. 
 The chorus is split into several divisions, including the Concert Chorus for boys and girls ages 12 to 18, which will perform a typically eclectic Transient Glory concert on Sunday. Mr. Nunez will lead the group in the premieres of five commissions, including Joan Tower's first choral piece with text, as well as music by Douglas J. Cuomo, Ko Matsushita (which will be sung in Japanese) and Bora Yoon, whose work is billed as ''a choral sound installation.'' 
 The program also includes the premiere of a multimedia version of Michael Gordon's ''Every Stop on the F Train'' (a collaboration with the filmmaker Bill Morrison), ''The Song I Sing'' by Stephen Flaherty and ''In Paradisum'' by Lynn Ahrens and Ernst Krenek. 
 These young singers are notable for the beauty of their youthfully pure voices and for their technical sophistication. ''Transient Glory II,'' the choir's latest CD, highlights their talents in works ranging from Ms. Weir's evocative ''I Carry Your Heart With Me'' to Tod Machover's harmonically and rhythmically challenging ''I Dreamt a Dream.'' (Sunday at 2 p.m., Miller Theater, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, 212-854-7799, ypc.org; $25.) VIVIEN SCHWEITZER

 Opera
 'DIE ENTFUHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL' (Saturday and Wednesday) There are many reasons to anticipate eagerly the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Mozart's German comic opera ''Entfuhrung aus dem Serail'' (''The Abduction From the Seraglio''), in John Dexter's colorful 1979 production. The cast is headed by the brilliant coloratura soprano Diana Damrau as Konstanze and the elegant lyric tenor Matthew Polenzani as Belmonte. The main news, though, is the return of the conductor David Robertson, now a major figure on the international scene, who comes back to the Met after 10 years. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)
 'LA FILLE DU REGIMENT' (Saturday and Tuesday) The production is not what you would call in Technicolor, but the principals are terrific. Juan Diego Florez is Tonio, and Natalie Dessay is Marie. If you can get a ticket, those two are worth the price and then some. Good luck. Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland)
 'SATYAGRAHA' (Friday, Monday and Thursday) Philip Glass's music will always divide audiences. But this 1980 opera, a mystical portrait of Mahatma Gandhi in his early years fighting for civil rights in South Africa, is both a seminal work of the Minimalist movement and a landmark achievement for Mr. Glass. The Metropolitan Opera's new production, a joint venture with the English National Opera, offers a hauntingly fanciful staging of a deeply spiritual work, deploying a roster of actors, aerialists and puppeteers. You are unlikely to hear a better musical performance. The excellent cast, led by the tenor Richard Croft as Gandhi, and the Met's brave chorus give their all to the demanding music, with its lulling patterns of repetitive riffs and motifs. But you must enter a contemplative state to experience this visionary opera as intended. For the final performance on Thursday Alan Oke takes the role of Gandhi. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)
 Classical Music
 AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Friday) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this adventurous (if sometimes uneven) ensemble in a program called ''Playing it Unsafe,'' which aims to challenge conventional notions about orchestral music. According to Derek Bermel, its composer in residence, most orchestras are ''not asking the question of what is possible, but what is palatable.'' The orchestra will test the boundaries with unusual premieres, likeAnna Clyne's ''Tender Hooks,'' a concerto for laptop duet and orchestra with visual choreography created live on a computer controlled by theremins. The other featured composers are Jonathan Dawe, Charles Mason, Ned McGowan and Dan Trueman. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $46. (Vivien Schweitzer)
 BELLA DAVIDOVICH AND DMITRY SITKOVETSKY (Friday) It isn't a foregone conclusion that two instrumental soloists who are mother and son will have a shared view: generation gaps are hardly unknown in music. But Bella Davidovich's emotional pianism is a good match for the rich-toned violin playing of her son, Dmitry Sitkovetsky (with a sound he seems to have inherited from his father, the Russian violinist Julian Sitkovetsky). Ms. Davidovich opens the program with Schumann's ''Kinderszenen,'' and they will join forces for the Ravel Sonata and movements from Prokofiev's ''Cinderella.'' At 7 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 646-731-3200, whiteoakdanceproject.com; free, but reservations are required. 
 (Allan Kozinn)
 SARA DAVIS BUECHNER (Friday) The pianist Sara Davis Buechner, who has won prizes and critical acclaim for her technically accomplished and musically sensitive playing, has an abiding curiosity for overlooked and unusual repertory, amply demonstrated by her recordings of concertos by the Hollywood film composers Bernard Herrmann and Franz Waxman, and piano works by Rudolf Friml. Her program at the Greenwich House Music School is typical: an elaborate sonata by Johann Ladislav Dussek (a Beethoven contemporary much lauded in his day); Ibert's ''Histoires Pour Piano'' (1922); Dana Suesse's ''Cocktail Suite''; and three foxtrots by Gershwin, transcribed from recordings. At 8 p.m., 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, gharts.org; $15; $10 for students and 65+. 
 (Tommasini)
 CHAMBER MUSIC AT THE Y (Tuesday and Wednesday) The veteran actor Alan Alda, Noah Wyle (formerly Dr. John Carter of ''ER'') and musicians including the violinist Jaime Laredo, the cellist Sharon Robinson, the clarinetist Alan R. Kay and the pianist Reiko Uchida unite for Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals'' and Stravinsky's ''Soldier's Tale.'' Mr. Alda plays the Devil and the narrator in the Stravinsky and offers new stagings of both pieces. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40; $25 for ages 35 and under. 
 (Schweitzer)
 CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) The composer Joan Tower says ''the sound of the viola has always reminded me of a deep kind of luscious purple.'' The fine violist Paul Neubauer will perform ''Wild Purple,'' a solo work she wrote for him in 1998, and play the premiere of ''Simply Purple,'' commissioned by the Chamber Music Society. The program also includes Dvorak's Piano Trio in F minor; Beethoven's Variations in E flat for Piano, Violin and Cello (Op. 44); and Haydn's String Trio in G (Op. 53, No. 1). Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $29 to $50. (Schweitzer)
 COLLEGIATE CHORALE (Monday) No Handelian stone remains unturned in the continuing revival of that composer's music. Robert Bass leads the fine Collegiate Chorale, the Orchestra of St. Luke's and soloists including Elizabeth Futral, Heidi Grant Murphy, Kristine Jepson, Rufus Muller and Valerian Ruminski in the American premiere of Handel's recently reconstructed ''Jupiter in Argos.'' ''Jupiter'' (whose original 1739 score is lost) was one of three ''pasticci'' (a pastiche of music primarily taken from his own earlier works) that Handel wrote for the London stage and includes well-known arias like ''Tornami a vagheggiar'' from ''Alcina.'' At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $ 20 to $130. (Schweitzer)
 RICHARD GOODE (Sunday) The Free for All at Town Hall series presents free performances by well-known soloists and ensembles every spring, with the tickets available on the day of the concert on a first-come-first-served basis. In this installment the thoughtful pianist Richard Goode plays works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Debussy. At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 937-7979, freeforallattownhall.org. (Kozinn)
 PAVEL HAAS QUARTET (Friday) This rising-star quartet, named after the Czech composer who perished in Auschwitz, is committed to Czech repertory. As part of the Distinctive Debuts series, they will perform Janacek's String Quartet No. 1 (''Kreutzer Sonata'') and Dvorak's ''American'' String Quartet No. 12 in F, as well as Beethoven's String Quartet in A minor (Op. 132). This young ensemble's recent accolades include being selected for the BBC New Generation Artists program. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30. (Schweitzer)
 JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Tuesday) This longstanding ensemble's reputation for new music is confirmed once again next week with the world premiere of Elliott Carter's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings. Charles Neidich is the visiting clarinetist. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)
 JESSYE NORMAN (Thursday) The acclaimed soprano Jessye Norman may not sound as splendid as she once did. But in recent years she has compensated by presenting unusual, even eclectic, programs, as in her recital this week at Carnegie Hall. Titled ''The Five Seasons: Summer, Winter, Spring, Fall and the Eternal Season of Love,'' the program offers a boldly wide variety of songs by Berg (''Sommertage''), Vernon Duke (''April in Paris''), Richard Strauss (''September''), Gershwin (''Love Walked In'') and many others. Mark Markham is the pianist. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $108. 
 (Tommasini)
 ORCHESTRE NATIONAL DE FRANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) The venerable Kurt Masur returns to New York next week. Wednesday's program will be as familiar and as welcome as its conductor: the Beethoven Second Piano Concerto with David Fray and the Dvorak ''New World'' Symphony. Thursday features the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter in two Beethoven Romances, the Tchaikovsky Fifth Symphony and ''Sur le Meme Accord'' by the great French composer Henri Dutilleux. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. (Holland)
 FREDERIC RZEWSKI (Thursday) This iconoclastic, politically engaged composer and powerhouse pianist is an ideal subject for a program in Making Music, the Carnegie Hall series that prefaces the works at hand with comments by their creators. Ara Guzelimian is the moderator, and the performers include Mr. Rzewski and Stephen Drury, pianists, and Steve ben Israel, narrator. The music includes Mr. Rzewski's ''Attica,'' ''Spots,'' ''War Song,'' ''Natural Things'' and ''Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20 to $26. (Kozinn)
 TAKACS QUARTET (Saturday) One of the world's great string quartets, the Takacs offers a program that includes Haydn's ''Rider'' Quartet, Brahms's Quartet No. 3 and, with the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Franck's Quintet in F minor. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $48 to $54. (Kozinn)
 BYRN TERFEL (Friday) This Welsh bass-baritone is a genuinely towering artist -- that is, tall and imposing, with a rich, robust voice -- a charismatic performer and a probing musician. For his Carnegie Hall recital with the pianist Malcolm Martineau, his frequent collaborator, Mr. Terfel sings songs by Schubert, Faure, Mozart, Roger Quilter, John Ireland and Vaughan Williams, ending with a group of traditional songs from the Celtic Isles. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $31 to $104. (Tommasini)
 YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS (Tuesday) Michael Stern leads the Orchestra of St. Luke's in support of three winners of the annual Young Concert Artists auditions, in a benefit for the organization. The soloists are Wonny Song, a pianist, in the Beethoven Concerto No. 3; Robert Belinic, a guitarist, in Rodrigo's ''Concierto de Aranjuez,'' and Alexandre Pirojenko, a pianist, in Prokofiev's Concerto No. 1. At 7:30 p.m., Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 307-6656, yca.org; $10 to $25 for concert tickets; $350 to $1,000 for benefit tickets. (Kozinn)

TAMAYO'S 'TROVADOR'
 Is Again Up for Sale
 With no legal issues blocking a sale, the financially troubled Randolph College in Lynchburg, Va., is offering one of its paintings -- ''Trovador'' (1945), by the Mexican master Rufino Tamayo -- for sale on May 28 at Christie's in New York. 
 The painting had been the cover image of Christie's Latin American sale catalog in November. But the college was forced to withdraw ''Trovador'' -- along with ''Men of the Docks,'' by George Bellows, ''Through the Arroyo'' by Ernest Hennings and ''A Peaceable Kingdom'' by Edward Hicks -- from the November auctions when a group of alumnae, students and donors obtained an injunction to stop the sale. 
 The group posted half the $1 million bond required by the court but failed to raise the rest. The injunction was lifted in February; papers were filed last month to withdraw the lawsuit. 
 ''We really have no choice but to sell some art,'' said Brenda Edson, a spokeswoman for the college, which is trying to raise $50 million for its endowment. 
 ''The market for Latin American art is strong,'' Ms. Edson said, explaining why the Tamayo was being sold now. Christie's estimates ''Trovador'' will bring $2 million to $3 million.
 No decision has been made about selling the other works.
 Before being given to the college ''Trovador'' belonged to Stephen C. Clark, the American collector who was once chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 A CENTRAL PARK PORTAL
 Interactive art has gone mainstream, popping up in museum shows, biennales and public places. On Monday ''Our Starry Night,'' a new sculpture by the Brooklyn artist James Yamada, will be unveiled in the Doris C. Freedman Plaza at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street; it will remain through Oct. 28.
 Constructed from powder-coated aluminum and decorated with 1,900 colored L.E.D. lights, the 12-foot-tall sculpture will serve as an entrance to Central Park. Day and night, as visitors walk through it a metal detector hidden inside the sculpture will activate the lights. 
 Mr. Yamada, 40, also creates installations, collages and paintings that use technology to explore perception of the surrounding environment.
 ''It touches on issues of surveillance and almost paranoia,'' said Rochelle Steiner, director of the Public Art Fund, the nonprofit group behind the project. 
 ARMORY SHOW TO GROW 
 The 10-year-old Armory Show is poised for a major expansion.
 The New York City Economic Development Corporation has appointed Vornado Realty Trust and its subsidiary, Merchandise Mart Properties of Chicago, to redevelop and expand the city-owned Pier 92; after a $100 million renovation there, Merchandise Mart will become the landlord for both Pier 92 and neighboring Pier 94. The renovated pier will be the site of a winter garden, trade shows and conferences, many of which Merchandise Mart will produce.
 All this will allow the Armory Show to spread from Pier 94, at 12th Avenue and 55th Street, to occupy the 75,000 square feet the renovation of Pier 92 will provide as well. The extra space means that the fair will be able to invite some 75 new exhibitors.
 While the Armory Show has focused on contemporary art, though, its organizers plan to use the new pier for older art.
 ''We're going to give the show two names -- the Armory Show and Armory Modern,'' said Paul Morris, a co-founder. ''To keep it just new art was to infantilize the fair.'' 
 THINNING THE HERD
 Editing is a difficult part of a curator's job. But when the task involves selecting 160 artworks from some 80,000 pieces -- and all come with the recommendation of your boss -- the challenge can be daunting. 
 Yet that's what about 200 curators are tackling now as they organize ''The Philippe de Montebello Years: The Curators Celebrate Three Decades of Acquisitions,'' a show opening on Oct. 24 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to note the coming retirement of its longtime director. 
 Helen C. Evans, the Met's curator of Byzantine art, is coordinating the effort. ''When you look at all the wonderful things Philippe acquired, it's far more than can fit into the Tisch Galleries,'' she said.
 Mr. de Montebello has championed several high-profile acquisitions, including Vermeer's ''Portrait of a Young Woman,'' van Gogh's ''Wheat Field With Cypresses'' and Jasper Johns's ''White Flag.'' 
 Ms. Evans said the goal is to illustrate how the collection has grown. New areas include the Met's photography department and the expansion of its African collection. But there are also works that the curators know Mr. de Montebello especially loves, among them Duccio di Buoninsegna's ''Madonna and Child'' from around 1300. 
 Will Mr. de Montebello, whose mellifluous narration on the audio guides has become synonymous with the Met, tape a grand finale guide for this show? 
 ''We're already talking about that,'' Ms. Evans said. 
 AN OPENING AT THE MET
 And speaking of Philippe de Montebello ...

 That was one of two listings this week on the jobs page of the American Association of Museums Web site (aam-us.org), which bills itself as ''your job headquarters for museum careers.'' (The other position is for an assistant curator at the Rochester Art Center in Minnesota.)
 The listing comes a bit late: Mr. de Montebello announced his retirement in January.

HEADLINE: Minor League Team as a Major Drawing Card

BYLINE: By STEPHEN WELLS

 BODY:
SO, what's in a name?
 When the name is Yankees, the answer for the people of Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties, just north of the Poconos in Pennsylvania, is euphoria.
 It was the hope of county and municipal officials in this northeastern part of the state that by persuading the New York Yankees to move their Class AAA minor league team here last year (from Columbus, Ohio) that the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre region would be catapulted into a spotlight that would, in a small way, do for it what Disney did for Central Florida decades ago.
 Scranton's profile and pride had already gotten a boost from the hit television series ''The Office,'' which is not only set here but has also spawned a locally popular rap parody, ''There Ain't No Party Like a Scranton Party! ('Cause a Scranton Party Don't Stop!).'' 
 With one baseball season in the books and another just starting, the signs from PNC Field, which seats 10,310, are all positive. Jeremy Ruby, the team's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said season-ticket sales for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees have almost tripled -- from about 1,700 to about 5,000 -- over 2006 when the Class AAA team that played here belonged to the Philadelphia Phillies.
 ''This area of Pennsylvania has always been a Yankee hotbed,'' he said, and there's no shortage of the parent club's hats and jerseys worn to the park.
 Scranton Yankee officials also say that ticket sales in the New York City region accounted for about 20 percent of advance single-game sales last season, and that the same is true this year. 
 And why not? From now through Labor Day, fans can see a version of Yankee baseball for 10 bucks or less, and the drive to Scranton just might be faster and easier than making the journey to the Bronx -- if you can even get a ticket. Besides seeing some of the Yankees' top prospects, you could possibly see an established major leaguer or two on a rehabilitation assignment after an injury.
 While the invasion of the Yankees has stimulated the region's tourist economy, there is plenty to do that has nothing to do with baseball. Anyone who thinks of Scranton as an old industrial city would get no argument from its town criers; rather than hide its grimy past, Scranton, a city of about 73,000, celebrates its steam and coal heritage.
 ''For lack of a better word, that's our shtick,'' said Tracy Barone, executive director of the Lackawanna County Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 The Steamtown National Historic Site, run by the National Park Service, for example, provides a chance to explore the era of steam trains. The locomotive and restoration shops and the rebuilt Roundhouse (described by Bill Clark, a veteran park ranger, as ''a Jiffy Lube for steam locomotives''), which is the centerpiece of the site, are both in operation. In warm-weather months, excursions on vintage trains to other towns in Northeastern Pennsylvania and back are offered at an additional cost.
 The site's two museums, both in the Roundhouse, are devoted to railroad history and technology, with the realized intent being, in Mr. Clark's words, ''to tell the story of the people, not just the machinery.'' 
 Smartly, the visitors center near the entrance offers three different written guides to touring the complex: one geared to the ''one-hour visit,'' one for ''visiting with children,'' and a third for ''taking your time.''
 For another kind of rail transportation, you can walk right across the parking lot from Steamtown to the more compact Electric City Trolley Museum, devoted to the history of the electric railways of Eastern Pennsylvania. In addition to taking in the museum exhibits, on certain days visitors can buy a 45-minute ride aboard a trolley car that once traveled the streets of Philadelphia in the 1920s, complete with uniformed conductor and period advertisements for slice-of-Americana products like Burma-Shave and Uneeda Biscuit.
 For a different way to go to a baseball game, and avoid the traffic, on five Sundays when the Yankees have home games scheduled this season, a special baseball excursion may be bought in advance (seating is limited to 50) for $15, which includes round-trip fare on the trolley to and from the stadium and a ticket to the game.
 The region's history can also be experienced 300 feet underground at the Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour, a one-hour guided descent into an anthracite coal mine that closed in 1966. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mining was the principal industry in and around Scranton, and the tour gives a strong sense of a miner's existence.
 A mine car shuttles visitors most of the way down, but the main part of the tour takes place on foot. Hard hats are offered -- and suggested -- for those over 5 feet 10 inches, and with the underground temperature a constant 51 degrees year round, it's a good idea to bring a sweater into the dank chill.
 Scranton may not have a Magic Kingdom, but it does have magic -- and that magic can be unearthed in a restored 19th-century Victorian (the first floor of which was originally an ice-cream parlor) that's easy to miss. Even inside, the Harry Houdini Museum has the unmistakable feel of a mom-and-pop operation -- though, perhaps, a mom and pop of the Addams Family variety. But that's more than balanced by the professionalism with which the illusionist's life is celebrated.
 Two accomplished magicians -- John Bravo (real name, Dick Brooks) and Dorothy Dietrich -- welcome visitors into a makeshift 78-seat ''theater,'' then begin a two-and-a-half-hour program that holds the attention of adults and children alike. 
 The show includes myriad details about Houdini's life -- such as his belief that what he would be remembered for was being the first pilot to fly a plane in Australia -- and a tour of rooms that hold his props and memorabilia, including the vest he rigged on his body to produce cards from ''up his sleeve.'' The program ends with a fast-moving magic show headlined by Ms. Dietrich.
 On Thursday and Saturday nights, a special three-and-a-half-hour ''haunted mind mysteries'' show is presented; those tickets must be reserved in advance. This event ventures into the Twilight Zone areas of extrasensory perception, mind-reading, telekinesis and sightless vision and has, for a capper, a seance in the dark. 
 So, what's the connection between Houdini and Scranton? Nothing more than that it was one of his frequent stops on his vaudeville tours, and that Ms. Dietrich and Mr. Bravo decided to relocate to their native Pennsylvania in 1987 after operating the Magic Towne House in Manhattan for 15 years.
 At some point, you'll get hungry. And perhaps the best-known restaurant in Scranton is Cooper's Seafood House, which was founded in 1948 and now sits in a mock (and landlocked) pirate ship and lighthouse. The menu choices are varied -- from burgers to bayou shrimp to New Orleans catfish that can be washed down with one of the more than 400 varieties of beer available -- and the setting is informal and family friendly.
 ALL of these attractions are within easy driving distance (5 to 10 minutes) of each other, including PNC Field, which is on the outskirts of Scranton in the borough of Moosic. And should there be family members who would rather not go to the game, there is a large shopping mall less than a half-mile from the stadium.
 Who knows? You might be able to track down a DVD or two of ''The Office.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft Shows Gains, But Also Weaknesses

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo may have run into some bumps, but its big software business is humming along smoothly.
 The company reported quarterly earnings Thursday that slightly surpassed Wall Street's expectations, and it provided an optimistic outlook for its 2009 fiscal year, which begins in July.
 The faltering American economy, Microsoft executives said, has not had a big impact on the company. Two-thirds of Microsoft's revenue now comes from overseas sales, and demand for many of its products remained healthy in the United States. 
 ''We have not seen any significant spillover to our business,'' Christopher P. Liddell, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said of the broader economy's problems in a conference call with analysts.
 During the call, Mr. Liddell spoke briefly about Microsoft's unsolicited offer for Yahoo, mainly echoing the tone of comments this week by Steven A. Ballmer, the company's chief executive. Mr. Liddell said he did not favor raising Microsoft's bid, which was worth $44.6 billion when it was announced in February and $44.1 billion at the close of trading on Thursday. 
 ''The strongest argument I have heard for increasing our bid -- simply that we can afford to -- is not one that I favor,'' Mr. Liddell said.
 Speaking in Milan on Wednesday, Mr. Ballmer held out the possibility that Microsoft might drop its efforts to take over Yahoo if its management continued to spurn the offer.
 ''We are prepared to go forward without a merger,'' Mr. Ballmer said. 
 His comment, most analysts say, was probably a gesture intended to put more pressure on Yahoo's board. 
 A proxy battle for control of Yahoo, analysts say, is a more likely alternative. On April 5, Mr. Ballmer sent a letter to Yahoo's directors, threatening to oust the board and lower the cash-and-stock offer unless Yahoo started negotiations within three weeks. That deadline is Saturday. Mr. Liddell said the company would decide how to proceed next week. 
 Microsoft had some weak spots in its quarterly performance. Revenue from its Windows personal-computer operating system was somewhat lower than most analysts' estimates. But Mr. Liddell attributed that to higher demand in developing nations, which are less likely to buy higher-priced versions than developed markets. He also said that piracy has picked up in some Asian markets.
 Microsoft's mainstay desktop software, data center software and video game businesses all delivered strong performances. ''It was a little weak in the Windows client business, but it was a solid performance overall and the guidance for 2009 was strong,'' said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
 But Microsoft's shares fell in after-hours trading. Mr. Di Bona said one reason might have been that some investors were expecting that Microsoft would make clear whether it was going to proceed with its Yahoo bid.
 The stock fell 5 percent in after-hours trading, to $30.20. In the regular session it rose 35 cents to $31.80.
 Microsoft reported net income for the quarter of $4.4 billion, or 47 cents a share. Profit, as expected, declined from the year-earlier quarter, when the company earned 50 cents a share.
 A year ago, Microsoft's net profit was inflated by $1.14 billion because of a one-time surge in revenue, related to coupon programs to cope with delays in the shipment of Windows Vista and Office 2007.
 Microsoft's sales rose slightly in the most recent quarter to $14.45 billion, compared with $14.40 billion in the year-earlier quarter. 
 The company's profits were above the Wall Street consensus estimate of 44 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Financial. Its revenue was a bit below analysts' estimate of $14.5 billion.
 For its 2009 fiscal year, starting in July, Microsoft said it expected revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion, and earnings of $2.13 to $2.19 a share. 
 The quarterly results underline once again how much the main engines of the company's performance are its desktop PC products, Windows and Office. Those two big, lucrative businesses are healthy and growing.
 The two product groups reported total sales of $8.77 billion, accounting for 61 percent of revenue, and operating profits of $6.24 billion, or 86 percent of profits from the business units. 
 The division making server software that runs data centers has become another large and profitable business for Microsoft. It generated revenue of $3.26 billion and operating profits of $1.09 billion.
 The Xbox video game division, which also includes computer hardware like keyboards and mice, generated solid growth, up 68 percent to $1.58 billion. After years of investment, the game unit is now profitable, reporting operating profits of $89 million. 
 The online business remains a weak spot and a strategic necessity for Microsoft as software shifts away from the PC desktop to be delivered as a service over the Internet. Google and others are offering online software that poses a long-term challenge to Microsoft's desktop programs.
 The online business lost $228 million on revenue of $843 million. The revenue got a one-time lift from the inclusion of results from aQuantive, an online ad agency that Microsoft bought last May for $6 billion.

 SALES OF NEW HOMES DROP
 To Lowest Level Since '90s
 Sales of new homes in March fell to the lowest level since the housing recession of the 1990s, the government said. The decline, 8.5 percent, was far sharper than economists had forecast. At the current sales rate, it will take 11 months for builders to work off the current backlog of houses, the biggest inventory pileup since 1981. PAGE C4

 A WEEKEND OF COMEDIES

 Four movies up for review might broadly be filed under two headings, if you accept ''broadly'' as meaning that the ''headings'' count for next to nothing. Having said that:
 PRISON:
 ''Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay'' is good for laughs, but ''Be warned that some of these are fairly cheap and crude,'' A.O. Scott writes in his review. ''Standard Operating Procedure,'' meanwhile, is a documentary about the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib. ''It is, predictably, a bleak, depressing movie,'' Manohla Dargis writes, but with surprises.
 BABIES:
 ''Baby Mama,'' a comedy about surrogate motherhood, ''never comes fully to term,'' Ms. Dargis writes, though ''it pulls you in.'' In the comedy ''Then She Found Me,'' Helen Hunt plays a woman obsessed with her ticking biological clock in a film that is ''unusually sensitive to the anxieties around adoption,'' Stephen Holden writes. PAGE B1 
 FILLING IN THE CONTOURS
 A small show at the American Folk Art Museum features works by the American sculptor Asa Ames, the first ever devoted to his work. ''Ames's artistry has a distinct personality,'' Roberta Smith writes in her review. ''His work is full of signature tics, like his careful carvings of his subjects' hair or ears. There is also a familial resemblance among the sculptures, and between them and Ames, as shown by the only known photograph of him.'' PAGE B23 
 SUPERSTAR BUZZ
 The ''American Idol'' obsessed blogs and chat boards are all abuzz with the speculation: Was Carly Smithson voted off the show because for singing the title song from ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which some people consider blasphemous?

 NOT BEING EARNEST
 In two campaigns, Senator John McCain has vowed not to dispense favors to contributors, selling himself as a maverick who is immune to the corrupting influence of big money. The highly profitable deals on public land that Mr. McCain helped arrange for an important fund-raiser differ little from the pork-barrel projects that he decries daily on the stump. As long as Mr. McCain is running for president as Mr. Straight Talk, he ought to live up to the standards he sets for himself. PAGE A26 
 NORTH KOREA REDUX
 The ever-secretive Bush administration has suddenly decided to go public with what it knows about North Korea's nuclear connection with Syria. It is another example of this administration insisting that information be withheld for national security reasons -- until there is a political reason to release it. PAGE A26 
 HURDLES TO INSURING CHILDREN
 Congressional investigators and researchers make a persuasive argument that the Bush administration's efforts to stop states from providing health insurance for middle-income children are illegal and unenforceable. PAGE A26 
 OP-ED
 PAUL KRUGMAN
 Barack Obama was supposed to be a transformational figure, with an almost magical ability to transcend partisan differences and unify the nation. If the relatively mild rough and tumble of the Democratic nomination fight has been enough to knock Mr. Obama off his pedestal, what hope did he ever have of staying on it through the general election?

HEADLINE: Paterson Wants to Seek More Trims in the Budget Approved Two Weeks Ago

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Likening the state to a consumer awash in credit card debt, Gov. David A. Paterson said Thursday that he wanted to take the rare step of reopening the already approved state budget before the end of the legislative session June 30 to cut spending further.
 He also asked state leaders, from the Legislature to the chief judge, to cut 3.35 percent from their operating costs, echoing an order he sent to his own commissioners and agency heads. 
 His moves are a response to a weakening economy and shrinking revenue projections. New York is likely to feel the economic slump acutely because of its dependence on a financial industry still beleaguered by the subprime mortgage crisis. Wall Street accounts for a fifth of the state's tax revenue, and recent events like the collapse of Bear Stearns have unnerved budget experts. 
 ''I don't see the reason to wait until next year when we know where this economy is,'' said Mr. Paterson, a Democrat, after his speech in Manhattan to a prominent interest group, the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''We can go back to Albany and hopefully address some of these issues by the end of the session.''
 The budget for the fiscal year that began April 1 continued Albany's pattern of approving spending growth at a rate exceeding that of inflation, even at a time when other states are cutting back. 
 Although Mr. Paterson negotiated the budget deal earlier this month, he has been sharply critical of it. He has said there was little he could do since the framework was developed under his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, who resigned on March 17 after he was implicated in a prostitution scandal. 
 Mr. Paterson also continued to strike a far more conciliatory note than Mr. Spitzer, who had a particularly contentious relationship with the hospital group. The association and its close labor ally, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, are among Albany's most powerful interest groups. 
 But Mr. Paterson also aroused Republicans in his remarks after the speech by taking a swipe at the millions of dollars the health care lobby has donated to Senate Republicans in recent years as part of a political alliance. 
 ''I think that they make their own determinations as to where they make contributions, and they can do it any way they like, but boy, it sure would be funny if they keep doing it and then there's a change,'' Mr. Paterson said, referring to the possibility that November's elections reverse the control of the narrowly divided Senate. 
 He added that if the Senate went Democratic and the health care lobby came to him for help, ''I'll say, 'That's really not my problem.' '' 
 John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the state's top Republican, said, ''We were surprised by that.''
 ''This governor should recognize the value of checks and balances and responsible government,'' he added. 
 Mr. Paterson's press secretary, Errol Cockfield, noted that the governor had made the comment only in response to a question from a reporter. ''The governor's not focused on politics or political contributions, but addressing an economy in the midst of a downturn,'' he said. 
 Whether the Legislature's leaders -- Mr. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat -- would be willing to reopen budget negotiations remains to be seen, though their spokesmen said they were open to the idea. Mr. Paterson is seeking administrative cuts in the current fiscal year, but he wants to reopen the budget process to make cuts that would affect the next year and beyond. 
 ''It would just be so unique that we start attacking next year's deficit instead of ignoring it, knowing it's sitting there waiting for us and growing,'' he said. 
 ''That's why consumers get in trouble with credit cards, because they send in the minimum payment,'' he added. ''If anything goes wrong, all of a sudden you can't pay the minimum payment and, as many Americans have found out, you're in deep trouble.''
 ''I don't think our government should act that way,'' he added. 
 He argued that lawmakers should be motivated to take aggressive action in an election year, but the reality is that lawmakers are often intimidated by multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns waged by the hospital lobby and other interest groups. And budget cuts are never great political talking points.
 Dan Weiller, a spokesman for Mr. Silver, said, ''We would be happy to work with the governor to get an early start on next year's budget.''
 Mr. Bruno's spokesman, Mr. McArdle, said, ''We are certainly willing to do that and would be willing to work with him along those lines.''
 Whether lawmakers and the governor could actually agree on spending reductions is unclear. There are fundamental differences over revenue and spending between the Assembly and Senate that often stall negotiations. Mr. Silver and other Assembly Democrats have championed increasing taxes on the wealthy as a way to raise more revenue. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Paterson have opposed more tax increases. 
 Budget watchdog groups have taken some heart from the direction Mr. Paterson is taking. 
 ''It is a positive sign that the governor is taking the implications of the weakening economy seriously,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, ''and that he has no plans to wait until after the election to adjust the financial plan.''

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Not Being Earnest

 BODY:
Senator John McCain sells himself for the presidency as a champion of campaign finance reform, a sworn enemy of Congressional handouts and a maverick who is immune to the corrupting influence of big money. In two campaigns, he has vowed not to dispense favors to contributors.
 Humans being humans, and senators being senators, it defied belief that Mr. McCain would not at some point have done a little something for a special friend back home. As it turns out, he has. David Kirkpatrick and Jim Rutenberg reported in The Times on Tuesday that Mr. McCain has used his influence and official position several times to benefit the real estate empire of Donald R. Diamond, a wealthy, 80-year-old real estate developer. 
 For his part, Mr. Diamond has successfully shaken the money tree for various McCain campaigns and already has raised $250,000 for this year's presidential effort.
 There is nothing illegal about this, but it is more evidence that Mr. McCain is as mortal -- or compromising -- as the next politician. Mr. McCain has accepted corporate contributions for pet projects and relied heavily on lobbyists to help run his campaigns and Senate office. And when land swaps like the ones he arranged for Mr. Diamond involve a subsidy from taxpayers, which they often do, they are no different from the pork-barrel projects that Mr. McCain decries daily on the stump. Pork is central to Mr. McCain's economic program. He says he would help pay for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts by getting rid of it.
 A McCain spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, told The Times that Mr. McCain ''has done nothing for Mr. Diamond that he would not do for any other Arizona citizen.'' That is supremely disingenuous, or Arizona's citizens are supremely blessed. In the mid-1990s, Mr. McCain's staff helped Mr. Diamond snap up some prime California coast that he turned for a $20 million profit. The senator also sponsored two bills in 1991 and 1994 (and is now sponsoring a third) authorizing Mr. Diamond to swap land that he owned for thousands of acres of public land that he developed at considerable profit. 
 Such exchanges are not unusual in Western states, where so much land belongs to the federal government. Typically, a developer (or sometimes a municipality needing room to grow) will exchange environmentally sensitive private land for public land on which business or homes can be built.
 These can be win-win deals, serving a public interest by expanding parks or wilderness areas while allowing legitimate profits. In many cases, though, the developers win and the taxpayers lose, partly because of inflated appraisals. Mr. Diamond appears to have come out way ahead in the 1991 and 1994 deals by swapping several thousands of acres that were added to a national park in exchange for cash and strategically located land in Scottsdale and Phoenix. 
 Many members of Congress who represent the West have supported such exchanges, and, compared with Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, Mr. McCain is something of a piker in this area. Mr. Reid is not the least bit embarrassed by bills that he sponsored that have given developers in growth-hungry Las Vegas access to vast acreage that was once off-limits to building.
 But it is Mr. McCain who is running for president as Mr. Straight Talk. He ought to live up to the standard that he sets for himself. A good place to start would be to admit to the deals that he has made and propose reforms to a process that badly needs an overhaul.

HEADLINE: Sarkozy, Admitting Errors, Vows to Speed Up Change

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Acknowledging mistakes of both substance and image, President Nicolas Sarkozy on Thursday still vowed to accelerate his controversial program of systemic reform, arguing that France would sink in power and influence unless it changes its ways.
 ''We must start the necessary changes so France can remain a major power in the world,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. The only strategy, he said, is ''to put in place the changes that others have made and we have not.''
 After a difficult and much-criticized year in power, Mr. Sarkozy answered questions on live television for an hour and 45 minutes, saying that he had been elected ''to rehabilitate work'' in a country where ''salaries are too low and taxes are too high,'' and 55 percent of the state budget goes to civil servants and pensions. 
 He was at turns aggressive, contrite and defensive, admitting serious mistakes, but saying that an overly strong euro, rising oil prices, the subprime crisis and sudden news events, like the Chinese crackdown in Tibet, had made his job much harder.
 With his poll numbers low, Mr. Sarkozy, 53, worked to refocus attention on the country and its problems and away from his personal life, which has featured a quick divorce, a quicker marriage and widespread criticism of his flashy habits, quick temper and frenetic style. His interviewers did not press him, allowing him to shut off discussion on his personal life by saying that ''everything in my personal life is in order'' and that ''tonight I want to talk about France.''
 He talked repeatedly about the weight of responsibility on his shoulders and said it was absurd to expect him to fix the problems of 30 years in a few months. 
 He understands criticism, he said, but added, ''If I stopped because high school students are unhappy, unions aren't happy -- in France someone is always unhappy.
 ''There is always a good reason not to do things, and the more we defer them, it costs a lot more, and it's much harder.''
 He made no major announcements, but defended his capacity and that of his prime minister, Francois Fillon, to deal with the challenge. He repeated his strong defense of adding 700 troops to Afghanistan, characterizing French involvement there as being ''on the side of the Afghanis'' faced with an insurgency from a Taliban that persecuted women.
 Asked if he feared retaliation, he demanded, ''Do you think what happened to New York, Madrid and London could not happen to us?''
 He said he would not talk as president to Hamas or to Iran, both of which he said want ''to scrape Israel from the map.'' And he said that as France took the six-month leadership of the European Union in July, he wanted to find a unified European stand on the Olympic Games in Beijing. 
 He said that he was ''shocked'' by the Chinese crackdown in Tibet, and that France would continue to press China to reopen dialogue with the Dalai Lama. French businesses have recently been the target of protests in China, where people are upset by the sometimes violent scenes that have met the Olympic torch in the streets of Paris.
 Although Mr. Sarkozy emphasized that he has four more years to get France right, some wonder if he can regain popularity.
 ''He won one of the best presidential victories of the modern republic,'' said Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist seeking his party's leadership. ''He had gold in his hands and turned it into lead.''
 Segolene Royal, the Socialist candidate Mr. Sarkozy defeated, summed up the problem neatly: ''It's a year ratee,'' she said, which can be politely translated as ''messed up.'' She added, ''It's dangerous when a country loses confidence in itself.''
 Mr. Sarkozy's poll ratings are dire. An IFOP poll showed that 72 percent of the French were dissatisfied. Some 65 percent believe Mr. Sarkozy has failed to make good on electoral promises.
 A CSA poll showed that 53 percent of French thought Mr. Sarkozy represented France badly, and that they displayed a nostalgia for the imperious Charles de Gaulle; 88 percent thought he represented France well. 
 Le Monde's editorial on Thursday was titled ''Too much Nicolas, not enough Sarkozy,'' suggesting that his personal life and his marriage to the Italian heiress and former model Carla Bruni had been too preoccupying, and that there had been too little of the reforms he had promised on jobs, security, economic deregulation and deficit reduction.
 His aides, like the Labor minister, Laurent Wauquiez, say that major reforms are being drafted. But even Mr. Sarkozy's own prime minister, Mr. Fillon, said earlier on Thursday, ''I'm waiting for a road map in the coming weeks and months that re-establishes the course of the reforms that need to be led.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy has four more years in a job with nearly monarchical powers. He is already making some changes, trying to be more like the secular ''kings'' de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, appearing less often in public, ordering his cabinet to stop leaking and gossiping and trying to wrap himself in more mystery. 
 ''He'll rebound,'' one minister said. ''For a month now, he's more at ease.''

HEADLINE: A Nation At a Loss

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE. 
Edward B. Fiske, a former Times education editor, is the author of the Fiske Guide to Colleges.

DATELINE: Durham, N.C. 

 BODY:
 TOMORROW is the 25th anniversary of ''A Nation at Risk,'' a remarkable document that became a milestone in the history of American education -- albeit in ways that its creators neither planned, anticipated or even wanted.
 In August 1981, Education Secretary T. H. Bell created a National Commission on Excellence in Education to examine, in the report's words, ''the widespread public perception that something is seriously remiss in our educational system.'' Secretary Bell's expectation, he later said, was that the report would paint a rosy picture of American education and correct all those widespread negative perceptions.
 Instead, on April 26, 1983, the commission released a sweeping 65-page indictment of the quality of teaching and learning in American primary and secondary schools couched in a style of apocalyptic rhetoric rarely found in blue-ribbon commission reports.
 ''The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and as a people,'' it warned. ''If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.'' 
 To his credit, Secretary Bell, a moderate Republican who had been hoping for some political relief from critics on his right, stood by these unexpected words from his commission -- and thereby became the unwitting father of the modern school reform movement.
 Secretary Bell's boss, President Ronald Reagan, was also taken aback by ''A Nation at Risk,'' although for different reasons. He took office in 1981 with a three-fold agenda for education: abolishing the Department of Education, promoting tuition tax credits and vouchers and restoring voluntary prayer in the schools. Using the bully pulpit and purse of the federal government to promote ''excellence'' in teaching and learning was not on the list.
 When members of the White House staff saw an early copy of ''A Nation at Risk,'' they were distressed to find no mention of their political agenda and threatened to cancel the ceremony in which the president would receive the first copy. Secretary Bell and commission members replied that such topics were at best tangential to their assigned topic of excellence in teaching and learning. 
 Eventually a compromise was reached. The president agreed to receive the commission and accept the first copy of ''A Nation at Risk'' at a White House ceremony, and he used his remarks to reaffirm his political objectives -- none of which were mentioned in the report. Several members of the commission later confided that they left Washington that day in a depressed mood, convinced that they had been ''used'' and were destined to be ignored. 
 Then came the biggest twist of all. ''A Nation at Risk'' resonated with Americans, who seemingly agreed that there was indeed something ''seriously remiss'' in their schools. White House pollsters picked this up. The president began visiting schools all over the country, usually in the company of Secretary Bell, who until then, as head of a department scheduled for elimination, had never seen the inside of Air Force One. 
 The most important legacy of ''A Nation at Risk'' was to put the quality of education on the national political agenda -- where it has remained ever since. The last 25 years have seen a succession of projects and movements aimed at increasing the quality of American primary and secondary schools: standards-based reform, the 1989 ''education summit'' that set six ''national goals'' for education, the push for school choice and, most recently, the No Child Left Behind legislation. Proponents of each have taken pains to portray themselves as the heirs of ''A Nation at Risk.''
 The apocalyptic rhetoric of the opening section of ''A Nation at Risk'' isn't the only element of the report that has had a lasting impact. One of the main ideas enshrined in the document -- that quality of schooling is directly linked to economic competitiveness -- has also shaped the way Americans think about education. This particular theory, however, hasn't been borne out by history. 
 In 1983, the causal connection between education and the economy seemed obvious. Americans were living in awe of the Japanese ''economic miracle'' and assumed that it was made possible by a school system whose students consistently routed ours on all those comparative international achievement tests. But then the Japanese economy soured -- even though it still had the same education system -- and we began asking ourselves another question: If American schools are so bad, why is our economy doing so well?
 With the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that the link between educational excellence and economic security is not as simple as ''A Nation at Risk'' made it seem. By the mid-1980s, policymakers in Japan, South Korea and Singapore were already beginning to complain that their educational systems focused too much on rote learning and memorization. They continue to envy American schools because they teach creativity and the problem-solving skills critical to prospering in the global economy. 
 Indeed, a consensus seems to be emerging among educational experts around the world that American schools operate within the context of an enabling environment -- an open economy, strong legal and banking systems, an entrepreneurial culture -- conducive to economic progress. 
 To put it bluntly, American students may not know as much as their counterparts around the Pacific Rim, but our society allows them to make better use of what they do know. The question now is whether this historic advantage will suffice at a time when knowledge of math, science and technology is becoming increasingly critical. Maybe we need both the enabling environment and more rigor in these areas.
 But while the theory behind ''A Nation at Risk'' may no longer hold (mediocre education inevitably leads to a weak economy), the report's desperate language may be more justified than ever, for American education is in turmoil. 
 Most troubling now are the numbers on educational attainment. One reason that the American economy was so dominant throughout the 20th century is that we provided more education to more citizens than other industrialized countries. ''A Nation at Risk'' noted with pride that American schools ''now graduate 75 percent of our young people from high school.''
 That figure has now dropped to less than 70 percent, and the United States, which used to lead the world in sending high school graduates on to higher education, has declined to fifth in the proportion of young adults who participate in higher education and is 16th out of 27 industrialized countries in the proportion who complete college, according to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. 
 The striking thing about the performance of American students on international comparisons is not that, on average, they are in the middle of the pack -- which was also true in 1983 -- but that we have a disproportionate share of low-performing students. We are failing to provide nearly one-third of our young people with even the minimal education required to be functioning citizens and workers in a global economy.
 This is particularly distressing news at a time when the baby boomers are aging and a growing proportion of the future work force comes from groups -- members of ethnic and racial minorities, students from low-income families, recent immigrants -- that have been ill served by our education system. The challenge today is to build access as well as excellence. That's the new definition of ''a nation a risk'' -- and ample reason for a new commission to awaken the nation to the need to educate all our young people.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls Opposition Leader Clear Victor in Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER, DAVID BARBOZA and ALAN COWELL; Celia W. Dugger reported from Pretoria, David Barboza from Shanghai and Alan Cowell from London. Graham Bowley contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Celia W. Dugger, David Barboza and Alan Cowell and written by Ms. Dugger.
 PRETORIA, South Africa -- The top American envoy to Africa declared Thursday that Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, was the ''clear victor'' over President Robert Mugabe in the nation's disputed election and called on other countries -- including the United States -- to help solve the deepening political and humanitarian crisis there. 
 The diplomat, Jendayi Frazer, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said the election results, based on projections by independent monitors, removed the rationale for any negotiated settlement that left Mr. Mugabe in charge, as was proposed Wednesday in an editorial in The Herald, the state-run newspaper. 
 ''This is a government rejecting the will of the people,'' Ms. Frazer said, referring to the Zimbabwe electoral commission's refusal to announce who won the March 29 presidential election. ''If they had voted for Mugabe, the results would already have been announced. Everyone knows what time it is.''
 The United States has deferred in recent years to South Africa, the region's most powerful nation, to mediate between ZANU-PF, Zimbabwe's governing party, and its political rivals. But at a news briefing on Thursday in Pretoria, South Africa's capital, Ms. Frazer said the severity of the human rights violations by state-sponsored groups against opposition supporters now required the involvement of more players: the African Union, the United Nations and other nations, including the United States.
 ''We can't stand back and wait for this to escalate further,'' she said. 
 Earlier Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry confirmed that a Chinese ship bound for Zimbabwe would turn back without unloading its cargo of bullets and mortar bombs made by a Chinese state-owned company.
 ''The Chinese company has already decided to send the military goods back to China in the same vessel, the An Yue Jiang,'' Jiang Yu, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said at a briefing. 
 The arms shipment has been a particularly contentious issue because of widespread concerns about politically motivated violence in the wake of the elections. 
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain said Wednesday in Parliament that he would ''promote proposals for an embargo on all arms to Zimbabwe.'' On Thursday Ms. Frazer praised his idea as one that the United States would ''consider seriously.''
 Mr. Mugabe, 84, who has led Zimbabwe for 28 years, will undoubtedly seize on their criticism to buttress his contention that only he can defend the nation's sovereignty. He has long depicted himself as the defiant African leader who will stand up to the British and the Americans, while painting his rival, Mr. Tsvangirai, as their stooge.
 Jacob G. Zuma -- the leader of South Africa's governing party, the African National Congress, and potentially a future president of South Africa -- said Wednesday that he was concerned that the British and the Americans had undercut their influence on Zimbabwe.
 Speaking before a meeting with Mr. Brown, who has accused Mr. Mugabe of stealing the election, Mr. Zuma said the approach the British and the Americans had taken ''undermined the possibility of their playing a meaningful role in Zimbabwe.''
 On Thursday, he said in London that he did not support Mr. Brown's call for a full-fledged arms embargo and ruled out South African military intervention in Zimbabwe. South Africa's opinion on an embargo is critical because it controls the main trade routes into Zimbabwe. 
 Even so, China's decision to turn the ship around was welcomed by the dock workers, trade unionists, religious leaders, Western diplomats and human rights workers who have been campaigning to block the delivery of the weapons to Zimbabwe.
 ''This is a great victory for the trade union movement in particular and civil society in general in putting its foot down and saying we will not allow weapons that could be used to kill and maim our fellow workers and Zimbabweans to be transported across South Africa,'' said Patrick Craven, spokesman for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which represents 1.9 million South African workers. 
 China's strategic retreat in delivering the weapons also allows it to avoid Zimbabwe-related protests over its human rights record before the Olympic Games in Beijing in August. The months leading to the Games have already been marked by protests over China's suppression of protesters in Tibet and criticism of it for supplying arms to the government of Sudan.
 In Britain, Anglican church leaders warned of the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe and urged international mediation.
 The leaders -- the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, and the archbishop of York, John Sentamu -- issued a statement saying people were being ''beaten, intimidated or oppressed'' and warning that ''political violence and drift could unleash spiraling communal violence,'' as has been seen elsewhere in Africa. 
 Zimbabwe's governing party has been following the fate of the arms shipment. The Herald, a mouthpiece for Mr. Mugabe and ZANU-PF, reported Thursday that China had said the shipment had been ordered before the elections and had nothing to do with ''what was taking place in Zimbabwe at the moment.''
 It quoted Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa as saying that Zimbabwe had a right to arm itself and defend its territorial integrity and ''dismissing suggestions that the military would want to use the arms against civilians.''
 Human rights researchers and doctors treating victims of the political crackdown in Zimbabwe said they feared that a government short on bullets because of the country's economic collapse would use an infusion of arms from China to make the crackdown more lethal.
 The ship sailed into Durban harbor in South Africa last week. The government there had already issued a permit to allow the arms to be trucked across South Africa to landlocked Zimbabwe when dock workers declared they would not unload the weapons, and an Anglican archbishop persuaded a judge to temporarily prohibit the arms delivery across South African soil.

HEADLINE: Self-Inflicted Confusion

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
After Barack Obama's defeat in Pennsylvania, David Axelrod, his campaign manager, brushed it off: ''Nothing has changed tonight in the basic physics of this race.''
 He may well be right -- but what a comedown. A few months ago the Obama campaign was talking about transcendence. Now it's talking about math. ''Yes we can'' has become ''No she can't.'' 
 This wasn't the way things were supposed to play out. 
 Mr. Obama was supposed to be a transformational figure, with an almost magical ability to transcend partisan differences and unify the nation. Once voters got to know him -- and once he had eliminated Hillary Clinton's initial financial and organizational advantage -- he was supposed to sweep easily to the nomination, then march on to a huge victory in November.
 Well, now he has an overwhelming money advantage and the support of much of the Democratic establishment -- yet he still can't seem to win over large blocs of Democratic voters, especially among the white working class.
 As a result, he keeps losing big states. And general election polls suggest that he might well lose to John McCain.
 What's gone wrong?
 According to many Obama supporters, it's all Hillary's fault. If she hadn't launched all those vile, negative attacks on their hero -- if she had just gone away -- his aura would be intact, and his mission of unifying America still on track.
 But how negative has the Clinton campaign been, really? Yes, it ran an ad that included Osama bin Laden in a montage of crisis images that also included the Great Depression and Hurricane Katrina. To listen to some pundits, you'd think that ad was practically the same as the famous G.O.P. ad accusing Max Cleland of being weak on national security. 
 It wasn't. The attacks from the Clinton campaign have been badminton compared with the hardball Republicans will play this fall. If the relatively mild rough and tumble of the Democratic fight has been enough to knock Mr. Obama off his pedestal, what hope did he ever have of staying on it through the general election?
 Let me offer an alternative suggestion: maybe his transformational campaign isn't winning over working-class voters because transformation isn't what they're looking for.
 From the beginning, I wondered what Mr. Obama's soaring rhetoric, his talk of a new politics and declarations that ''we are the ones we've been waiting for'' (waiting for to do what, exactly?) would mean to families troubled by lagging wages, insecure jobs and fear of losing health coverage. The answer, from Ohio and Pennsylvania, seems pretty clear: not much. Mrs. Clinton has been able to stay in the race, against heavy odds, largely because her no-nonsense style, her obvious interest in the wonkish details of policy, resonate with many voters in a way that Mr. Obama's eloquence does not.
 Yes, I know that there are lots of policy proposals on the Obama campaign's Web site. But addressing the real concerns of working Americans isn't the campaign's central theme. 
 Tellingly, the Obama campaign has put far more energy into attacking Mrs. Clinton's health care proposals than it has into promoting the idea of universal coverage. 
 During the closing days of the Pennsylvania primary fight, the Obama campaign ran a TV ad repeating the dishonest charge that the Clinton plan would force people to buy health insurance they can't afford. It was as negative as any ad that Mrs. Clinton has run -- but perhaps more important, it was fear-mongering aimed at people who don't think they need insurance, rather than reassurance for families who are trying to get coverage or are afraid of losing it. 
 No wonder, then, that older Democrats continue to favor Mrs. Clinton. 
 The question Democrats, both inside and outside the Obama campaign, should be asking themselves is this: now that the magic has dissipated, what is the campaign about? More generally, what are the Democrats for in this election?
 That should be an easy question to answer. Democrats can justly portray themselves as the party of economic security, the party that created Social Security and Medicare and defended those programs against Republican attacks -- and the party that can bring assured health coverage to all Americans.
 They can also portray themselves as the party of prosperity: the contrast between the Clinton economy and the Bush economy is the best free advertisement that Democrats have had since Herbert Hoover.
 But the message that Democrats are ready to continue and build on a grand tradition doesn't mesh well with claims to be bringing a ''new politics'' and rhetoric that places blame for our current state equally on both parties.
 And unless Democrats can get past this self-inflicted state of confusion, there's a very good chance that they'll snatch defeat from the jaws of victory this fall.

AROUND TOWN
 CHRIS ROCK When Senator Barack Obama made a speech about race last month, the consensus from commentators was that it was rare to hear such a frank meditation on the topic. Well, candor about race may not be a common practice for politicians on the stump, but it's nothing new to comedy clubs, where black comedians have often held the spotlight by refracting the lens to illuminate issues of race in America. No one is better at this than Chris Rock, above. 
 Following in the tradition of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, Mr. Rock's jokes -- if they can be called that -- would be heartbreaking if they weren't delivered in a voice ready to start a fight and paired with comedic timing ready to dispel one. Mr. Rock brings his own meditation on race, and class, to Madison Square Garden for five nights starting on Wednesday. The appearance, with Mario Joyner, is a return for Mr. Rock, who opened his appropriately named ''No Apologies'' tour with a sold-out show at the Garden on New Year's Eve. Since then he has crisscrossed the country at a pace rivaling that of a political campaign, and this year's election hasn't been far from his mind. In January he gave Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a good ribbing, although he reserved his most blistering words for Mrs. Clinton. Challenging her campaign message, that she has more experience, he said, ''You get on a plane tomorrow, you want the pilot's wife flying you?'' 
 It comes as no surprise then that Mr. Rock is a supporter of Mr. Obama's, and his backing isn't limited to a mere link on his Web site; he has appeared at a fund-raiser for the senator, and his message was among those left on New Yorkers' voice mail on Mr. Obama's behalf on Feb. 5. But his routine isn't partisan. His insights on race, class and gender relations may not be delivered against a backdrop of American flags, but that makes them no less worthy of consideration.

HEADLINE: Confidence Falls to Lowest Level in 26 Years

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
American consumer confidence fell to a 26-year low in April, more than forecast, as unemployment rose and fuel prices hit records.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan sentiment index decreased to 62.6, from 69.5 in March. The measure was down from a preliminary estimate of 63.2 issued on April 11. 
 Consumers are growing increasingly anxious because the economy has lost almost a quarter-million jobs so far this year, gasoline is up 17 percent and property values have fallen. Sales of houses and cars have declined as a result, contributing to a slowdown that may bring an end to the six-year expansion.
 ''Consumers are feeling the pinch, not only from the labor market, but also from prices,'' Aaron Smith, an economist at Moody'sEconomy.com in West Chester, Pa., said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ''There's a squeeze on incomes from two sides.''
 Economists had forecast the consumer sentiment gauge would fall to 63.2, from 69.5 in March, according to the median of 60 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.
 The index of consumer expectations for six months from now, which more closely projects the direction of consumer spending, dropped to 53.3, from 60.1 last month.
 A measure of current conditions, which reflects Americans' perceptions of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to make big-ticket purchases like cars, decreased to 77, from 84.2 last month.
 Consumers were also more concerned about inflation. Americans thought prices would increase 4.8 percent over the next 12 months, up from a 4.3 percent estimate in March. Longer term, inflation expectations were pegged at 3.2 percent, the highest level since August 2006. The estimated figure last month was 2.9 percent.
 The economy lost 80,000 jobs in March, the most in five years, after a 76,000 drop in payrolls in each of the previous two months, according to figures from the Labor Department. The jobless rate rose to 5.1 percent, the highest level in more than two years.

HEADLINE: New Homes Turning Old As the Inventory Piles Up

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE prices are coming down, but new homes in the United States are still not selling, and some of them are getting old while waiting for a buyer.
 In its report on new-home sales in March, the Census Bureau said that 189,000 completed new homes were on the market and unsold. That number was down a bit from the peak of 198,000 reached this winter, but it remains far higher than in previous cycles.
 It appears that many of the homes now being sold -- and there were 51,000 sold in the month, the lowest for any March since 1991 -- are coming from the supply of homes that are still being built or are newly completed. The median age of completed new homes on the market has risen to 7.4 months. Only four months ago, that figure was six months. 
 If the completed homes are not selling, builders are unlikely to break ground on many new homes. ''It says that as low as housing starts have gone, you can continue to see them fall,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. In March, the number of starts of single-family houses fell to an annual rate of 680,000, a 17-year low but still well above the rate of new-home sales, which came in at 526,000.
 In some areas, the risk is that some of the new homes will not sell at all. There are subdivisions with large numbers of empty homes, some that never sold and some that were sold to buyers who were unable or unwilling to meet the payments and left, sometimes before and sometimes after foreclosure proceedings began.
 In other areas, the houses will eventually sell, but prices may have to be cut further. The median price of new homes sold in March was $227,600, a price that is lower than it was three years earlier. Prices in the first quarter of the year were down about 8 percent from the period in 2007.
 Such comparisons are risky, since the data include homes of different sizes in different markets. It appears that expensive homes are among the hardest to sell these days, a fact that would reduce the median price even if home prices were not being cut. While the rate of sales for all new homes, using three-month moving averages, is down by about a third from a year ago, the sales pace for homes costing more than $500,000 is down by more than half.
 Over all, there are fewer new homes for sale now than there were a year or two ago, simply because there are fewer homes being built. But that fact offers little solace for home builders.
 In normal times, the vast majority of new homes being offered for sale have not been completed, and deposits are put down well before houses are finished. But in March, builders were offering 189,000 houses that had been completed, nearly as many as the 201,000 unsold homes that were under construction. Those two figures have never been so close since the government began collecting that data in 1970.
 Unlike the figures for existing homes on sale -- some of them with owners who may decide not to sell -- new homes on the market that have been completed are certainly available, and the financing costs facing the builder are growing with every week that passes while the homes sit unoccupied. 
 The spring months of March through May are traditionally the strongest months of the year for sales of new homes, with the summer months almost as good. If sales do not pick up soon, the pressure to cut prices more may grow intense as the weather grows warmer.

HEADLINE: Will We Eat 'Clean Meat' Grown in a Petri Dish?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''PETA's Latest Tactic: $1 Million for Fake Meat'' (news article, April 21): 
 The commercial development of meat from animal tissue won't result in ''fake meat'' any more than cloning sheep results in fake sheep. 
 Quite the contrary, lab-based techniques have the potential to yield far purer meat, uncontaminated with growth hormones, pesticides, E. coli bacteria or food additives. A more accurate name for the end result would therefore be ''clean meat.''
 In addition, clean meat has a key advantage not mentioned in your article: it's much more climate-friendly than traditional meat. 
 More greenhouse gas emissions are generated by current methods of meat, dairy and livestock production than by driving cars, so we need to reduce meat consumption and develop alternative food production technologies just as urgently as we need to reduce driving and develop alternative fuel technologies.
 Scott Plous Middletown, Conn., April 21, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Million-Dollar Meat'' (editorial, April 23): 
 In vitro meat might not appeal to everyone, but I am guessing that the day PETA awards its prize money will be a happy day for the billions of land animals bound for slaughter. 
 We can treasure the cultural and historical bond between animals and domesticated animals only by ignoring the emotional bond. Children naturally love animals, but the many ''uses we have found for them'' lead us to teach our children to save their compassion for companion animals exclusively. 
 We encourage kids to gently pet baby lambs, cows, chickens and pigs, but we deny them this loving connection when we serve animals for dinner by surreptitiously calling them chops, hamburger, nuggets and bacon.
 There is no happy ending for even the most humanely raised animal. And there is no good reason to breed, confine and kill animals for food unless we believe that economic benefit justifies killing. More and more people do not. We call ourselves vegetarians.
 Patti Breitman Fairfax, Calif., April 23, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 You suggest that the raising of animals for food should be done ''in ways that are both ethical and environmentally sound.'' This is asking for the impossible.
 More than nine billion chickens are slaughtered each year in the United States. When you treat animals as objects on an assembly line, it is not possible to provide for their basic needs. 
 You argue that we must treasure a ''cultural and historical bond'' between us and those we eat. But that bond is based on exploitation and abuse. 
 If domesticated animals ''exist only because of the uses we have found for them,'' let me ask you: Would you have recommended 150 years ago that we preserve and treasure the bond between whites and their black slaves -- and develop a more humane slave trade?

HEADLINE: For Many, Thrift Shops Are a Wardrobe Essential

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
SHEENA MASSIE, dragged by her mother to garage and estate sales as a child, once cringed at the sight of used goods. 
 ''The very thought of being caught by my peers buying other people's junk was mortifying,'' said Ms. Massie, a 25-year-old waitress in Canal Winchester, Ohio, near Columbus. ''If someone else didn't want it, why would I?'' 
 But, like Ms. Massie, who with her mother is opening a thrift shop, more consumers are concluding that brand new is not necessarily better. 
 According to the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops, the industry is growing at a rate of 5 percent a year. And as the prices of gasoline and groceries edge higher and debt -- be it mortgage or credit card -- weighs more heavily, saving money on clothes, shoes and household goods has become increasingly essential for many people.
 ''With the economy in its current condition, I think people will begin turning to more thrifty ways of shopping,'' said Ms. Massie, whose store, Thrift on the Canal, opens next month. ''We want everyone that shops with us to enjoy the same thrill we do when we go thrifting.''
 The thrift shop association estimates that there are 25,000 such stores in the United States. Britt Beemer, the founder and chief executive of America's Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm, said surveys have found that 16 to 18 percent of Americans shop in thrift stores, while 12 to 15 percent visit consignment stores. 
 ''Thrift shops are not on the radar screen for many shoppers,'' Mr. Beemer said. He predicted that more would turn to them, especially for back-to-school clothing.
 TheThriftShopper.com, a two-year-old Web site, is viewed 70,000 times a day, mostly by women age 30 to 50, said Mike Gold, who runs the site with his wife, Julie.
 Mr. Gold said he discovered that thrift shop fans are everywhere when he met the auctioneers and experts of ''The Antiques Roadshow,'' a popular PBS series. 
 ''Every single one of them was an avid thrift shopper,'' he said. Ms. Gold added, ''One said she even buys her clothes there.'' 
 Kara Lake, a 34-year-old mother in Braintree, Vt., who is home-schooling her five children, ages 8, 7, 6, 3 and 6 months, said she was one of those fans, particularly since a tight budget is normal. She said she grew up in rural Vermont wearing thrift shop clothing and ''can count on two hands when I've bought something new.''
 Because many families have only one or two children, she said, the clothing is only gently used. ''We can still give our kids the best things.'' Ms. Lake said she easily found clothes with labels like Old Navy, the Gap and Banana Republic. ''It doesn't make any sense to me to buy anything brand new if the clothes are well taken care of.''
 She also finds clothes for herself from midpriced labels like Ann Taylor and J. Jill, shopping twice a month and spending, in all, $15 to $20 for an armful of clothing for herself and several of her children.
 Consignment shops, which typically have higher prices but offer higher-end or designer merchandise, have their fans as well. Clothing must be washed or dry cleaned before sale, and the selection in such shops tends to be more carefully edited. 
 Mason Bechtel, a retired administrative assistant for a major financial services firm in Houston, grew up choosing between having several new dresses each season from Loehmann's, a discount store, or just one from Bonwit Teller. ''I realized that shopping at the best shops, I felt stupid,'' she said. ''Why pay $120 for a dress I could find in a resale shop?''
 Ms. Bechtel, whose mother ran a Lilly Pulitzer shop in Westport, Conn., admits to having expensive, if classic taste. ''I still wear the same clothes from the same shops -- but I usually pay nothing more than $20.''
 Thrift and consignment shoppers love getting a bargain. For Ms. Bechtel, it was a $25 Black Watch plaid blazer with a black velvet collar and $25 for a St. John knit suit -- new, typically costing four figures.
 Julie Gold, a co-owner of TheThriftShopper.com, said buying used clothing takes more diligence than simply rifling the racks at a local retailer. ''In a thrift store, you really have to dig,'' she said. ''It takes a lot of time, energy and patience.'' 
 But, thrift shoppers say, the time demanded is repaid with single-digit price tags and a wide variety of styles in one place. 
 Two national chains, Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads Trading Company, allow shoppers to bring in clothes they no longer want for cash or to trade for clothes in the store. Both promote their fashionable offerings, in an attempt to appeal to younger shoppers. And both offer a combination of new and what they term ''recycled'' clothes. 
 ''A lot of the neighborhood men who shop in our store are very style-conscious,'' said Mary Dalton, the manager of a Crossroads store near the Castro district in San Francisco. ''They can recycle their clothing and not wear it into the ground. Sustainable businesses are becoming more trendy, so people are more open to it.''
 Prices, she said, range from $6 to $75, and popular jeans like Diesel or G Star cost $50 to $65 a pair compared with a regular retail price that can be double or triple that. ''People will get three or four garments for the price of one,'' she said. ''We get all kinds of customers, from an attorney who needs work clothes to the college-age hipster. The age range is very, very wide.'' 
 Consumers can also make money by selling or donating clothing or household goods to thrift and consignment shops. Donations can offer a tax deduction, while selling items that are worth more than you paid, can make consigning lucrative, Ms. Massie said. ''I once found a vintage Carlton Ware money box for $2.50 and made a $45 profit and a pair of Ruehl jeans for $9.99 that I sold for $60. I know of a lady who bought a necklace for $3.50, and it was a diamond over one carat worth over $8,000.
 ''That's why I shop in thrift stores.''

HEADLINE: Horseplayers Struggle to Get a Grip on Synthetic Surfaces

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
We have heard from horsemen and handicappers about synthetic surfaces, but bettors may be making the loudest statement of all: Keeneland's 16-day spring meet concludes Friday, and average daily betting is down by 12.7 percent.
 Through Thursday, bettors placed $133.5 million in wagers over 15 days, compared with $142.7 million over 14 days last year, when the track was closed for Easter Sunday. The average daily handle dropped to almost $8.9 million a day, from $10.2 million. 
 ''We think that it's probably a combination of things,'' the Keeneland spokesman Jim Williams told The Louisville Courier-Journal. 
 Williams cited ''speculation that some people are, you know, a little uncomfortable with betting on the Polytrack.''
 Williams also said the handle has suffered along with the generally poor economy, and offered other considerations. But I hear from one horseplayer after another that they are not betting races on synthetic surfaces because they cannot figure it out. 
 We all know folks who concentrate on turf races or maidens, but early in the synthetic evolution, I have not heard anyone proclaim themselves a Polytrack expert. The result is that smart money is staying in people's pockets or is going on horses running on dirt tracks. 
 Fillies in the Derby?
 There is a possibility that two fillies will run in the Kentucky Derby this year. There is a greater possibility that one, Eight Belles, will run; the other, Proud Spell, is preferred for the Oaks on the previous day.
 It is debatable if it is a good idea to run a filly in the Derby, but there is no denying a filly can win the race. The most recent filly to win the Derby was Winning Colors in 1988.
 There is, however, one issue that does concern horsemen, especially those connected to the horses who are listed just outside of the top 20 in graded stakes earnings. They will need defections to get into the Derby. 
 Denis of Cork's connections would come to mind. If Eight Belles is entered for the Derby, which appears very likely, and then receives a poor post position, their connections say they will scratch her and run her in the previous day's Oaks. 
 Their preference for Eight Belles is the Derby only if they get a good post position. If they scratch her, then 19 horses will start in the Derby and there is no also-eligible list to make up the field size. The horse listed just on the outside looking in will be eating hay as the bell rings on the first Saturday in May. 
 ALEX BROWN 
 A History Lesson 
 Fair Hill Training Center has been mentioned a number of times on The Rail, conjuring memories of an article in The Baltimore Sun in 2006 by Bill Ordine on the history of the land it is built on.
 Ordine's piece on the center, which is in Cecil County, Md., is fascinating, serving as a history lesson of William duPont Jr., an heir to the explosives and chemical fortune, and his aggressive acquisition of land to build a private fox-chasing estate. The preserve also had a steeplechase course modeled after the famous Aintree course in England. 
 Fair Hill, as some will remember, was thrust into the national spotlight during the run for the 2006 Triple Crown, when Barbaro emerged from the quiet, 350-acre retreat well rested after a five-week layoff to capture the Kentucky Derby. 
 After the Derby, Barbaro's trainer, Michael Matz, shipped him back to Fair Hill, where he ran around and played in the dirt.
 Jockey Edgar Prado, in his new book, ''My Guy Barbaro,'' said Matz's plan was to keep Barbaro at Fair Hill as long as possible before shipping him to the Triple Crown races. In fact, Prado said that Barbaro became excited when he was being saddled on grass before the Preakness. ''It was like he could barely wait to run, win, and get back to Fair Hill,'' Prado said.
 Of course, Barbaro never had the chance to return to Fair Hill, having shattered his right hind leg in the Preakness.
 This year, Matz is optimistic again. He is returning to the Derby for the first time since Barbaro's victory, with the Gotham Stakes winner Visionaire. But he says he retains a special place in his heart for Barbaro.
 ''I was real fortunate to have a horse like Barbaro,'' Matz told The Sun recently. ''I was lucky enough to have one. And that one set the standard pretty high.'' MELISSA HOPPERT 
 Fogelberg's Imprint
 Dan Fogelberg was to the Kentucky Derby what John Fogerty was to baseball games.
 Fogelberg, the singer-songwriter who died in December at 56 and is perhaps better known for his ballads ''Leader of the Band'' and ''Same Old Lang Syne,'' also wrote the song ''Run for the Roses,'' about the Derby.
 ''Run for the Roses'' made it to No. 18 on the Billboard charts in 1982. Only one song Fogelberg released after that, ''The Language of Love'' in 1984, went higher.
 In 1982, the 21-1 shot Gato Del Sol won the Derby from post position -- that's right -- No. 18. 
 Fogelberg died on Dec. 16, 2007, a little more than four months after Gato Del Sol was euthanized. PETER BLAIR 
 A Synthetic Benefit
 AnakNakal completed his scheduled work Friday at Churchill Downs, as did Recapturetheglory, because of threatening weather over the weekend.
 This is a case where trainers prefer the less weather dependent synthetic surface because rain makes a dirt track sloppy. ALEX BROWN

HEADLINE: Meditations on Live Art And the Woes of Teenagers

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
After the lights have gone down and bows have been taken for Yasuko Yokoshi's ''Reframe the Framework DDD,'' a short film clip plays. 
 ''In New York?'' ''What is the Kitchen?'' burble two of the high school students Ms. Yokoshi enlisted to take part in her reworking of David Gordon's 1984 ''Framework.'' 
 On paper, the concept of taking ''Framework,'' a sophisticated piece about verbal and physical communication, and refashioning it with teenage performers from Brattleboro Union High School in Vermont might sound improbable. But in Ms. Yokoshi's disciplined practice it works perfectly on its own terms -- as a window into the highly coded world of adolescence, and as a more abstract meditation on the ways life and art are always framed by context.
 The piece begins as it did originally, with a solo by Valda Setterfield, Mr. Gordon's wife and longtime muse. Her lyrical movements at center stage, to a Chopin piano solo, are echoed by her younger self in a film projected behind her. Then the phone rings, and the world intrudes in the form of the nine students, who crowd onto the stage, bombarding her with their names and questions.
 It's a perfect symbolic transition from past to present, underlined by film of the students watching ''Framework'' and reacting to the piece. Ms. Yokoshi interweaves these documentary aspects (hence the ''DDD'' of the title, for documentary-dance-drama) with poetic extracts of pure movement, some of which involve the manipulation of a large, rectangular frame through which the dancers run, crawl or jump. And by the end of the piece each performer has offered a glimpse of his or her world, in often moving, funny, nonchalant accounts of friendship, family, social pressures and heartbreak.
 The skillful economy of Ms. Yokoshi's choices is remarkable, given her wealth of material, and so are the performances by the students and Ms. Setterfield. The run ends on Saturday night, which may be appropriate, given that ''Reframe'' is itself a comment on the ephemeral nature of live art. But watching it, you can't help wishing that it wasn't so.
 Yasuko Yokoshi's ''Reframe the Framework DDD'' will be performed on Saturday at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org.

HEADLINE: Goodyear's Profit Beats Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by price increases, the sale of more expensive tires and favorable foreign exchange rates. Goodyear said the slowing American economy remained a concern and it would most likely cut production by five million tires in North America over the balance of 2008 to align with lower demand from vehicle manufacturers. The company reported first-quarter net profit of $147 million, or 60 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $174 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9.8 percent, to $4.94 billion.

HEADLINE: Questions Linger Over Scope Of Iran's Role in Iraq Fighting

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI, STEVEN LEE MYERS and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
This article is by Mark Mazzetti, Steven Lee Myers and Thom Shanker.
 WASHINGTON -- The United States has gathered its most detailed evidence so far of Iranian involvement in training and arming fighters in Iraq, officials say, but significant uncertainties remain about the extent of that involvement and the threat it poses to American and Iraqi forces.
 Some intelligence and administration officials said Iran seemed to have carefully calibrated its involvement in Iraq over the last year, in contrast to what President Bush and other American officials have publicly portrayed as an intensified Iranian role.
 It remains difficult to draw firm conclusions about the ebb and flow of Iranian arms into Iraq, and the Bush administration has not produced its most recent evidence. 
 But interviews with more than two dozen military, intelligence and administration officials showed that while shipments of arms had continued in recent months despite an official Iranian pledge to stop the weapons flow, they had not necessarily increased.
 Iran, the officials said, has shifted tactics to distance itself from a direct role in Iraq since the American military captured 20 Iranian operatives inside Iraq in December 2006 and January 2007. Ten of those Iranians remain in American custody. 
 Since then, Iran seems to have focused instead on training Iraqi Shiite fighters inside Iran, though the exact number remains unclear. Some officials said only handfuls of fighters at a time had recently trained in Iran. At the same time, Iran has sought to retain political and economic influence over a variety of Shiite factions, not just the most extremist militias, known as ''special groups.''
 ''They don't want to be identified with activities that might be seen by the international community as illegitimate,'' a senior official familiar with the intelligence about Iran said in an interview.
 Iran has sought to spread its influence inside Iraq not only by its support to militias, officials said, but also through legitimate economic assistance, in particular across the oil-rich Shiite south.
 The Iranians also support a number of Shiite parties and militias -- including providing weapons to militias fighting the Shiite-led government in Baghdad as well as to militias supporting that government.
 For weeks, Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the top American officials in Iraq have portrayed Iran as a significant and growing threat to the American war effort in Iraq. 
 In particular, they have cited an intensified barrage of Iranian-made rockets hitting the Green Zone in Baghdad -- including attacks during a visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- that have killed Americans and Iraqis.
 None of the officials interviewed disputed the notion that Iran sought to undermine American interests in Iraq, but in recent weeks the administration has sought to emphasize the threat by citing new evidence. The interrogations of four Iraqi Shiite militia commanders, for example, have provided new details about the extent of training conducted by the Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, officials said.
 Still, the officials offered an assessment of Iranian involvement that was more complicated and nuanced than public statements by Mr. Bush and other officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who said at a news conference this week that ''what Iranians are doing is killing American servicemen inside Iraq'' by providing training and weapons to Shiite fighters.
 Two weeks ago, Mr. Bush cited Iran as a primary justification in his announcement that he would halt further withdrawals of American troops in Iraq after the level reaches 140,000 this summer. He said an American withdrawal ''would embolden its radical leaders and fuel their ambitions to dominate the region.''
 At the White House, the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies and the military headquarters in Baghdad, officials declined to detail publicly the extent of Iran's support for fighters in Iraq, referring instead only in broad terms to training, equipping and financing Shiite militias.
 But in the wake of his briefings to Congress on April 8 and 9, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior commander, ordered his subordinates to prepare a public dossier on Iranian involvement as part of the administration's efforts to expose Iran's covert activities and sustain support for the war, which is increasingly unpopular at home.
 On Capitol Hill, General Petraeus said Iranian-backed militias could ''pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq.''
 Publication of the dossier -- which includes pages of charts and photographs of seized Iranian-made weapons -- has been widely expected but has now been delayed while the government of Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, confronts Iran diplomatically with new evidence of Iranian assistance to Shiite militias, one of the officials said. 
 The administration's focus on Iran has raised alarms among the war's staunchest critics, who accuse the White House of overstating the threat and laying the groundwork for military action against Iran. 
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California who has called for opening talks with Iran, said that while she believed that there was evidence that Iran was aiding Shiite militias, she worried about the tenor of the administration's latest warnings.
 ''This is not a new thing,'' she said of Iran's involvement. ''Why all of a sudden do the sabers start to rattle?''
 The administration has, in fact, discussed whether to attack training camps, safe houses and weapons storehouses inside Iran that intelligence reports say are being used by the Quds Force to train fighters, according to two senior administration officials. Like most of those interviewed for this article, they spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were discussing intelligence assessments and potential military operations.
 For now, however, the United States has decided that military strikes in Iran would be untenable and has concentrated on trying to disrupt the routes used to smuggle weapons and fighters across the border, and on diplomatic and financial pressure, those and other officials said.
 ''The focus right now clearly is on dealing with the problem inside Iraq,'' Mr. Gates said in an interview.
 Much of the new evidence of Iranian activity in Iraq emerged during the Iraqi-led operation last month to seize control of Iraq's second largest city, Basra. A senior administration official described the fighting in Basra as ''a clarifying moment'' for the Iraqis, as well as the Americans, about the extent of Iran's involvement.
 The operation in Basra and fighting against Shiite militias that has spread to the Sadr City neighborhood in Baghdad have resulted in the capture of significant caches of weapons, including hundreds of rockets and materials to build the bombs designed to puncture armored vehicles, which kill most American troops, the officials said.
 The caches, the officials said, have given American commanders a clearer picture of how Iranian weapons have entered Iraq and filtered to various militias and criminal groups throughout the country.
 ''Much of the Iranian-sponsored arms flow through southern Iraq and are used elsewhere in the country -- certainly here in the ongoing Sadr City fight,'' a senior military officer in Baghdad said.
 Many of the weapons included serial numbers or packaging materials indicating that they had been made in Iran and in 2008, the officials said. That would contradict Iranian pledges last year to Mr. Maliki that it would stanch the flow of weapons and fighters crossing the border. 
 Even so, the amount of weaponry does not appear to have increased.
 ''I would argue that in fact, that it has been consistent with where it was some time ago -- I couldn't tell you whether it was 12 months ago -- but essentially, that that support continues,'' Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the Pentagon Friday of Iranian involvement. ''And it's not just weapons. They continue to train Iraqis in Iran to come back and fight Americans and the coalition.''
 The dossier being prepared by General Petraeus's staff also details the interrogations of four captured Iraqi Shiite militia commanders who had received training in Iran, a senior official said. Those commanders, among 16 Shiite commanders captured from last fall to the beginning of the fighting in Basra, have provided the American military its most extensive understanding of Iran's training of Iraqi fighters, the officials said.
 The official said Iran's Quds Force had developed a formal and sophisticated training program that included five courses on tactics, leadership, training, commando operations and weapons and explosives. Graduates of the training program are expected to return to Iraq and train other Iraqis, the officials said. 
 ''We have very little intelligence collection on actual numbers crossing the border,'' a senior official familiar with the intelligence reports on Iran said in an interview.
 The United States has identified an unspecified number of Quds camps, warehouses and safe houses near the border with Iraq, according to other officials. Those sites are dispersed in Iranian cities, making them difficult to strike without risking killing civilians, the officials said. 
 In January, the Treasury Department imposed financial sanctions against Iranian officials suspected of aiding Shiite militias in Iran. They included Brig. Gen. Ahmed Foruzandeh, commander of the Quds Force Ramazan Corps, who was identified as the organizer of the training in Iran, and Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, an Iraqi based in Iran who moved fighters across the border for training, as well as weapons. 
 A report by the Congressional Research Service this month said that the fighting in Basra -- which ended after Iran took credit for brokering a cease-fire -- ''cast significant doubt on the effectiveness of the U.S. counter-measures'' against the Iranian efforts.
 There is evidence, officials said, that Iran may not have control over the various Shiite groups it had armed. According to a senior American official, Iran has at times been angered when Iranian weapons were used for intra-Shiite fighting, rather than for killing Americans.
 ''Iran has hedged its bets,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter of the Cato Institute, who has written extensively about Iran's role in Iraq. ''It doesn't know which Shiite faction is going to come out on top.''

HEADLINE: The Recurring Agonies of Asbury Park

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J. 

 BODY:
For nearly a quarter-century, the rusting, hulking skeleton of a never-completed high-rise apartment building stood on the corner of Fourth and Ocean Avenues, a sad symbol of stalled redevelopment in this faded resort town. Then in April 2006, the abandoned structure was demolished to make way for another high-rise amid a nascent construction boom here, sparking optimism as long and wide as the city's barren boardwalk.
 But two years later that project -- known as Esperanza, Spanish for hope -- has stalled because of the downturn in the economy and the subprime mortgage crisis, sending a tremor of unwelcome familiarity through the city's longtime residents. 
 ''What you heard in Asbury Park was people saying: 'Look, it's happening again. That's the building they blew up. There must be Indian spirits on that ground,' '' said Sue Henderson, the leader of a homeowners' association, in a tongue-in-cheek recollection of the community's response when construction was suspended in December. ''It brought people down. It's a little scary.''
 Officials in this city of 17,000 initially promised a strenuous legal fight to compel the developer, Metro Homes, of Hoboken, to resume work on Esperanza, a $100 million project that calls for 224 luxury condominiums in two towers. In recent weeks city officials have seemed to have softened, and rumors are rife that other developers may be brought into the project and that it will be scaled back. The president of Metro Homes, Dean Geibel, declined to say how the project might change or when construction might resume.
 ''It's complicated, but we're working on a couple different plans of action,'' Mr. Geibel said. ''We are committed to the city of Asbury Park and to completing the project.''
 In Asbury Park, which was ravaged by riots in the 1970s, residents endured corrupt public officials in the years that followed and enjoyed an economic resurgence earlier in this decade. They are doing their best not to let this suddenly uncertain moment tamp down the community's collective sense of esperanza.
 ''This is not dead yet,'' said John Loffredo, an Asbury Park councilman who also sits on the planning board and has taken a lead role in trying to resuscitate the project.
 In any event, Mr. Loffredo said the future of Esperanza might be outlined at Asbury Park's next Council meeting, on May 7, when he expects Metro Homes to unveil an abridged plan for the site. Regardless, he said, the stalled project would not slow the momentum the town has built up over the past decade.
 ''The Esperanza is not going to stop us,'' he said. ''We're just going to keep moving forward. And we've got a lot of other projects going on.''
 Indeed, bulldozers were at work one recent day on Cookman Avenue downtown, not far from businesses that have opened in the past few years, including Mike's Beach House, which sells seashells, towels and other beach-related items, and the Asbury Bark, a puppy boutique with plate-size paw prints painted on its bay window.
 Many of the grand old Victorian-style houses are still boarded up, and a few too many downtown storefronts are empty. But all over town there are pockets of progress behind temporary fencing that stretches accordion-like on sidewalks outside condominium projects like the Post Building on Mattison Avenue, whose prices were unimaginable a decade ago: two bedrooms, two baths, $447,000. 
 ''People coming and buying these properties and fixing them up -- it changed the whole flavor of the town,'' said Kathy Ragauckas, the owner of Wish You Were Here, a boutique and espresso bar on Cookman. ''It's sort of like build it and they will come.''
 The exception, of course, has been at the Esperanza, where the concrete frame of two incomplete floors stands behind an uneven fence. Metal strips left on the site run red with rust. And the sales office across Ocean Avenue is covered by a steel grate.
 Although other construction projects are continuing around the city, there is a certain symbolism about the suspension of work at the Esperanza, if for no other reason than the old demons it was meant to exorcise at the corner of Fourth and Ocean.
 ''Given the long and tortured history of Asbury, it was obviously a disappointment,'' said Donald M. Moliver, director of the Kislak Real Estate Institute at Monmouth University.
 Named for Francis Asbury, the founder of Methodism in America, the city was once a beach resort drawing upward of half a million visitors a summer, but it lost some of its luster in the years after World War II. The city reached its nadir after the 1970 riots, when an exodus left many of its proud Victorians empty. 
 The city's recent troubles have been political. In 2003, a former mayor, Kenneth E. Saunders Sr., who served from 1997 to 2001, was convicted on federal corruption charges for accepting bribes related to development along the Boardwalk and the waterfront. A decade earlier another mayor, Dennis M. Buckley, resigned after being charged with cocaine possession. The authorities said that he bought the drug in a bar across the street from City Hall.
 It was against the backdrop of that kind of political instability, with seven mayors over the past 17 years, that the city's redevelopment efforts have continued to stagnate. A decade-long legal fight over the site at Fourth and Ocean, after the previous developer went bankrupt, was finally resolved in 2006, allowing the city to gain what it thought was traction in its gentrification effort.
 But regardless of whether the Esperanza resumes, the debate over the project's fate might be a sign of just how much further this city has to go in its recovery.
 ''Asbury's going to take some time,'' said Mr. Moliver, referring to the city's prospects for a renaissance.
 But Ms. Henderson, of the homeowners' association, said that many here are prepared to dig in for the long haul.
 ''We were here when it looked like Beirut,'' Ms. Henderson said. ''Those who have a connection to this town aren't giving up on it. We've been up, we've been down, but we're not going anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Some Carbon With Your Kiwi?

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Daniele Pinto contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Cod caught off Norway is shipped to China to be turned into filets, then shipped back to Norway for sale. Argentine lemons fill supermarket shelves on the Citrus Coast of Spain, as local lemons rot on the ground. Half of Europe's peas are grown and packaged in Kenya.
 In the United States, FreshDirect proclaims kiwi season has expanded to ''All year!'' now that Italy has become the world's leading supplier of New Zealand's national fruit, taking over in the Southern Hemisphere's winter. 
 Food has moved around the world since Europeans brought tea from China, but never at the speed or in the amounts it has over the last few years. Consumers in not only the richest nations but, increasingly, the developing world expect food whenever they crave it, with no concession to season or geography. 
 Increasingly efficient global transport networks make it practical to bring food before it spoils from distant places where labor costs are lower. And the penetration of mega-markets in nations from China to Mexico with supply and distribution chains that gird the globe -- like Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco -- has accelerated the trend.
 But the movable feast comes at a cost: pollution -- especially carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas -- from transporting the food. 
 Under longstanding trade agreements, fuel for international freight carried by sea and air is not taxed. Now, many economists, environmental advocates and politicians say it is time to make shippers and shoppers pay for the pollution, through taxes or other measures. 
 ''We're shifting goods around the world in a way that looks really bizarre,'' said Paul Watkiss, an Oxford University economist who wrote a recent European Union report on food imports.
 He noted that Britain, for example, imports -- and exports -- 15,000 tons of waffles a year, and similarly exchanges 20 tons of bottled water with Australia. More important, Mr. Watkiss said, ''we are not paying the environmental cost of all that travel.'' 
 Europe is poised to change that. This year the European Commission in Brussels announced that all freight-carrying flights into and out of the European Union would be included in the trading bloc's emissions-trading program by 2012, meaning permits will have to be purchased for the pollution they generate. 
 The commission is negotiating with the global shipping organization, the International Maritime Organization, over various alternatives to reduce greenhouse gases. If there is no solution by year's end, sea freight will also be included in Europe's emissions-trading program, said Barbara Helferrich, a spokeswoman for the European Commission's Environment Directorate. ''We're really ready to have everyone reduce -- or pay in some way,'' she said. 
 The European Union, the world's leading food importer, has increased imports 20 percent in the last five years. The value of fresh fruit and vegetables imported by the United States, in second place, nearly doubled from 2000 to 2006. 
 Under a little-known international treaty called the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago in 1944 to help the fledgling airline industry, fuel for international travel and transport of goods, including food, is exempt from taxes, unlike trucks, cars and buses. There is also no tax on fuel used by ocean freighters. 
 Proponents say ending these breaks could help ensure that producers and consumers pay the environmental cost of increasingly well-traveled food. 
 The food and transport industries say the issue is more complicated. The debate has put some companies on the defensive, including Tesco, Britain's largest supermarket chain, known as a vocal promoter of green initiatives. 
 Some of those companies say that they are working to limit greenhouse gases produced by their businesses but that the question is how to do it. They oppose regulation and new taxes and, partly in an effort to head them off, are advocating consumer education instead.
 Tesco, for instance, is introducing a labeling system that will let consumers assess a product's carbon footprint. 
 Some foods that travel long distances may actually have an environmental advantage over local products, like flowers grown in the tropics instead of in energy-hungry European greenhouses. 
 ''This may be as radical for environmental consuming as putting a calorie count on the side of packages to help people who want to lose weight,'' a spokesman for Tesco, Trevor Datson, said.
 Better transportation networks have sharply reduced the time required to ship food abroad. For instance, improved roads in Africa have helped cut the time it takes for goods to go from farms on that continent to stores in Europe to 4 days, compared with 10 days not too many years ago.
 And with far cheaper labor costs in African nations, Morocco and Egypt have displaced Spain in just a few seasons as important suppliers of tomatoes and salad greens to central Europe. 
 ''If there's an opportunity for cheaper production in terms of logistics or supply it will be taken,'' said Ed Moorehouse, a consultant to the food industry in London, adding that some of these shifts also create valuable jobs in the developing world.
 The economics are compelling. For example, Norwegian cod costs a manufacturer $1.36 a pound to process in Europe, but only 23 cents a pound in Asia.
 The ability to transport food cheaply has given rise to new and booming businesses. 
 ''In the past few years there have been new plantations all over the center of Italy,'' said Antonio Baglioni, export manager of Apofruit, one of Italy's largest kiwi exporters.
 Kiwis from Sanifrutta, another Italian exporter, travel by sea in refrigerated containers: 18 days to the United States, 28 to South Africa and more than a month to reach New Zealand. 
 Some studies have calculated that as little as 3 percent of emissions from the food sector are caused by transportation. But Mr. Watkiss, the Oxford economist, said the percentage was growing rapidly. Moreover, imported foods generate more emissions than generally acknowledged because they require layers of packaging and, in the case of perishable food, refrigeration. 
 Britain, with its short growing season and powerful supermarket chains, imports 95 percent of its fruit and more than half of its vegetables. Food accounts for 25 percent of truck shipments in Britain, according to the British environmental agency, DEFRA.
 Mr. Datson of Tesco acknowledged that there were environmental consequences to the increased distances food travels, but he said his company was merely responding to consumer appetites. ''The offer and range has been growing because our customers want things like snap peas year round,'' Mr. Datson said. ''We don't see our job as consumer choice editing.''
 Global supermarket chains like Tesco and Carrefour, spreading throughout Eastern Europe and Asia, cater to a market for convenience foods, like washed lettuce and cut vegetables. They also help expand the reach of global brands. 
 Pringles potato chips, for example, are now sold in more than 180 countries, though they are manufactured in only a handful of places, said Kay Puryear, a spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble, which makes Pringles. 
 Proponents of taxing transportation fuel say it would end such distortions by changing the economic calculus. 
 ''Food is traveling because transport has become so cheap in a world of globalization,'' said Frederic Hague, head of Norway's environmental group Bellona. ''If it was just a matter of processing fish cheaper in China, I'd be happy withit traveling there. The problem is pollution.''
 The European Union has led the world in proposals to incorporate environmental costs into the price consumers pay for food. 
 Switzerland, which does not belong to the E.U., already taxes trucks that cross its borders. 
 In addition to bringing airlines under its emission-trading program, Brussels is also considering a freight charge specifically tied to the environmental toll from food shipping to shift the current calculus that ''transporting freight is cheaper than producing goods locally,'' the commission said. 
 The problem is measuring the emissions. The fact that food travels farther does not necessarily mean more energy is used. Some studies have shown that shipping fresh apples, onions and lamb from New Zealand might produce lower emissions than producing the goods in Europe, where -- for example -- storing apples for months would require refrigeration. 
 But those studies were done in New Zealand, and the food travel debate is inevitably intertwined with economic interests. 
 Last month, Tony Burke, the Australian minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, said that carbon footprinting and labeling food miles -- the distance food has traveled -- was ''nothing more than protectionism.'' 
 Shippers have vigorously fought the idea of levying a transportation fuel tax, noting that if some countries repealed those provisions of the Chicago Convention, it would wreak havoc with global trade, creating an uneven patchwork of fuel taxes. 
 It would also give countries that kept the exemption a huge trade advantage. 
 Some European retailers hope voluntary green measures like Tesco's labeling -- set to begin later this year -- will slow the momentum for new taxes and regulations. 
 The company will begin testing the labeling system, starting with products like orange juice and laundry detergent. 
 Customers may be surprised by what they discover. 
 Box Fresh Organics, a popular British brand, advertises that 85 percent of its vegetables come from the British Midlands. But in winter, in its standard basket, only the potatoes and carrots are from Britain. The grapes are South African, the fennel is from Spain and the squash is Italian.
 Today's retailers could not survive if they failed to offer such variety, Mr. Moorehouse, the British food consultant, said.
 ''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''we've educated our customers to expect cheap food, that they can go to the market to get whatever they want, whenever they want it. All year. 24/7.''

HEADLINE: Sect Children Face New World In Texas' Care, but Still No TV

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and DAN FROSCH. 
Dan Frosch reported from San Antonio, and Kirk Johnson from Denver.

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO 

 BODY:
Workers at the Children's Shelter on this city's gritty west side began this week to remove anything and everything colored red from the walls, the floors, even from their clothes.
 The shelter's president, Jack Downey, said he was not sure, exactly, what was wrong with red, only that state officials had told him to get rid of it in preparing for the children of a fundamentalist polygamy sect who would be coming his way as their odyssey through the Texas child welfare system began. 
 But getting the red out is only the beginning. Forget bologna and white bread for lunch, too. Because the children, from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or F.L.D.S., have never eaten processed foods, the new shelter mantra is whole grains and fresh vegetables. Because they have never been to public school, the equivalent of home schooling will be established in shelters. Because they have never watched television, televisions will remain off. 
 Then there is the issue of prairie dresses for the girls. 
 ''Wal-Mart doesn't sell them,'' Mr. Downey said.
 Good intentions toward the 462 children seized by the state this month in the raid on the Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado, a small town three hours northwest of here, are being expressed everywhere these days.
 State officials say that their long-term goal is reunification of the families torn asunder in an investigation into the possibility that under-age girls at the ranch were forced to marry, and that extraordinary steps are being taken to minimize the shock of foster care and shelter life as the case continues to unfold. Families across Texas have raised their hands to adopt the children or to volunteer as foster parents.
 ''We're not going to throw them in the middle of the pond in an alien world,'' said Mr. Downey at the Children's Shelter, where 22 children arrived on Friday, none of them over age 6. ''We're going to stick our toe in the water and walk together -- we're going to be very, very careful.''
 But the hard reality, child advocacy experts and foster parents say, is that the children -- deeply isolated from much of modern culture all their lives -- are being flung headlong into places like this from here to Amarillo that they cannot begin to understand. 
 And the Texas child welfare system, those experts and insiders say -- underfinanced and understaffed in the best of times, dysfunctional in the worst -- can do only so much to make the road easier.
 A damning 2004 state report found that the system was overwhelmed with caseloads and staff turnover, that children with violent criminal records were being mixed in the general foster-care population, and that medically fragile children were often under served. 
 A study in 2006 by the Texas Department of Health Services said that more than half of all foster children ages 13 to 17 were being given psychotropic drugs to control behavior. And a dire shortage of foster home beds means that at least 500 foster children were forced to sleep one night or more in a state office building in 2007, according to a report last fall by a nonprofit legal group, Texas Appleseed, which advocates what it calls social and economic justice.
 Some child welfare experts say the risks are great that Texas could fail the children of the sect, compounding and exacerbating whatever damage, if any, that they suffered in their lives before the raid. The state seized the children after officials said they had received a call from inside the Zion ranch from a girl who called herself Sarah and who said she was 16 and being abused by her middle-aged husband. The girl has still not been found.
 ''We could have a situation where the cure is worse than the original problem,'' said Richard LaVallo, a lawyer in Austin who has represented children for 25 years. ''I think that really categorizes what could happen if we don't do this right.''
 Mr. LaVallo, among other experts, is critical of the state's decision to use large group shelters across Texas for the children, who range in age from infancy to 17. Traditional foster homes with real parental figures instead of shift workers and regimented institutional rules would be a better choice, those critics say. 
 State officials and some other child welfare experts say Texas was right to throw out the old best-practice playbook in this instance. Group shelters, they say, will allow the children to support and reinforce one another through the inevitable trauma of separation and transition. A traditional middle-class foster home, they say, would be even more of a shock to an F.L.D.S. child, especially because many such homes in Texas are run by religiously minded Baptists and Presbyterians.
 The sect members, who call themselves Mormons, broke off from the mainstream Mormon Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, more than a century ago after the Mormons disavowed polygamy.
 As for the color red, some F.L.D.S. members believe that Jesus Christ will return to earth wearing red robes -- the color is reserved for him alone, according to a primer on the sect by the Utah State attorney general's office, which Texas officials have used in the raid's aftermath.
 ''We want them to remain in their culture while we learn fully what's happened to them,'' said Darrell Azar, a spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services, which was granted indefinite custody of the children by a State District Court judge last week. The judge, Barbara Walther, ordered that each child be assigned a lawyer from among a pool of volunteers around the state.
 On Tuesday, the state began moving the children from San Angelo, about 45 miles from the Zion ranch, where they had been held in a makeshift shelter at a multipurpose domed coliseum. Mr. Azar and other state officials would not say exactly where the children were going or how many might be coming to San Antonio.
 ''With this population, we have to do things differently than we would for a child that comes out of downtown Houston -- what that fully entails, we're still working out,'' he said.
 But state officials also know that the children cannot stay in large group settings like the Children's Shelter forever. Ninety days is the legal limit in a traditional shelter, though a court order this week by Judge Walther, who is overseeing the case, said discussions would be undertaken about longer-term care.
 Another unresolved issue is visiting rights. Parents with children in foster care are entitled to visits, usually under supervision -- but most children taken from their parents are also usually at least in the same county, not hundreds of miles away. Officials at the Department of Family and Protective Services said that plans were being developed to help mothers in the sect reach their children and perhaps to help the mothers find places to stay as well, but that nothing had been settled on.
 A spokesman for the department, Chris Van Deusen, said that the last busload of children left San Angelo on Friday afternoon for their new temporary homes. He said that 17 adult women with infants under 12 months had been moved together to one location together, and that mothers under 18 were also being kept together with their children, but he did not know how many teenage mothers there were.
 Meanwhile, traditional foster homes -- the presumed next step in the F.L.D.S. diaspora -- are waiting. Here in San Antonio, the Block family has already volunteered.
 ''I told the boys the situation andsaid, 'What do you think about helping out some of these kids?' and they immediately said yes,'' said Roy Block, who also serves as executive director of the Texas Foster Family Association, referring to his two sons. ''In fact they even offered to give up their rooms.''
 The Texas Foster Family Association is a nonprofit group that receives public and private financing.
 Mr. Block and his wife, Judi, first took in their two sons, Thomas, 14, and George, 11, who are brothers, as foster children, then later adopted them. The boys entered the foster-care system about five years ago, after they came home from school one day to find their father being arrested in the murder of their mother.
 The Blocks are Baptists but said they would respect the culture and traditions of the sect's children and do everything in their power to make them feel at home.
 ''We would hope to show them one day that the world is not all bad, that there are a lot of good people,'' Mr. Block said. ''We'd try to explain to them why this happened, that they're victims, that they didn't do anything wrong.''

PERSON: Vesna Vulovic 

HEADLINE: Serbia's Most Famous Survivor Fears That Recent History Will Repeat Itself

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia 

 BODY:
 THIRTY-SIX years ago, Vesna Vulovic plummeted 33,300 feet in temperatures of 60 degrees below zero after an explosion ripped apart the DC-9 Yugoslav Airlines plane on which she was working as a flight attendant.
 Ms. Vulovic, then 22 years old, crashed into a wooded, snow-capped hill in Srbska Kamenice, Czechoslovakia. Miraculously, she survived, the only one among the 28 people aboard that day to live. Now she says she fears it is the political situation in her native Serbia that will kill her.
 ''I am like a cat,'' she said. ''I have had nine lives. But if nationalist forces in this country prevail, my heart will burst.'' 
 What scares Ms. Vulovic is the ascent of the Radical Party, an ultra-right group that is leading in the polls ahead of next month's parliamentary elections. Tapping into anger over Western backing of Kosovo's independence, the party is calling for Serbia to turn east to Russia instead of west toward Europe. 
 ''If we return to the dark isolation of the Milosevic years, it will be a disaster for this country,'' she said in an interview on a recent day at a restaurant in Belgrade.
 Ms. Vulovic, who still bears the cheerful demeanor of a flight attendant, is a national heroine, alongside Serbia's tennis and basketball stars. She was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records in 1985 for the highest fall survived without a parachute. 
 Though she is not running in the election, she is using her celebrity to campaign in favor of the Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic, which supports closer ties with the European Union and the United States. In recent weeks, she has been knocking on doors across the Serbian capital and warning voters of the risks of international ostracism. 
 ''My mission is to prevent Serbia from falling into the same hands that destroyed Serbia in the 1990s,'' said Ms. Vulovic, who took to the streets in the 1990s in the mass demonstrations that helped overthrow the Milosevic government. ''We Serbs are survivors. We have survived Communism, Tito, war, poverty, bombardment, sanctions and Milosevic. But we just want a normal life. I want a normal life.''
 Her survival against all odds still resonates across the former Yugoslavia. ''Her story is an epic and heroic story, and everybody knows her,'' said Simon Simonovic, a leader of No Alternative to Europe, a student group that supports better ties to the West. ''If she could survive what she did and still be fighting, then so can we.'' 
 THE life of Ms. Vulovic, whose parents were a company director and a gym instructor, changed irreversibly on Jan. 26, 1972, after she boarded Flight 367 in Copenhagen bound for Belgrade. She says she was not scheduled to fly that day and the airline had mixed her up with another stewardess named Vesna. 
 One hour into the flight, an explosion detached the cockpit from the main body of the aircraft. When rescuers found Ms. Vulovic -- close to death because she had lost so much blood -- she was still wearing her turquoise uniform. She says her legs were sticking out of the plane's smoking fuselage on the snowy hill, with the three-inch stiletto heels torn off her shoes by the impact. 
 She was rescued by a villager, Bruno Honke, who had heard her screams amid the thuds of bodies hitting the ground. The cause of the explosion was never determined, but Yugoslav authorities at the time attributed it to a bomb placed in a suitcase by ideological descendants of an ultranationalist Croatian group known as the Ustasha. During World War II, the Nazis had occupied Yugoslavia and allowed the Ustasha, officially known as the Croatian Revolutionary Movement, to administer part of the occupied territory. The Ustasha were driven into exile or hiding after the war.
 While Ms. Vulovic survived the fall, she did not escape unscathed. She spent the next three days in a coma with a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, two broken legs and a broken pelvis. 
 ''I was broken, and the doctors put me back together again,'' she said, lifting up the back of her chic suit jacket to show her twisted spine. ''Nobody ever expected me to live this long.'' 
 While she has no memory of the crash, she still recalls greeting passengers on the plane in Copenhagen and waking up in the hospital and seeing the stunned faces of her mother and father. The first thing she did after waking was to ask her doctor for a cigarette. Then, she said, she asked her mother for her cat and dog. ''When I saw a newspaper and read what had happened, I nearly died from the shock,'' she said. 
 Ms. Vulovic was paralyzed from the waist down, but was walking within 10 months -- a feat she attributes to eating chocolate, spinach and fish oil as a child and to having the stubbornness of a Serb. 
 Upon her return to Yugoslavia, she was honored by Tito and became a national darling. She asked Yugoslav Airlines if she could resume working as a stewardess, but instead she was given a desk job. Today she walks with a limp and still wears a gold Yugoslav Airlines pin on her lapel. 
 Ms. Vulovic said she turned to religion rather than therapy to help her come to terms with the crash and her struggle with survivor's guilt. She says she came back to life on Jan. 27 -- the birthday of St. Sava, the most important saint of the Serbian Orthodox Church. 
 ''The accident made me turn to God,'' she said. ''It also made me an optimist, because if you can survive what I survived, you can survive anything.''
 MS. VULOVIC said she was not afraid to fly because she did not remember the horror of what had happened. She noted that fellow Serbian passengers were shocked when they recognized her on flights to France, Greece or Britain. ''People always want to sit next to me on the plane,'' she said, smiling. 
 Yet, she is not immune to fear. She said that she remained petrified of cockroaches and earthquakes -- and the uncertain future of her country. 
 Ms. Vulovic said she despaired that nationalists in Serbia were exploiting anger over Kosovo, which declared independence in February. She said she felt empathy for the Serb minority in Kosovo, which now finds itself living in a foreign country dominated by ethnic Albanians. But she stressed that Serbs needed to come to terms with losing the territory, which they have long regarded as their medieval heartland.
 ''We celebrate the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, when we lost against the Ottoman Turks,'' she said. ''We celebrate losing -- it is stupidity. It is time to look to the future.''
 She said she wanted Serbia to join the European Union, a move she argued would bring economic prosperity while allowing Serbs to travel in a borderless Europe. 
 Even with her fame, she said, she lives on a monthly pension of a little more than $300. Her greatest indulgence, she said, is going to the movies, where she admits she enjoys watching airplane crash films. Though she said she was tired of talking about the accident, she traveled to London a few years ago to attend a meeting of fellow Guinness Book of World Records inductees, including Sir Paul McCartney, Billie Jean King and a man who spoke 32 languages. 
 ''I don't think of the accident every day,'' she said. ''I am strong. But the politics in this country are making me tired. My heart can't take much more. I have had enough.''

HEADLINE: When the Smoke Cleared

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
SHOULD employers have the right to punish workers who smoke when they are not working?
 The question is a troublesome one, with persuasive arguments on both sides. Employers that provide health insurance have an interest in the health of their workers. But workers do not want their employers regulating their private behavior. 
 Under its previous ownership, the Tribune Company fined workers $100 a month if they smoked while enrolled in the company's health plan. This week, under the new owner, Samuel Zell, the company ended the practice, which had taken effect on Jan. 1 (chicagotribune.com). In an e-mail message to employees this week, Gerry Spector, executive vice president, said the fine was ''inconsistent with the new culture.'' 
 ''We'd rather you use your own judgment when it comes to tobacco use, not impose ours upon you,'' he wrote. Employees who had paid fines would be reimbursed, he said. And the company would continue to offer smoking-cessation programs to employees at no cost. 
 When the fine was imposed, Mark Lacter of the blog LAObserved (laobserved.com) wrote that it was ''another example of why companies have no business dealing with people's health care coverage.'' 
 One argument against fines or other sanctions is that a better approach would be for companies to offer incentives for employees to quit smoking or take other steps to improve their health. But that can be problematic, too. This week, Whirlpool suspended 39 employees who had claimed to be nonsmokers to get a $500 discount on their health insurance. They were seen smoking outside a Whirlpool factory in Evansville, Ind. (abc news.com)
 In a statement, Whirlpool said that it was among ''a growing number of companies waging war on unhealthy habits.''
 The suspensions prompted another plea for decoupling health insurance from employment, this time from Laurie Ruettimann of the human resources blog Team Building Is for Suckers (laurieruettimann.com). ''Imagine how much more competitive American corporations could become if we focused on products, services, profitability and employee development, and not on reducing & containing health care costs,'' she wrote.
 COMFY FLYINGDelta Air Lines is planning to install seats that it says are more comfortable in the coach sections of some of its planes. Wired.com's Gadget Lab(blog.wired.com/gadgets)has pictures of the seats, which are positioned diagonally to offer more legroom. ''The only problem,'' wrote Charlie Sorrel on Gadget Lab, ''might be in holding a conversation with your neighbor.''
 For travelers not interested in the life stories of strangers, that might not be a problem.
 THE PORN INDICATORPeter Bart, a columnist for Variety, suggests that the downturn in the pornography industry may serve as an economic indicator (variety.com).
 Mr. Bart argued that falling sales of pornography DVDs may signal ''a true plunge in consumer confidence.'' As for online pornography, he said, it was ''lofty in traffic'' but did not bring in revenue. 
 The fact is, the pornography industry is struggling with a problem that has little to do with the overall economy -- a problem that began well before the current downturn and is shared by most other media industries. The Internet has created a vast oversupply, leaving consumers to wonder why they should pay someone for something they can get free. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: An Up Day, Focused on Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended its second consecutive winning week with a moderate advance Friday, overcoming concerns about consumer confidence and inflation.
 After slumping early in the session in response to weak consumer confidence and a rise in oil prices, investors seemed to turn their attention to broader signs, including the week's generally satisfactory earnings reports, that suggested that government efforts to steady the economy were working. That shift in focus sent stocks up late in the day.
 Although the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in with its lowest reading since the early 1980s, Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments in Newport Beach, Calif., said companies' first-quarter reports convinced investors that ''over all, things aren't all that bad.'' 
 ''I think a lot of people went into the weekend feeling they didn't want to be on the short side,'' Mr. Lydon said.
 While consumer spending represents about 70 percent of the economy, a UBS equities strategist, David Bianco, said, ''It's the wrong thing to be looking at to gauge the prospects'' for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 ''Business activity is strong in the U.S. and especially globally,'' he said. ''That's far more important.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 42.91, or 0.33 percent, to 12,891.86, after falling more than 100 points earlier in the session. The Dow closed the week with a gain of less than 1 percent.
 The S.& P. 500 index gained 9.02, or 0.65 percent, to 1,397.84, and rose 2.1 percent for the week.
 The Nasdaq composite index, depressed by disappointment with a Microsoft forecast, fell 5.99, or 0.25 percent, to 2,422.93, after dropping as much as 1.6 percent during the session. But advancers were well ahead of decliners in the broader Nasdaq, and for the week, the index gained 1.4 percent.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.67 percent, to 721.88.
 Bond prices fell ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday on interest rates. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32, to 97. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.87 percent, from 3.82 percent.
 Oil prices jumped on a series of troubling events overseas, including word that a ship under contract with the United States Navy fired warning shots at two small boats of unknown origin in the Persian Gulf. 
 Oil was up earlier after an attack on a pipeline in Nigeria and a looming refinery strike in Scotland. Light crude shot as high as $119.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange before falling back to settle at $118.72, up $2.66.
 Investors could get further insights into the health of the consumer next week with reports due from companies like Tyson Foods, Kellogg, Kraft, Burger King Holdings and Procter & Gamble. But so far, ''the earnings have come in on the financial side pretty much where people expected and in terms of the industrial side a little bit better than expected,'' said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. 
 ''Consumers were a little bit weaker than expected,'' he said. ''So you net all those together and the earnings season is turning out as people thought it would before it started.''
 Microsoft fell $1.97, or 6.2 percent, to $29.83, after its first-quarter report. The company said after the closing bell Thursday that worldwide sales next year should offset weakness in the American economy.
 Goodyear Tire and Rubberrose $1.66, or 6.1 percent, to $28.91, after posting higher revenue and a first-quarter profit. The tire maker, which reported a loss for the period a year earlier, said it focused on higher-priced tires and international markets.
 American Express rose $2.59, or 5.7 percent, to $47.77, after reporting that its first-quarter earnings fell 6 percent as more American cardholders failed to make their payments. 
 The credit card lender's total provisions for credit losses jumped 48 percent from a year earlier, to $1.27 billion. The company said, however, that cardholders were continuing to spend and that strength abroad had helped make up for troubles in the United States.

HEADLINE: Making Ships Green, in Port and at Sea

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: GOTHENBURG, Sweden 

 BODY:
Something unusual is happening in Swedish waters. Crews docking at the Port of Gothenburg are turning off their engines and plugging into the local power grid rather than burning diesel oil or sulfurous bunker fuel -- a thick, black residue left over from refining oil.
 ''I always knew these extremely dirty bunker fuels were helping produce acid rain that falls so heavily over this part of Sweden,'' said Per Lindeberg, the port's electrical manager and an avid fisherman. ''I was very happy when we could switch off the ships.''
 Similar high-voltage technologies have been introduced at Zeebrugge in Belgium, and in Los Angeles and Long Beach in California. But as at Gothenburg, only a small fraction of ships are equipped with plugs, so the benefits from shore-side electricity so far have been limited.
 And despite the growing availability of cleaner technologies, the shipping industry has made little progress toward becoming greener, even as traffic grows heavier on existing routes and new routes open up in the Arctic. Indeed, the most recent efforts to tackle the problem have met resistance -- less from the shipping industry, however, than from the big oil companies that supply the dirty fuel. 
 Shipping is responsible for about twice the emissions of carbon dioxide as aviation -- yet airlines have come under greater criticism. Particles emitted by ships burning heavy bunker fuel, described by some seafarers as ''black yogurt'' for its consistency, also contain soot that researchers say captures heat when it settles on ice and could be accelerating the melting of the polar ice caps.
 Health experts say the particulates worsen respiratory illnesses, cardiopulmonary disorders and lung cancers, particularly among people who live near heavy ship traffic.
 Ship engines also produce large quantities of nitrogen, which contribute to the formation of algal blooms at sea. Those use up oxygen when they decompose and create so-called marine dead zones in heavily trafficked waters, like the Baltic Sea. 
 ''The sheer volume of pollutants from shipping has grown exponentially along with the growth of our economies and of global trade,'' said Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. ''Shipping is just less visible than other industries, so for too long it has slipped to the bottom of the agenda.''
 James J. Corbett, an associate professor of marine policy at the University of Delaware, is the co-author of a study published in December that attributed 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths each year globally to shipping emissions and forecast an increase to nearly 85,000 deaths by 2012 under current trends. 
 With the harm growing increasingly evident, this month the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations body, proposed reducing the sulfur content of marine fuels starting in 2010 on all ships. It also proposed steps reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from engines on new ships from 2011, with the organization intending to adopt all the measures in October.
 The organization is continuing to work on separate measures to deal with the more difficult issue of carbon dioxide emissions. 
 The European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-nation European Union, has said that if the International Maritime Organization fails to make concrete proposals on carbon dioxide by the end of the year, it would consider regulating the matter itself, perhaps by including shipping in the European carbon trading system. That could oblige ship owners to buy pollution permits from other sectors.
 The European Parliament this week passed a nonbinding resolution urging the commission to act ''urgently.''
 The shipping industry has supported the organization's recommendations because they would apply globally and be introduced gradually. But the fuel industry immediately called for a review of the most important element: a global cap on sulfur content of marine fuels of 0.5 percent by 2020 from the current maximum level of 4.5 percent.
 That target poses ''risks to security of supply and to shippers and truckers,'' said Isabelle Muller, the secretary general of Europia, an industry group representing BP, Exxon Mobil and other oil companies.
 Ms. Muller said the fuel industry would not be able to build refining operations quickly enough and that oil companies would be penalized for doing so, because refining contributes heavily to greenhouse gas output.
 According to a study last year for the American Petroleum Institute, it would cost the fuel industry $126 billion over 13 years to invest in equipment and chemicals to replace polluting bunker fuels with sufficient amounts of cleaner diesel to supply the shipping industry.
 The study also indicated that the industry would pass on those costs at about $13 to $14 a barrel directly to the ship operators.
 Already, Wallenius Willemsen Logistics, based in Norway and Sweden, uses fuels that contain less than half the amount of sulfur that would be required under the proposed International Maritime rules.
 ''We know customers want greener shipping companies as part of their overall supply chain,'' said Lena Blomqvist, an environmental and operations expert for Wallenius, explaining why the company was prepared to pay more for cleaner fuel.
 Some shipping companies are investing in more efficient marine engines that capture and convert waste heat into more energy, cutting down on fuel use and on emissions at the same time. But of the hundreds of ships currently under construction around the world, only a handful of them include that technology.
 Some shippers are running vessels at slower speeds to cut fuel consumption and emissions, carbon dioxide in particular. Other companies are even testing sail power. But those initiatives may be at odds with ever greater levels of speed and reliability.
 In Gothenburg, ship crews hook up vessels using the shore-side electricity system with a single giant plug within about 10 minutes of docking. The technology cuts emissions of sulfur, nitrogen and particulate emissions by berthed ships to nearly zero, and cuts engine noise, too.
 The system was pioneered in Gothenburg eight years ago after Stora Enso, a Swedish company in the energy-intensive paper industry, asked the port for help to improve its environmental profile. Costs for the system run from 70,000 euros (about $109,000) to 640,000 euros for each outlet and largely depend on how easy it is to connect to a nearby power grid.
 In Gothenburg, the costs of the system were shared by Stora Enso, the port and the Swedish government. The electricity comes from the local grid but Stora Enso pays slightly more for ''green'' electricity generated by windmills.
 One factor hindering expansion of shore-side power is the difference in the electrical frequencies of ships. Another factor is the higher cost of electric power compared with bunker fuel, which is not taxed.
 So far, calls by the port for tax breaks for on-shore power have failed, disappointing port officials in Gothenburg. But Mr. Lindeberg, the port manager who developed the technology, said the rewards would be as much personal as professional.
 Acid rain from sources like shipping has turned many of Sweden's white sandstone riverbeds black over the last 15 years, he said, and fish no longer thrive as they once did.
 ''In the past all we needed to do was to throw a net into the river to catch the salmon,'' he said. ''It's especially when I'm fishing that I think about the damage.''

 IN RUNOFF ELECTIONS,
 A Serbian Icon Adds Her Voice
 Decades ago, Vesna Vulovic was the lone survivor of a plane bombing after plumetting more than 33,000 feet. In Serbia, she is a national heroine on par with the nation's tennis and basketball stars. She's now leveraging her considerable celebrity to campaign vigorously for the Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic, whose party trails in polls to the ultra-right Radical Party. ''I am like a cat. I have had nine lives,'' she said. ''But if nationalist forces in this country prevail, my heart will burst.'' PAGE A7
 ARGENTINE MINISTER STEPS DOWN
 Martin Lousteau, a 36-year-old economist who was trained at the London School of Economics, stepped down after less than five months as Argentina's economy minister, amid rising inflation and a long feud with farmers over tax policy. Though no reason was given for his resignation, an Argentine newspaper reported last week that he presented President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner with a plan meant to stabilize the country's economy in order to ''avoid a serious crisis.''

 SOUTH DAKOTA TO CONSIDER
 Challenge to Roe v. Wade
 In 2006, a ballot measure that would have banned abortion in South Dakota was defeated after an intense and expensive battle, 56 percent to 44 percent. Now the state is revisiting the question of a ban on abortion in a proposal that is widely seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. Unlike the 2006 measure, the question being voted on by South Dakotans will include exceptions for rape, incest or issues that endanger the life and health of the child. PAGE A10
 A COZIER PLACE TO SIT AND WAIT
 In Los Angeles, low-income residents who rely on public transportation have taken tools, technical help and a little grant money to some neighborhood bus stops to turn them into what they are calling ''community living rooms'' in an effort to ease the wait for the bus. The simple furniture they build for the rooms is generally made of wood and includes chairs and ottomans. PAGE A10
 ATHEISM IN FOXHOLES
 After convening a group of atheists and freethinkers at Camp Speicher in Iraq, Specialist Jeremy Hall and another soldier were berated by a superior officer who told them that the charges would be filed against them and they would be barred from re-enlistment. Specialist Hall filed a lawsuit saying that his First Amendment rights were violated. The lawsuit has raised questions about the effectiveness of the military's religious guidelines. PAGE A10
 MCCAIN IN HOSTILE TERRITORY
 John McCain just finished concluded a weeklong trip in which he traveled to places where Republicans are loath to venture. He has attended quilting sessions in Kentucky and a town-hall-style meeting at Xavier University in New Orleans. ''I want to inform you that everybody in the camp here is not a Republican,'' one participant informed him ashe was being berated by the audience. ''I got that impression,'' Mr. McCain responded.

 FRESH FRUIT YEAR-ROUND,
 But at a Price
 It's now possible to get a ripe kiwi year-round thanks to the efficient global networks that transport food from all over the world. But the consequence of say, buying Argentina-grown lemons in Spain, is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to ship it. The European Union, which imports more food than anywhere else in the world, is trying to tackle the problem by making freight-carrying flights buy permits for the pollution they generate (though sea freight may also require permits, too). ''We're really ready to have everyone reduce -- or pay in some way,'' said a European Union spokeswoman. PAGE B1
 WACHOVIA SETTLES SUIT
 Wachovia Bank ended an 18-month investigation into its relationships with schemes that stole from thousands of victims -- many of them elderly -- by agreeing to pay $144 million. The settlement, which is the second-largest penalty ever demanded by the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was criticized by some who said that the settlement agreement did not guarantee that victims would be paid. PAGE B1 
 SHIPS SLOW TO CLEAN UP
 The shipping industry, despite producing twice as much carbon dioxide as aviation, isn't in a rush to go green despite the presence of cleaner technologies. Many ships burn heavy bunker fuel, which is called ''black yogurt'' for its consistency, and which researches say could speed up the melting of the polar ice caps and contribute to serious breathing illnesses and lung cancers. PAGE B1
 AIRLINES SAID TO BE NEAR MERGER
 United Airlines and Continental Airlines could be one carrier by next week, according to sources. The talks between the two airlines picked up after Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines announced their $3 billion merger. Like Delta and Northwest, United and Continental hope to have regulatory approval of the deal done before President Bush leaves office, rather than face possible delays under a new administration.

 SUSPECT IN BAD TRADES FINDS JOB
 Jerome Kerviel, the suspected rogue trader who caused more than $7 billion in losses at the French banking giant Societe Generale, is out of prison and has found a new job -- as a computer consultant at a company that specializes in computer security and system development. Jean Veil, a lawyer for Societe Generale, said he was happy that Mr. Kerviel had secured employment. ''It means he will be in a position to start repaying the bank,'' Mr. Veil said. PAGE B3

 GROWING PAINS
 When he was an eighth grader in 2001, Tyler Tolson's left leg was three and a half inches shorter than his right. It took a rare, arduous and painful bone-lengthening procedure that stretched his left leg to make him able to walk normally -- and to play lacrosse better than that. Now he's a junior attackman at Division III Lynchburg College and has scored 112 goals in fewer than three seasons. PAGE B15

''It's just time,'' he says. PAGE B14 
 NEW YORK REPORT
 SHOOTING VERDICT SETTLES PRESENT, 
 But Detectives' Future Is Unclear
 The three New York City police detectives found not guilty in the shooting death of Sean Bell expressed relief at a news conference. Some thanked God and their families, and one offered apologies to Mr. Bell's family and said, ''This is the start of my life back.'' But it is not clear what life, or their jobs, holds for them next. PAGE B10
 A VOW TO KEEP PUSHING
 Some of Sean Bell's relatives and their supporters visited Mr. Bell's grave after the not-guilty verdict for three detectives accused in his death. Some talked of anger, boycotts, civil disobedience. Mostly, they talked about not letting the verdict divert them. ''We're not going to give up,'' said the father of the woman Mr. Bell was to have married. ''We're going to keep pushing forward.'' PAGE B9

 WELL, THEIR LAWYERS SEE THE GLASS AS HALF-FULL
 The best-selling self-help book ''The Secret'' promises success to people who think positively, through something its authors call ''the law of attraction.'' If they follow that logic, both Drew Heriot, the director of the movie on which the book is based, and Dan Hollings, the developer of its Web site, should think affirming thoughts after filing separate suits against Rhonda Byrne, the creator of the project.

 SKETCHING A LEADER
 Yasmina Reza's ''Dawn, Dusk or Night,'' which she calls ''an impressionistic sketch'' of Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign for the French presidency last year, largely concerns itself with personalities instead of issues of state. The French playwright followed Mr. Sarkozy around during his bid, and her account played a large role in shaping public perception of the French leader. ''It is as if Nicolas Sarkozy stepped out of my pages and now leads his own life,'' she said. PAGE A17

 Why would gay men in their 20s rush to marry? Maybe it has something to do with gay teenagers coming out earlier and being able to experience a gay adolescence, Benoit Denizet-Lewis writes.

 BOOK REVIEW
 In ''The Second Plane,'' his collection of essays about Sept. 11, Martin Amis substitutes insult for analysis and writes about history and politics as if Orwell never lived, Leon Wieseltier writes. For all of Mr. Amis's testimonies about the event's transformative impact, there is at least one way in which he has been thoroughly untouched by the atrocity: he is still busy with the pursuit of extraordinary sentences.

 Legend has it that the disturbances that convulsed France in the spring of 1968 began at the movies and came full circle when, three months later, the Cannes Film Festival came to a halt. New Yorkers can mark the 40th anniversary of that year with a program on Jean-Luc Godard at the Film Forum and a wide-ranging series at Lincoln Center. To rediscover the cinematic experiments of 1968 is to be amazed at how raw, how disarmingly alive the period's films are. A review by A.O. Scott. PAGE 1

HEADLINE: Top Official On Economy Steps Down In Argentina

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
Martin Lousteau, Argentina's embattled economy minister, resigned late Thursday after less than five months in the job, amid rising inflation and a protracted conflict with farmers over government tax policy. 
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Argentina's president, quickly named Carlos Fernandez, an adviser who briefly headed Argentina's tax agency, to succeed Mr. Lousteau. 
 The government did not comment on the reasons for Mr. Lousteau's departure. Mr. Lousteau, who is 36 and was trained at the London School of Economics, apparently grew frustrated with the government's response to rising inflation and the fallout from a three-week strike by farmers.
 Mr. Fernandez, a former economy minister of Buenos Aires Province, was also an adviser to former President Nestor Kirchner, the husband of the current president. He said Friday that government economic policy would not change.
 Before resigning late Thursday, Mr. Lousteau met with Mrs. Kirchner and presented her with a plan to stabilize the economy, urging her to adopt it to ''avoid a serious crisis,'' the Argentine newspaper La Nacion reported. 
 Mr. Lousteau was working on an index of prices to try to contain inflation, said Fernando Porta, an economist with the Center for Science, Development and Higher Education Studies in Buenos Aires. ''He was admitting to her that there was a problem with inflation,'' Mr. Porta said.
 Efforts to reach Mr. Lousteau were not successful. Messages left at his office and with his spokesman were not returned.
 Despite his title, Mr. Lousteau held little power to set the overall direction of Argentina's economy, which most analysts said was being controlled by the former president. 
 Since Mr. Kirchner was elected in 2003 in the wake of a financial crisis, the economy has grown by an average of 8 percent a year, in large part through a strategy of maintaining a low currency to increase exports and high subsidies on food and energy to encourage consumer spending. His wife has continued those policies.
 But those policies face increasing pressure. For several months leading up to the presidential election last October, the Kirchners denied that inflation was rising quickly, insisting that official numbers from the government statistical agency, Indec, were accurate. 
 Several officials who had left Indec, however, criticized a new methodology for calculating inflation established by a political appointee. Dante Sica, director of Abeceb, an economic consulting firm in Buenos Aires, said inflation was 16 to 18 percent, about twice as high as the 8.8 percent that the government reported last month.
 Mr. Lousteau had been shut out of much of the day-to-day decision-making, analysts said. He focused on improving relations with the United States and looking for a solution to Argentina's outstanding debt, said Graciela Romer, a political analyst in Buenos Aires.
 Nevertheless, he signed off on a series of floating-rate export tariffs on agricultural goods put in place on March 11 that incited a farmer revolt. The resulting widespread strike crippled exports of grains and meat and caused food shortages in stores. 
 Mr. Lousteau refused to back down from the new measures, and Mrs. Kirchner harshly criticized the farmers in speeches.
 The farmers suspended their strikes on April 2, declaring a one-month truce to try to negotiate with the government. Mr. Lousteau was visibly absent from the talks. 
 Farmers are threatening to resume blockades on Friday unless they see progress in negotiations with the government.

HEADLINE: Heading Toward The Danger Zone

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Barack Obama is winning, so why does it look like Hillary Clinton is having all the fun?
 Senator Obama has been thrown completely off his game by a combination of political attacks (some fair, some foul), a toxic eruption (the volcanic Jeremiah Wright was a gift from the gods to the Clintons and the G.O.P.), and some pretty serious self-inflicted wounds.
 You can almost feel the air seeping out of the Obama phenomenon. The candidate and his aides are brainstorming ways to counter the Clinton death-ray machine and regain the momentum. They need to generate some new excitement and enthusiasm, and they need to do it soon. 
 Despite all the new voters who have been brought into the process, Democrats are filled with anxiety about their prospects in November. A nervous operative told me on Friday: ''If we lose this election, it would be like Johnson losing to Goldwater.''
 One of the problems is that anger is growing like a cancer among Democrats. The Clintons have more than lived up to their polarizing reputations, slicing and dicing the electorate and then gleefully exploiting the myriad divisions.
 Their message varies, depending on whether it's in public or behind the scenes. But the mantra is roughly as follows: Obama won't win! He can't win whites. Jeremiah Wright! He can't win women. He can't win Hispanics. He'll lose Jewish voters. Farrakhan! We'll nuke Iran.
 The share of Clinton voters who have been telling exit pollsters that they will not vote for Senator Obama if he wins the nomination is inching toward the red zone. At the same time, there is growing resentment of the Clintons' tactics among Obama partisans, especially the young and African-Americans.
 Representative James Clyburn, one of the most highly respected black leaders in Congress, told The Times that there is an almost unanimous belief among blacks that the Clintons were committed to damaging Senator Obama so badly that even if he wins the nomination he would never be able to win the general election.
 What we're witnessing here -- in what was supposed to have been a championship season for Democrats -- is a potential train wreck. And it can't all be blamed on the Clintons.
 However one views the behavior of Bill and Hillary Clinton -- and however large the race issue looms in this election, and it looms large -- there can be no denying that an awful lot of Mr. Obama's troubles have come from his side of the table. The Rev. Wright fiasco undermined the fundamental rationale of the entire Obama campaign -- that it would be about healing, about putting partisanship aside, about reaching across ethnic and party divisions to bring people together in a new era of cooperation. 
 It's hard to continue making that case when the candidate's spiritual adviser is on television castigating America and scaring the hell out of at least some white people. Senator Obama did his best with his speech on race in Philadelphia, but the Wright story has extremely muscular legs. It has hurt the campaign far more than Mr. Obama's comments about guns and religion in San Francisco.
 But more important than the Wright comments -- and sundry gaffes by Mr. Obama himself, his wife, Michelle, and campaign aides -- has been Senator Obama's strange reluctance to fight harder in public for the nomination. He may feel he doesn't need to, that he has the nomination wrapped up. But there is such a thing as being too cool.
 Hillary Clinton may be behind, and she may lose. But she is now widely seen as the tougher of the two candidates, the one who is more resolute, who will fight harder and longer (and, yes, more unscrupulously) to achieve her desired ends.
 An edge in toughness is hardly a good quality to cede to your opponent.
 The big issue in this campaign is the economy and jobs. But if you were to ask most voters how Senator Obama plans to fight for them on this crucial matter, you're likely to get a blank stare.
 He should be pounding that message home with a jackhammer. Give the voters an economic program to wrap their arms around. Let them know: ''I'm for you! And this is what we're going to do!''
 Some Democratic officials who were worried about having Senator Clinton at the top of the ticket in November are now expressing concern about Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton's bar-brawl tactics have raised her negatives sharply, but they've also raised doubts about Mr. Obama. Is he a fighter? Is he tough enough to take on the G.O.P.? 
 One of Senator Obama's favorite phrases is ''the fierce urgency of now.'' There is nothing more fiercely urgent for him right now than to reassure voters and superdelegates that an Obama candidacy will not lead to a Democratic debacle in November.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Now Sees Obama as Liability for Ticket

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama is starring in a growing number of campaign commercials, but the latest batch is being underwritten by Republicans. 
 In a sign that the racial, class and values issues simmering in the presidential campaign could spread into the larger political arena, Republican groups are turning recent bumps in Mr. Obama's road -- notably his comment that small-town Americans ''cling'' to guns and religion out of bitterness and a fiery speech by his former minister in which he condemned the United States -- into attacks against Democrats down the ticket. 
 ''The public, week by week, is becoming more familiar with his big-government, far-left vision for America,'' said Ed Patru, a spokesman for Freedom's Watch, an advocacy organization that is portraying Mr. Obama as ultraliberal in an advertisement running in Louisiana before a special election for a House seat. 
 Republicans say the new focus on Mr. Obama reflects their view that he remains the more likely Democratic presidential nominee since he continues to lead Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in convention delegates. It also shows that Republicans, who have for months characterized Mrs. Clinton as the contender who would most energize Republican voters, now see vulnerabilities in Mr. Obama that could be liabilities for other Democrats on the ballot. 
 ''There were times when Republicans reacted with just horror that he would lead the ticket,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. ''Now there is not the sense of him being invulnerable, the magic bullet. I think there has been a major change.''
 The growing Republican emphasis on Mr. Obama could also help Mrs. Clinton plead her case that she is more electable, bolstering her argument to superdelegates that Republicans are poised to pounce on her relatively untested opponent. Her advisers have been frustrated that some top Democrats rate Mrs. Clinton a greater liability for the party's candidates in conservative parts of the country -- a view still held by some strategists -- even though she has shown a capacity to withstand Republican attacks.
 At the same time, some Democrats privately said the new Republican push could be a backdoor effort to buoy Mrs. Clinton, the candidate Republicans initially saw as the Democrat who would most rally Republicans and spur fund-raising. It has not been lost on Republican strategists that they can give pause to superdelegates leaning toward endorsing Mr. Obama. 
 The Republican House and Senate campaign organizations have seized on the remark on bitter voters in particular, encouraging their candidates to make the most of it. Advertisements have been placed on the Internet, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee assembled videos for targeted states that replay Mr. Obama's comments as somber music builds. ''Mary Landrieu. A Democratic superdelegate,'' says the video, referring to the Louisiana senator, who is seeking re-election this year. ''Will she cast her vote for Obama?'' 
 Democrats say Republicans are going to vilify either Democratic contender and distort his or her record in an effort to weaken the nominee and drag down fellow Democrats. 
 ''We know they will use Karl Rove/Lee Atwater tactics no matter who the nominee is,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''Republicans have lost their credibility on the issues they want to scare people on, like national security, so they will try a different strategy.''
 Mr. Obama was considered a crucial asset in a House election in Illinois earlier this year when his endorsement helped a Democrat, Bill Foster, gain the seat vacated by former Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican. And for months Republicans have looked with dismay on Mr. Obama's ability to draw new voters and on the force of his call for change.
 But they say the drawn-out campaign has altered Mr. Obama's image. In recent days, Republicans have sought to make him a lightning rod in the hotly contested special House race in Louisiana and in a statewide race in North Carolina, whose presidential primary is May 6. 
 A state party advertisement in North Carolina has come under fire even from leading Republicans. It shows a grainy clip of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama's former pastor, cursing the United States, and it notes the endorsement of Mr. Obama by two Democratic candidates for North Carolina governor. ''He's just too extreme for North Carolina,'' the commercial concludes of Mr. Obama.
 Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, demanded that the advertisement be pulled, and others characterized it as reminiscent of the racially tinged spots of past North Carolina campaigns. But Mr. McCain has no authority to force such commercials off the air, a situation that could provide him with the advantage of taking a stand against a polarizing campaign spot while possibly benefiting from the advertisement.
 In Louisiana, Freedom's Watch's six-figure ad purchase seeks to tie the Democratic contender, Don Cazayoux, to Mr. Obama's ''big-government scheme'' for health care. Another commercial in that race, by the National Republican Congressional Committee, claims that Mr. Cazayoux shares Mr. Obama's ''radical health care agenda.'' The House campaign group has also been pressing Democratic contenders to disavow Mr. Obama's remark on rural Americans.
 ''He is being defined more and more as a conventional liberal politician,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 The emerging advertising effort against Mr. Obama raises the possibility that, if he is elected, similar commercials could be broadcast in conservative districts around the country this fall, as Republicans try to undermine Democrats who have endorsed him. ''Conventional wisdom has been that we want to run against Hillary,'' said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, who said Mr. Obama had provided evidence to the contrary. ''I don't think he has connected with the average Joe. I do think he feels like people are bitter.''
 But Representative Zack Space, a freshman Democrat seeking re-election in a predominantly Republican district in Ohio, said he did not think such tactics would work.
 ''The people of my district are smart enough to figure out that kind of thing,'' Mr. Space said. ''We have two qualified people, and I am going to support the nominee. And regardless of who they vote for for president, the people of my district are going to vote for the right person for Congress.''
 Still, the prolonged Democratic nominating fight is complicating the campaigns of some of the party's Congressional candidates. Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania, who spoke favorably last month of Mr. Obama and appeared with him at an event in his district, announced he would remain neutral in the race until the primaries ended June 3. Republicans criticized him for what they said was his ducking the issue. 
 Republicans are not alone in trying to link a presidential contender unfavorably with Congressional candidates. House Democrats have begun a concerted effort to tie dozens of Republicans to Mr. McCain and, just as important in their view, to President Bush.
 In a recent blitz, the House Democratic campaign arm called on about 40 Republicans to disavow Mr. McCain's comment that there had been ''great progress economically'' during the Bush administration. Democrats say their goal is not only to put the focus on House contenders,but also to rough up Mr. McCain so he does not enjoy a free ride while the Democrats sort out their presidential picture.
 ''Our presidential candidates are spending so much time firing at each other that we haven't focused enough on the big differences between the Democrats and John McCain,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, the House Democratic strategist. ''We are going to make it very clear to voters that John McCain is George Bush all over again.''

HEADLINE: Democratic Superdelegates Say Rest of Campaign Will Be Crucial

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER and CARL HULSE; Megan Thee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Jeanne Lemire Dahlman, a Montana superdelegate and rancher, has declared her allegiance to Senator Barack Obama. But she said voters in her state, whose primary is June 3, are thrilled by the unresolved Democratic nominating fight, which gives them a potential voice in a nominating process that has usually bypassed them.
 ''A part of me would like to wrap this up,'' she acknowledged. ''But I think Senator Clinton should continue, unless she tanks in Indiana.'' 
 The Pennsylvania primary was supposed to help clarify the picture for the 795 Democratic superdelegates, but Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's strong victory there on Tuesday has in many ways complicated matters for them, furthering a stalemate that has deeply divided the party even as top Democrats called this week for them to make up their minds by June. 
 The latest New York Times survey of superdelegates -- the party leaders and elected officials who essentially have the power to determine the nominee -- finds that Mrs. Clinton holds a 16-person edge that slices into Mr. Obama's overall lead in delegates. And those 478 superdelegates who have declared their allegiances show no signs of switching sides as the primary calendar proceeds toward its June 3 ending. 
 Donald L. Fowler is a South Carolina superdelegate who supports Mrs. Clinton. His wife, Carol, is a superdelegate too, but she supports Mr. Obama. Needless to say, they have very different views of how the party should proceed in light of Mrs. Clinton's Pennsylvania victory. 
 ''It's sort of like what you would have heard at the Super Bowl at the end of the third quarter,'' Mr. Fowler said. ''Patriot fans are anxious and optimistic, and Giant fans are hopeful and a little bit more anxious. But the game is not over.''
 He said Clinton supporters like him ''are encouraged'' by the Pennsylvania results, ''but we're not naive.'' He added: ''We're still behind and we've got a lot to do to catch up. She's playing games now where she has to win them all.'' 
 Ms. Fowler, who is chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said that once the primaries were over, she would like to see a prompt resolution. ''I've been in politics long enough to know that when you get close to the end, people get cranky with each other,'' she said. ''But I believe that won't continue forever. People will find that the wounds are not so deep they can't be healed.'' 
 As with previous contests, Pennsylvania did little to change the math in terms of superdelegates. In interviews, superdelegates supporting Mrs. Clinton seized on the results to push for the contest to continue, while Obama backers often focused on the need for party unity. And some expressed trepidation about their newfound power. 
 One superdelegate, David E. Price, was a member of the Hunt Commission, which created the superdelegate system in the early 1980s. Now a representative from North Carolina who has endorsed Senator Obama, Mr. Price says he notices ''a certain deterioration out there of the climate, but I don't want to exaggerate that.'' Because the views of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are so close on most issues, ''it is tempting to pick each other's words apart and concentrate on lesser matters,'' he said. ''That does become irritating and wear on voters. But we will get past it.'' 
 What appears to worry him more is the idea, advanced by some of Mrs. Clinton's advisers and supporters, that the superdelegates have the authority to be the final arbiters in the Clinton-Obama race. He said the superdelegates should intervene only in extraordinary circumstances that do not now exist. 
 ''The fact is that the unpledged delegate group was added not to be kingmakers or queenmakers but simply to give each state a few extra slots without having to sign in blood for a presidential candidate or run against their own constituents,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone thought this would be the decisive voting bloc, let alone overturn a popular verdict.''
 The biggest well of superdelegates is in Congress. There, Democrats in the House and the Senate seemed resigned to the likelihood that the nominating contest would stretch on at least to June. 
 They sought to play down the potential damage to the party of an extended nominating fight. And they emphasized the enthusiasm shown by voters and said they believed that Democrats fervently committed to one or the other candidate would rally to the eventual nominee once the contrast is shown between any Democrat and Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee.
 Yet there was a clear sentiment that the rest of the Democratic campaign and the way it is resolved would be crucial. ''The way the loser loses,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who is close to both candidates but has made no endorsement, ''will determine whether the winner wins in November.''
 The Democrats' national chairman, Howard Dean, told The Financial Times in an article on Friday: ''I think the race is going to come down to the perception in the last six or eight races of who the best opponent for McCain will be. I do not think in the long run it will come down to the popular vote or anything else.''
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, another publicly neutral superdelegate, said the nominating contest would take care of itself. ''I still say it will never get to the superdelegates,'' said Mr. Harkin, who once ran for president himself. ''Within 10 days of the last primary, one or the other will drop out.''
 Mr. Harkin was among those who were skeptical of the claim that disheartened supporters of Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton would abandon the party if their choice lost and possibly back Mr. McCain. ''That's now,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''Two months later, three months later, of course they are all going to be on board. Emotions run high in primaries, but time heals all wounds and political wounds tend to heal faster.''
 Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a strong backer of Mr. Obama, said she believed the thousands of new voters being drawn into the primary process would coalesce around the Democratic nominee once the candidates and the party begin to define Mr. McCain better on issues like the war and the economy.
 ''I think that will turn the tide for the people who are going in that direction,'' she said of those saying they could abandon the winner. ''We have a job to do, and shame on us if we don't create that definition,'' she said of the distinctions between the Democratic nominee and Mr. McCain.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, another Obama backer, also noted the enthusiasm, particularly among young voters, that he had witnessed when campaigning for Mr. Obama. He said that zeal should end up being ''enormously constructive and valuable and helpful.''
 Representative John Tanner of Tennessee gave Mrs. Clinton his superdelegate support on Wednesday after Pennsylvania, but he said the current economic and political climate would seem to favor either Democrat over Mr. McCain in November.
 ''But I think she presents the most pragmatic view of our problems,'' he said. ''You can talk all you want, have all the rhetoric you want about how it ought to be, but we have got to have somebody who is a pragmatist: What is possible? How is it possible to reverse the financial ruination occurring before our very eyes?'' 
 Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who has announced no preference in the race so far, said he believedthe contest was only strengthening the nominee.
 ''I would prefer the issue be resolved so we had a nominee and not give John McCain the opportunity to put together his base,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''But I think our nominee will be stronger as the result of this fight.''

HEADLINE: No Shoes, No Shirt, No Worries

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS. 
MICHELLE HIGGINS writes the Practical Traveler column for the Travel section.

 BODY:
WHEN Larry Massa says he likes to travel light, he means it. No need for a jacket and tie at dinner, a pristine set of tennis whites when he hits the court, or even a bathrobe to wear when heading from his hotel room to the pool or the spa.
 For when Mr. Massa, 74, a retired Navy commander and computer science engineer from Virginia Beach, and his wife, Darlene, go on vacation, they do it in the nude. ''If you haven't tried it, there's no way I can tell you what a fun thing it is, what an added dimension to a vacation it can be'' said Mr. Massa, who has been taking ''clothing-optional'' vacations since 2001 and whose most recent trip was to an all-nude resort in Mexico. ''I'll never forget the day,'' said Mr. Massa, recalling the couple's first nudist vacation at a Caribbean resort. ''The place was full. We went to the far end of the pool and Dar said, 'I'm going to take my top off.' I thought I'm not going to wear these stupid swim trunks in the pool. So I jumped in naked. She looked down at me and dropped her bottoms and we never looked back.'' 
 To many, the mention of a nudist resort conjures up images of isolated beach colonies with volleyball courts, hippie-style gatherings in a secluded campground or R.V. parks tucked away in the woods for vacationers who still talk reverently about the Summer of Love. 
 And while those kinds of offerings still exist for Mr. Massa and his fellow naturalists, as they prefer to be called, the real boom in nude vacations is coming at the high end of the business, as upscale hotels and resorts, and even some luxury cruise lines, have begun to see the economic potential in the no-clothes crowd -- particularly those who want to shed their clothes but not their pampered lifestyles.
 The $300-a-person all-inclusive Hidden Beach Resort, a nude-only luxury hotel that opened in 2003 along Mexico's popular Mayan Riviera, greets guests with Champagne upon arrival. Rose petals are tossed on the beds at turndown, and beach butlers hand out towels and reading materials to guests relaxing in the nude, while they themselves walk around in discreet uniforms of buttoned-down shirts and khaki pants.
 Sea Mountain Inn, a two-year old nude resort and spa in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., with room rates ranging from $269 to $900 a night, features Asian-influenced rooms with Egyptian bed linens, flat-screen TVs and natural mineral water pumped into the shower. The upscale Occidental Grand Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands has set aside entire blocks of rooms exclusively for nude guests. And several mainstream hotels, including Caesar's Palace and the Mirage in Las Vegas, have introduced topless pools in the past couple of years. 
 Even in the vacation home market, a new clothing-optional condo-resort, Mira Vista in Marana, Ariz., is selling more than a hundred two-bedroom condominiums, priced from $244,500. 
 In 2007, nude recreation represented a $440 million industry -- up from $400 million in 2001 and $200 million in 1992 -- and it's still growing, says the American Association for Nude Recreation, which promotes au natural vacations as ''nakations.'' According to the association, roughly 20 percent of members have a median household income of $106,000, drive luxury cars and spend $3,000 or more on travel. 
 The types of nude vacations have expanded too. Vacationers can now roll out a mat at all-nude yoga retreats, share banana bread with other guests at all-nude bed-and-breakfasts, gear up for nude mountain biking in California's High Desert and saunter around the decks of cruise ships chartered specifically for clothing-free travel. In Germany, a travel operator has arranged for an all-nude charter flight this summer to take customers to a clothing-optional retreat in the Baltics. The naturalists will take off and land fully clothed, but shed their clothes once airborne. (Flight attendants and crew will, however, keep their uniforms on.)
 SpaFinder.com, an online spa search engine, recently created a separate category for ''nudist spa vacations'' after noticing an increase in searches for the term. Since November, searches on SpaFinder.com for such trips have averaged about 720 a month -- beating out ''pet-friendly spas'' (284) and ''waxing services'' (298).
 ''It's no longer just a grass-roots, nuts-and-sweets kind of thing,'' said Nancy Tiemann, president of Bare Necessities, which specializes in nude travel and is offering a seven-day Greek cruise in September, along with four others in 2008 and 2009. Four months ago, Ms. Teimann's company began selling an all-nude 2010 Hawaiian cruise on Celebrity Cruise Line's Constellation, a 2,000-passenger ship. Already, about 90 percent of the ship is booked. 
 When the company, which she owns with her husband, Tom, began chartering small ships for all-nude cruises in the early 90s, she said many mainstream cruise operators dismissed them as a joke. ''Now,'' Ms. Tiemann said, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole, ''they're trampling each other to get our business.''
 Most nude vacationers say that what they enjoy most is liberation from the typical pretenses of society. ''When you don't have any clothes on, you don't know if someone's a judge or a doctor, or a lawyer or a mechanic,'' said Larry Massa. ''You are what you are.'' 
 Nude recreation, of course, goes back at least to the ancient Greeks, who competed in the Olympics sans clothing, and later, in the United States, both Benjamin Franklin and Henry David Thoreau lauded the benefits of nude nature walks, or ''air baths.'' 
 But it wasn't until the dawn of the 20th century when nudism became organized in America, according to the American Association for Nude Recreation. Kurt Barthel, a German immigrant, is acknowledged as the founder of American nudism. On Labor Day of 1929 he led a small group of individuals to picnic in the buff in upstate New York and organized the first official nudist club, called the American League for Physical Culture, where nudists paid dues to gather to swim, socialize and relax in the nude.
 Today, America's increasing obsession with health and wellness may be contributing to the rise of clothing-optional vacations. ''Americans have moralized healthy bodies,'' said Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, who has studied moral emotion and judgment. He added that ''a case could be made that people are traveling to these places to be pure for moral reasons -- to achieve harmony in nature.'' It's really a form of self-expression, he added, that dates back to Walt Whitman and John Muir, as well as Thoreau, all of whom advocated being as true to yourself as possible. ''The truest you can be is taking off those clothes,'' he said. 
 Suzann Zane, a 26-year-old bartender from Baltimore, decided to try her first nude vacation this year -- a weekend getaway in January to the Avalon Resort in Paw Paw, W. Va. -- partly because of her interest in getting back to nature. ''I consider myself a minimalist,'' said Ms. Zane. ''With this big societal push for becoming green, we need to kind of get back to our roots and I thought maybe this would be a good way.'' The first clue that this would be a different kind of vacation came on the drive up the long winding road to Avalon. The first sign Ms. Zane said she spotted was one that posted the speed limit at 7 m.p.h. The second announced, ''Beyond this point you will encounter nudity.''
 When Susan Sullivan, 42, from New Jersey, visited her first nudist resort last year with her boyfriend, John Sheilds, 55, she said she had to warm up to the idea of disrobing in front of strangers by draping a towel over her body when she first went outdoors. But after a short while, she too lost any inhibitions. ''You come to the realization you're looking at those people, you're not staring at people. They're not staring at you.''
 SpaFinder's chief executive, Pete Ellis, theorizes that the increase of spas at resorts has influenced the growing acceptance of nudity. After all, disrobing for a massage has become a routine vacation ritual for many travelers. Even the staid Canyon Ranch Resort in Tucson, Ariz., has nude sunbathing decks off both the women's and men's locker rooms with an unlimited supply of sunscreen.
 Warm-weather resorts from Palm Springs to Miami Beach to the Caribbean say they are seeing (and turning a blind eye to) more topless sunbathing at their pools and beaches as the strength of the euro brings more Europeans, and their more relaxed attitude toward nudity, on vacations to this country.
 So many European guests were sunbathing topless on the beach at Starfish Trelawny, an all-inclusive family resort in Jamaica, that the resort put up a bamboo fence at the eastern end of its beach a few years ago to keep conservative guests happy and teenage boys from gawking. And Shan Kanagasingham, the general manager at The Tides, in South Beach, recalls her first stay at the hotel when she got the job about a year ago. ''When I checked in for the first time to the Tides -- and I'm not making this up -- I opened the window and looked out, and all I saw was this sea of breasts and people walking around in G-strings.'' 
 The spa at the Parker Palms Springs, which opened about two years ago, offers separate men's and women's areas each with pools and relaxation areas, all of which can be used in the nude. ''And trust me, they are,'' said Marisa Zafran, the hotel's spokeswoman. 
 To make sure the experience doesn't turn voyeuristic -- or into a free love free-for-all, some resorts turn away single men. And most make it clear what the resort offers and what it doesn't. ''We make sure they understand it's not a sexual kind of place,'' said Tom Mulhall, who owns the Terra Cotta Inn in Palm Springs, with his wife, Mary Clare.
 And while nude resorts say they don't pressure guests to strip, guests are expected to be mostly naked for most of their stay. ''We allow for the clothing optional until they feel comfortable with their own body and are willing to be nude in public,'' said Dave Landman, co-owner of Mira Vista Resort near Tucson. ''If someone we get is never nude I go over and say, ''why are you here?'''
 No matter how popular and upscale nude resorts become, one social convention is unlikely to change: Nudity and family vacations don't always mix.
 Just ask the Massas. They simply can't convince their children, all in their late 40s, to join them on their two or three trips a year. 
 On vacation at the Couples Negril resort in Jamaica, which has a nude beach in addition to what she refers to as a ''prude'' beach, Ms. Massa said she casually mentioned to her son and daughter-in-law that she was going to check out the nude side. 
 ''Mom,'' replied her son, ''I don't want to see you naked.''
 PLANNING A NAKATION? DON'T FORGET THE SUNBLOCK
 The American Association for Nude Recreation (www.aanr.com) defines a nakation as: ''1. A clothes-free interlude from one's customary duties, as for recreation or rest; a holiday. 2. The part of your vacation you'll brag to friends about.'' Here are some of the growing nakation options. 
 NUDE RESORTS: Roughly an hour south of Cancun, Mexico, the all-inclusive Hidden Beach Resort offers 42 oceanfront suites with Champagne upon arrival and special touches like rose petals tossed on the bed at turndown. In addition to the pool, beach and hot tub, au natural amenities include nude dining, nude bars and a nude disco (888-754-3907; www.hiddenbeachresort.com). Rates begin at $215 per person a night based on two people sharing an oceanfront junior suite. 
 The Sea Mountain Inn in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., is a so-called nude lifestyle resort with an emphasis on ''upscale adults only pleasures.'' Rooms start at $269 a night and offer Asian decor, Egyptian bed linens and mineral water pumped into the showers. No single men allowed (877-928-2827; www.seamountaininn.com). 
 In Spain's Canary Islands, the all-inclusive Occidental Grand Fuerteventura has 38 rooms set aside exclusively for nude guests. The rooms share an au natural swimming pool and Jacuzzi and start at $67 euros a person a night, or about $108 at $1.61 to the euro (34-928-873-600; www.occidentalhotels.com).
 NUDE CRUISES:Bare Necessities Tour and Travel is offering several naked cruises including a nearly sold-out week-long sailing in February 2009 to ports in Florida, Jamaica and Mexico. Passengers must board and disembark fully clothed and dress for dinner in the dining room. Prices start at $1,949 for a cabin with a balcony on the upper deck (800-743-0405, www.bare-necessities.com).
 Castaways Travel is selling a sail down the Danube in the nude, from Budapest to Vienna to Nuremberg, July 20 to 27, on a 75-cabin river boat. Rates from $2,199 to $2,799 a person (800-470-2020, www.danubeadultcruise.com). 
 NUDE FLIGHT: A German travel company, OssiUrlaub, is offering an all-nude flight from Erfurt, Germany, to the Baltic Sea resort of Usedom in July. Note to non-German speakers: ask for Sandra. Cost: 499 euros a person(49-361-6006-520; www.ossiurlaub.de).

HEADLINE: Big (Young) Man on Campus

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY 

 BODY:
 LIKE most college freshmen, Art Forst enjoys sleeping in, but he usually cannot spare the time. He is a football player at Rutgers, and the alarm clock in his dorm room rudely reminds him that he needs to work out year-round.
 ''Sometimes, when I wake up at 4:20 in the morning, I say to myself, 'I could be in high school right now,' '' Forst, 18, said recently with a smile. 
 Instead, at the advice of coaches and others, he decided to get a leg up on his college education and his college career.
 Though he should have been finishing his senior year at Manasquan High School in June, Forst, an offensive tackle and a top national prospect, rushed to earn the required number of credits for his diploma by December. That allowed him to enroll at Rutgers in January, a semester early.
 Forst, who completed spring practice with the rest of the Scarlet Knights this month, believes his early arrival on campus will put him ahead of other players in the fall.
 University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, who as a sophomore last season became the first underclassman to win the Heisman Trophy, also entered college through early enrollment. 
 ''Every year, you get more and more kids coming in early, because they can not only get acclimated football-wise, but it gets kids oriented to going to school -- balancing academics and sports, making the best use of their time,'' said Bob Lichtenfels, a recruiting analyst for Scout.com, a Web site that tracks college choices of top high school athletes. ''They are so far ahead of the kids who come into school in the fall.''
 Of the 51,000 students on the Rutgers campus, only 25 enrolled in January ahead of schedule, said Courtney McAnuff, the university's vice president for enrollment management. The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not keep statistics on early admissions among athletes, officials said. But three other football players at Rutgers have taken the same route, officials said.
 Two share a dormitory suite with Forst: Steve Shimko, a freshman quarterback from Ewing, and Keith Stroud, a freshman wide receiver from Brooklyn who spent a year at Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia. The other, Mo Lange, a tackle from Hillsborough, entered Rutgers early last year.
 Though Forst is younger than many of his classmates this year, he hardly looks it, at 6 feet 8 inches and about 300 pounds. He is taking four courses for 13 credits this semester.
 ''I think that it's been beneficial for me,'' he said, ''yet some people lose a lot. It depends on how much you care about doing those senior-year-of-high-school things.''
 He plans to go to the prom at Manasquan, but does not plan to participate in graduation, saying, ''I'm not a very sentimental person, I suppose.''
 The second of Bob and Lisa Forst's four children, Forst drives 45 minutes home to Manasquan most weekends to see his girlfriend and to decompress from a week of studying and lifting weights.
 ''He was absolutely ready to do this,'' Bob Forst said. ''He's always ready to keep going to the next level. Art is always looking to just keep moving on.''
 Art Forst picked Rutgers over five other prestigious football schools he considered: Notre Dame, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and Boston College. He said that he admired Coach Greg Schiano's integrity and that he felt comfortable at Rutgers.
 It was the coach of one of the schools Forst turned down, Urban Meyer of Florida, who suggested that Forst enroll in college early, so he could get a head start on his college classes, not to mention learning the technique required to play college football.
 Forst thought Meyer made sense. So after consulting with high school officials, he picked up two independent-study classes -- one on the Vietnam War, the other on economics -- and finished them as he played football for the Manasquan Warriors.
 ''Once he made that commitment, there was no wavering on it,'' said Rich Read, an assistant coach at Manasquan High. ''He has a very strong faith that guides him a lot in his decision-making. He's focused on where he wants to go.''
 Forst is determined to become good enough at Rutgers to parlay his success into a career in the National Football League, but if that does not work, his father said he would not be surprised to see Art become an entrepreneur.
 When he was a boy, his father, who is in the construction business, used to invite him to work -- and Art would insist on working. When it snowed at Rutgers, Forst went to the maintenance shed and asked to borrow a shovel. He knocked on doors and made $105 shoveling driveways. 
 ''He's probably one of the largest human beings you've seen, and he's a special, special guy,'' Schiano said recently. ''We're blessed to have him here early.''

 BODY:
It is 10:30 p.m. and students at the elite Daewon prep school here are cramming in a study hall that ends a 15-hour school day. A window is propped open so the evening chill can keep them awake. One teenager studies standing upright at his desk to keep from dozing.
 Kim Hyun-kyung, who has accumulated nearly perfect scores on her SATs, is multitasking to prepare for physics, chemistry and history exams.
 ''I can't let myself waste even a second,'' said Ms. Kim, who dreams of attending Harvard, Yale or another brand-name American college. And she has a good shot. This spring, as in previous years, all but a few of the 133 graduates from Daewon Foreign Language High School who applied to selective American universities won admission. 
 It is a success rate that American parents may well envy, especially now, as many students are swallowing rejection from favorite universities at the close of an insanely selective college application season.
 ''Going to U.S. universities has become like a huge fad in Korean society, and the Ivy League names -- Harvard, Yale, Princeton -- have really struck a nerve,'' said Victoria Kim, who attended Daewon and graduated from Harvard last June. 
 Daewon has one major Korean rival, the Minjok Leadership Academy, three hours' drive east of Seoul, which also has a spectacular record of admission to Ivy League colleges. 
 How do they do it? Their formula is relatively simple. They take South Korea's top-scoring middle school students, put those who aspire to an American university in English-language classes, taught by Korean and highly paid American and other foreign teachers, emphasize composition and other skills crucial to success on the SATs and college admissions essays, and -- especially this -- urge them on to unceasing study. 
 Both schools seem to be rethinking their grueling regimen, at least a bit. Minjok, a boarding school, has turned off dormitory surveillance cameras previously used to ensure that students did not doze in late-night study sessions. Daewon is ending its school day earlier for freshmen. Its founder, Lee Won-hee, worried in an interview that while Daewon was turning out high-scoring students, it might be falling short in educating them as responsible citizens.
 ''American schools may do a better job at that,'' Dr. Lee said. 
 Still, the schools are highly rigorous. Both supplement South Korea's required, lecture-based national curriculum with Western-style discussion classes. Their academic year is more than a month longer than at American high schools. Daewon, which costs about $5,000 per year to attend, requires two foreign languages besides English. Minjok, where tuition, board and other expenses top $15,000, offers Advanced Placement courses and research projects. 
 And, oh yes. Both schools suppress teenage romance as a waste of time.
 ''What are you doing holding hands?'' a Daewon administrator scolded an adolescent couple recently, according to his aides. ''You should be studying!''
 Students do not seem to complain. Park Yeshong, one of Kim Hyun-kyung's classmates, said attractions tended to fade during hundreds of hours of close-quarters study. ''We know each other too well to fall in love,'' she said. Many American educators would kill to have such disciplined pupils.
 Both schools reserve admission for highly motivated students; the application process resembles that at many American colleges, where students are judged on their grade-point averages, as well as their performance on special tests and in interviews. 
 ''Even my worst students are great,'' said Joseph Foster, a Williams College graduate who teaches writing at Daewon. ''They're professionals; if I teach them, they'll learn it. I get e-mails at 2 a.m. I'll respond and go to bed. When I get up, I'll find a follow-up question mailed at 5 a.m.''
 South Korea is not the only country sending more students to the United States, but it seems to be a special case. Some 103,000 Korean students study at American schools of all levels, more than from any other country, according to American government statistics. In higher education, only India and China, with populations more than 20 times that of South Korea's, send more students.
 ''Preparing to get to the best American universities has become something of a national obsession in Korea,'' said Alexander Vershbow, the American ambassador to South Korea. 
 Korean applications to Harvard alone have tripled, to 213 this spring, up from 66 in 2003, said William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions. Harvard has 37 Korean undergraduates, more than from any foreign country except Canada and Britain. Harvard, Yale and Princeton have a total of 103 Korean undergraduates; 34 graduated from Daewon or Minjok.
 This year, Daewon and Minjok graduates are heading to universities like Stanford, Chicago, Duke and seven of the eight Ivy League universities -- but not to Harvard. Instead, Harvard accepted four Korean students from three other prep schools.
 ''That was certainly not any statement'' about the Daewon and Minjok schools, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. ''We're alert to getting kids from schools where we haven't had them before, but we'd never reject an applicant simply because he or she came from a school with a history of sending students to Harvard.''
 South Korea's academic year starts in March, so the 2008 class of Daewon's Global Leadership Program, which prepares students for study at foreign universities, graduated in February.
 One graduate was Kim Soo-yeon, 19, who was accepted by Princeton this month. Daewon parents tend to be wealthy doctors, lawyers or university professors. Ms. Kim's father is a top official in the Korean Olympic Committee.
 Ms. Kim developed fierce study habits early, watching her mother scold her older sister for receiving any score less than 100 on tests. Even a 98 or a 99 brought a tongue-lashing. 
 ''Most Korean mothers want their children to get 100 on all the tests in all the subjects,'' Ms. Kim's mother said.
 Ms. Kim's highest aspiration was to attend a top Korean university, until she read a book by a Korean student at Harvard about American universities. Immediately she put up a sign in her bedroom: ''I'm going to an Ivy League!''
 Even while at Daewon, Ms. Kim, like thousands of Korean students, took weekend classes in English, physics and other subjects at private academies, raising her SAT scores by hundreds of points. ''I just love to do well on the tests,'' she said. 
 As bright as she is, she was just one great student among many, said Eric Cho, Daewon's college counselor. Sitting at his computer terminal at the school, perched on a craggy eastern hilltop overlooking the Seoul skyline, Mr. Cho scrolled through the class of 2008's academic records.
 Their average combined SAT score was 2203 out of 2400. By comparison, the average combined score at Phillips Exeter, the New Hampshire boarding school, is 2085. Sixty-seven Daewon graduates had perfect 800 math scores.
 Kim Hyun-kyung, 17, scored perfect 800s on the SAT verbal and math tests, and 790 in writing. She is scheduled to take nine Advanced Placement tests next month, in calculus, physics, chemistry, European history and five other subjects. One challenge: she has taken none of these courses. Instead, she is teaching herself in between classes at Daewon, buying and devouring textbooks.
 So she is busy. She rises at 6 a.m. and heads for her school bus at 6:50. Arriving at Daewon, she grabs a broom to help classmates clean her classroom. Between 8 and noon, she hears Korean instructors teach supply and demand in economics, Korean soils in geography and classical poets in Korean literature.
 At lunch she joins other raucous students, all, like her, wearing blue blazers, in a chow line serving beans and rice, fried dumpling and pickled turnip, which she eats with girlfriends. Boys, who sit elsewhere, wolf their food and race to a dirt lot for a 10-minute pickup soccer game before afternoon classes.
 Kim Hyun-kyung joins other girls at a hallway sink to brush her teeth before reporting to French literature, French culture and English grammar classes, taught by Korean instructors. At 3:20, her English language classes begin. This day, they include English literature, taught by Mani Tadayon, a polyglot graduate of the University of California at Berkeley who was born in Iran, and government and politics, taught by Hugh Quigley, a former Wall Street lawyer.
 Evening study hall begins at 7:45. She piles up textbooks on an adjoining desk, where they glare at her like a to-do list. Classmates sling backpacks over seats, prop a window open and start cramming. Three hours later, the floor is littered with empty juice cartons and water bottles. One girl has nodded out, head on desk. At 10:50 a tone sounds, and Ms. Kim heads for a bus that will wend its way through Seoul's towering high-rise canyons to her home, south of the Han River.
 ''I feel proud that I've endured another day,'' she said. 
 The schedule at the Minjok academy, on a rural campus of tile-roofed buildings in forested hills, appears even more daunting. Students rise at 6 for martial arts, and thereafter, wearing full-sleeved, gray-and-black robes, plunge into a day of relentless study that ends just before midnight, when they may sleep.
 But most keep cramming until 2 a.m., when dorm lights are switched off, said Gang Min-ho, a senior. Even then some students turn on lanterns and keep going, Mr. Gang said. ''Basically we lead very tired lives,'' he said.
 Students sometimes report for classes so exhausted that Alexander Ganse, a German who teaches European history, said he asked, ''Did you go to bed at all last night?''
 ''But we're not only nerds!'' interrupted Choi Jung-yun, who grew up in San Diego. Minjok students play sports, take part in many clubs and even have a rock band, she said. Ambassador Vershbow, who plays the drums, confirmed that with photographs that showed him jamming with Minjok's rockers during a visit to the school last year.
 There are other hints of slackening. A banner once hung on a Minjok building. ''This school is a paradise for those who want to study and a hell for those who do not,'' it read. But it was taken down after faculty members deemed it too harsh, said Son Eun-ju, director of counseling.

HEADLINE: Pain of Rising Diesel Costs Is Swift and Sharp

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

DATELINE: Bethany 

 BODY:
 CHERYL LAPAGLIA has not seen anything like it in the 28 years she has been working in her father's small trucking business here: diesel fuel prices that surpass the price of regular gasoline by a dollar a gallon, with the gap widening by the week.
 The last time Ms. LaPaglia, 49, the office manager at Petruzzello Transport, bought wholesale diesel fuel for the company's nine trucks, she paid $4.33 a gallon. 
 ''That's a 48-cent increase from what I paid 10 days before,'' she said. ''I don't know anything that goes up that quickly, and there's no end in sight.''
 Indeed, the latest AAA weekly survey shows diesel in Connecticut averaged $4.51 a gallon. A year ago it was $3.02. In April 2004, it was $1.82. 
 ''It's outrageous,'' said Lee Hawthorne, owner of Hawthorne & Sons of Enfield, which runs eight trucks hauling everything ''from trees to ice cream'' nationwide.
 ''We're hurting, and if it keeps heading in this direction, I don't see how any of us can survive,'' said Shaun Fleming, president of Fleming's Transportation in Suffield, a 35-truck operation delivering mostly food within 500 miles of Hartford.
 Most heavy-duty truck engines are made to use diesel, because, unlike gasoline, it provides enough power to move heavy trucks, which get only about 5.5 miles per gallon. Meanwhile, relentlessly rising fuel costs are squeezing profits from Connecticut's 4,600 mostly small trucking companies. 
 Petruzzello, which takes in revenues of $1.3 million annually hauling everything from food products to machine parts in a 250-mile radius of Bethany, suffered a 15 percent decrease in profits in the last year. 
 Trucking companies are passing on the increase in their fuel costs to shippers as surcharges. ''Our customers would not accept all of it,'' Ms. LaPaglia said. ''If you passed it all on, you'd lose business.''
 Some manufacturers who are facing surcharges from their shippers to cover the higher fuel costs are producing fewer goods to ship.
 ''People are not shipping as much freight as they did six months ago,'' said Tony Petruzzello, 75, the owner. ''Where I used to take a full load, now I'm picking up half a load. Companies are just not ordering supplies, and they're cutting their employees' hours.''
 Consumers are also shouldering the burden.
 ''Trucks transport 70 percent of all freight tonnage, and at least 80 percent of all towns and communities in the U.S. get their consumer goods like clothing and food by truck,'' said Bob Costello, chief economist at American Trucking Associations. ''So, with diesel prices at a record high, that has to lead to higher prices for you and me.''
 Diesel costs, a trucker's greatest expense, seriously threaten the nation's half a million freight haulers, said Michael Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, whose 1,000 members include movers, construction companies, landscapers, food transporters and other carriers.
 ''It's putting more stress on the trucking industry than anything I've seen in 20 years,'' Mr. Riley said. ''It's affecting the bottom line, and if truckers can't make a profit, they can't run, and if they don't run, we're in trouble.''
 Meanwhile, diesel fuel prices keep climbing. Since 2006, commercial vehicles have had to use a cleaner diesel -- ultra-low sulfur, containing 15 parts of sulfur per million parts of diesel fuel, down from 500 parts of sulfur -- and diesel costs more to make. 
 Also, global competition for diesel is high.
 ''About 60 percent of European vehicles are diesel-powered,'' said Steven Guveyan, executive vice president of the Connecticut Petroleum Council. ''There's greater demand for diesel on the world market, and it costs more to deliver to us. And as demand grows in Europe, the refiners are keeping diesel in Europe.''
 Truckers are forced to compensate, they said.
 ''I'm driving 55 miles an hour, and that increases my fuel economy by three-quarters of a mile per gallon,'' Mr. Hawthorne said.

SNEAKER WARS 
 The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and Puma and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sports. 
 By Barbara Smit. 
 Illustrated. 384 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95. 
 Are there any two more overused words in the book business than ''changed'' and ''forever''? Browse through the bookstore and how many books will you find with those words on the cover? The war that changed us forever. The speech that changed America forever. Even, if you can believe it, ''The Match: The Day the Game of Golf Changed Forever.'' I read a description of the book on Amazon.com. It didn't. Change golf forever, I mean.
 Barbara Smit's fundamental claim in ''Sneaker Wars'' is that the multigenerational feud involving members of the German Dassler family ''forever changed the business of sports.'' She says in her introduction that the feud ''shaped the modern sports business, giving rise to corruption and ever increasing financial stakes.'' 
 Well, at least this isn't complete hyperbole. Adi and Rudolf Dassler were brothers, based in the town of Herzogenaurach, who founded a small shoe company in the 1920s called Gebruder Dassler. Adi Dassler was the visionary shoemaker, tinkering in his workshop as he churned out soccer and running shoes that were both lighter and sturdier than anything that had come before. His older brother Rudolf was the company's chief salesman. 
 The brothers Dassler were aided immensely by Hitler's emphasis on sports; by the time of the Berlin Olympics in 1936, German athletes of all ages and skills were wearing the Dasslers' ''boots,'' as Smit calls them. But Adi especially also had an understanding of the importance of getting top athletes, the ones who generated the most excitement and publicity, to wear his sneakers. He didn't pay any money for endorsements back then -- nobody did -- but he did work to get his shoes to the athletes who mattered. Early on, he befriended the German track-and-field coach -- and wound up outfitting many notable German athletes. And during the Olympics, he even managed to get a pair of his sneakers to Hitler's nemesis, Jesse Owens, who won three gold medals wearing shoes made by Adi Dassler.
 After the war, however, the Dasslers, who lived under the same roof but hadn't gotten along in years, split up. The parting was acrimonious in the extreme -- among many other things, Rudolf felt that his brother's family had betrayed him to the Allies. So he moved across town and started a competing shoe company named Puma. Adi's company became Adidas.
 Smit's essential point is that the feud between the Puma and Adidas branches of the family, which lasted for several generations, gave rise to payoffs and endorsements and the fact that modern sports, both professional and amateur, are now drenched in money. Without question, both Rudolf's and Adi's executives worked hard to get their shoes worn by prominent athletes, especially at the Olympics. And they were paying to do so, handing envelopes of cash to athletes at a time when the Olympic movement was still trying to resist commercialization. Smit, who has written for The Financial Times and The Economist, quotes an American sprinter who participated in the Tokyo Olympics of 1964: ''I remember -- like in the James Bond or mystery movies. In Tokyo, a shoe agent goes into the bathroom and leaves an envelope under the stall, and I go into the stall after him.'' 
 But you can take a thesis like this only so far; the truth is almost always more complex than a book jacket suggests. It is plain that in many cases, the athletes themselves, bitter that they were not being paid for their Olympic toils, were playing Puma against Adidas, demanding cash from reluctant shoe marketers. What's more, after 100 pages of ''Sneaker Wars,'' the Puma cousins have become bit players, overshadowed by Adidas, which had both better products and a stronger business. Indeed, what really drove the corruption of the Olympic movement was a very different Dassler family feud, the one between Adi and his son, Horst. 
 This, in fact, is the crucial subplot of Smit's book: Horst Dassler was sent to Alsace to set up a division of Adidas that was not supposed to sell beyond France. But he was a supremely ambitious man, not content to wait quietly for his turn, so he turned his corner of the company into a kind of secret empire that acted against the express wishes of his parents. He started shadow companies to hide certain product lines from them. He befriended all the top officials in sports, including those in charge of the Olympics. He knew how to wine and dine them -- and how to bribe them. He understood, early on, that owning the rights to sports events could be a multimillion-dollar business. When he died in 1987, at the age of 51, the unraveling of his secrets almost brought Adidas down.
 There is also a second, and much larger, problem with Smit's thesis. Hovering like a dark cloud over her narrative is a little running shoe company in Oregon started by Phil Knight, a man every bit as ambitious as Horst Dassler. That company, originally named Blue Ribbon Sports, is now known as Nike. Far more than Adidas or Puma, Nike helped transform sneakers into shoes that everybody, not just athletes, wore -- and wore all the time. It understood marketing far better than its European rivals did, and eventually it overtook them. Even when Adidas bought Reebok a few years ago, the combined company was still smaller than Nike.
 As for the transformation of sports, few moments are more important, for better or worse, than Nike's decision to sign up Michael Jordan as an endorser right out of college, pay him millions to wear its shoes -- and put out a brand with his name on it that would one day cost kids more than $100 a pair. The line from that moment to the era of stars like LeBron James getting giant endorsement deals right out of high school is a straight one, and it seems hard to make the case that anything the Dasslers did changed the business of sports more profoundly.
 The last part of ''Sneaker Wars'' is a recounting of the financial troubles suffered by both Adidas and Puma -- troubles due in part to their own insularity but also due to Nike, which took over markets almost at will. Both companies have since righted themselves, but Puma is unlikely to be a major force ever again, while Adidas is still playing catch-up against its American rival.
 Nike, meanwhile, remains a juggernaut, still changing the business of sports. Forever.

HEADLINE: For Risk-Takers and Tightwads, a Quiz

BYLINE: By JENNIFER V. HUGHES

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 SHARKIRAH FOOTE, a management major at Rutgers Business School here, thought she was a cautious investor. 
 But when she took an investment risk-tolerance quiz as part of a new course at the university, she realized she was much bolder, scoring above average. 
 ''Hopefully that will mean more returns in the future,'' Ms. Foote said, laughing. 
 The course, titled ''Love and Money: Valuable Lessons for Life,'' covers personal finance topics ranging from budgeting and credit cards to loans and insurance. But other subjects include ''maintaining self-esteem'' and ''lifelong mental health.''
 While it seems unlikely that finance majors would not know how to plan a personal budget, Dr. Susan Feinberg said it happens. Students may learn about capital budgets but not household spending; they can help employees map out careers but not chart their own. 
 ''No one takes the business course work and relates that to the gestalt of 'I'm going to get out of college and I need to figure out my own financial plan,' '' said Dr. Feinberg, who helped create the course along with Ivan E. Brick, chairman of the school's finance and economics department. The idea for the course, she said, originated with Boardroom, a consumer finance newsletter company that financed it with a three-year $75,000 endowment. About 230 students are taking the course, which runs until May 5. 
 Students need to understand not only their own financial styles, Dr. Feinberg said, but also those of their potential spouses. 
 ''You might be a saver who gets together with a spender -- how do you deal with that?'' she asked. 
 During a class in March, Dr. Feinberg covered investments, starting with 401ks. 
 ''What's so awesome about this is that you are investing this money pretax,'' she told the students. ''This is a really good chance for you to save on your tax bill and start investing.''
 One student asked whether 401ks ever lose money. Dr. Feinberg answered yes, in the short run, noting that her own fund had declined in recent weeks. 
 ''But see, that's something you need to understand about yourself -- that you don't like risk,'' she said. ''You are all young enough to have a long-term view in investing.''
 Students took the risk-tolerance quiz in class by using clickers that wirelessly fed their answers back to a computer, tallied the results instantly and projected them on a screen. Most students said friends would describe them as ''willing to take risks after completing adequate research.'' But when a fair number of students indicated they would invest a windfall in commodities like gold, Dr. Feinberg said, ''I hope I can talk you out of that -- it's really risky.'' 
 Another of the guest speakers in the course was Dr. Judy Kuriansky, a clinical psychologist and probably the first person to lecture at the business school who has also written a book called ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Tantric Sex.'' 
 There are no two topics more intertwined than sex and money, said Dr. Kuriansky, an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Teachers College. ''Even though people have a very taboo sense in talking about sex they are even more inhibited in talking about their money.'' 
 A person's attitude toward money -- say, as a risk-taker or a tightwad -- may also be reflected in how they dole out emotion in relationships, said Dr. Kuriansky. 
 And Dr. Feinberg said the relationship aspects of the course were as important as the financial ones.
 ''Developing healthy relationships is like developing healthy money habits,'' she said. ''People tend to get into trouble because they put it off.''
 One of the students in the course, Shaniqua Harrell, a junior majoring in finance, said that before taking the class, she hadn't thought about how couples had to merge their financial styles. 
 ''You have to know these things about your spouse,'' she said. ''Money is one of the most important parts of family life and success.'' 
 Travia Smith, a sophomore majoring in marketing, was stunned after the lesson on budgeting to realize how much money she spent on eating out. 
 ''I never kept track of it before,'' she said. ''It will really help me better manage my money.'' 
 She said she also loved learning more about stocks. 
 ''I've always asked my dad how stocks work and he said he didn't know,'' Ms. Smith said. ''Now I get to tell him.''

KLUGE 
 The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind. 
 By Gary Marcus. 
 211 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $24. 
 In April 1970, the astronauts on the Apollo 13 space mission faced a life-threatening crisis. Levels of carbon dioxide inside their craft were climbing dangerously, and there were no filters to replace the ones that were failing. Working quickly, the crew members assembled a makeshift filter out of materials on board -- including a sock, a plastic bag and some duct tape -- allowing them to return safely to Earth. 
 The cobbled-together filter was a kluge, Gary Marcus writes, and whatever we think of the rest of his book, we owe him thanks for introducing this instantly indispensable word into general circulation. As defined by the author, a kluge (rhymes with huge) is ''a clumsy or inelegant -- yet surprisingly effective -- solution to a problem.'' Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University and director of the N.Y.U. Infant Language Learning Center, borrowed the word from the field of engineering, where it has long been the term of art for a useful but ungainly improvisation. Speculations on its origin abound: perhaps it descends from the German word klug, meaning clever, or from the 1930s-era Kluge brand paper feeder, which, according to The Hacker's Dictionary of Computer Jargon, employed ''a fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts and linkages.'' Around midcentury, the word was adopted by the pioneers of early computing; a 1962 article defined a kluge (or kludge) as ''an ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.''
 And that, Marcus writes, is a fair description of a fleshier contraption: the human body. Take the spine. It would make more sense, and spare us much Advil, if we had four cross-braced columns of vertebrae instead of a single vulnerable one. Or the retina: it faces the back of the head rather than the front, burdening us with a blind spot where a clump of wiring gets in the way. We're a collection of patches and fixes, held together with the biological equivalent of duct tape -- the handiwork not of an intelligent designer but of the rough-and-ready processes of evolution. Engineers and computer programmers resort to kluges when pinched for time or money. Evolution ''kluges'' its solutions because it has only the crudest tools at its disposal: genetic mutations and millions of years. Natural selection can select only from what genetic accidents have made available, and the features it chooses may remain in place not because they are optimal, Marcus writes, but ''because evolution just didn't find a better way.'' 
 What's true of our aching backs and blinkered vision also applies to our brains. The human mind, Marcus writes, is ''the most fantastic kluge of them all,'' an organ whose ''haphazard construction'' is apparent in our memory slips, credulous beliefs and self-defeating choices. 
 The early pages of ''Kluge'' are invigorating fun, as Marcus introduces the concept and explores its application to the evolution of the brain. The notion of nature as an ingenious but often careless technician, content to make do with what's available, at first seems inspired, one of those unexpected analogies that help us look at everything afresh. Indeed, if we are to think of the mind as a kluge, Marcus asserts, ''our very understanding of ourselves -- of human nature -- must be reconsidered.'' He then proceeds to attempt such a reconsideration, in chapters on the ''kluginess'' of memory, belief, choice, language and pleasure. 
 But almost immediately the promise begins leaking out of the metaphor like air from a punctured tire. Thinking of the brain as a kluge, it turns out, doesn't change much at all; the points Marcus makes about how our minds trip us up are familiar from years of bulletins from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics. The excitement of the concept has dissipated by the final chapter, in which Marcus offers a list of tips to help us ''outwit our inner kluge.'' No elaborate analogy is necessary to produce recommendations like this one: ''Whenever possible, don't make important decisions when you are tired or have other things on your mind.'' Marcus himself appears to realize that his advice is rather rusty. When he writes that his suggestion to weigh benefits against costs ''sounds obvious,'' and that his counsel to try to be rational ''may sound unbelievably trivial,'' the reader can only agree. 
 Marcus, it seems, has a problem: an appealing and intriguing idea that isn't quite as big as he claims. To solve it, he reaches for that rhetorical kluge, the straw man, setting up and then sweeping aside the notion that the human mind is infallible. ''Are human beings 'noble in reason' and 'infinite in faculty' as William Shakespeare famously wrote?'' Marcus asks ingenuously. ''Perfect, 'in God's image,' as some biblical scholars have asserted?'' Hamlet might well complain that his remarks are being quoted out of context -- after all, he goes on in the same soliloquy to call man the ''quintessence of dust.'' And biblical scholars have devoted at least equal time to the flaws and sins of humanity (serpent, apple, etc.). Even Marcus's own readers' imputed beliefs become so many flimsy figures for him to knock down. He writes of ''our everyday acceptance of the idiosyncrasies of the human mind,'' suggesting later on that ''many of us just don't want human cognition to turn out to be less than perfect.'' 
 Actually, most of us are only too aware of our mental malfunctions, greeting them with consternation (and maybe a profanity or two). But in skewering these supposedly universal assumptions, Marcus has taken a slight premise and leveraged it into a book. It's not the most elegant solution to his problem, but hey, it works.

HEADLINE: When the Share Price Is a Factor in Pay

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND. 
E-mail: newmanage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HAVING trouble feeling sorry for people with stock options, deferred stock and other kinds of stock-based pay as the market bobs and weaves? 
 Maybe you assume that most of the people in this category are well-heeled Wall Street deal makers or executives with eye-popping bonuses. But, in fact, 47 percent of private sector employees in the United States have had at least part of their compensation tied to their company's profitability or stock price. 
 That's right. If you include stock options, deferred stock, profit sharing or cash bonuses pegged to a company's performance, nearly half of the 114 million employees of private-sector companies had some stock or profit-related pay at the end of 2006. 
 That is according to an analysis by Douglas Kruse and Joseph R. Blasi, management professors at Rutgers University, and Richard Freeman, an economics professor at Harvard. Roughly six million workers received stock options in 2006, and of those who held company stock that year, the median value of their portfolio was roughly 25 percent of their annual pay. 
 Most of these people were happy to receive stock-based pay while the market was rising. Their managers were happy, too, because the employees were motivated to help the company do well, and were reluctant to leave their jobs for fear of losing out on some of that benefit. 
 But this year, stock-based pay -- and the piles of company shares that many employees have accumulated as a result -- are looking a lot less appealing. Through Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.8 percent for the year. 
 Employees ''value these awards a whole lot less than they did,'' said Steven Gross, head of compensation consulting at Mercer, the human resources firm. He said he knew of one employee who had told his boss that he no longer put any value in stock options, because with prices bouncing up and down, there was no way to know whether the options would be worth anything at any given time. 
 But making changes to stock-based compensation is not simple. If a company sticks to an existing formula and lets employee pay fluctuate with the stock price, there is a risk that people will leave for jobs with more stable compensation. If employers adjust their system, though, they may damage -- or even sever -- the link between employee pay and performance. 
 ''There's always this tension if companies aren't doing well and bonuses are going down. If managers are afraid you're going to leave, do they have to give you something?'' Mr. Gross said. ''But the plans are designed to go down when the company stock goes down. If you change it, you're not really paying for performance. 
 ''Boards are struggling with this issue,'' he added. 
 The fact remains that stock-based compensation is a highly efficient way to motivate and retain employees. If employees feel that they can do well by working hard -- and not just earn a pat on the back -- they are more likely to do their best. 
 Moreover, for many rank-and-file employees, stock-based compensation represents their biggest chance at a real increase in wealth, even after inflation. Real, or inflation-adjusted, wages actually fell slightly from 2000 to 2007, according to Census Bureau data. But over the long term, if employees also receive some pay tied to their company's stock, combined with their low single-digit raises, they may well fare better. 
 ''If you didn't give stock-based compensation to a broad group of the population, you'd be cutting off their opportunity to increase their compensation,'' Professor Blasi said. ''The alternative to stock-based compensation is 1 to 2 percent pay increases and 1 to 3 percent inflation.''
 It is crucial, however, for employers to provide education along with stock-based pay -- and, luckily, many have been doing just that, said Patrick Goepel, president of human resources services at Fidelity Investments. Employers are ''providing a lot more information to employees to help them make informed choices,'' he said.
 Managers also need to make sure that employees understand they are better off diversifying rather than holding a stockpile of the employer's stock. (See Bear Stearns.) And they need to make clear that employees should work for the company's long-term success so that they do not take undue risks for short-term gains. 
 At many companies, employees now have more choices about how they are paid. At Netflix, for example, employees decide at the beginning of each year how much of their pay they want in cash, in 10-year stock options or in the employee stock purchase plan.
 Patty McCord, the company's chief talent officer, said employees' choices closely reflect their lifestyles and risk tolerance. Employees with young families and new houses tend to take more cash, while single 20-somethings are generally more likely to allocate more to stock options. Employees generally opted for more cash at the beginning of this year, she said, but the shift was not significant. 
 As a result, Netflix has some employees who watch the share price closely, but others who do not. 
 ''If prices go down, there's not this huge morale hit across the company,'' Ms. McCord said.

HEADLINE: Odd Couple Of The Jungle

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
IN THE AMAZON JUNGLE, Ecuador
 Douglas McMeekin was a failed businessman in Kentucky, and Juan Kunchikuy was a hunter in a remote nook of the Amazon rain forest who killed monkeys, deer and wild pigs with a blowgun and poison darts. 
 Now this unlikely pair has joined forces in a remarkable campaign to save the rain forest, ''the lungs of the earth'' that suck up the carbon we spew out. Of all the struggles to fight climate change, this is one of the more quixotic -- and inspiring. 
 The Amazon rain forest that both men treasure is being hacked down, along with other tropical forests around the world. More than half of the world's tropical rain forest is already gone, and every second of every day, another football-field-size chunk is destroyed. 
 Mr. McMeekin, now 65, started out not as an environmentalist but as an entrepreneur running a hodgepodge of small businesses in Lexington, Ky., employing about 50 people. In the 1982 recession, he went bankrupt.
 Pained and disillusioned, he decided to go far away -- to Ecuador, where he eventually found work in the Amazon as a liaison between international oil companies and indigenous tribes. He came to love the people, and his heart went out to them.
 In school, Mr. McMeekin had suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia. ''I was just a 'dumb kid,' and carrying that burden is difficult,'' he recalled. The stigma left him empathizing with the Amazon natives, who were often scorned by outsiders as slow and backward because they were unschooled.
 Mr. McMeekin began the Yachana Foundation in 1991 to promote education among natives of the Amazon, and in the course of his travels by canoe (there are few roads in the region), he met Mr. Kunchikuy, then a boy living in a cluster of huts a five-hour walk from any other village. Mr. Kunchikuy and his family were semi-nomadic, speaking an obscure tribal language (his real name is Tzerem, but an Ecuadorian official filling out his birth certificate turned that into ''Juan''). They survived largely by hunting with darts tipped with home-made curare poison.
 Mr. Kunchikuy was one of 12 siblings, of whom five died in childhood. One of his grandfathers was speared to death in a war with a rival tribe; another grandfather adorned his house with the shrunken heads of enemies he had killed.
 At the time, in 1995, Mr. McMeekin was building an eco-lodge in the jungle for American tourists, to finance his dreams of promoting education for local people. So he invited the boy to move to the lodge and work and study. At the age of 17, Mr. Kunchikuy left his pocket of the rain forest for the first time -- and encountered such wonders as shoes, electricity, running water, telephones and cars. 
 It was soon obvious that Mr. Kunchikuy had a first-rate mind, so Mr. McMeekin sponsored his education and a home-stay visit to Boston, where in the winter he encountered a puzzling white substance that was very cold. His tribal language, Shiwiar, has no word for snow, ice, freezing or even anything very cold. So after his return, it was tough to describe to his friends how his host family had taken him ice skating and snow-boarding.
 Mr. Kunchikuy now speaks fluent English, on top of his other languages -- Shiwiar, Spanish, Quichua, Achuar and Shuar, not to mention his mastery at calling monkeys and birds in the jungle. He became a naturalist and guide at the Yachana Foundation's 18-room eco-lodge, which tourists reach by riding in a canoe for nearly three hours.
 Now 30, Mr. Kunchikuy points wildlife out to American tourists and demonstrates that grubs can be tasty. He also displays his impressive collection of scars, from vampire bats, a piranha, a caiman, a stingray, and a shaman who operated on his chest to block another shaman's black magic. In his spare time, he demonstrates how to shoot a blowgun.
 ''It has a range of up to 150 feet,'' he explained. ''It's better than a shotgun, because it's silent. You can shoot repeatedly if you miss the first time.'' (Keep an eye on nytimes.com in the coming days for a video of Mr. Kunchikuy using his blowgun to spear a papaya balanced on my head -- but don't tell my wife.)
 Yet the traditions he grew up with are eroding, much like the rain forest. Loggers are chipping inexorably away at the Amazon, robbing the planet of biodiversity and of a great carbon sink that absorbs our greenhouse gas emissions. On top of that, the deforestation itself, including slash-and-burn clearing, accounts for 20 percent of global carbon emissions, the same amount as that produced by the United States or China. Several studies declare that the low-hanging fruit in the war against climate change is keeping these forests alive. 
 In my next column, on Thursday, I'll tell you how Mr. McMeekin and Mr. Kunchikuy are doing just that.

HEADLINE: Other Voices: Adjusting to Those New Indexes

 BODY:
Re ''Change Can Be Painful, but This One Shouldn't Hurt'' (April 6):
 I am one who spends an hour or more Monday through Friday on The New York Times, no time on Saturday and only a little on Sunday because I do have a wife who expects to have a sensate husband at least part time.
 I did not object to the reduction in page size because it made good sense in an economic squeeze. I cherish the printed paper and my ink-stained hands and know that that sort of change will continue to be necessary as the world becomes more and more electronic. (I won't.) 
 But I reacted negatively to the index change, which struck me -- and still strikes me -- as change for the sake of change, because somebody got bored and named a committee, which then felt compelled to do something, anything. 
 The new index should not be fixed as promised; it should be dumped. 
 JOSEPH BENNETT Dearborn, Mich., April 6, 2008
 I like the new index's openness. I feel I can read it and get news, and then go to the dense articles that interest me within the paper. Those articles are often intimidating, and therefore I only glance at them because there isn't time each day to read all of The Times (including Sunday's). It's a struggle, as it is such a treasure. 
 MARYEL LOCKE Boston, April 6, 2008
 I meant to write about the alarm I felt every day I picked up my beloved Times and saw that news articles had been pushed back two, three, four pages. 
 By printing pages of indexes (''here's what you could actually read about if you could just push yourself a little bit, and get past all these indexes''), The Times seems to be going over to the dark side, trivializing the news, attempting to reduce it into easily digestible bites. 
 It's as if The Times is saying, ''We know you're terribly busy multitasking away, so we're going to save you the trouble of actually reading a full account of important events and trends.''
 The problem with that approach is that Times readers do not want bite-sized chunks of news. We expect the real deal. The folks who want a quick snack can go onto their sacred BlackBerries or go blugging (thank you, Doris Lessing, for that brilliant knock on blogging).
 Please replace the snacks with full-course meals. 
 RUSS PATRICK Beverly Hills, Calif., April 7, 2008
 I was amazed to read that people were unhappy with the new index. I think it is wonderful, helpful and very informative. 
 I have been a reader for more than 60 years, and I go cover to cover every day. I believe that I've probably lived through more changes to The Times than any current employee, editor, etc., and I've managed to absorb them all without complaint.
 To me, The Times is an essential ingredient to my day, every day. And now, when I'm in other parts of the world where it is not available, I open my trusty laptop and there it is. There's nothing quite like it anywhere. It's The Times. Period. 
 HARVEY GLASSMAN Boynton Beach, Fla., April 8, 2008
 Opinion and News Pages
 Re ''The Analysis/Opinion Blur'' (April 13):
 You write that Michael Cleveland, a weekly newspaper editor from Lyndeborough, N.H., sent a message criticizing you ''for giving voice to someone so obviously uninformed about how a newspaper works.''
 Since I was the one you gave voice to, I have to ask: since when is the reading public supposed to be expert in the inner workings of a newspaper? 
 I never professed to be a journalist. I am one of the thousands of Times subscribers interested in news and opinions. The Times invites readers' comments and opinions as a way to participate in a political debate. Period.
 I understand that there is a difference between opinion and a news story. Frank Rich, Maureen Dowd, Bob Herbert and the other columnists have every right to express their opinions. But I have always been aware that The Times seemed to maintain a standard of writing, even in the opinion columns, that went beyond pettiness and kept to a broader, more balanced presentation.
 ELLEN SHIRE New York, April 14, 2008
 Thanks for your clarification regarding Op-Ed articles and columnists versus reporting. But I believe that you have missed one ingredient: repetition. 
 When an Op-Ed column continues in the same vein, then it becomes a sound-bite advertisement. It becomes ingrained, and those who do not distinguish between news and opinion begin to blur the two.
 I suggest there be a limit on repetitions of a view -- five sounds like a good number, but not every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
 INGRAM OLKIN Stanford, Calif., April 13, 2008
 While the best of the people in the news business strive to keep their reporting factual and unbiased, I have long believed that actually doing so is impossible. Stories labeled as news may be fact-filled. But which facts are presented, which quotes used, which pictures selected and the relative importance a story is given on the page (or in a news report) are all variables that convey some tone, if not bias, to the reporting. 
 Even if a paper were simply to list the facts -- who, what, when, where, why -- elements like placement would communicate relative importance to readers. 
 Wise readers recognize that they choose a newspaper, Web site, or television or radio station in part because the general direction reflects views that are in some way comfortable or agreeable to them. 
 ANNE-MARIE HISLOP Davenport, Iowa, April 13, 2008
 It is reasonable for The Times to make every effort to distinguish between reporting, analyzing and commenting on issues. The inability of a reader to recognize those distinctions is an acknowledgment of a lack of commitment to rigorous thinking. Unfortunately, all too often when columns that report or analyze issues strive to some false standard of fairness, fatuous assertions by partisans are given equal weight with objective facts. 
 The headline ''Earth Is Round, Others Disagree'' serves no legitimate goal of fairness in reporting or analysis. Calling lies, distortions or partisan positions anything other than what they are is a disservice to the readership, regardless of the nature of the column.
 WILLIAM A. FERRY Lafayette, La., April 13, 2008
 Shielding Journalists
 Re ''Squeezed by the Courts'' (April 20): Your argument for Congressional approval of a journalistic shield law is largely beside the point. Sympathetic a figure as the reporter Toni Locy may be, if justice is not being served in her case, that is a function of a misapplication of current laws by the relevant judge. 
 No change in laws (particularly a bill that would include a ''balancing'' test) can shield against that possibility. Valuable as the free flow of information can be, and instrumental as confidentiality for sources can be to that flow, the public has no right to such information. 
 Whatever the merits of Ms. Locy's case, when the maintenance of confidentiality impedes the government's ability to fulfill its mission of protecting citizens' rights, reporters have no more right to protection than any other citizen. 
 The Bush administration has given a bad name to good-faith judgment about when that ability is jeopardized. That is not reason to alter the law, however.

HEADLINE: Not-So-Personal Finance

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
ARIELLE GREEN, a publicist in Manhattan, knows what most of her friends earn, whether it is $28,000 a year or $100,000. And she does not seem particularly shy about disclosing her income ($30,000 a year, plus overtime). 
 At 22, Ms. Green, like her friends, is less afraid to flirt with what many over 35 consider the last taboo in American life: discussing salary openly with friends and colleagues. ''There's just more of a feeling of openness in discussing what you make,'' Ms. Green said.. 
 Her friends, she said, consider frank talk about income a valuable tool. It helps them strategize -- when to push for a raise, when to start looking around. It even helps them figure out plans for a Friday night, whether the assembled cast is better suited to a brick-oven pizzeria or Buddakan. 
 Yes, elders find it strange. ''My parents wouldn't have this conversation with friends,'' she said. For them, Ms. Green said, ''it's very hush-hush. You don't talk about money, politics, or religion with friends. But in this generation, it's important.'' 
 For people old enough to remember phone booths, a blunt reference to salary in a social setting still represents the height of bad manners. But for many young professionals, the don't-ask-don't-tell etiquette of previous generations seems like a relic. 
 For them, salary information is now fair game, at least among friends. Many consider it crucial to prosper in an increasingly transient, winner-take-all workplace -- regardless of the envy that full disclosure can raise. Besides, when the Internet already offers a cornucopia of personal information, it almost seems coy to keep personal income private. 
 As Ilana Arazie, 32, an online video producer for a media company in Manhattan, said, ''If we can talk about how many orgasms we have with our mate, why can't we discuss how much we make?''
 While salaries may be disclosed casually among friends, that doesn't mean most young professionals brag about their incomes at a cocktail party. There is still an etiquette to sharing the information -- a proper way to divulge. 
 For instance, most young people don't tell their cubicle mates, according to a 2007 study for Money magazine by the sociologist Jeanne Fleming and the writer Leonard Schwarz. 
 Still, young workers seem somewhat less likely to adhere to this convention than older ones. The study found that 90 percent of those over 35 who were surveyed agreed with the statement ''you should never let your co-workers know how much you make,'' while 84 percent of subjects under 35 agreed.
 But between friends almost anything is fair game. Beth Kobliner, the author of the best-selling ''Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties,'' said she had noticed that many young people now ''have no idea what their boomer parents earn, but know every intimate detail about their close friends' salaries, 401(k)s and debt loads.'' 
 She attributes the increase in openness in part to a shared sense of struggle by people in their 20s, who have come of age in a turbulent economic time, gyrating from the dot-com boom to the post-Sept. 11 gloom, to the housing bubble to the credit crunch.
 ''There is a bunker mentality,'' Ms. Kobliner said. ''They've had it rough, jobs are precarious and debts are outrageous.'' Bill Coleman, the chief compensation officer of Salary.com, which tracks income figures for numerous occupations by ZIP code, said that he had noticed more candor about income among those who live by social networking than among those who don't -- what he calls the ''MySpace/Facebook rift.''
 And, he said, the new openness on salaries is reflective of a deeper acceptance of networking, offline as well as online. 
 ''This is a generation that is much more attuned to teamwork, collaboration and sharing information,'' he said. ''Everything they do is a kind of group event. How do you know, when you get your first job offer, if $45,000 is a good offer, a bad offer or an O.K. offer? You go to your friends.'' 
 Such was the case with Jim Wang, 27, until recently a software developer living in Columbia, Md., who blogs about his personal finances. Two years ago, he said, several of his friends who worked in the same industry started to get restless. As they started to scout around, they also started to dish. 
 ''People started leaving firms to go to other companies, and they were getting 15, 20, 25 percent raises,'' recalled Mr. Wang, who can name what his 30 or so closest friends earn ''within a bandwidth of $5,000.'' 
 ''I thought, why not go out and see what my true market rate is? I found out that there were two companies both willing to pay 18 percent more, so I left.''
 Several workers under 35 said that greater salary transparency among friends only makes sense in an age when there is so much information freely available online. Young professionals, in fact, have all sorts of ways to find out how much their friends make, even without asking. Associates at law firms anonymously report their own salaries to Web sites like www.greedyassociates.com. Every bonus season, Wall Street analysts send one another Excel spreadsheets, based on published reports and word-of-mouth, that detail which banks are paying what. 
 Related taboos already started to crumble over the last decade, as housing prices exploded, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco, and people suddenly started to consider it innocent dinner-party banter to ask someone, to the dollar, what they paid for their two-bedroom condo. 
 Rebecca Geller, who works in media relations for green technology companies in San Francisco, recalled a recent brunch with two friends. One, a school administrator, was hoping to find a new job that paid at least $40,000 a year. He wanted to know if the other two people at the table -- Ms. Geller, 29, and a first-year lawyer -- thought he was lowballing himself, asking, ''Why, what do you guys make?'' 
 The truth hurt. The lawyer, a bit sheepishly, admitted that he made $130,000. 
 ''There was definitely an awkward silence,'' Ms. Geller said. Many professionals interviewed said that they believe salary talk is best confined to friends within the same tax bracket, to spare feelings. Others, however, insisted that a little generosity by the haves could help stave off jealousy by their have-not friends. 
 Some young Wall Street professionals said that since everyone knows everyone else's bonus, it is common for friends with the biggest paydays to celebrate by picking up the check at a restaurant or nightclub.
 Still, there are good reasons that generations of parents have instructed their children to keep quiet about money, social scientists say. In a meritocratic country, money has always been the great divider, the primary way Americans connote status. 
 Thus it is impossible to engage in a conversation about income that is entirely innocent, said Herb Goldberg, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who has written about financial issues. 
 ''When people talk about money,'' he said, most people traditionally have presumed that there is ''a motive behind it, and the motive is what makes it seem impolite.'' People bombarded with unwelcome salary information, or pressed to disclose it, assume someone is raising the topic to subtly brag, or put someone else down, he said.
 But social scientists say that some young people have generation-specific motives for broaching this touchy subject. 
 Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, said that an open flow of information is deemed crucial by young professionals who think of themselves as free agents, not company men.
 ''People move between jobs a lot more now than they used to,'' Dr. Frank said. This mobility alone increases the instances that salary might come up among friends. 
 ''If you change jobs, that's news,'' he said. ''If you get a better salary, that's the explanation of the news: 'They're paying me 80 grand, the last place only paying me 65.' '' 
 Barbara W. Keats, an associate professor of management at Arizona State University who studies money attitudes among the young, said that their relative lack of manners regarding salary can be traced to the self-esteem movement embraced by baby boomer parents. 
 ''As they moved through primary and secondary school, the focus was always to avoid anything that might stifle their creativity or hem them in,'' she said, which has bled into their sense of etiquette. ''They're special, and however they say things is very cute.''
 Elders who equate openness with rudeness are missing the point, said Kate Hubin, a 28-year-old publicity director for a film studio in Los Angeles.
 ''For my generation, salary is one piece of the job satisfaction and self-worth puzzle, but not the only metric we use,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''Status is not just about money any more. Everyone knows you generally have to suffer to make a big income, so high-earners talk about their salary in the course of complaining -- is all this worth $180,000? -- while low-earners see their paltry salaries as a token of lifestyle freedom.'' 
 In recent years, even some people over 35 have started to call for more candor on the topic. In a much-discussed appearance on ''The View'' last year, the personal-finance author Suze Orman, a proponent of people sharing salary figures as a means of fighting income disparity, challenged her fellow hosts and other guests to disclose their salary on the show (none did). 
 Some young professionals seem more receptive to Ms. Orman's logic. Janet Polli, 32, who lives in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, works in sales and marketing for a nonprofit organization. A few years ago, she and a colleague were both selected for a promotion at a nonprofit, and Ms. Polli suggested they share salary information as a negotiating tool.
 ''I wanted to be open, like a union,'' she recalled. ''We would get more if we were together.'' 
 But the other woman ''was very secretive in her negotiations,'' she said. ''In the end, neither of us did very well.''

HEADLINE: A Stalwart of Retirement Planning: the I.R.A.

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
WITH so much contradictory advice floating around, it is sometimes hard to figure out the best way to save for retirement.
 Financial experts say that one often-overlooked resource is the humble Individual Retirement Account, or I.R.A., which has been a part of the personal finance landscape for so long that many of us take it for granted.
 More than 90 percent of the money that flows into traditional I.R.A.'s is being rolled over from retirement plans at work, like 401(k)'s. On the other hand, only 14 percent of American households that were eligible to make direct I.R.A. contributions did so in 2006, according to the most recent data from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry trade group. 
 The rules for some I.R.A. contributions are so complex that many Americans may not realize they are eligible to make them, said Brian Reid, the chief economist at the Investment Company Institute. Indeed, the I.R.A. rules fill a 108-page brochure on the Internal Revenue Service Web site. 
 And while investors often fund a 401(k) at work before contributing to an I.R.A., particularly if employers offer matching contributions, many people don't have a 401(k) or other workplace option. Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said that 57 percent of ''prime working-age Americans,'' defined as 25 to 64 years old, had no retirement plan at work. Contributing to an I.R.A. makes sense for such people, she said.
 In a nutshell, the main flavors of I.R.A. -- traditional and Roth -- have one big difference. You may be able to deduct the money you put into a traditional I.R.A. on your taxes, but you will pay income taxes on all withdrawals in retirement. Contributions to Roth I.R.A.'s are not deductible up front, but there are no taxes on money withdrawn in retirement. 
 Some I.R.A. rules are simple. Say you are single, do not have a retirement plan at work -- like a 401(k) or a traditional pension -- and want to contribute to a traditional I.R.A. Whatever your income, you can make the maximum contribution, all of it deductible. (The maximum total contribution for all I.R.A.'s is $5,000 this year, or $6,000 if you are 50 and above.) 
 But the rules can quickly become more convoluted. If you are single but eligible for a retirement plan at work, you may make the maximum tax-deductible contribution so long as your adjusted gross income is $53,000 or less. The deductible amount whittles away to zero as your income climbs from $53,000 to $63,000.
 If you are married and filing taxes jointly, and both of your employers offer retirement plans, both of you can make the maximum deductible contribution so long as adjusted gross household income doesn't exceed $85,000. The deductible amount phases out at higher incomes, falling to zero at $105,000. And the list goes on.
 If you're considering a Roth I.R.A., it doesn't matter if you have an employer plan at work. But a single person, for example, can make the full contribution only if income is less than $101,000. The eligible contribution phases out as income climbs to $116,000.
 The government slapped income limits on I.R.A.'s in the 1980s to prevent high-income taxpayers from redirecting savings to tax-deferred accounts, said Ms. Munnell at the Center for Retirement Research. ''A lot of evidence suggested that higher-income people were simply rearranging their finances,'' she said.
 A third form of I.R.A., the traditional nondeductible version, is less popular. There are no income limits, and it does not matter whether you have a retirement plan at work. Contributions are not deductible, and you will pay income taxes on investment profits withdrawn in retirement.
 Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York, said the nondeductible I.R.A. was not compelling for most investors. As is the case with all I.R.A.'s, you cannot write off investment losses on your taxes, and you lose the benefit of capital gains tax rates, which are generally lower than income tax rates. If you are eligible to contribute to either a 401(k) or an I.R.A., Mr. Schatsky said, in most cases you are better off choosing the 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. 
 Statistically, few people take full advantage of 401(k)'s. Roughly three of four qualified workers participate, but among those who do, only 10 percent contribute the maximum, according to the Center for Retirement Research.
 Labor Department rules issued last fall make it easier for companies to automatically enroll workers in 401(k) plans. Now there is talk in Washington about making enrollment in I.R.A.'s automatic for workers who don't have 401(k)'s, said James Poterba, the head of the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Mr. Poterba, who is to become president of the National Bureau of Economic Research this summer, said the issues were more complex for automatic I.R.A. enrollment. For instance, he said, employers choose default investments for the 401(k), but he asked, ''Who picks the default investment for an I.R.A.?''
 While these issues are being worked out, people without employer plans would benefit by opening I.R.A.'s on their own, Ms. Munnell said, adding that they should find motivation in projected shortfalls for the Social Security trust fund. 
 The government has already been raising the age when most Social Security applicants can retire at full benefits. For those born from 1938 to 1943, full retirement age rose gradually from 65 to 66. It stays at 66 for those born through 1954, and gradually climbs again, to 67, for those born in 1960 or later.
 ''Those are the changes that are already baked into the cake,'' Ms. Munnell said. If the Social Security projections worsen, she said, future retirees may regret not having saved more.

HEADLINE: Home Brew for the Car, Not the Beer Cup

BYLINE: By MICHAEL FITZGERALD. 
Michael Fitzgerald writes about business, technology and culture. E-mail: mfitz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHAT if you could make fuel for your car in your backyard for less than you pay at the pump? Would you?
 The first question has driven Floyd S. Butterfield for more than two decades. Mr. Butterfield, 52, is something of a legend for people who make their own ethanol. In 1982, he won a California Department of Food and Agriculture contest for best design of an ethanol still, albeit one that he could not market profitably at the time.
 Now he thinks that he can, thanks to his partnership with the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Thomas J. Quinn. The two have started the E-Fuel Corporation, which soon will announce its home ethanol system, the E-Fuel 100 MicroFueler. It will be about as large as a stackable washer-dryer, sell for $9,995 and ship before year-end. 
 The net cost to consumers could drop by half after government incentives for alternate fuels, like tax credits, are applied.
 The MicroFueler will use sugar as its main fuel source, or feedstock, along with a specially packaged time-release yeast the company has developed. Depending on the cost of sugar, plus water and electricity, the company says it could cost as little as a dollar a gallon to make ethanol. In fact, Mr. Quinn sometimes collects left-over alcohol from bars and restaurants in Los Gatos, Calif., where he lives, and turns it into ethanol; the only cost is for the electricity used in processing. 
 In general, he says, burning a gallon of ethanol made by his system will produce one-eighth the carbon of the same amount of gasoline.
 ''It's going to cause havoc in the market and cause great financial stress in the oil industry,'' Mr. Quinn boasts. 
 He may well turn out to be right. But brewing ethanol in the backyard isn't as easy as barbecuing hamburgers. Distilling large quantities of ethanol typically has required a lot of equipment, says Daniel M. Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, he says that quality control and efficiency of home brew usually pale compared with those of commercial refineries. ''There's a lot of hurdles you have to overcome. It's entirely possible that they've done it, but skepticism is a virtue,'' Mr. Kammen says.
 To be sure, Mr. Quinn, 53, has been involved with successful innovations before. For instance, he patented the motion sensor technology used in Nintendo's wildly popular Wii gaming system.
 More to the point, he was the product marketing manager for Alan F. Shugart's pioneering hard disk drive when the personal computer was shifting from a hobbyists' niche to a major industry. ''I remember people laughing at us and saying what a stupid idea it was to do that disk drive,'' Mr. Quinn says.
 Mr. Butterfield thinks that the MicroFueler is as much a game changer as the personal computer. He says that working with Mr. Quinn's microelectronics experts -- E-Fuel now employs 15 people -- has led to breakthroughs that have cut the energy requirements of making ethanol in half. One such advance is a membrane distiller, which, Mr. Quinn says, uses extremely fine filters to separate water from alcohol at lower heat and in fewer steps than in conventional ethanol refining. Using sugar as a feedstock means that there is virtually no smell, and its water byproduct will be drinkable. 
 E-Fuel has bold plans: It intends to operate internationally from the start, with production of the MicroFueler in China and Britain as well as the United States. And Mr. Butterfield is already at work on a version for commercial use, as well as systems that will use feedstocks other than sugar. 
 Ethanol has long had home brewers, and permits are available through the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. (You must be a property owner and agree to make your ethanol outdoors.) But there are plenty of reasons to question whether personal fueling systems will become the fuel industry's version of the personal computer. 
 For starters, sugar-based ethanol doesn't look much cheaper than gas. It takes 10 to 14 pounds of sugar to make a gallon of ethanol, and raw sugar sells in the United States for about 20 cents a pound, says Michael E. Salassi, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Louisiana State University. But Mr. Quinn says that as of January this year, under the North American Free Trade Agreement, he can buy inedible sugar from Mexico for as little as 2.5 cents a pound, which puts the math in his favor. While this type of sugar has not been sold to consumers, E-Fuel says it is developing a distribution network for it.
 In addition, it's illegal in the United States to operate a car on 100 percent ethanol, with exceptions for off-road vehicles like Indy cars and farm equipment. Mr. Quinn has a federal permit to make his own fuel, and believes that if MicroFuelers start popping up like swimming pools, regulators will adapt by certifying pure ethanol for cars.
 Despite all the hurdles, Mr. Quinn and Mr. Butterfield may be on to something. There are plenty of consumers who want to reduce their carbon footprint and are willing to make an upfront investment to do it -- consider the success of the Prius. 
 And if oil prices continue to rise, the economics of buying a MicroFueler will become only better and better.

HEADLINE: Seeking the Key to Employment for Ex-Cons

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
Over the past two years, Peter Santos has hired 40 ex-convicts to help him build and renovate apartments here; 36 did not last, many of them doing unacceptably sloppy work or simply disappearing after a few weeks -- or a few days -- on the job. 
 One worker, Ronald O'Reilly, 41, had spent more than half his life in prison, for burglary, drug sales and weapons possession, when Mr. Santos last summer gave him not just a job but a cheap apartment and the furnishings to make the place feel like home. He even paid to repair Mr. O'Reilly's neglected teeth. ''I gave him my all,'' Mr. Santos said. ''I really thought Ron would be different.''
 But within five months, Mr. O'Reilly had rekindled his love affair with crack cocaine, said Mr. Santos and others who knew him. He stopped coming to work, ceased paying his $500 monthly rent, and by the time he was evicted, had not only sold off the contents of the apartment, but also the items in an adjacent storage space that belonged to his erstwhile patron, they said. He was arrested soon after and charged with sexual assault. 
 The situation epitomizes the way Newark's two leading problems, crime and unemployment, are intertwined with the huge number of ex-convicts in the city. Some 2,300 men and women pour into the city from prison each year, and 65 percent are rearrested within five years. One in six adult residents of the city has a criminal record.
 With Newark's unemployment rate stubbornly stuck at twice the state average of 4.9 percent -- and criminal history and lack of education leaving many chronically unemployable -- Mayor Cory A. Booker has tried to make prisoner re-entry a signature issue, aware that his twin promises of safety and economic vitality depend on it. He is part of a growing national movement of local and state politicians trying to tackle the problem; earlier this month, President Bush signed the Second Chance Act, allocating $165 million annually to their efforts. ''Up until now, the focus has been putting ex-offenders back in jail,'' complained Fred Davie, president of Public/Private Ventures, a nonprofit group based in Philadelphia that has created prisoner rehabilitation programs in 15 cities and advised the Booker administration. ''We need a national approach to what has become a national crisis.''
 Even with crime at historic lows, the number of people behind bars in the country is 2.3 million, its highest level ever, according to the Pew Center on the States; last year, there were 7 million people in jail or prison, on probation or on parole. 
 Most of the prisoner re-entry programs around the country are too new to have been evaluated independently, though the Manpower Development Research Corporation in New York is midway through a three-year study of employment and recidivism among 2,000 male ex-convicts in Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Chicago.
 Here in Newark, Mayor Booker has recruited 50 local companies to hire ex-convicts screened by the city's workforce-development agency, rewarding them with tax breaks, and persuaded 300 lawyers who had volunteered on his campaign to donate their services to felons facing legal obstacles to employment. He is selling city land at a discount to developers willing to employ former prisoners on their construction sites.
 But many of Mr. Booker's initiatives have been stymied. He created a new post at City Hall dedicated to re-entry, but its first two occupants did not work out. He has lobbied legislators to take down some of the barriers ex-offenders face -- like rules preventing those with criminal records from working at the Port of Newark -- but many are loath to appear soft on crime. A threadbare municipal budget upended the idea of providing sanitation jobs to parolees.
 ''We're making progress but it's like running on the beach,'' the mayor said in a recent interview.
 Mr. Booker is invariably approached on Newark streets by young men with tattooed arms, newly released from prison and desperate for work. He explains that City Hall is not hiring and then, after assessing the person's seriousness, whips out his cellphone and dials Kirsten Giardi at Goodwill Industries.
 Ms. Giardi tells the job seeker to show up the next day at Newark's main train station to catch a van ride to Goodwill, which has a three-year federal grant of $1.8 million to run a job-training center for former prisoners that provides resume advice, work clothes and training in speaking grammatically correct English. But nearly half of the men never show, Ms. Giardi said, and half of those who do disappear once she informs them that it will be three weeks of preparation before they are sent on an interview. 
 ''A lot of these guys want the easy way out,'' she explained. ''We can give them everything -- hold their hand, give them a job and a place to live -- but something has to click in their head. I don't think anyone has figured out what that magic switch is.''
 Of the 415 felons who have come through the program since it started in 2006, 245 have found work. Many, like Murray McNair, have been through two, three, even four jobs.
 Mr. McNair, 22, the son of a drug dealer, approached Mayor Booker on the street last summer after the most recent in a string of jail stints for narcotics sales and said, ''I'm done running the streets.''
 But he quit the first job Ms. Giardi found him -- at a refrigerated warehouse that provides food to the airlines -- after a few days because, he said, he could not stand the cold. He was fired from the next, as a shelf stocker at Stop & Shop, for goofing around. Then he stopped going to Goodwill. 
 Until last month, when Mr. McNair showed up looking for another chance. At a Goodwill mentoring session, Mr. McNair listened as a silver-haired grandfather talked tearfully about missing family milestones because he was always in jail. 
 ''I've never been to a graduation, never been to nothing,'' said the man, Stanley Carter. ''I don't want to end up dying in prison. I don't want to be killed in the street and be memorialized by some balloons on the sidewalk. I want to be remembered as the old man who turned his life around.''
 That night, Mr. McNair returned to the crowded apartment he shares with his pregnant girlfriend, his sister and her two children, and announced that he had found a $9-an-hour job at a warehouse in Perth Amboy. It was 20 miles -- two buses and a taxi ride -- away. 
 ''I know it's going to be tough,'' he said. ''But I can't be thinking about myself anymore.''
 Even the most focused and well-financed efforts run uphill. Parolees with drug convictions do not qualify for federal tuition grants and outstanding traffic fines prevent many from obtaining the driver's licenses that would give them access to jobs beyond the city's public transportation system. And because child support payments and court fees accrue while they are behind bars, the paychecks of newly employed offenders are sometimes heavily garnisheed.
 Newark's Nicholson Foundation, which has allocated $9 million for employment training and mentoring programs, runs a program called Opportunity Reconnect, in which parolees can apply for food stamps, housing assistance and mental health counseling in a student union-like setting at Essex Community College. 
 ''The last thing a returning ex-offender needs is to have to chase down a dozen different services to remedy their problems,'' said Stefan Pryor, Newark's deputy mayor for economic development. ''If we can produce a light at the end of the tunnel, more individuals will successfully navigate that tunnel.''
 Donald Shauger,who owns a property maintenance business, is one of the local employers Mr. Booker successfully recruited to the cause, agreeing to fill a quarter of his 140 positions with parolees. He said that the three he recently hired come to work early and stay long after their shifts end, concluding, ''When you give someone a second chance, they truly work hard.''
 Rich Liebler, who owns a car dealership in nearby Hillside, N.J., is a veteran in the cause, having run a Newark mechanics training school largely for ex-convicts with felony records since 1996. Of the 50 students per year, Mr. Liebler said, about 30 usually complete the yearlong program, which is financed by nonprofit groups, the Ford Motor Company and Pell grants. He said that 90 percent of the graduates find jobs and stay out of jail, though the program has not been independently studied.
 It takes at least a year, Mr. Liebler said, to ''deprogram'' the felons. Most have never owned an alarm clock -- months can pass before they show up for class on time -- and few can name a family member with a regular job. ''We treat them as if they were in a cult,'' he said. ''We have to reverse the thought process they've grown up into.'' 
 Mr. Santos, the local developer, did not give up after Mr. O'Reilly shirked his job and stole his property. Instead, he gave another ex-convict, Rahman Parker, the keys to the apartment. He has promised, too, to replace the stolen furnishings.
 Mr. Parker, a recovering addict who most recently served five months in the county jail for possession of heroin, is 35, a quiet man with big hands, and has been doing demolition work, painting and carpentry for Mr. Santos for the last year and a half. Mr. Santos says he will help Mr. Parker fix his teeth, just as he did for Mr. O'Reilly.
 ''I think Rahman will be different,'' Mr. Santos said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on April 27 about Newark's difficulty in helping ex-convicts get jobs gave an outdated and erroneous name for a New York agency that is conducting a three-year study of employment and recidivism among ex-convicts in four cities. It is MDRC, formerly known as the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (not Development).

HEADLINE: Is Trade the Problem?

 BODY:
Americans are angry about trade, and a lot of politicians -- especially the two Democratic presidential candidates -- are eager to capitalize on it. The country would be far better served by a serious, dare we say fact-based, discussion of what is causing the dislocations in American workers' lives, how much trade is to blame and what government can do to help. 
 There is no question that trade can disrupt lives. Just ask the nearly 500 workers who lost their jobs four years ago when Sanmina-SCI closed its plant in Wilmington, Mass., to move its production of circuit boards to Asia. An investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that eight months later only about 175 of Sanmina's employees had found new jobs, with most of those taking a pay cut. 
 There is also no question that life for many American workers has gotten tougher since the 1970s. Paychecks have failed to keep pace with productivity as most of the spoils of growth have gone to a tiny elite. 
 Still, critics' charges that trade is to blame are misguided. While trade can hurt some workers, most economists believe it plays a modest role compared with other forces in the economy, including advances in technology, the decline of trade unions and mushrooming executive pay. Many Americans benefit from freer trade, whether they are buying cheaper imports or exporting products.
 Consider the four million manufacturing jobs lost over the last decade. That number is daunting -- and the human pain behind it very real. But in most years the United States generates more jobs than it loses. 
 Suppose the critics are right and all those workers were displaced by cheap imports and factories moving overseas. Those lost manufacturing jobs -- an average of 400,000 a year -- amount to less than 3 percent of the 15 million jobs lost each year across the economy. Meanwhile, about 17 million jobs were created annually, which is why the unemployment rate at the end of 2007 was not much different than it was at the end of 1997. 
 What about pay? Workers who lose their jobs usually have to accept a pay cut to get a new one, studies show. And the lost manufacturing jobs paid substantially more than many of the fast-growing service jobs. Critics say trade drives down all blue-collar wages, making it more difficult for companies that compete with cheap imports to increase pay while the greater competition for remaining jobs can lower wages. 
 There is a growing inequity in pay. From 1976 to 2006, the average salary of workers in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution -- nearly everybody -- rose by only 2.3 percent, to $38,800, tax data show. Among the top 10 percent, average salaries rose 57 percent, to $195,000. While there are still high-paying jobs out there, more and more they are reserved for workers with high levels of education. Between 2000 and 2006, the only workers who saw an increase in take-home pay were those with doctorates or professional degrees. 
 No matter how hard economists look for trade's fingerprints on these inequities, they find it plays only a bit part. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute estimated that rising trade with poor countries increased wage inequality between college and high school graduates by about 7 percent over the past quarter-century -- but the wage gap has widened by more than six times that amount over that period. And many economists think Mr. Bivens overstates trade's impact. Robert Lawrence of Harvard, who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, concluded that the increase in wage inequality since the 1990s had little to do with trade. 
 Trade's critics overstate the threat of ''cheap imports'' from poor countries. Often these goods are just assembled in poor countries from components made in high-wage countries -- including the United States. Moreover, many of the things imported from cheap labor markets have not been made here for a long time, so pose no threat to American goods. 
 So what is going on?
 Economists have other explanations for the stagnation of middle incomes and the mushrooming income gap. Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, argues that a big part of the problem is a shortage of educated, skilled workers at a time when demand for them keeps rising. High school graduation rates are flat, and there has been a slowdown in the growth of college graduation rates, partly because of the rising cost of college. This is weighing on wages of less-educated workers while increasing the pay of the most educated. 
 Outrageous executive pay and excesses in financial markets also play a big part. The richest 1 percent of the population has captured more than half of the nation's total income growth since 1993. 
 None of this denies that American workers are hurting. But blaming trade is not the right way to go. What the candidates need to do is respect the voters, and explain the economics and outline policies that will address the true problems. 
 That means expanding the social safety net to help workers displaced by trade. But a lot more must be done, since the problem far transcends shuttered factories. The government has to invest more in education to help produce better-prepared, better-paid graduates. To help American companies compete, it must invest in better roads and ports and address the country's health care crisis. And it must move toward more progressive taxation to help redistribute the spoils of growth. 
 The candidates also need to remind workers of trade's benefits. Trade gives companies and consumers access to cheap imports and accelerates the spread of new technologies; exporters gain access to foreign markets; foreign competition spurs innovation. According to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, increased trade since World War II has added about 10 percent to American national income. 
 Blaming Nafta and other trade agreements for American workers' pain may play well on the campaign stump. But it will not solve the country's economic problems. It will only make them worse.

HEADLINE: At the Ready When Artists Think Big

BYLINE: By JORI FINKEL

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 WHEN Michael Govan, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began talking with the artist Jeff Koons about building a reproduction of a 1943 Baldwin locomotive (suspended from a crane) outside the museum, talk soon turned to rather sizable engineering challenges.
 Is it possible to make a full-scale 70-foot model of the locomotive so that it is hyper-realistic and semifunctional -- with wheels spinning as fast as 100 miles per hour and steam belching three times a day -- and also make it lightweight enough to be safe? How much would the whole thing -- which could easily top $25 million -- actually cost to build? How long would it take? And what would happen in the event of an earthquake?
 For answers they turned straight to one source: Carlson & Company in San Fernando, Calif. One of the art world's leading fabricators, it specializes in making artworks that are too large, industrial, labor-intensive, time-consuming or otherwise complex for the artists to make in their own studios. Its clients over the years have included artists as diverse as Isamu Noguchi, Ellsworth Kelly, the duo Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen and, perhaps most prominent, Mr. Koons. 
 Along with working on smaller pieces for him over the years, the company has quietly been researching his plan for a dangling locomotive, which promises to be his biggest project yet. It delivered a feasibility report of several hundred pages at the end of March.
 ''I would say the project is unprecedented in the art world,'' said Peter Carlson, the company's founder. ''It's art on the scale of major industrial pieces, like the Eiffel Tower, like bridges.''
 Or like a roller coaster at Disney World, said his partner in the business, Ed Suman. ''What they call 'show action equipment' in the themed entertainment business has a lot of similar concerns,'' he said, like safety, reliability and availability to the public. 
 For the last two years Mr. Suman has supervised a team of eight -- including some engineers from Disney Imagineering -- working full time to complete the feasibility study. And that's not counting dozens of other Carlson employees who have had a hand in producing Mr. Koons's work over the past decade. (There are 75 employees in all, heavy on artists and engineers.)
 The company has been working on his famous -- and famously troubled -- ''Celebration'' series since 1996, when it received a unsolicited fax from his studio detailing his plans for gigantic sculptures of children's toys. At that point Mr. Koons was pushing to finish the series in time for an exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, but the show was ultimately canceled because of production delays and cost overruns.
 Things got messy enough that Carlson suspended production of the series, but work resumed in 2000 with new financing from top collectors. The company has since built a giant playroom's worth of pieces, including a nine-foot-wide stainless-steel sculpture of a Mylar balloon called ''Moon'' that weighs more than a ton, in an edition of five. And it completed five 10-foot-tall versions of ''Balloon Dog,'' also in stainless steel, in candy colors for some of the world's biggest collectors. 
 Among them is the yellow puppy made for the hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen, which was installed this month at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as part of ''Jeff Koons on the Roof,'' and an orange version for the publisher Peter Brant that is part of a Koons retrospective opening at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago on May 31. (Carlson did not fabricate Mr. Koons's ''Tulips,'' which recently made news after a visitor at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art apparently scratched it with her bracelet.) 
 Even today you can find odds and ends from the ''Celebration'' series in progress at Carlson's building, a warehouse with 30,000 square feet of manufacturing space as well as offices. 
 The manufacturing area looks like a sci-fi incubator for some kind of cyborg life form, only the aliens turn out to be artworks. Here the machines, which you might find in a metal shop, wood shop or auto-body shop, stand near sculptures you might find in a museum. There's a wide, mechanized screen of rotating hexagonal mirrors by Doug Aitken; a tall, bronze rectangular column by John McCracken; and a boulder-size bronze-composite version of one of Ken Price's vaguely biomorphic speckled ceramic sculptures, which are usually small enough to fit in a duffel bag.
 Then there are the oversize pots and pans that Carlson is creating for Robert Therrien's exhibition in May at Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea. Two worktables were covered with molds for kitchenware -- an enormous lid here, an overly generous salad bowl there. On the floor other super-size pieces -- a steel bowl, a steel colander and a Revere Ware saucepan complete with copper detailing -- were stacked on a post. It's all part of Mr. Therrien's surreal but highly functional vision, which can inspire an Alice-in-Wonderland sense of both vertigo and wonderment.
 Mr. Carlson said he had been working with Mr. Therrien for about eight years. And he made his first sculpture for Mr. McCracken back in 1985, when the polishing technology for achieving mirror-finish stainless-steel surfaces was so crude that the artist's response was, ''Nice try.''
 Recently, however, Mr. McCracken has been won over. ''Making what I want in stainless steel and bronze is very notably not an easy thing to do,'' he explained. ''He pulls out all the stops to accomplish it, even inventing processes and machines to do it.''
 An electrical engineering student who discovered art in college, Mr. Carlson founded the company in 1972 after briefly working for the print shop Gemini G.E.L. producing multiples for artists like Mr. Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg. Mr. Suman, an art student who logged some time on drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, joined the company in 1992 and became a principal five years ago.
 As their relationships with artists have developed, so have certain technologies. The company has spent years perfecting its ''optically perfect mirror polish finish'' stainless-steel surface, which is a hallmark of Mr. Koons's work.
 ''Jeff is one of the most courteous, gentlemanly, considerate people you can ever imagine would ever be working at such a high level of his profession,'' Mr. Suman said. ''At the same time he has very specific ideas about what he would like to create. It would certainly be fair to say that he is very demanding, but in a soft-spoken way, I think.''
 Part of the challenge was creating a smooth contour for sculptures like ''Balloon Dog,'' in which 60 parts are welded to produce the round limbs and torso. ''What makes it so tricky is that these are very simple shapes, and suggestive,'' Mr. Suman said. ''So if the form doesn't look 100 percent perfect, the defects really stand out.''
 The company also had to figure out how to achieve this mirror polish finish in bright colors like magenta and blue. Carlson's experts will not give away their secret except to say that it is a multistage process involving the application of certain adhesives before an ''automobile-type'' paint goes on. (And like a car this sculpture is vulnerable to scratches, as was the case with ''Tulips.'' )
 These days it sometimes seems as though every artist (and every other architect) wants the same glossy look. ''It's like the four-minute mile: once one person breaks the record, it seems like everyonedoes,'' Mr. Carlson said. ''By working on such scale with such perfection, Jeff showed everyone else what's possible.''
 But more than identifying themselves with any technical solution, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Sumac see themselves as problem solvers who can assemble the right team and tools for a particular job, however odd. 
 Their work typically requires reverse engineering -- starting with an image or model supplied by the artist and working backward to figure out how to achieve it. It's the same basic process Mr. Carlson used when, still in preschool, he made himself a bicycle out of scrap parts he picked up in an alley. (Yes, it worked.)
 Sometimes Mr. Carlson and Mr. Sumac end up using old-fashioned techniques. They are making a giant lump of Play-Doh for Mr. Koons, for instance, by using assorted tools to measure every nook and cranny of a small-scale model and then blowing up those measurements, a technique that dates back to the age of Greek and Roman sculpture.
 Today, though, the Carlson team is relying more and more on 3-D modeling technology to scan and manipulate a form in the computer. The resulting data then guide machines that shape a three-dimension object or model. If the company doesn't have (or cannot devise) the right tools in house, it will farm out a piece of a project, working closely with several subcontractors that sprung up to serve the once-booming aerospace industry in Southern California.
 Carlson & Company also devises custom shipping fixtures, steel armatures that safeguard the artwork and allow cranes or other equipment to attach to the framework, not the artwork. In the case of ''Moon,'' also heading to Chicago for the Koons retrospective, the shipping fixture consists of a tubular steel framework that holds the piece at enough of an angle that it can fit through doorways. In the case of ''Balloon Dog'' the shipping fixtures are smaller, as the company has designed the sculpture to be dismantled into 10 pieces.
 What museum visitors won't see are the holes beneath the dog's paws, about the size of a fist, into which highly customized wrenches can be inserted to loosen the body parts. The company helps with installation and also conservation, both of which it tries to address from the start. There is no way to guard against every interaction when it comes to public art, of course, but Mr. Suman did note that the Met's version has a large pedestal that should help protect it from run-ins.
 As for the Koons locomotive, Mr. Suman said that its prospects look good. ''There were a number of technical issues,'' he said. ''We were unsure they could be resolved. But it appears like they can.'' 
 Otherwise the Carlson group declined to disclose specific findings of the report, including cost estimates, and Mr. Koons and Mr. Govan were unavailable for comment despite multiple phone calls to each. 
 ''We just submitted the final report,'' Mr. Suman said. ''They probably just need a little time to digest it and decide what they want to do next.'' And no doubt to drum up the financing in a shaky economy.

HEADLINE: 500 Home Runs, Zero Certainty

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Jim Thome hits long homers, prodigious homers, majestic homers, a lot of homers. Thome is patient and powerful, a left-hander hitter with an open stance, with an uppercut swing and with forearms as massive as telephone poles. Before he ever swings, he looks like someone who should pound homers.
 With Thome, looks are not deceiving. When he bashed his 513th homer, for the Chicago White Sox against the Yankees on Thursday, Thome chugged past Ernie Banks and Eddie Mathews on the career list. Only 18 major league players, three of whom are active, have accumulated more homers than Thome. 
 ''It's very humbling,'' Thome said. ''You're talking about being grouped with the greatest home run hitters who ever played.'' 
 Still, when Thome's career statistics are dissected and debated, he is not universally considered an automatic Hall of Famer. Of the 16 players with at least 500 homers who are eligible for the Hall, 15 have made it. Mark McGwire, who has been suspected of using steroids, is the one player in the 500 club who does not have a spot in Cooperstown.
 Thome has never been connected with the use of performance-enhancing drugs, but he has played in what has become known as the Steroid Era. Five hundred homers used to guarantee admittance to the Hall, but those standards could be changing. Maybe 600 will be the new 500. 
 ''When I hear people say 500 homers doesn't get you in the Hall of Fame, that's a bold statement because 500 homers isn't something that just happens,'' Thome said in a telephone interview. ''It's not something that you just toss out there.''
 Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa have been linked to performance enhancers, so their candidacies for the Hall will be muddied. The veteran baseball writers who vote must decide how to evaluate the players from this era. In McGwire's two years on the Hall of Fame ballot so far, his best showing was 23.6 percent of the votes; 75 percent is necessary for induction. 
 Thome said that the inflation of statistics, some illegitimate, has made it more complicated to judge accomplishments. After he said he had been hurt by playing at a time when players used steroids, he amended his comments. 
 ''I shouldn't say it's hurt me,'' Thome said. ''It's hurt the game. It's a part of what has happened and what we all have to deal with. It's put us in a position where people's speculation is one of the things you have.''
 There is no doubt that Thome is an excellent power hitter, but is he a Hall of Famer? One of the players he surpassed said yes.
 ''He's definitely a Hall of Famer,'' Banks said in a telephone interview. ''He's been consistent. He's done a lot of wonderful things. He's played in the World Series. He's been a great asset to baseball.''
 Writers routinely say that a player has to dominate his era to be a Hall of Famer. Thome has averaged a homer every 13.47 at-bats, the fourth-best ratio ever. He has driven in 100 or more runs nine times, hit 40 or more homers six times, scored 100 or more runs eight times and has a career on-base percentage of more than .400. As strong as those statistics are, do they show dominance? 
 Thome's detractors say he has led the league in homers only once, he has never been in the top three in the most valuable player voting, he has 2,062 strikeouts, which is the third-highest career total, and his 1,942 hits are modest for a player in his 18th season. But Banks, a Hall of Famer who played for the Chicago Cubs, sees Thome as someone who belongs in the exclusive club.
 ''To me, he's a natural-born home run hitter,'' Banks said. ''He hits to all fields. He hits off lefties. He hits off righties. I'm proud of him.''
 If Thome makes 564 plate appearances in 2008, 28 more than he had last year, he will secure a $13 million option with the White Sox for 2009. Whether he returns to Chicago or goes elsewhere, Thome, 37, who exercises daily for his once troublesome back, wants to play for a few more years.
 That means he will presumably climb higher on the home run list. Although Thome is proud of his place in baseball history, he will not say definitively that he deserves to be in the Hall. He would only describe the strenuous journey to Highway 500, the road that used to assure players of getting there.
 ''I do know one thing,'' Thome said. ''I know how hard and how long and how many countless hours you have to put in for it. I know how much you have to work your butt off to even come close to 500 homers.''

HEADLINE: Saddled With Legacy of Dioxin, Town Considers an Odd Ally: The Mushroom

BYLINE: By ANNIE CORREAL

DATELINE: FORT BRAGG, Calif. 

 BODY:
On a warm April evening, 90 people crowded into the cafeteria of Redwood Elementary School here to meet with representatives of the State Department of Toxic Substances Control. 
 The substance at issue was dioxin, a pollutant that infests the site of a former lumber mill in this town 130 miles north of San Francisco. And the method of cleanup being proposed was a novel one: mushrooms.
 Mushrooms have been used in the cleaning up of oil spills, a process called bioremediation, but they have not been used to treat dioxin.
 ''I am going to make a heretical suggestion,'' said Debra Scott, who works at a health food collective and has lived in the area for more than two decades, to whoops and cheers. ''We could be the pilot study.'' 
 Fort Bragg is in Mendocino County, a stretch of coast known for its grand seascapes, organic wineries and trailblazing politics: the county was the first in the nation to legalize medical marijuana and to ban genetically modified crops and animals.
 Fort Bragg, population 7,000, never fit in here. Home to the country's second-largest redwood mill for over a century, it was a working man's town where the only wine tasting was at a row of smoky taverns. But change has come since the mill closed in 2002.
 The town already has a Fair Trade coffee company and a raw food cooking school. The City Council is considering a ban on plastic grocery bags. And with the push for mushrooms, the town seems to have officially exchanged its grit for green.
 The mill, owned by Georgia-Pacific, took up 420 acres, a space roughly half the size of Central Park, between downtown Fort Bragg and the Pacific Ocean. Among several toxic hot spots discovered here were five plots of soil with high levels of dioxin that Georgia-Pacific says were ash piles from 2001-2, when the mill burned wood from Bay Area landfills to create power and sell it to Pacific Gas & Electric.
 Debate remains about how toxic dioxin is to humans, but the Department of Toxic Substances Control says there is no safe level of exposure.
 Kimi Klein, a human health toxicologist with the department, said that although the dioxin on the mill site was not the most toxic dioxin out there, there was ''very good evidence'' that chronic exposure to dioxin caused cancer and ''it is our policy to say if any chemical causes cancer there is no safe level.'' 
 Fort Bragg must clean the dioxin-contaminated coastline this year or risk losing a $4.2 million grant from the California Coastal Conservancy for a coastal trail. Its options: haul the soil in a thousand truckloads to a landfill about 200 miles away, or bury it on site in a plastic-lined, 1.3-acre landfill. 
 Alarmed by the ultimatum, residents called in Paul E. Stamets, author of ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World.''
 Typically, contaminated soil is hauled off, buried or burned. Using the mushroom method, Mr. Stamets said, it is put in plots, strewn with straw and left alone with mushroom spawn. The spawn release a fine, threadlike web called mycelium that secretes enzymes ''like little Pac-Mans that break down molecular bonds,'' Mr. Stamets said. And presto: toxins fall apart. 
 In January, Mr. Stamets came down from Fungi Perfecti, his mushroom farm in Olympia, Wash. He walked the three-mile coastline at the site, winding around rocky coves on wind-swept bluffs where grass has grown over an airstrip but barely conceals the ash piles. It was ''one of the most beautiful places in the world, hands down,'' he said.
 Quick to caution against easy remedies -- ''I am not a panacea for all their problems'' -- he said he had hope for cleaning up dioxin and other hazardous substances on the site. ''The less recalcitrant toxins could be broken down within 10 years.'' 
 At least two dioxin-degrading species of mushroom indigenous to the Northern California coast could work, he said: turkey tail and oyster mushrooms. Turkey tails have ruffled edges and are made into medicinal tea. Oyster mushrooms have domed tops and are frequently found in Asian food.
 Local mushroom enthusiasts envision the site as a global center for the study of bioremediation that could even export fungi to other polluted communities.
 ''Eventually, it could be covered in mushrooms,'' said Antonio Wuttke, who lives in neighboring Mendocino and describes his occupation as environmental landscape designer, over a cup of organic Sumatra at the Headlands Coffeehouse. 
 The proposal is not without critics, however.
 ''There still needs to be further testing on whether it works on dioxin,'' said Edgardo R. Gillera, a hazardous substances scientist for the State Department of Toxic Substances Control. ''There has only been a handful of tests, in labs and field studies on a much smaller scale. I need to see more studies on a larger scale to consider it a viable option.''
 On April 14, at a packed City Council meeting, an environmental consultant hired by the city voiced skepticism, citing a study finding that mushrooms reduced dioxins by only 50 percent. Jonathan Shepard, a soccer coach, stood up and asked: ''Why 'only'? I think we should rephrase that. I think we should give thanks and praise to a merciful God that provided a mushroom that eats the worst possible toxin that man can create.'' 
 Jim Tarbell, an author and something of a sociologist of the Mendocino Coast, said the enthusiasm for bioremediation showed a change in the culture at large. 
 ''We are trying to move from the extraction economy to the restoration economy,'' Mr. Tarbell said. ''I think that's a choice that a broad cross-section of the country is going to have to look at.'' 
 At the April 14 meeting, Georgia-Pacific promised to finance a pilot project. Roger J. Hilarides, who manages cleanups for the company, offered the city at least one 10-cubic-yard bin of dioxin-laced soil and a 5-year lease on the site's greenhouse and drying sheds for mushroom testing. And the City Council said it would approve the landfill but only if it came with bioremediation experiments. 
 So, sometime later this year, Mr. Stamets is scheduled to begin testing a dump truck's load of dioxin-laced dirt in Fort Bragg. 
 ''One bin. Ten cubic yards. That's a beginning,'' said Dave Turner, a Council member. ''I have hope -- I wouldn't bet my house on it -- but I have a hope we can bioremediate this.''

HEADLINE: Recession Diet Just One Way To Tighten Belt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and ERIC DASH; Mary M. Chapman, Brenda Goodman and Christopher Maag contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stung by rising gasoline and food prices, Americans are finding creative ways to cut costs on routine items like groceries and clothing, forcing retailers, restaurants and manufacturers to decode the tastes of a suddenly thrifty public. 
 Spending data and interviews around the country show that middle- and working-class consumers are starting to switch from name brands to cheaper alternatives, to eat in instead of dining out and to fly at unusual hours to shave dollars off airfares.
 Though seemingly small, the daily trade-offs they are making -- more pasta and less red meat, more video rentals and fewer movie tickets -- amount to an important shift in consumer behavior.
 In Ohio, Holly Levitsky is replacing the Lucky Charms cereal in her kitchen with Millville Marshmallows and Stars, a less expensive store brand. In New Hampshire, George Goulet is no longer booking hotel rooms at the Hilton, favoring the lower-cost Hampton Inn. And in Michigan, Jennifer Olden is buying Gain laundry detergent instead of the full-price Tide. 
 Behind the belt-tightening -- and brand-swapping -- is the collision of several economic forces that are pinching people's budgets or, at least, leaving them in lit-tle mood to splurge.
 The price of household necessities has surged, with milk topping $4 a gallon in many stores and regular gasoline closing in on $3.60 a gallon nationwide.
 Home prices are sliding, wages are stagnant, job losses are growing and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad measure of stock performance, is down 6 percent in the last year. So consumers are going on a recession diet. 
 Burt Flickinger, a longtime retail consultant, said the last time he saw such significant changes in consumer buying patterns was the late 1970s, when runaway inflation prompted Americans to ''switch from red meat to pork to poultry to pasta -- then to peanut butter and jelly.''
 ''It hasn't gotten to human food mixed with pet food yet,'' he said, ''but it is certainly headed in that direction.'' 
 Retail sales figures and consumer surveys confirm that Americans are strategically cutting corners, whether it is at the coffee house or the airport. (In: brewing coffee at home and flying coach. Out: Starbucks and first class.)
 In March, Americans spent less on women's clothing (down 4.9 percent), furniture (3.1 percent), luxury goods (1.3 percent) and airline tickets (1.1 percent) compared with a year ago, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, a service of the credit card company that measures spending on 300 million of its cards and estimates purchases with other cards, cash and checks. 
 Wal-Mart Stores reports stronger-than-usual sales of peanut butter and spaghetti, while restaurants like Domino's Pizza and Ruby Tuesday have suffered a falloff in orders, suggesting that many Americans are sticking to low-cost home-cooked meals.
 Over the last year, purchases of brand name cookies and crackers have fallen, according to Information Resources, which tracks retail sales.
 Sales of Nabisco graham crackers have dropped 7.5 percent, and Keebler Fudge Shoppe cookies have slipped by 12.3 percent. Not even beer is immune. Sales of inexpensive domestic beers, like Keystone Light, are up; sales of higher-price imports, like Corona Extra, are down, the firm said.
 Some are skipping drinks altogether. The number of people ordering an alcoholic drink fell to 31 percent last month from 42 percent last summer, according to a survey of 2,500 people conducted by Technomic, a restaurant industry consulting firm.
 ''People have started to shift spending as if we were in a recession,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at MasterCard.
 Such trade-offs were on vivid display last week in Ohio, where layoffs have been rampant. At Save-A-Lot, a discount grocery store in Cleveland, Teresa Rutherford, 51, chided her sister-in-law, Donna Dunaway, 44, for picking up a package of Sara Lee honey ham (eight ounces for $2.49).
 ''We can't afford that!'' she said. ''Get the cheap stuff.'' They settled on a 16-ounce package of Deli Pleasures ham for $3.29, or 34 percent less an ounce. 
 The women said that soaring prices for food and fuel had changed what they buy and where they buy it. ''We used to eat out at Bob Evans or Denny's once a month,'' said Ms. Rutherford, who works in an auto-parts factory. ''Now we don't go out at all. We eat in all the time.''
 Ms. Dunaway, a homemaker, used to splurge on the ingredients for homemade lasagna, her husband's favorite, before food prices began to surge this year. 
 ''Now he's lucky to get a 99-cent lasagna TV dinner, or maybe some Manwich out of a can,'' she said. ''I just can't afford to be buying all that good meat and cheese like I used to.''
 By no means has the economic downturn been bad for all product categories. For instance, sales of big-ticket electronics, like $1,000 flat-panel televisions and $300 video game systems, are on the rise, according to retailers and research firms. 
 Falling prices for such devices and a looming government deadline to convert to digital television have helped. So has the view, sensible or not, that the technology is a good investment. At a Best Buy in Southfield, Mich., James Szekely, 28, a mechanical engineer, was shopping for a big high-definition TV that he expected would cost at least $2,000, an expense he rationalized because ''at least we can watch movies at home.''
 (In a survey conducted this month by the NPD Group, a research firm, consumers suggested that they would sooner cut spending on clothing, furniture and eating out than on video games.)
 At Home Depot, sinks and faucets are selling briskly. Managers at the chain suspect that consumers, loath to spend money on a splashy kitchen renovation or new roof, are settling for a cheaper bathroom ''refresh.'' 
 Another top seller at home improvement stores: programmable thermostats and insulation, which can cut fuel bills.
 Many retailers are struggling to adjust to the new needs. Clothing sales have started to sink at department stores like Macy's, Kohl's and J. C. Penney. So have furniture sales at companies like Bombay and Domain, both of which have filed for bankruptcy protection. 
 Consumers are spurning small indulgences. Starbucks is warning of a drop-off in purchases, and sales have dipped at higher-end restaurant chains, including the steakhouses Ruth's Chris and Morton's. 
 To drum up business, Domino's is offering a new deal: three 10-inch pizzas for $4 each. ''We are not recession-proof,'' said the chain's president, J. Patrick Doyle.
 But chains that emphasize low prices, like TJ Maxx and Wal-Mart, are thriving. And cut-rate supermarkets, like Save-A-Lot, are swamped.
 ''People are not not spending, but they are changing how they spend,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at the NPD Group. 
 And they are often willing to sacrifice convenience or swallow their pride. 
 George Goulet, 52, the business traveler switching from the Hilton to the Hampton Inn, now books flights that depart in the afternoon rather than the early morning. ''It's a lot cheaper,'' he said. ''I can really see the difference.'' 
 Mary Gregory, 55, a telephone company operator in Cleveland, used to eat red meat at least once a week. Now it is hardly ever on her menu. ''I usually buy turkey instead,'' she said. ''Any recipe that calls for meat, like chili or spaghetti, I try to substitute turkey.''
 Carl Hall, a retired construction worker in Detroit, wants to buy a fence forhis backyard. But he decided not to buy a finished product at Lowe's, the home improvement chain where he was shopping recently. With money tight, ''I am looking to put it together myself,'' he said, adding that he hoped to save $200.
 As the compromises mount, people are even coming up with clever schemes to hide their cost-cutting.
 Holly Levitsky, a 56-year-old supermarket cashier in Cleveland, buys a brand of steak sauce called Briargate for 85 cents and surreptitiously pours it into an A1 steak sauce bottle she keeps at home.
 ''My husband can't even tell the difference,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Bread Basket Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 BAGEL ZONE, like so many other regional food shops, is apologizing to its customers. In a lengthy letter posted on its front door here, the store's owners explain that prices have gone up, fueled largely by the rise in the cost of wheat as well as other commodities. 
 ''We are aware of the financial hardships everyone is experiencing due to increasing oil and other costs,'' the letter says. ''However, in order to remain viable we are now forced to pass some of these increases to our customers.'' 
 These increases in the cost of ingredients are anything but incremental, approaching 300 percent over the past year, according to John DiMartino, a co-owner of Bagel Zone. He said he posted the letter in March because ''there's a perception out there it only costs a couple of pennies to make a bagel. But it's just not the case anymore.'' 
 As a result, Mr. DiMartino said, a bagel that sold for 70 cents a year ago now sells for 95 cents.
 The increases in the cost of wheat have affected all types of flour -- the semolina and durum used in pasta, the high-gluten flour used in pizza and bagels, and the lower-gluten flour used in cakes and pastries.
 The impact has spread throughout the metropolitan area on baked goods from bread to brownies, and consumers are feeling the pinch. Even the price of pizza is nearing $3 a slice at many locations.
 An unusual set of conditions has led to shortages, and the gyrating markets have turned bakers into commodities experts.
 Global demand for wheat has spiked -- especially from developing countries like China and India -- while droughts, most notably in Australia, and crop failures worldwide have decreased supply. Additionally, many farmers are altering their mix of crops, planting more corn to meet the growing demand of ethanol producers. 
 Some countries have taken steps to protect their own citizens; on April 15, Kazakhstan, the world's fifth-biggest wheat producer, suspended exports until September. 
 Ephraim Leibtag, an economist with the Economic Research Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture, said the average price of wheat in 2007 was up 48 percent over 2006. ''In December alone, prices jumped 112 percent,'' he said. ''Since the end of 2007, wheat prices have increased another 27 percent over the last two months.'' 
 The cost of other ingredients, like eggs and milk, has also increased, on top of increases in the price of gasoline that inevitably get passed on to consumers. 
 Joe Filc, president of Villarina Pasta, based in New Rochelle, said that while he has passed along some of the increases, he has also absorbed some and, as a result, his profit has fallen by 20 percent in the last year at his 16 stores in Connecticut and Westchester.
 ''Our same-store sales are down 10 percent from last year as a result of both the economy and pricing,'' Mr. Filc said. ''People are cutting back where it's easiest -- first by not going out as much, and second by cutting down on gourmet goods, which is what we have. We're sacrificing profits in hopes that the market will adjust itself. I don't want to turn customers away. I'd like to keep my consumer base.''
 Similarly, Richard Reinwald, a third-generation baker and the owner of Reinwald's Bakery in Huntington, N.Y., said that he faced increases of more than 200 percent in the past 16 months.
 ''Ingredients used to be 22 percent of total cost; now it's up to 30 percent,'' he said. ''We have had three price increases since the summer. Sometimes in the past we didn't raise our prices for over a year and sometimes for two years.'' 
 To make matters worse, some shortages are occurring. Rye bread is particularly at risk, Mr. Reinwald said, because ''you cannot purchase rye flour anymore.''
 ''If you want a rye sandwich, you better get it pretty soon,'' he said. ''We have enough in the industry until May. The imports might make up for it, but it will be at a much higher price.''
 The price increases are historic, business owners say. Stew Leonard, the well-known Connecticut grocer, who has been in business for more than 30 years, said he had ''never heard our farmers talking about the price of food as much as they are now. Everybody I talk to, it's the topic.'' 
 Businesses with diverse foods are changing their suppliers or their recipes to cope with the prices. Mr. Leonard, for example, said, ''We can save money by using great local farms, so we're buying more from the local farms.''
 Others, like Paul Liscio, the chef and co-owner of La Casa Bianca in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said he is using ''semolina, corn and polenta, blending some flours and some grains and adjusting the recipes a little.''
 ''You get creative so you can still make a profit,'' he said, adding that he had not raised his prices in four years. 
 But for those companies for which flour-based products are their bread and butter, tinkering is not an easy answer.
 Noel Labat-Comess, the president of Tom Cat Bakery, in Long Island City, Queens, which supplies bread throughout the metropolitan area, said he had experimented with cheaper varieties of flour to hold down costs, but it ''entails tweaking the recipe.''
 ''We make a lot of different products, and we have high quality expectations,'' he said. ''Making a change that seems small really trickles down; making sure it's right is complex.''
 Often overlooked is the unanticipated impact that price increases have on food banks. Mr. Reinwald said he gives his leftover bread at the end of each day to the local food pantry. But he has changed his inventory, baking closer to anticipated demand, and has fewer loaves to contribute. 
 ''I always overproduce to take care of the soup kitchen,'' he said. ''Now I need to underproduce, and they ask if that's all I have. The pressure is on the soup kitchen when more people need their services.''

HEADLINE: Dry Cleaners Feel an Ill Wind From China

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
THE wholesale price of wire hangers would seem an unlikely source of urban dismay.
 But the other day at Uptown Dry Cleaners in East Harlem, as workers bustled about wrapping suits in plastic and tossing newly arrived garments into bins, the owner, Young Hoon Jung, sat solemnly at the counter, shaking his head as he stared at a sheaf of invoices. 
 At one point, Mr. Jung gestured in disbelief at a piece of paper indicating the prices he pays for steel wire hangers, which he, like virtually every dry cleaner, uses by the thousands. 
 After a federal tariff was imposed last month on wire hangers imported from China, Mr. Jung explained, the wholesale price skyrocketed. As a result, many dry cleaners say, already slim profits have grown even slimmer. 
 ''It increased 60 percent from one week to the next,'' Mr. Jung said of hanger prices. ''We do 4,000 pieces a week, so obviously we need 4,000 hangers. Raise the price a little, O.K., but not 60 percent. It's a lot of upset.'' 
 In just a few weeks, he said, the price of a box of 500 hangers rose to almost $40 from $17.50. 
 ''Everyone in the Korean community is talking about it,'' continued Mr. Jung, who said that he might have to raise prices soon. ''They're saying: 'What are we doing this for? The government? The landlords? We can't do this business anymore.' '' 
 With Korean immigrants owning an estimated 65 percent of the city's 1,100 dry cleaners, the issue, the subject of a recent article in Korea Times New York, a Korean-language newspaper, is big news in that community. 
 The new tariff was imposed after a six-month investigation by the United States Department of Commerce, which concluded that Chinese manufacturers were flooding the market with cheap hangers below cost, a practice that is known as dumping and is designed to put rivals out of business. 
 The Korean Dry Cleaners Association of New York has urged federal officials to remove the tariff. ''The whole economy is not good now,'' said Chang-Kyun Im, the group's chairman. ''And now we have this extra expense.''
 But Nora Nealis, the executive director of the National Cleaners Association, which is based in the garment district, says she doubts that the tariff will be rescinded. She hopes that competition among American firms will eventually cause prices to fall and that consumers will be encouraged to recycle their undamaged hangers. Meanwhile, she is doling out sympathy to suffering dry cleaners. 
 ''If you look at the Korean cleaners, they're by and large mom-and-pops not making an awful lot,'' Ms. Nealis said. ''A nickel and dime add up real quick.''

HEADLINE: A Market That Dashes Assumptions

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
INVESTORS entered the year sure of one thing -- that the economy was bound for recession, or at least for a severe downturn. And based on that assumption, they drew several conclusions. 
 There was widespread agreement, for example, that growth stocks would likely trounce value stocks this year, because investors typically seek out companies with dependable earnings growth during times of dwindling profits. 
 Large-capitalization stocks, meanwhile, were expected to handily beat small-company shares, as investors tend to seek the safety of larger, blue-chip investments during a market storm. And defensive-minded industries like health care were expected to hold up significantly better than economically sensitive sectors like consumer discretionary stocks. 
 Nearly a third of the way into the year, the economy looks as if it's in or bound for a severe slowdown. Yet none of these other predictions have come to pass -- at least not the way the ''smart money'' anticipated.
 ''It does seem that logic has been turned on its head,'' said Christopher N. Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel, the asset management firm in Los Angeles.
 To be sure, growth and value stocks have been running neck and neck this year. But that is rather remarkable. After all, the growth shares were supposed to perform so much better, and value investing has been weighed down by huge losses in financial stocks (a classic value sector). 
 Small-cap stocks, meanwhile, are actually holding up slightly better than big, blue-chip shares. Since the start of the year, the Standard & Poor's 600 index of small stocks has lost 3.5 percent of its value, while the S.& P. 500 index of blue chips is down 4.8 percent. 
 And as for defensive plays like health care? That sector has lost nearly 11 percent, on average, since the start of the year. Consumer discretionary stocks, on the other hand, have lost less than 3 percent. ''It is puzzling to me that the consumer discretionary part of the S.& P. 500 is beating the index,'' Mr. Orndorff said. ''We are in a recession and consumer spending is slowing, so it should stand to reason that these stocks would do poorly.''
 What's going on? A growing school of thought says that stock markets are acting rationally. ''The economy simply has not turned out as bad as most feared,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. 
 Consider corporate earnings. In the first quarter, earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies were forecast to have fallen 14.1 percent. But virtually all of these declines can be attributed to just one sector: the financials. 
 For the second quarter, Wall Street analysts are bracing for a 5.5 percent decline in corporate profits. But if you strip out financial companies' results, earnings for the rest of the S.& P. 500 are expected to climb nearly 8 percent, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research, has a slightly different take on these trends: Maybe the markets aren't simply reacting to a less-than-severe downturn. What if stock prices are instead foreshadowing an impending recovery? 
 Mr. Stovall noted, for instance, that many Wall Street assumptions have come true -- it's just that they did so between the market's peak last October and mid-March. During that stretch, growth beat value, large caps held up significantly better than small caps, and defensive sectors held up better than economically sensitive stocks.
 But all that seemed to change in March, when the Federal Reserve made a sixth cut in a key short-term interest rate and helped bail out Bear Stearns from a possible bankruptcy.
 THE fact that small stocks and economically sensitive shares have done so well since March 10 -- the S.& P. 600 index of small stocks has jumped 10.6 percent since then, while consumer discretionary stocks have been among the better performers -- would seem to confirm that the worst of the equity price decline is over, he said. 
 But others aren't so sure. Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, noted that consumers were still stressed by a combination of falling housing values, a worsening job market, the continuing credit crisis and rising food and energy bills. Given that, ''it's too early for stocks to be off to the races,'' Mr. Ablin said.
 He could be right. After all, the markets erred by making wholesale assumptions about how stocks would react to a slowing economy. Investors could be similarly mistaken about a potential recovery rally. 
 This is a reason to ignore market chatter and simply stick with a diversified investing plan that calls for investing some money in large-cap stocks and small-cap shares, in growth and value, and in every sector of the market.

HEADLINE: Wall Street, Run Amok

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You don't really need to find out what's going on.
 You don't really want to know just how far it's gone.
 Just leave well enough alone... .
 -- Don Henley, ''Dirty Laundry''
 YOU may well be asking yourself, as I have asked myself, how on earth did the credit crisis on Wall Street become such a catastrophe? 
 How did all of the mechanisms operated by the mind-bogglingly well-paid men and women of the Street go so wrong that we saw a major investment bank, Bear Stearns, essentially disappear? How did Wall Street firms of ancient lineage take such immense losses that they made banks clam up on lending -- at great risk to the economy?
 Weren't fail-safe devices in place to guard against risk? Weren't government watchdogs there to make sure that catastrophes could not happen? Weren't ratings agencies on the job to police what was going on in the canyons of Lower Manhattan? 
 To paraphrase Dr. Evil in the ''Austin Powers'' movies: ''How about 'no,' Scott?''
 Anyone who cares about this disaster would be extremely well advised -- and I'd underline ''extremely'' as often as possible -- to read a speech on the matter that was given on April 8 by a genius investor named David Einhorn at a Grant's Interest Rate Observer event. 
 Mr. Einhorn runs Greenlight Capital, a successful hedge fund. He also isn't an infallible observer of human lapses and regulatory failures -- he invested in and briefly served on the board of New Century, a subprime mortgage lender that later went bust amid accounting problems. (When I sought his response, Mr. Einhorn said he did not want to comment on New Century or on his essay.) 
 Yet his speech so well explains what went wrong in the financial debacle that it's frightening. Here is my CliffsNotes version of it.
 First, Maestro Einhorn points out that the fellows who run big investment banks have a strong incentive to maximize their assets and leverage themselves into deep trouble because their pay is a function of how much debt they can pile on. If they can use relatively low-interest debt to generate slightly higher returns, the firm earns more revenue and executive pay increases. Often, an astonishing 50 percent of total revenue goes to employee compensation at Wall Street firms.
 NOW, you may ask, what kind of assets were they acquiring with that debt? Well, sometimes, as with Bear Stearns, the leveraged assets are mostly government agency debt, which used to be regarded as fairly safe. 
 Sometimes, as Mr. Einhorn notes, those portfolios also hold stocks, bonds, loans awaiting securitization, and pieces of structured finance deals. They also hold heavy exposure to derivatives that have stunning risk profiles and can produce astounding losses in bad circumstances. They might also contain real estate assets and have exposure to private equity deals.
 In other words, they can hold some scary ''assets.'' What do they hold as capital against such risks? You would think it would be cash or Treasury bonds, wouldn't you? But no.
 Under an interesting set of rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004, called ''Alternative Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That Are Part of Consolidated Supervised Entities,'' the amount of capital that had to underlie assets was reduced substantially. (Mr. Einhorn rightly says that this set of rules should have been called the ''Bear Stearns Future Insolvency Act of 2004.'')
 Through the act, the S.E.C. -- acting as one of Wall Street's chief regulators, mind you -- also allowed such things as ''hybrid capital instruments'' (much riskier than cash or Treasuries), subordinated debt (ditto) and even deferred return of taxes, to be counted as capital. The S.E.C. even allowed the banks to hold securities ''for which there is no ready market'' as capital.
 ''These adjustments reduced the amount of required capital to engage in increasingly risky activities,'' Mr. Einhorn says.
 In response to Mr. Einhorn's critique, an S.E.C. spokesman told me that these changes could theoretically lower capital, but that the agency has seen no evidence that that has, in fact, occurred.
 But Mr. Einhorn has even more troubling observations. He says the S.E.C. also allowed broker-dealers to set their own valuations on assets and liabilities that were hard to value. And broker-dealers could assign their own creditworthiness ratings to counterparties in complex derivatives transactions when those counterparties were otherwise unrated.
 In a word, Mr. Einhorn says, the S.E.C. told Wall Street to police itself to save on regulatory costs, while not bothering to ''discuss the cost to society of increasing the probability that a large broker-dealer could go bust.''
 A result of all this, he says, was as follows:
 ''The owners, employees and creditors of these institutions are rewarded when they succeed, but it is all of us, the taxpayers, who are left on the hook if they fail. This is called private profits and socialized risk. Heads, I win. Tails you lose. It is a reverse-Robin Hood system.'' 
 And when it all went kaput during the Bear Stearns debacle, the likable chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, said that the system was fine and needed no immediate repairs. Of course, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, is calling for merging the S.E.C. with the easygoing Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in the financial equivalent of setting off a Doomsday Device.
 The S.E.C. told me that all of its actions were helpful to investors and that no one could have prevented the Bear Stearns collapse because it was caused by liquidity issues, not capital issues. My respectful response is that if Bear were thoroughly well capitalized, why would liquidity issues come up at all? 
 There is much more in Mr. Einhorn's speech about how dramatically understaffed the ratings agencies are in assessing risk on Wall Street and how even the biggest ratings agencies largely allowed the Street to rate itself.
 The big ratings firms, according to Mr. Einhorn, do not even bother to assess the major investment banks' portfolios because they change so often.
 It looks to me as if the inmates are running the asylum. One truth, that deregulation is sometimes a good thing, has been followed down so long and winding a road that it has led to an immense lie: that deregulation carried to an extreme will not lead to calamity. 
 To think that people of this mind-set are in charge of the finances of the nation that is the cornerstone of world freedom is terrifying. Mr. Einhorn may well have done us a service of great value.

HEADLINE: The Rule of Law

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS. 
Dexter Filkins, a foreign correspondent for The Times, covered the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2006. His book, ''The Forever War,'' will be published this fall.

 BODY:
THE POLITICS OF CHAOS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
 By Olivier Roy. 
 Translated by Ros Schwartz. 
 167 pp. Columbia University Press. $24.95. 
 THE FALL AND RISE OF THE ISLAMIC STATE 
 By Noah Feldman. 
 189 pp. Princeton University Press. $22.95. 
 Five years is a long time in the Middle East -- and especially the five that just passed. In early 2003, a barrel of oil cost $30. A reform-minded president was at the helm in Iran. In Gaza, Hamas was a bunch of renegades. And a very brutal man was still ruling the region known historically as Mesopotamia. 
 The invasion of Iraq changed everything, if not directly; war, as Lenin said, can be the great accelerator of events. The Middle East is now in such extraordinary ferment that it is possible to imagine that the system of states carved out of the Ottoman Empire following World War I could collapse altogether.
 Two new books by eminent scholars of the region offer different perspectives on the present crisis. It's a measure of how dire things are that neither one inspires much hope. 
 In ''The Politics of Chaos in the Middle East,'' Olivier Roy, the research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research, takes the full measure of the state of the Middle East since the American invasion of Iraq. It's not a pretty picture. From Suez to Kashmir, the old categories have changed, or have begun to overlap. For starters, that old reliable -- the Arab-Israeli conflict -- has, in Roy's mind, passed the point of no return. ''The conditions on the ground now make the creation of a viable Palestinian state impossible,'' he says.
 The region is now beset by armed movements, like Hamas and Hezbollah, that transcend national boundaries and pay little heed to the formal -- and invariably weak -- governments of the states where they reside. At the same time, conflicts within Islam are overshadowing the fights between states. Foremost among these is the emerging division between the Sunni and Shiite worlds, exemplified by the sectarian bloodletting in Iraq. 
 Behind the Sunni-Shiite conflict, of course, is the region's most troubling challenge -- that of an Iranian regime bent on challenging the status quo. With the rise of the Shiites in Iraq (enabled by the American invasion) and in Lebanon, the Iranian government is leading a fundamental reordering of the balance of power that is coming at the expense of the Sunni world -- so much so that hard-line Arab states like Saudi Arabia have even begun to move closer to Israel. ''The day the United States bombs Iran,'' Roy says, ''all the Arab capitals will protest, but more than one will be quietly jubilant.'' 
 Moving across the region, Roy asserts that entire ethnic groups, like the Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan, are becoming radicalized. And Iraq, he says, will almost certainly break apart. ''Kurdistan is automatically heading towards independence,'' Roy writes. That doesn't mean America can leave Iraq anytime soon, Roy says -- doing so would inflame the Sunni-Shiite conflict across the region.
 What is to be done? At only 167 pages, Roy's book provides a concise and penetrating summation of the current scene; it's a fine primer for anyone trying to get a sense of just how chaotic the Middle East is. But if you are looking for a way out of the quagmire, or even ways to manage the various catastrophes, you will not find much here. Roy impressively delineates the challenges, but doesn't say much about solving them. He excoriates the Bush administration for lumping all of Islam -- and all the Islamists -- into its war on terror, but half the editorial writers in America have done that. The most he can offer is a suggestion that the United States negotiate with Iran and Hamas. These are good ideas (and the United States is already talking to Iran about Iraq), but hardly ones likely to effect drastic change, if any at all. 
 Which brings us to Noah Feldman's ''Fall and Rise of the Islamic State.'' The book begins in daring fashion, acknowledging the plight of the region and suggesting it might be saved by Islamic law. That's right: Shariah. ''Just now, the Islamist promise of the rule of law offers the only prospect for meaningful political justice for many Muslims,'' he writes. ''If it, too, fails, the alternative may well be worse.''
 Well now, that's a provocative assertion. At a glance, you might think Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, drew the most difficult card at a college debating tournament. But I have a personal interest: as a correspondent covering the Taliban in Afghanistan a decade ago, I witnessed a public execution and an amputation performed at the Kabul Sports Stadium on a Friday afternoon. ''In revenge there is life,'' a voice called into the loudspeaker as the execution of a young man proceeded. (The announcer was reading from the Koran.) I saw the other tenets of Taliban Shariah in full flower as well, like the wholesale repression of women. I was eager to see how Feldman would pull off such a novel and unorthodox argument. 
 And he does not. Or not very convincingly, anyway. Feldman provides an interesting history of the Islamic legal system that prevailed over the Middle East and North Africa, including, in particular, the variant practiced by the Ottomans until the collapse of their empire following World War I. Feldman shows that, through a delicately balanced arrangement that relied on an unelected group of scholars to interpret the Koran and other religious texts, Shariah provided an orderly and predictable legal system that checked the power of the empire's rulers. And he shows how that system collapsed, thereby speeding the decline of the empire by removing checks on executive power. 
 But that was then, and this is now. In today's world Feldman's argument runs out of steam. How could it not? As Roy points out, modern attempts to impose Shariah have failed wherever they have been tried -- whether in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia or Iran. Failed, that is, in Roy's words, at ''instigating effective and legitimate political institutions and social justice, and guaranteeing economic development.'' Feldman is correct in pointing out that Islamist ideas will play an increasingly prominent role in the Middle East, but he avoids the critical questions. What about women? What about Muslims who leave the faith? Of these, Feldman says almost nothing. 
 Maybe Shariah will save the Middle East. But based on the evidence we have, waiting for it to blossom into a humane and modern legal system is to engage in wishful thinking. Feldman seems to recognize this himself, and ends his book by calling on the West to help majority Muslim countries build ''institutions that perceive themselves and are perceived by the public as committed to the rule of law.'' Nation-building, in other words. America and Europe are doing quite a lot of that already, in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. The chaos that engulfs both of those countries shows just how difficult it is for the rule of law to take hold, whether it's Islamic or not.

HEADLINE: A Living Heritage: The Earthen Homes Of Yongding County

BYLINE: By BARBARA KOH

 BODY:
FROM China's Fujian coast, it's a grinding drive up narrow roads through villages built around exhausted coal mines to reach the remote mountains of Yongding. Morning mist clings to the slopes of dense trees and brush. Below, in a valley, rests an eerie collection of beige cylindrical structures, one as enormous as a football field.
 This sci-fi scenery is peculiar to southern China and concentrated in Yongding County. The bizarre edifices, which the Chinese say foreign surveillance has, over the years, mistaken for missile silos and U.F.O.'s, are decades- and centuries-old and made of rammed earth. They are still homes to the Hakka, a Han Chinese nomadic group.
 Getting there is an effort -- from the closest airport, in Xiamen, a driver will take you to Yongding in three to four hours for about 1,500 yuan round trip, around $210 at 7.13 yuan to the dollar. The reward, however, is a tour of unvarnished rural China, one-of-a-kind grass-roots architecture and an ancient culture's fading traditions. 
 The Hakka communal homes-cum-fortresses have lured foreign architects and anthropologists for the last 20 years and, more recently, a trickle of tourists seeking obscure corners of China and overseas Hakka seeking their roots. Noting this interest, China, more often known for demolishing historic structures than protecting them, has begun restoring the earthen houses and last year nominated them for World Heritage Site status. Unesco will consider the nomination this summer. 
 In the meantime, many Hakka residents are upgrading to modern housing and to jobs in the cities. They are less interested in the cultural value of their dwellings, which adds to the sense of urgency among those wishing to preserve, or see, remnants of China's past. 
 The houses, mostly built between the 1300s and 1960s, were designed to deter outsiders and wild animals. Starting around A.D. 300, wars, famine and persecution drove Chinese in north and central China to flee southward. These migrants became known as ''ke jia'' or Hakka, meaning ''the guest people,'' by unwelcoming natives. Many Hakka prospered, including Deng Xiaoping, the engineer of present-day China's market economy, and Singapore's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew. 
 In southern Fujian, the Hakka settled in the mountains and created insular homesteads like the covered-wagon circles of America's pioneers, with rooms facing an open-air common space.
 Feng shui correct, the compounds have withstood bullets, fires, quakes and typhoons. They're at least three stories tall, and their outer walls are three to five feet thick. The entrance is a wooden slab sheathed in iron. Windows are tiny and only on the upper floors. A well is inside; outhouses are outside. Most ingenious are the walls -- a mixture of soil, lime, pebbles and wood chips held together by soupy glutinous rice and brown sugar, pounded into impregnability, giving the structures their name, ''tulou,'' or ''earthen building.'' 
 The Zhengchang tulou spans 260 feet and has two concentric circles of different heights that contain 250 rooms. In its center is a white and pink ancestral-worship hall. Red lanterns wave from the eaves, and several rooms have become souvenir shops. Livelier and more down-to-earth is Wenchang Lou, set amid terraced rice paddies. The cobblestone courtyard is a huge playpen for youngsters, hens and puppies. On a visit last August, I peeked into the living areas; one contained gray-haired players clattering mah-jongg tiles. A wobbly wooden staircase led to storage rooms on the second floor; on the third floor were bedrooms and hanging laundry. Wenchang's 30 families each owns a stack of rooms. They and the families in four tulou nearby all share one ancestor and surname, Huang. 
 Customs that have disappeared elsewhere in China linger here. The tulou have auspicious names (Wenchang means flourishing culture), and pasted on the doors are wishes for prosperity, health and harmony written in traditional characters on red paper. Several clans use current wall calendars with the anachronistic image of a rosy-cheeked Mao as ''the red sun.'' 
 For the most part, the Hakka welcome visitors. Hospitality is a tradition, and at several tulou, I was invited to have tea. 
 Around 8 a.m., loudspeakers reminded the Huangs to clean up for an inspection by Unesco advisers. The government also ordered residents to shoo out their chickens and ducks, according to 60-year-old Huang Shungeng. World Heritage Site status is important, he said, but won't really affect him. (If it means the poultry are permanent exiles, though, he'd like the government to help pay for new coops.) 
 SOME locals are realizing the payoff of attracting visitors to Yongding. Li Shuyang, who was 18 when she married a Huang, lives in a concrete building near the Huang tulou cluster. The couple rents rooms to travelers for 30 yuan per person and proudly emphasizes the shower and squat flush toilet.
 Ms. Li, now 40, cooked a dinner of wild greens and mushrooms, and ladled a broth whose coconut-cream scent came from a local root. She hated tulou living: ''It's not sanitary enough,'' she said. 
 The nationwide migration from the countryside to urban areas has taken its toll. In the Wenchang tulou, I met Huang Yangcan, who had left home in his 20s and was visiting his brother, a farmer, and widowed mother. He runs a clothing business in Kunming, a city of four million. ''Of course I'd rather live in the tulou,'' said Mr. Huang, 36. ''It's less pressure; everyone's a friend; we all know each other. The environment is nicer, but you can't make money.''
 Lin Yunchang, 80, belongs to his clan's 23rd generation. ''At 15, 16, people leave to seek work,'' he said. The three-centuries-old square tulou that he's never left has 30 residents, mainly grandparents raising their grandchildren. It has 100 at Chinese New Year, when many people visit their ancestral villages. ''No one's yet returned to retire,'' though, Mr. Lin added. 
 Most Hakka view the buildings merely as shelter and their location and functions as outdated, noted Ping Yip, a recent master's degree graduate in Hong Kong who researched and lived in the tulou. Yet, she said, ''if all the residents move out, the tulou loses its cultural significance as a human settlement.''
 The government and conservationists, meanwhile, see cultural heritage as the tulou's raison d'etre. If Unesco rewards their legacy with a place on the World Heritage list, the resulting tourism and investment might help resuscitate the local economy and offset the city-bound stampede.

HEADLINE: Raising Taxes: It's Time for Voters to Get Real

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Thanks for ''Empty Talk on Taxes'' (editorial, April 24). This is something that the media should cover more. 
 We have horrible deficits and national debt, and nobody is willing to step up to the plate to pay for it. Sure, federal spending isn't perfect: we should be even more skeptical of how our government spends money. But we cannot question the fact that it spends money at all and that we must pay for it. 
 During the 1950s and 1960s -- when the American economy was booming -- the top income tax rates were 90 and 75 percent, respectively. Ronald Reagan gutted tax inflows. We'll have to pay someday. It should start now.
 Jeffrey Sleasman Columbus, Ohio, April 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Empty Talk on Taxes'' (editorial, April 24) states, ''Perhaps the candidates are afraid the American people can't handle the truth about what it would take to meet the nation's economic challenges.'' 
 The real fear, however, is political: conservatives have drummed into our heads that there shall be ''no new taxes,'' and the penalty can be political death. This leads to the silly candidates' promises to limit tax increases when they are obviously required. Taxes do make possible services that government provides best and most economically, and where privatization doesn't work well. 
 A campaign is needed to persuade the public that it can't have valued programs without paying for them, any more than one can purchase for free clothing or toothpaste.

HEADLINE: Stamford Restaurants Face Ban on Trans Fats

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

DATELINE: stamford 

 BODY:
 HAVING an order of French fries, or a piece of cake for dessert, might become a bit healthier in some restaurants here this summer when a trans fat ban goes into effect.
 The city will ban restaurants from using trans fats beginning July 1. The new regulations do not apply to the sale of prepackaged foods. 
 Dannel P. Malloy, Stamford's mayor, said he proposed the ban because while many national restaurant chains had already stopped using trans fats, many smaller independent establishments have yet to follow suit. 
 ''What we're seeing, quite honestly, are a lot of places in the city that serve less affluent people still cooking Latino foods, or other ethnic foods, using trans fats,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''That's created a disparity of the health factor of food along economic lines, and we need to address that.'' 
 Stamford appears to be the first city or town in the state to ban the use of trans fats, which are derived from partially hydrogenated oils and are considered to increase the risk of heart disease. William Gerrish, a spokesman for the State Department of Public Health, said that he knew of no other. 
 Last year, a bill banning trans fats throughout the state was passed by the Senate, but was never brought up for a vote in the House. State Senator John McKinney, Republican of the 28th District, a cosponsor of the bill, said that he would introduce it again next year if he is re-elected. 
 ''We've learned that trans fats are extremely harmful to your health, in terms of heart disease, and that there are effective alternatives that accomplish the same cooking goals as trans fats,'' he said.
 In Stamford, Dr. Johnnie A. Lee, the director of Health and Social Services and the city's medical adviser, said the ordinance would help to eliminate cardiovascular disease and help educate the public. 
 ''This will prompt people to read labels and ask questions about trans fats,'' he said.
 Joseph Coppola, a Republican member of the city's board of representatives, said that he voted against it. ''I don't believe it's a legislator's job to determine what people can eat and what they can't eat,'' he said.
 Simon A. Flynn, the president and chief executive of the Connecticut Restaurant Association, which represents approximately 750 restaurants in the state, said that he supported eliminating trans fats. He said that the July 1 deadline was too soon.
 ''They're not giving the marketplace, the suppliers and the restaurants themselves, enough time to reformulate what they need, and where to find new supplies,'' he said. ''There are all kinds of issues.''
 Dr. Lee said that the ordinance would be enforced during regular health inspections. He said letters about the ordinance had been sent to every food service business in the city last November and December, and so far his department has not received any complaints or questions. 
 The operators of several restaurants and bakeries said that they no longer used trans fats.
 Maria Aposporos, the owner of Curley's Diner in Stamford and a city representative who voted for the ordinance, said that she was persuaded to use vegetable oil, instead of trans fats, at her business 25 years ago.
 ''If you keep your customers healthy and going back to work, they will continue to come here,'' she said. ''If you help get them sick and they are unable to work, they are not going to go out to eat, either.''
 In downtown Stamford, some diners said they favored the ban.
 Mike Dreibelbis, 23, of Stamford, who works for a non-profit bank in the city said: ''It's nice that you won't have to worry about whether what you're eating was made with trans fats.''
 ''I think it's great,'' said Alena Kerins, 28, a bookkeeper who lives in Stamford. ''There are healthier alternatives that taste exactly the same.''

HEADLINE: 3 Candidates With 3 Plans, But One Deficit

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates differ strikingly in their approaches to taxes and spending, but their fiscal plans have at least one thing in common: each could significantly swell the budget deficit and increase the national debt by trillions of dollars, according to tax and budget experts.
 The reasons reflect the ideological leanings of the candidates, with Senator John McCain proposing tax cuts that go beyond President Bush's and the Democrats advocating programs costing hundreds of billions of dollars. But for fiscal experts concerned with the deficit, both approaches are worrisome.
 With the national debt soaring to $9.1 trillion from $5.6 trillion at the start of 2001, in part because of the Iraq war and Mr. Bush's tax cuts, a crucial question about the candidates to succeed him is ''whether they are helping to fill the hole or make it deeper,'' said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that advocates deficit reduction. ''With the proposals they have on the table, it looks to me like all three would make it deeper.''
 Representatives of all three campaigns disputed such assessments, questioning the accounting methods analysts used to calculate the growing debt and saying they could enact their plans without making matters worse. 
 Mr. McCain's plan would appear to result in the biggest jump in the deficit, independent analyses based on Congressional Budget Office figures suggest. A calculation done by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington found that his tax and budget plans, if enacted as proposed, would add at least $5.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.
 Fiscal monitors say it is harder to compute the effect of the Democratic candidates' measures because they are more intricate. They estimate that, even taking into account that there are some differences between the proposals by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, the impact of either on the deficit would be less than one-third that of the McCain plan.
 The centerpiece of Mr. McCain's economic plan is a series of tax cuts that would largely benefit corporations and the wealthy. He is calling for cutting corporate taxes by $100 billion a year. Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which was created to apply to wealthy taxpayers but now also affects some in the middle class, would reduce revenues by $60 billion annually. He also would double the exemption that can be claimed for dependents, which would cost the government $65 billion.
 ''High tax rates are driving many businesses and jobs overseas -- and, of course, our foreign competitors wouldn't mind if we kept it that way,'' Mr. McCain said, laying out his economic plan this month in Pittsburgh. ''We're going to get rid of that drag on growth and job creation.''
 On the expenditure side, Mr. McCain has called not only for continuing an open-ended deployment of troops in Iraq, but also for spending $15 billion annually to expand the Army and the Marine Corps and to improve health care for veterans, among other programs.
 Mr. McCain's advisers have said the new tax cuts would be paid for by eliminating earmarks and making large spending cuts, but they have not identified specifics. And they have spoken vaguely about making entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare less costly for the government. Mr. McCain's chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said the campaign had simply presented its vision of what the tax code should look like and noted that some of the proposals would be phased in.
 ''I think what they ought to do is remember that the proposals are going to engender economic growth, which is the best thing you can do for near-term budget improvement,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, adding that Mr. McCain believed spending restraint was possible. 
 That vision for the tax code includes making permanent the Bush tax cuts, set to expire in 2010, which Mr. McCain once opposed in part because they were not accompanied by sufficient spending cuts.
 ''I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthiest Americans,'' Mr. McCain said in 2004. ''I would clearly support not extending these tax cuts in order to help address the deficit.''
 In 2001 and 2003, Mr. Bush pushed through Congress tax cuts totaling nearly $2 trillion. The first set lowered income and estate taxes, and the second focused mostly on capital gains and dividends.
 The McCain campaign does not figure the costs of extending the tax cuts into its deficit projections, although the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost an extra $2.2 trillion over the next decade.
 When Mr. McCain outlined his tax cut plan, he backed away from his pledge to balance the budget during his first term, but said that he would do so by the end of his second term. And in an interview last Sunday on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC, Mr. McCain said he would push ahead with his tax cuts even if Congress did not approve his spending cuts.
 Some conservative economists say that increased deficits in the short run are an acceptable tradeoff for tax cuts that they say will promote economic growth in the long run. And many liberal economists say that some of the Democratic spending proposals, like addressing the affordability of health care or improving education, are long-overdue investments that pay off handsomely even if they entail more red ink.
 Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have acknowledged that their various new programs would be costly but have outlined how to pay for them. But some fiscal monitors say they may be relying on overly rosy projections of how much savings their proposals would actually yield. 
 Mrs. Clinton has calculated that her universal health care plan would cost about $110 billion a year, while Mr. Obama's somewhat more modest proposal would cost up to $65 billion annually, his advisers say. Both candidates have also talked of new government incentives and investment to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy, which would cost about $15 billion a year.
 The Democratic candidates have suggested that they could finance these and other programs by allowing parts of the Bush tax cuts to expire. That, however, ignores projections of the Congressional Budget Office, which has already assigned those savings to deficit reduction.
 In other words, unlike Mr. McCain, both Democrats say they would revoke the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. ''At a time of war and economic hardship, the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for Americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 But they would retain those reductions meant to benefit poor and ''middle-class'' families, which they defined as the 97 percent or so of the population that lives on less than $250,000 a year, and they would count the estimated $50 billion generated by higher taxes on the wealthy as new revenue. 
 ''Remember, you can only use this money once,'' said Mr. Bixby of the Concord Coalition, ''and with all the Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire, that money is already scheduled to come into the Treasury. But on the campaign trail, this has become a source of new spending.''
 Mrs. Clinton's aides have been perhaps the most specific in explaining how they would offset the costs of their proposals, and her campaign speaks of moving toward balanced budgets. ''We're not going into debt for the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans,'' Mrs. Clinton has said, ''but instead we are taking care of the needs of our people at home.''
 Regarding gas taxes, Mr. McCain has proposed a one-time ''tax holiday'' for the summer. Mrs. Clinton also calls for suspending it in a new advertisement in Indiana, while Mr. Obama says that is a ''bad idea'' but opposes any increase in the tax.
 On the spending side, Mr. Obama has argued that ending the Iraq war is one way to pay for some of the new programs, including creating a national infrastructure investment bank and increasing the foreign aid budget. But such savings, which Mrs. Clinton does not count on, would not immediately make their way into the Treasury, and some experts say it is not clear whether they would be sufficient to finance all the programs Mr. Obama has enumerated.
 Mr. Obama has talked of spending that money on a variety of initiatives whose costs amount to about one-third of the war's estimated annual cost of $150 billion. ''It is clear that there ought to be some distinction between a candidate who says a withdrawal should start immediately and a candidate who says let's maintain the war at the highest level,'' said Austan Goolsbee, Mr. Obama's senior economic adviser.
 The fiscal outlook has been made even murkier by the explicit ''no new taxes for the middle class'' pledge that both Democratic candidates made at their debate in Philadelphia this month, exempting taxpayers making $250,000 a year or less from new levies. 
 Hearing such a promise ''makes you very sad,'' said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. ''First of all, we don't have enough revenue coming in to pay our bills.'' In addition, he said, the notion that all the revenue that would be lost in a middle-class tax freeze can be made up by higher taxes on the wealthy ''is not tenable.''

 BODY:
The Ratings Game
 In 1996, Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, remarked on ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' that there were two superpowers in the world -- the United States and Moody's bond-rating service -- and it was sometimes unclear which was more powerful. Moody's was then a private company that rated corporate bonds, but it was, already, spreading its wings into the exotic business of rating securities backed by pools of residential mortgages. 
 Obscure and dry-seeming as it was, this business offered a certain magic. The magic consisted of turning risky mortgages into investments that would be suitable for investors who would know nothing about the underlying loans. To get why this is impressive, you have to think about all that determines whether a mortgage is safe. Who owns the property? What is his or her income? Bundle hundreds of mortgages into a single security and the questions multiply; no investor could begin to answer them. But suppose the security had a rating. If it were rated triple-A by a firm like Moody's, then the investor could forget about the underlying mortgages. He wouldn't need to know what properties were in the pool, only that the pool was triple-A -- it was just as safe, in theory, as other triple-A securities. 
 Over the last decade, Moody's and its two principal competitors, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, played this game to perfection -- putting what amounted to gold seals on mortgage securities that investors swept up with increasing elan. For the rating agencies, this business was extremely lucrative. Their profits surged, Moody's in particular: it went public, saw its stock increase sixfold and its earnings grow by 900 percent. 
 By providing the mortgage industry with an entree to Wall Street, the agencies also transformed what had been among the sleepiest corners of finance. No longer did mortgage banks have to wait 10 or 20 or 30 years to get their money back from homeowners. Now they sold their loans into securitized pools and -- their capital thus replenished -- wrote new loans at a much quicker pace. 
 Mortgage volume surged; in 2006, it topped $2.5 trillion. Also, many more mortgages were issued to risky subprime borrowers. Almost all of those subprime loans ended up in securitized pools; indeed, the reason banks were willing to issue so many risky loans is that they could fob them off on Wall Street. 
 But who was evaluating these securities? Who was passing judgment on the quality of the mortgages, on the equity behind them and on myriad other investment considerations? Certainly not the investors. They relied on a credit rating. 
 Thus the agencies became the de facto watchdog over the mortgage industry. In a practical sense, it was Moody's and Standard & Poor's that set the credit standards that determined which loans Wall Street could repackage and, ultimately, which borrowers would qualify. Effectively, they did the job that was expected of banks and government regulators. And today, they are a central culprit in the mortgage bust, in which the total loss has been projected at $250 billion and possibly much more. 
 In the wake of the housing collapse, Congress is exploring why the industry failed and whether it should be revamped (hearings in the Senate Banking Committee were expected to begin April 22). Two key questions are whether the credit agencies -- which benefit from a unique series of government charters -- enjoy too much official protection and whether their judgment was tainted. Presumably to forestall criticism and possible legislation, Moody's and S.&P. have announced reforms. But they reject the notion that they should have been more vigilant. Instead, they lay the blame on the mortgage holders who turned out to be deadbeats, many of whom lied to obtain their loans.
 Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, charges that ''the credit-rating agencies suffer from a conflict of interest -- perceived and apparent -- that may have distorted their judgment, especially when it came to complex structured financial products.'' Frank Partnoy, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law who has written extensively about the credit-rating industry, says that the conflict is a serious problem. Thanks to the industry's close relationship with the banks whose securities it rates, Partnoy says, the agencies have behaved less like gatekeepers than gate openers. Last year, Moody's had to downgrade more than 5,000 mortgage securities -- a tacit acknowledgment that the mortgage bubble was abetted by its overly generous ratings. Mortgage securities rated by Standard & Poor's and Fitch have suffered a similar wave of downgrades. 
 Presto! How 2,393 Subprime Loans Become a High-Grade Investment 
 The business of assigning a rating to a mortgage security is a complicated affair, and Moody's recently was willing to walk me through an actual mortgage-backed security step by step. I was led down a carpeted hallway to a well-appointed conference room to meet with three specialists in mortgage-backed paper. Moody's was fair-minded in choosing an example; the case they showed me, which they masked with the name ''Subprime XYZ,'' was a pool of 2,393 mortgages with a total face value of $430 million. 
 Subprime XYZ typified the exuberance of the age. All the mortgages in the pool were subprime -- that is, they had been extended to borrowers with checkered credit histories. In an earlier era, such people would have been restricted from borrowing more than 75 percent or so of the value of their homes, but during the great bubble, no such limits applied. 
 Moody's did not have access to the individual loan files, much less did it communicate with the borrowers or try to verify the information they provided in their loan applications. ''We aren't loan officers,'' Claire Robinson, a 20-year veteran who is in charge of asset-backed finance for Moody's, told me. ''Our expertise is as statisticians on an aggregate basis. We want to know, of 1,000 individuals, based on historical performance, what percent will pay their loans?''
 The loans in Subprime XYZ were issued in early spring 2006 -- what would turn out to be the peak of the boom. They were originated by a West Coast company that Moody's identified as a ''nonbank lender.'' Traditionally, people have gotten their mortgages from banks, but in recent years, new types of lenders peddling sexier products grabbed an increasing share of the market. This particular lender took the loans it made to a New York investment bank; the bank designed an investment vehicle and brought the package to Moody's. 
 Moody's assigned an analyst to evaluate the package, subject to review by a committee. The investment bank provided an enormous spreadsheet chock with data on the borrowers' credit histories and much else that might, at very least, have given Moody's pause. Three-quarters of the borrowers had adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs -- ''teaser'' loans on which the interest rate could be raised in short order. Since subprime borrowers cannot afford higher rates, they would need to refinance soon. This is a classic sign of a bubble -- lending on the belief, or the hope, that new money will bail out the old. 
 Moody's learned that almost half of these borrowers -- 43 percent -- did not provide written verification of their incomes. The data also showed that 12 percent of the mortgages were for properties in Southern California, including a half-percent in a single ZIP code, in Riverside. That suggested a risky degree of concentration. 
 On the plus side, Moody's noted, 94 percent of those borrowers with adjustable-rate loans said their mortgages were for primary residences. ''That was a comfort feeling,'' Robinson said. Historically, people have been slow to abandon their primary homes. When you get into a crunch, she added, ''You'll give up your ski chalet first.''
 Another factor giving Moody's comfort was that all of the ARM loans in the pool were first mortgages (as distinct from, say, home-equity loans). Nearly half of the borrowers, however, took out a simultaneous second loan. Most often, their two loans added up to all of their property's presumed resale value, which meant the borrowers had not a cent of equity.
 In the frenetic, deal-happy climate of 2006, the Moody's analyst had only a single day to process the credit data from the bank. The analyst wasn't evaluating the mortgages but, rather, the bonds issued by the investment vehicle created to house them. A so-called special-purpose vehicle -- a ghost corporation with no people or furniture and no assets either until the deal was struck -- would purchase the mortgages. Thereafter, monthly payments from the homeowners would go to the S.P.V. The S.P.V. would finance itself by selling bonds. The question for Moody's was whether the inflow of mortgage checks would cover the outgoing payments to bondholders. From the investment bank's point of view, the key to the deal was obtaining a triple-A rating -- without which the deal wouldn't be profitable. That a vehicle backed by subprime mortgages could borrow at triple-A rates seems like a trick of finance. ''People say, 'How can you create triple-A out of B-rated paper?' '' notes Arturo Cifuentes, a former Moody's credit analyst who now designs credit instruments. It may seem like a scam, but it's not. 
 The secret sauce is that the S.P.V. would float 12 classes of bonds, from triple-A to a lowly Ba1. The highest-rated bonds would have first priority on the cash received from mortgage holders until they were fully paid, then the next tier of bonds, then the next and so on. The bonds at the bottom of the pile got the highest interest rate, but if homeowners defaulted, they would absorb the first losses. 
 It was this segregation of payments that protected the bonds at the top of the structure and enabled Moody's to classify them as triple-A. Imagine a seaside condo beset by flooding: just as the penthouse will not get wet until the lower floors are thoroughly soaked, so the triple-A bonds would not lose a dime unless the lower credits were wiped out. 
 Structured finance, of which this deal is typical, is both clever and useful; in the housing industry it has greatly expanded the pool of credit. But in extreme conditions, it can fail. The old-fashioned corner banker used his instincts, as well as his pencil, to apportion credit; modern finance is formulaic. However elegant its models, forecasting the behavior of 2,393 mortgage holders is an uncertain business. ''Everyone assumed the credit agencies knew what they were doing,'' says Joseph Mason, a credit expert at Drexel University. ''A structural engineer can predict what load a steel support will bear; in financial engineering we can't predict as well.'' 
 Mortgage-backed securities like those in Subprime XYZ were not the terminus of the great mortgage machine. They were, in fact, building blocks for even more esoteric vehicles known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. C.D.O.'s were financed with similar ladders of bonds, from triple-A on down, and the credit-rating agencies' role was just as central. The difference is that XYZ was a first-order derivative -- its assets included real mortgages owned by actual homeowners. C.D.O.'s were a step removed -- instead of buying mortgages, they bought bonds that were backed by mortgages, like the bonds issued by Subprime XYZ. (It is painful to consider, but there were also third-order instruments, known as C.D.O.'s squared, which bought bonds issued by other C.D.O.'s.) 
 Miscalculations that were damaging at the level of Subprime XYZ were devastating at the C.D.O. level. Just as bad weather will cause more serious delays to travelers with multiple flights, so, if the underlying mortgage bonds were misrated, the trouble was compounded in the case of the C.D.O.'s that purchased them. 
 Moody's used statistical models to assess C.D.O.'s; it relied on historical patterns of default. This assumed that the past would remain relevant in an era in which the mortgage industry was morphing into a wildly speculative business. The complexity of C.D.O.'s undermined the process as well. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which recently scooped up the mortally wounded Bear Stearns, says, ''There was a large failure of common sense'' by rating agencies and also by banks like his. ''Very complex securities shouldn't have been rated as if they were easy-to-value bonds.''
 The Accidental Watchdog
 John Moody, a Wall Street analyst and former errand runner, hit on the idea of synthesizing all kinds of credit information into a single rating in 1909, when he published the manual ''Moody's Analyses of Railroad Investments.'' The idea caught on with investors, who subscribed to his service, and by the mid-'20s, Moody's faced three competitors: Standard Statistics and Poor's Publishing (which later merged) and Fitch. 
 Then as now, Moody's graded bonds on a scale with 21 steps, from Aaa to C. (There are small differences in the agencies' nomenclatures, just as a grande latte at Starbucks becomes a ''medium'' at Peet's. At Moody's, ratings that start with the letter ''A'' carry minimal to low credit risk; those starting with ''B'' carry moderate to high risk; and ''C'' ratings denote bonds in poor standing or actual default.) The ratings are meant to be an estimate of probabilities, not a buy or sell recommendation. For instance, Ba bonds default far more often than triple-As. But Moody's, as it is wont to remind people, is not in the business of advising investors whether to buy Ba's; it merely publishes a rating. 
 Until the 1970s, its business grew slowly. But several trends coalesced to speed it up. The first was the collapse of Penn Central in 1970 -- a shattering event that the credit agencies failed to foresee. It so unnerved investors that they began to pay more attention to credit risk. 
 Government responded. The Securities and Exchange Commission, faced with the question of how to measure the capital of broker-dealers, decided to penalize brokers for holding bonds that were less than investment-grade (the term applies to Moody's 10 top grades). This prompted a question: investment grade according to whom? The S.E.C. opted to create a new category of officially designated rating agencies, and grandfathered the big three -- S.&P., Moody's and Fitch. In effect, the government outsourced its regulatory function to three for-profit companies.
 Bank regulators issued similar rules for banks. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance regulators followed. Over the '80s and '90s, a latticework of such rules redefined credit markets. Many classes of investors were now forbidden to buy noninvestment-grade bonds at all. 
 Issuers thus were forced to seek credit ratings (or else their bonds would not be marketable). The agencies -- realizing they had a hot product and, what's more, a captive market -- started charging the very organizations whose bonds they were rating. This was an efficient way to do business, but it put the agencies in a conflicted position. As Partnoy says, rather than selling opinions to investors, the rating agencies were now selling ''licenses'' to borrowers. Indeed, whether their opinions were accurate no longer mattered so much. Just as a police officer stopping a motorist will want to see his license but not inquire how well he did on his road test, it was the rating -- not its accuracy -- that mattered to Wall Street. 
 The case of Enron is illustrative. Throughout the summer and fall of 2001, even though its credit was rapidly deteriorating, the rating agencies kept it at investment grade. This was not unusual; the agencies typically lag behind the news. On Nov. 28, 2001, S.&P. finally dropped Enron's bonds to subinvestment grade. Although its action merely validated the market consensus, it caused the stock to collapse. To investors, S.&P.'s action was a signal that Enron was locked out of credit markets; it had lost its ''license'' to borrow. Four days later it filed for bankruptcy. 
 Another trend that spurred the agencies' growth was that more companies began borrowing in bond markets instead of from banks. According to Chris Mahoney, a just-retired Moody's veteran of 22 years, ''The agencies went from being obscure and unimportant players to central ones.'' 
 A Conflict of Interest?
 Nothing sent the agencies into high gear as much as the development of structured finance. As Wall Street bankers designed ever more securitized products -- using mortgages, credit-card debt, car loans, corporate debt, every type of paper imaginable -- the agencies became truly powerful. 
 In structured-credit vehicles like Subprime XYZ, the agencies played a much more pivotal role than they had with (conventional) bonds. According to Lewis Ranieri, the Salomon Brothers banker who was a pioneer in mortgage bonds, ''The whole creation of mortgage securities was involved with a rating.''
 What the bankers in these deals are really doing is buying a bunch of I.O.U.'s and repackaging them in a different form. Something has to make the package worth -- or seem to be worth -- more that the sum of its parts, otherwise there would be no point in packaging such securities, nor would there be any profits from which to pay the bankers' fees. 
 That something is the rating. Credit markets are not continuous; a bond that qualifies, though only by a hair, as investment grade is worth a lot more than one that just fails. As with a would-be immigrant traveling from Mexico, there is a huge incentive to get over the line. 
 The challenge to investment banks is to design securities that just meet the rating agencies' tests. Risky mortgages serve their purpose; since the interest rate on them is higher, more money comes into the pool and is available for paying bond interest. But if the mortgages are too risky, Moody's will object. Banks are adroit at working the system, and pools like Subprime XYZ are intentionally designed to include a layer of Baa bonds, or those just over the border. ''Every agency has a model available to bankers that allows them to run the numbers until they get something they like and send it in for a rating,'' a former Moody's expert in securitization says. In other words, banks were gaming the system; according to Chris Flanagan, the subprime analyst at JPMorgan, ''Gaming is the whole thing.'' 
 When a bank proposes a rating structure on a pool of debt, the rating agency will insist on a cushion of extra capital, known as an ''enhancement.'' The bank inevitably lobbies for a thin cushion (the thinner the capitalization, the fatter the bank's profits). It's up to the agency to make sure that the cushion is big enough to safeguard the bonds. The process involves extended consultations between the agency and its client. In short, obtaining a rating is a collaborative process. 
 The evidence on whether rating agencies bend to the bankers' will is mixed. The agencies do not deny that a conflict exists, but they assert that they are keen to the dangers and minimize them. For instance, they do not reward analysts on the basis of whether they approve deals. No smoking gun, no conspiratorial e-mail message, has surfaced to suggest that they are lying. But in structured finance, the agencies face pressures that did not exist when John Moody was rating railroads. On the traditional side of the business, Moody's has thousands of clients (virtually every corporation and municipality that sells bonds). No one of them has much clout. But in structured finance, a handful of banks return again and again, paying much bigger fees. A deal the size of XYZ can bring Moody's $200,000 and more for complicated deals. And the banks pay only if Moody's delivers the desired rating. Tom McGuire, the Jesuit theologian who ran Moody's through the mid-'90s, says this arrangement is unhealthy. If Moody's and a client bank don't see eye to eye, the bank can either tweak the numbers or try its luck with a competitor like S.&P., a process known as ''ratings shopping.'' 
 And it seems to have helped the banks get better ratings. Mason, of Drexel University, compared default rates for corporate bonds rated Baa with those of similarly rated collateralized debt obligations until 2005 (before the bubble burst). Mason found that the C.D.O.'s defaulted eight times as often. One interpretation of the data is that Moody's was far less discerning when the client was a Wall Street securitizer. 
 After Enron blew up, Congress ordered the S.E.C. to look at the rating industry and possibly reform it. The S.E.C. ducked. Congress looked again in 2006 and enacted a law making it easier for competing agencies to gain official recognition, but didn't change the industry's business model. By then, the mortgage boom was in high gear. From 2002 to 2006, Moody's profits nearly tripled, mostly thanks to the high margins the agencies charged in structured finance. In 2006, Moody's reported net income of $750 million. Raymond W. McDaniel Jr., its chief executive, gloated in the annual report for that year, ''I firmly believe that Moody's business stands on the 'right side of history' in terms of the alignment of our role and function with advancements in global capital markets.'' 
 Using Weather in Antarctica To Forecast Conditions in Hawaii 
 Even as McDaniel was crowing, it was clear in some corners of Wall Street that the mortgage market was headed for trouble. The housing industry was cooling off fast. James Kragenbring, a money manager with Advantus Capital Management, complained to the agencies as early as 2005 that their ratings were too generous. A report from the hedge fund of John Paulson proclaimed astonishment at ''the mispricing of these securities.'' He started betting that mortgage debt would crash.
 Even Mark Zandi, the very visible economist at Moody's forecasting division (which is separate from the ratings side), was worried about the chilling crosswinds blowing in credit markets. In a report published in May 2006, he noted that consumer borrowing had soared, household debt was at a record and a fifth of such debt was classified as subprime. At the same time, loan officers were loosening underwriting standards and easing rates to offer still more loans. Zandi fretted about the ''razor-thin'' level of homeowners' equity, the avalanche of teaser mortgages and the $750 billion of mortgages he judged to be at risk. Zandi concluded, ''The environment feels increasingly ripe for some type of financial event.''
 A month after Zandi's report, Moody's rated Subprime XYZ. The analyst on the deal also had concerns. Moody's was aware that mortgage standards had been deteriorating, and it had been demanding more of a cushion in such pools. Nonetheless, its credit-rating model continued to envision rising home values. Largely for that reason, the analyst forecast losses for XYZ at only 4.9 percent of the underlying mortgage pool. Since even the lowest-rated bonds in XYZ would be covered up to a loss level of 7.25 percent, the bonds seemed safe. 
 XYZ now became the responsibility of a Moody's team that monitors securities and changes the ratings if need be (the analyst moved on to rate a new deal). Almost immediately, the team noticed a problem. Usually, people who finance a home stay current on their payments for at least a while. But a sliver of folks in XYZfell behind within 90 days of signing their papers. After six months, an alarming 6 percent of the mortgages were seriously delinquent. (Historically, it is rare for more than 1 percent of mortgages at that stage to be delinquent.) 
 Moody's monitors began to make inquiries with the lender and were shocked by what they heard. Some properties lacked sod or landscaping, and keys remained in the mailbox; the buyers had never moved in. The implication was that people had bought homes on spec: as the housing market turned, the buyers walked.
 By the spring of 2007, 13 percent of Subprime XYZ was delinquent -- and it was worsening by the month. XYZ was hardly atypical; the entire class of 2006 was performing terribly. (The class of 2007 would turn out to be even worse.) 
 In April 2007, Moody's announced it was revising the model it used to evaluate subprime mortgages. It noted that the model ''was first introduced in 2002. Since then, the mortgage market has evolved considerably.'' This was a rather stunning admission; its model had been based on a world that no longer existed. 
 Poring over the data, Moody's discovered that the size of people's first mortgages was no longer a good predictor of whether they would default; rather, it was the size of their first and second loans -- that is, their total debt -- combined. This was rather intuitive; Moody's simply hadn't reckoned on it. Similarly, credit scores, long a mainstay of its analyses, had not proved to be a ''strong predictor'' of defaults this time. Translation: even people with good credit scores were defaulting. Amy Tobey, leader of the team that monitored XYZ, told me, ''It seems there was a shift in mentality; people are treating homes as investment assets.'' Indeed. And homeowners without equity were making what economists call a rational choice; they were abandoning properties rather than make payments on them. Homeowners' equity had never been as high as believed because appraisals had been inflated. 
 Over the summer and fall of 2007, Moody's and the other agencies repeatedly tightened their methodology for rating mortgage securities, but it was too late. They had to downgrade tens of billions of dollars of securities. By early this year, when I met with Moody's, an astonishing 27 percent of the mortgage holders in Subprime XYZ were delinquent. Losses on the pool were now estimated at 14 percent to 16 percent -- three times the original estimate. Seemingly high-quality bonds rated A3 by Moody's had been downgraded five notches to Ba2, as had the other bonds in the pool aside from its triple-A's. 
 The pain didn't stop there. Many of the lower-rated bonds issued by XYZ, and by mortgage pools like it, were purchased by C.D.O.'s, the second-order mortgage vehicles, which were eager to buy lower-rated mortgage paper because it paid a higher yield. As the agencies endowed C.D.O. securities with triple-A ratings, demand for them was red hot. Much of it was from global investors who knew nothing about the U.S. mortgage market. In 2006 and 2007, the banks created more than $200 billion of C.D.O.'s backed by lower-rated mortgage paper. Moody's assigned a different team to rate C.D.O.'s. This team knew far less about the underlying mortgages than did the committee that evaluated Subprime XYZ. In fact, Moody's rated C.D.O.'s without knowing which bonds the pool would buy.
 A C.D.O. operates like a mutual fund; it can buy or sell mortgage bonds and frequently does so. Thus, the agencies rate pools with assets that are perpetually shifting. They base their ratings on an extensive set of guidelines or covenants that limit the C.D.O. manager's discretion. 
 Late in 2006, Moody's rated a C.D.O. with $750 million worth of securities. The covenants, which act as a template, restricted the C.D.O. to, at most, an 80 percent exposure to subprime assets, and many other such conditions. ''We're structure experts,'' Yuri Yoshizawa, the head of Moody's' derivative group, explained. ''We're not underlying-asset experts.'' They were checking the math, not the mortgages. But no C.D.O. can be better than its collateral. 
 Moody's rated three-quarters of this C.D.O.'s bonds triple-A. The ratings were derived using a mathematical construct known as a Monte Carlo simulation -- as if each of the underlying bonds would perform like cards drawn at random from a deck of mortgage bonds in the past. There were two problems with this approach. First, the bonds weren't like those in the past; the mortgage market had changed. As Mark Adelson, a former managing director in Moody's structured-finance division, remarks, it was ''like observing 100 years of weather in Antarctica to forecast the weather in Hawaii.'' And second, the bonds weren't random. Moody's had underestimated the extent to which underwriting standards had weakened everywhere. When one mortgage bond failed, the odds were that others would, too. 
 Moody's estimated that this C.D.O. could potentially incur losses of 2 percent. It has since revised its estimate to 27 percent. The bonds it rated have been decimated, their market value having plunged by half or more. A triple-A layer of bonds has been downgraded 16 notches, all the way to B. Hundreds of C.D.O.'s have suffered similar fates (most of Wall Street's losses have been on C.D.O.'s). For Moody's and the other rating agencies, it has been an extraordinary rout. 
 Whom Can We Rely On?
 The agencies have blamed the large incidence of fraud, but then they could have demanded verification of the mortgage data or refused to rate securities where the data were not provided. That was, after all, their mandate. This is what they pledge for the future. Moody's, S.&P. and Fitch say that they are tightening procedures -- they will demand more data and more verification and will subject their analysts to more outside checks. None of this, however, will remove the conflict of interest in the issuer-pays model. Though some have proposed requiring that agencies with official recognition charge investors, rather than issuers, a more practical reform may be for the government to stop certifying agencies altogether.
 Then, if the Fed or other regulators wanted to restrict what sorts of bonds could be owned by banks, or by pension funds or by anyone else in need of protection, they would have to do it themselves -- not farm the job out to Moody's. The ratings agencies would still exist, but stripped of their official imprimatur, their ratings would lose a little of their aura, and investors might trust in them a bit less. Moody's itself favors doing away with the official designation, and it, like S.&P., embraces the idea that investors should not ''rely'' on ratings for buy-and-sell decisions.
 This leaves an awkward question, with respect to insanely complex structured securities: What can they rely on? The agencies seem utterly too involved to serve as a neutral arbiter, and the banks are sure to invent new and equally hard-to-assess vehicles in the future. Vickie Tillman, the executive vice president of S.&P., told Congress last fall that in addition to the housing slump, ''ahistorical behavorial modes'' by homeowners were to blame for the wave of downgrades. She cited S.&P.'s data going back to the 1970s, as if consumers were at fault for not living up to the past. The real problem is that the agencies' mathematical formulas look backward while life is lived forward. That is unlikely to change.

HEADLINE: How to Show a Dictator the Door

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
ZIMBABWE'S political crisis lurched on last week as President Robert Mugabe, the strongman who has ruled the California-size country in southern Africa for the past 28 years, refused to release the results of the March 29 elections. In old-fashioned autocratic style, the government's police began to round up opposition supporters.
 The world is losing patience, but Mr. Mugabe is only the latest example of dictators in Africa and elsewhere -- some more bloodthirsty than others -- who have overstayed their welcome, and whom the West have tried to winkle out of power.
 What lessons can be learned from past attempts to oust seemingly immovable oppressors? Do the lessons apply in the case of Zimbabwe? What are the options for dealing with Mr. Mugabe? 
 PAY OFF AND EXILE
 This strategy has worked, sort of, before.
 In 1997, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, now Congo, the very model of an African dictator dirty with corruption as his country collapsed around him, was promised safe passage by his former ally, the United States, and flew to Morocco. (He died of prostate cancer in exile soon after.)
 In July 2003, leaders of the African Union bribed Charles Taylor -- a murderous warlord with folllowers who would hack off the hands or feet of civilians -- to leave Liberia for an early retirement in Nigeria. In similar fashion, the United States got Ferdinand Marcos to quit the Philippines by allowing him refuge in a Hawaiian villa.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who as ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton helped ease Mr. Mobuto from Zaire, said he believed the same strategy could be used with Mr. Mugabe.
 ''Maybe if he is offered safe passage we will rid ourselves of this despot,'' he said.
 Yet Congo and Liberia are hardly good examples. Congo has tipped further into chaos since Mr. Mobuto left. And, despite promises, Nigeria returned Mr. Taylor to Liberia, which handed him over to an international tribunal to face charges of war crimes in Sierra Leone. That sequence of events may make autocrats like Mr. Mugabe think twice before they head for the airport.
 SANCTIONS AND ISOLATION
 A popular response to noxious regimes (think Castro or early Saddam). But they only work if the sanctions hurt.
 ''The greater the ties to the West, the greater the degree to which the elite is educated in the West and has career prospects in the West, then the greater the likelihood the coalition behind a regime will crack,'' said Steven Levitsky, professor of government at Harvard University, who has studied conditions under which autocracies crumble. (Another condition is a weak internal security apparatus with little stomach for a long fight against its people -- hardly a description of Mr. Mugabe's battle-hardened forces, which came of age in a guerrilla liberation war.)
 Unfortunately, it's not clear what extra pain sanctions could exact on Zimbabwe, where 8 out of 10 people are unemployed and the annual inflation rate is more than 100,000 percent.
 MILITARY INTERVENTION
 In 1979, armies from Tanzania invaded Uganda and chased out Mr. Amin, a tyrant said to have sanctioned the murder of close to 300,000.
 Yet regime change is perilous, as the United States discovered following its toppling of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
 In Uganda, the man who replaced Idi Amin -- Milton Obote -- was arguably worse. Mr. Obote may have murdered more Ugandans even than his predecessor.
 ''Intervention is always very difficult in Africa,'' said Michael Holman, former Africa editor of The Financial Times. ''If you don't have a well-drilled army and decent civil service to fill the gap that threw up the problem in the first place then you are going to have a disaster on your hands.''
 POPULAR UPRISING
 In 1998, President Suharto of Indonesia was forced to end his brutal and corrupt tenure after an economic meltdown, nationwide rioting and the withdrawal of government and military support. (He went into internal exile in a modest house in Jakarta, the capital, until his death earlier this year.)
 One hope among Zimbabwe watchers is that the moderates in Mr. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party turn against him, dissent breaks out in the military, or ordinary Zimbabweans finally take to the street.
 Earlier this year, in the election crisis in Kenya, opposition supporters streamed from Nairobi's slums to challenge President Mwai Kibaki's declaration of victory in a flawed vote, until he was finally persuaded to share power with the opposition leader Raila Odinga.
 But that may be too much to expect from embattled Zimbabweans. ''In Zimbabwe, extreme poverty has bred utter lethargy,'' said Michela Wrong, author of ''In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz,'' about Congo, and who is writing a book about the Kenyan crisis.
 Indeed, a nationwide strike called by Zimbabwe's chief opposition party earlier this month fizzled quickly as people went about their normal routines, and the party's leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, isn't even in the country, suggesting he may not be prepared to fight or be imprisoned again. 
 TALK TO HIM
 Wary of intervening in a continent where some Africans still perceive Mr. Mugabe as a liberation hero in the struggle against colonialism, the United States and the West have largely left the job of negotiating with him to South Africa, Zimbabwe's big neighbor and regional power.
 Some critics think South Africa has not been sufficiently muscular with Mr. Mugabe but President Thabo Mbeki says that his ''quiet diplomacy'' has won results: the elections went ahead in the first place, and the government agreed to post the outcome of each count on the outside of local ballot stations, though the government has withheld the overall results.
 Mark Ashurst, director of the Africa Research Institute in London, said that South Africa also subtly promoted an alternative candidate, Simba Makoni, a breakaway member of Mr. Mugabe's party, but that this effort failed after Mr. Makoni won too few votes.
 Gugulethu Moyo, a Zimbabwean lawyer who works for the International Bar Association in London, said it was time for the outside world to go beyond hand-wringing and critical statements. Instead, she said, the United Nations should be sent to scrutinize the actions of the security forces and monitor any future elections.
 One idea is for Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, to be dispatched to broker an agreement just as he negotiated the Kenyan deal.
 Maybe he could persuade Mr. Mugabe to stay for now but to agree to step down in two years and hold new elections -- a sort of ''government of national unity'' trial balloon that was floated by Zimbabwe's state-run newspaper, The Herald, this week.
 But will Mr. Mugabe take Mr. Annan's call? Some think not.
 Heidi Holland, author of ''Dinner With Mugabe: The Untold Story of a Freedom Fighter Who Became a Tyrant,'' argues that the only power he will speak to now is Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial master under whose rule he spent half his life.
 Ms. Holland, who first met Mr. Mugabe in 1975 and interviewed him again last year, said he was a remote, emotionally immature, dogged, bookish man who is obsessed with Britain as a kind of parental figure. She said he felt humiliated because, in his view, Britain reneged on financial commitments he believed were made at the time of independence in 1980.
 For her, the way out of this mess may be more psychological.
 ''Revenge is a key word for Mugabe,'' she says. ''He says, I don't have a quarrel with the United States, or the United Nations. He wants Britain to come to him and say: 'O.K. We will now talk.' All he wants is recognition.''

HEADLINE: Inequalities

BYLINE: By LARRY M. BARTELS. 
Larry M. Bartels, a professor of politics at Princeton, is the author of ''Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age.''

 BODY:
The past three decades have seen a momentous shift: The rich became vastly richer while working-class wages stagnated. Economists say 80 percent of net income gains since 1980 went to people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, boosting their share of total income to levels unseen since before the Great Depression.
 Despite the historic magnitude of this shift, inequality has thus far had little traction as a political issue. Many Americans seem to accept the conservative view that escalating inequality reflects ''free market'' forces immune to amelioration through public policy. As Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson put it, perhaps a bit defensively, the growing income gap ''is simply an economic reality, and it is neither fair nor useful to blame any political party.'' Paulson's assertion, however, is strongly contradicted by the historical record. While technology, demographic trends and globalization are clearly important, purely economic accounts ignore what may be the most important influence on changing U.S. income distribution -- the contrasting policy choices of Republican and Democratic presidents. 
 The Census Bureau has tracked the economic fortunes of affluent, middle-class and poor American families for six decades. According to my analysis, these tabulations reveal a wide partisan disparity in income growth. The real incomes of middle-class families grew more than twice as fast under Democratic presidents as they did under Republican presidents. Even more remarkable, the real incomes of working-poor families (at the 20th percentile of the income distribution) grew six times as fast when Democrats held the White House. Only the incomes of affluent families were relatively impervious to partisan politics, growing robustly under Democrats and Republicans alike.
 The cumulative effect of these partisan differences is enormous. If the pattern of income growth under postwar Republican presidents had matched the pattern under Democrats, incomes would be more equal now than they were in 1950 -- a far cry from the contemporary reality of what some observers are calling a New Gilded Age. 
 It might be tempting to suppose that these partisan differences in income growth are a coincidence of timing, merely reflecting the fact that Republicans held the White House through most of the past three decades of slow, unequal growth. The partisan pattern, however, is remarkably consistent throughout the postwar period. Every Republican president since Dwight Eisenhower presided over increasing economic inequality, while only one Democrat -- Jimmy Carter -- did so. (I allow one year for each president's economic policies to take effect, so the recession of 2001 is counted against Clinton, not Bush.) 
 If middle-class and poor people do so much better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, why do so many of them vote for Republicans? One popular answer, advanced by Thomas Frank and others, is that they are alienated by Democratic liberalism on cultural issues like abortion, gay marriage and gender roles. This does not appear to be the case. In recent presidential elections, affluent voters, who tend to be liberal on cultural matters, are about twice as likely as middle-class and poor voters to make their decisions on the basis of their cultural concerns.
 A better explanation for Republican electoral successes may be that while most voters, rich and poor alike, do vote with their economic interests in mind, they construe those interests in a curiously myopic way. Their choices at the polls are strongly influenced by election-year income growth but only weakly related to economic performance earlier in the president's term. And while Republicans have presided over dismal income growth for middle-class and poor families in most years, they have, remarkably enough, produced robust growth in election years. 
 Why have Republican administrations typically presided over strong election-year growth? The pattern probably reflects the fact that presidents have more clout early in their terms than at election time. Republicans have often used that clout to rein in inflation and social spending, producing or prolonging economic contractions that then wear off by the time of the next election. New or newly re-elected Democrats, for their part, have frequently stimulated the economy and expanded employment, producing economic booms that raise all boats in their second and third years but trail off as the next election approaches. As a result, even working-poor families have experienced stronger income growth under Republicans (1.8 percent) than under Democrats (1 percent) in election years. 
 This year looks unusual in this respect, with slow growth likely despite the infusion of substantial tax rebates from an election-year stimulus plan. If that slow growth produces a Republican defeat in November, it will be a rare instance of economic accountability for a party with a long history of delivering meager income gains for most American families.

THE MAN WHO PUSHED AMERICA TO WAR 
 The Extraordinary Life, Adventures, and Obsessions of Ahmad Chalabi. 
 By Aram Roston. 
 369 pp. Nation Books. $27.50. 
 There's never been anyone like Ahmad Chalabi in American history, never a foreigner without official status so crucially involved in a decision by the United States to go to war. Of course, Winston Churchill helped engineer America's entry into World War II, but he was, after all, prime minister of the United Kingdom. And Chalabi -- a University of Chicago Ph.D. in mathematics, wealthy banker forever going bankrupt, and creator and sole proprietor of a Potemkin Iraqi freedom front financed entirely by United States taxpayers -- is no Winston Churchill. 
 In many ways, Chalabi resembles William Randolph Hearst, a master at ramping up Spain as a mortal threat to America at the end of the 19th century. Hearst's power, however, exploded from the barrel of his ubiquitous newspapers, while Chalabi had only his own wits. 
 With those wits, this improbable chunky, merry-eyed dynamo tirelessly connived and schemed on behalf of two dreams: for American military might to drive Saddam Hussein from power and to install himself in the dictator's place. His Washington allies needed little motivation to oust Hussein; Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and many others already regarded him as Public Enemy No. 1. But they welcomed Chalabi's ammunition, his ''information,'' in the fight against war skeptics -- though they didn't welcome him enough to implant him as Baghdad's new boss. 
 This general story line is familiar, and Chalabi has earned a lot of ink in recent books. But more is needed. His successes should occasion great soul-searching among Americans interested in how and why we decide to fight and die and spend our national treasure. Chalabi, an occasional resident in our country whom I've been acquainted with for almost 20 years, knew us well and played us like the proverbial violin. 
 In ''The Man Who Pushed America to War,'' Aram Roston, a television reporter and producer, tells about every Chalabi machination in 53 staccato chapters -- beginning with his childhood. Only rarely does he slip into analysis or commentary, as when he invites readers to imagine Chalabi as an amalgam of Don Quixote, Captain Ahab and Elmer Gantry.
 The Don Quixote analogy eludes me. Chalabi never tilted at windmills; his lance pointed unerringly at Hussein's heart. He did pursue that brutal dictator with all the ferocity and single-mindedness of an Ahab. Unfortunately for us, his vessel for the chase was not the Pequod, but the United States. And Chalabi manipulated our dreams with all the intuitive force Elmer Gantry conjured up to woo the souls of Middle Americans. 
 Roston bases his account on interviews with Chalabi's family, friends, intimates and enemies, and on a range of books and articles. Chalabi did not give Roston an interview. The overall result is a book with some new details on key events, but no headlines. Its main contribution is to consolidate all the Chalabi anecdotes into one coherent and fair-minded account. Roston does very little speculating or searching for larger meanings, but he provides a solid foundation to analyze what this brilliant, charming rogue led us to do to ourselves. 
 In at least one sense, Chalabi is as American as a Washington apple pie. He courted and accumulated power players through a wicked sense of humor and a collection of indiscreet tales featuring human foibles, all conveyed with the bite and delight of a Mark Twain. His conversation is irresistible. His mind can open vistas previously unseen by the more conventional denizens of our capital city.
 Roston's narrative shows that the United States, revealingly, was the country of Chalabi's greatest success by far. He never made anywhere near as big a splash in England, where he lived for years. And while his personal and political circles in Iraq incredibly span every religion, culture and ideology, he never rose to the top of political power there. Europeans and Middle Easterners had a feel for Chalabi that Americans lacked, a better sense of a man who always skated close to the edge in business and politics, close to danger.
 Chalabi grasped our strengths -- our ideals, our open political system and our self-confidence (or hubris) -- and he knew how to flip these strengths into vulnerabilities. Roston relates how Chalabi unfurled the banners of freedom and democracy because he knew well that few Americans would dare argue against bringing these blessings to the oppressed. He also knew that many Americans, including a great number in the Washington crowd, didn't see the difference between the readiness for democracy of a postwar Japan and Germany or of a South Korea -- all free from internal warfare and with a good economic base -- and a country like Iraq, which had experienced only tyranny.
 At the same time, he saw that Americans were terribly impressed with apparent facts. He offered up many, most notably the fable of Hussein's biological weapons labs. He noticed that no matter how many times false assertions were exposed, politicians and pundits never stopped purveying them. He observed that the news media might correct misinformation once, but after that didn't consider the correction to be news and simply regurgitated garbage ad nauseam. 
 Chalabi saw beyond the research institutes and policy makers in Washington's national security power structure. He spent little time on liberals, whose influence on foreign affairs is by and large limited to Democratic Party presidential primaries. If he needed a Democratic senator, and he always did, he went to hard heads like Bob Kerrey of Nebraska or Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. He devoted most of his time to Republican conservatives like Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, to influential journalists and, above all, to neoconservatives like Richard Perle. They were the ones who had mastered the art of public debate, of skywriting threats and diminishing opponents as wimps. Accordingly, they commanded the most attention from reporters, Congress and Washington whisperers of ''what was really going on.''
 Roston deals especially well with the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which committed the United States to overthrowing Hussein. It was bipartisan and embraced by the Clinton administration. Chalabi pushed bipartisanship hard, understanding that liberal foreign-policy types (who no longer referred to themselves as liberals) never wanted to be out-Saddamed by the conservatives. 
 Chalabi did what he did for personal and patriotic reasons. And who is to say that from the point of view of an Iraqi, he was not justified in using whatever means, fair or foul, were available to remove the beast of Baghdad? The problem -- and it is an immense one -- is not that Chalabi did what he thought was necessary; it is that we fell for it all without serious examination, without Congress or the administration looking into what we would do the day after victory, without anyone in the White House ever asking what the effects would be on Islamic terrorism or the regional influence of Iran. 
 The problem is not that Chalabi was so smart, but that we were so careless and so vulnerable to manipulation. As Roston thoroughly demonstrates, Chalabi understood us better than we understood ourselves.h

HEADLINE: Where Was The Wise Man?

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
EVERY month or so, Citigroup invites a select group of clients to dine with a singular and very special host: Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who, for the last nine years, has been the banking giant's self-described consigliere. 
 These discreet affairs are held in the executive dining room of Citigroup's Park Avenue headquarters, but it's a movable feast. Mr. Rubin has presided at similar soirees overseas and in the bank's Lower Manhattan offices, where luminaries like Bill Clinton and Alan Greenspan have joined him to discuss the global economy.
 ''With Bill, I was a little bit like an unskilled Larry King,'' Mr. Rubin says. ''It's less of a conversation with him than with Alan.''
 That kind of self-deprecating observation is vintage Rubin, and it plays down his own substantial celebrity as a corporate and political wise man. When a Who's Who of South Korean government officials, business leaders and clients gathered last September in Seoul to hear Mr. Rubin speak, they greeted him as though he were a rock star. 
 ''There was a reception before the big event, and people just wanted to shake his hand or get a photo with him,'' says Michael Schlein, who, as head of international franchise management for Citigroup, attended the meeting.
 Mr. Rubin is still regarded with affection in South Korea because of the pivotal role he played in helping the country survive the Asian economic crisis a decade ago. But now, closer to home, another financial crisis is creating a very different type of notoriety for Mr. Rubin. The housing and credit mess here has cost Citigroup nearly $40 billion, forced the exit of its chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, and led to persistent rumors inside the bank that Mr. Rubin might soon be stepping down as well.
 Mr. Rubin and others at Citigroup are quick to dismiss any talk of departure, but one senior insider says Mr. Rubin may soon change his job title in order to clarify a clutch of duties that have always been ambiguous. He currently serves as chairman of the executive committee; his new title hasn't been decided. 
 ''It's not under consideration,'' Mr. Rubin insists.
 Titles aside, shareholders and analysts who have watched Citigroup run off the rails continue to ask a logical question about a financial statesman widely considered to be an astute judge of risk throughout a long and storied career: Where was Bob? 
 While many Wall Street luminaries have come in for criticism as a result of the financial breakdown, Mr. Rubin is part of an Olympian duo -- along with Mr. Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman -- whose legacies are most clearly threatened by the mess.
 ''The board is still pretty tightly behind Bob,'' said one outsider who has frequent discussions with Citigroup officials and requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. ''The second layer of executives at the company are very disappointed with him for not focusing more, for not doing a lot more.''
 At Citigroup's annual meeting last week, Joe Condon, a retired Citibank regional manager in New York, posed a similar question. ''What kind of advice did he give to Mr. Prince?'' asked Mr. Condon, who spent 38 years at the bank. ''Citigroup bankers are losing their jobs, and Bob Rubin is collecting $10 million, $15 million a year.''
 Answers to these questions are complex and laced with contradictions, which neatly fits Mr. Rubin's personality. Over the last 43 years, he has glided between Washington and Wall Street, emerging as an outspoken Democrat supporting liberal candidates like Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis even as he earned tens of millions of dollars as a top executive of Goldman Sachs. 
 As an economic adviser to President Clinton in 1993 and 1994 and as Treasury secretary from 1995 to 1999, he supported tax hikes and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, pleasing investors but disappointing liberals who wanted more money for social programs. And as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, he's played the incongruous role of official eminence grise, advising top executives and serving on the board while, he says, steering clear of day-to-day management.
 ''By the time I finished at Treasury, I decided I never wanted operating responsibility again,'' Mr. Rubin, 69, said during a two-hour interview in his office. Sitting in a red-cloth chair and propped against a thick book to support a bad back, he made it plain that responsibility for Citigroup's staggering losses can't be laid at his feet. 
 ''People know I was concerned about the markets,'' he says. ''Clearly, there were things wrong. But I don't know of anyone who foresaw a perfect storm, and that's what we've had here.'' 
 ''I don't feel responsible, in light of the facts as I knew them in my role,'' he adds. 
 But did he make mistakes? 
 ''I've thought a lot about that,'' he responds. ''I honestly don't know. In hindsight, there are a lot of things we'd do differently. But in the context of the facts as I knew them and my role, I'm inclined to think probably not.''
 The exact contours of Mr. Rubin's Citigroup duties are elusive, but they hinge on using his stature to attract clients and deal with regulators, while also tapping his experience in strategic matters. A paradox in all of this is that he maintains great sway at Citigroup while exercising no direct operational responsibilities.
 Until mid-2007, the board-level executive committee that he leads met only several times a year, but Sanford I. Weill, who as chief executive lured Mr. Rubin to the company in 1999, says they spoke practically every day during his tenure. Mr. Rubin also made himself readily available to Mr. Prince and others seeking advice. 
 ''It's a little like visiting Yoda,'' says Raymond J. McGuire, Citigroup's co-head of global investment banking. ''You go and get a dose of wisdom.''
 That arrangement worked fine when Citigroup prospered -- its shares more than doubled between 2002 and early 2007 -- but over the last year, as the bank's earnings and stock price withered, Mr. Rubin has endured much more critical scrutiny. At Citigroup's annual conference with analysts and institutional investors on May 9, he is likely to be on the receiving end of more hostile questions.
 MODEST and genial to a fault, Mr. Rubin is also proud and protective of his sterling reputation. Adorning a wall behind his desk is a framed Time cover from 1999 hailing his role on what the magazine called the ''Committee to Save the World''; the cover about the Asian economic crisis features him alongside his Treasury deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, and Mr. Greenspan, then the Fed chairman. 
 Addressing the current round of criticism, Mr. Rubin makes a passionate defense without sounding the least bit defensive. 
 ''There is no way you would know what was going on with a risk book unless you're directly involved with the trading arena,'' he says. ''We had highly experienced, highly qualified people running the operation.''
 That still doesn't satisfy experts like Frank Partnoy, a former banker at Morgan Stanley who is now a law professor at the University of San Diego. He says he long admired Mr. Rubin as a ''smart guy up against powerful forces in Washington who was consistently a voice of reason.'' But he says Citigroup's huge losses have shaken that faith.
 Mr. Partnoy recently had his corporate finance students listen to a conference call from last November in which Mr. Rubin tried to explain Citigroup's myriad financial woes and what role he played at the bank. ''You could feel the air go out of the room as this incredibly well-respected guy struggled to answer,'' Mr. Partnoy says of that class. ''It was almost poignant.''
 LONG before he became a star in Washington, Bob Rubin was renowned on Wall Street. It wasn't just his intellect that made him stand out, his pedigree from Harvard College and Yale Law School, or his success at the Street's most competitive firm, Goldman Sachs.
 ''What's unique about Bob is a combination of rare intellect and rare temperament. That's what sets him apart,'' says Roger Altman, a veteran of Wall Street who has known Mr. Rubin for nearly 30 years and served with him in the early years of the Clinton administration. ''He's self-effacing, always calm, with a low-ego style.'' 
 Colleagues say Mr. Rubin often prefaces his opinions by saying, ''I don't know much about this,'' and then proceeds to lay out his argument by asking questions of those around him.
 As he worked his way up from Goldman's arbitrage trading desk to the corner office, ''he was very accepting of debate and disagreement,'' says Stephen Friedman, who met Mr. Rubin shortly after joining Goldman Sachs in 1966 and eventually became co-chairman of the firm with him from 1990 to 1992. Nodding toward Mr. Rubin's acute sense of the volatility of the markets, he adds that the only thing Mr. Rubin ''is dismissive of is people who are certain of things that are inherently uncertain.''
 Mr. Rubin encouraged Goldman to move into more treacherous markets like proprietary trading and commodities trading. Even so, he now says he was always concerned about the dangers posed by risky futures and derivatives trades, having seen how the pell-mell use of futures contracts exacerbated the 1987 stock market crash. 
 Shortly before leaving Goldman to head up President Clinton's National Economic Council, Mr. Rubin says, he met with Richard B. Fisher, the chairman of Morgan Stanley, to discuss the idea of imposing stricter margin requirements on futures trading. Mr. Rubin says the idea died after the Chicago Board of Trade told him ''we will make sure Goldman Sachs never trades another future on the C.B.O.T. if this went ahead.'' 
 A spokeswoman for the CME Group, which now owns the Chicago Board, contends that ''Goldman was and continues to be a valued customer and we would never deny access to our markets.''
 At the Treasury Department, Mr. Rubin threaded a moderate stance on the always-controversial issue of market regulation, navigating between conservative free marketeers like Mr. Greenspan who wanted to streamline regulation and more liberal advocates demanding tighter monitoring of the securities industry.
 At the same time, Mr. Rubin pushed developing countries to open their markets to foreign competition while privatizing state-dominated economies. This approach eventually became known as the Washington consensus and gained deep traction in Latin America, East Asia and Eastern Europe, regions where Citigroup later aggressively pursued new business.
 Overseas, Mr. Rubin's legacy remains controversial nearly a decade after he left the Treasury. In Latin America, populist leaders have come to power in part by arguing that privatization and market-oriented reforms greatly enriched the elite but didn't benefit the rest of the population. 
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, suggests Mr. Rubin and other Clinton officials were more attuned to the impact of free trade on American workers than on their overseas counterparts. ''Free trade does promote growth but promotes inequality,'' he says. ''In terms of helping victims of that process, they did more domestically than internationally.''
 Looking back, Mr. Rubin says: ''We were in favor of trade liberalization and also very focused on for the potential for trade to increase inequality and job dislocation.'' He adds that, ''if we did it again, we would be more focused on social safety nets for the poor during the crises.''
 With the economy booming and the market soaring in the mid- to late 1990s, Washington wasn't focused on new regulation. The trend had long been in the opposite direction, as commercial banks and investment banks gradually moved closer together, eroding the Glass-Steagall legal restrictions enacted in the 1930s to rein in banking excesses. Mr. Rubin in theory supported the legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act but was concerned that it would strengthen the Fed's powers at the expense of the Treasury. It was passed and signed into law under his successor, Mr. Summers.
 Despite the views of Mr. Greenspan, others in their inner circle say Mr. Rubin charted his own philosophic course about regulation.
 ''He was consistently more skeptical that market discipline alone is sufficient and more often in favor of using regulation to get a better balance between innovation and stability,'' says Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who served as a senior Treasury official under Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers.
 But on at least one occasion, Mr. Rubin lined up with Mr. Summers as well as Mr. Greenspan to block a 1998 proposal by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that would have effectively moved many derivatives out of the shadows and made them subject to regulation.
 Derivatives are privately negotiated and often complex financial contracts theoretically designed to limit risk. Their value is derived from an underlying basket of assets, like stocks, bonds or loans. Advocates say that derivatives, used wisely, foster economic activity. Critics contend that as derivatives trading has boomed over the last decade, it has led to high-octane speculation more akin to gambling than to sensible hedging of financial risk. 
 Opaque trading and hard-to-value derivatives tied to mortgage loans and other forms of credit have been one of the underlying causes of the current financial crisis. One former commodities commission official argues that a different approach to derivatives regulation in 1998 would have helped avert the worst of today's credit crisis.
 ''Stopping this let the momentum build and led to subprime as well as soaring commodity prices today because unregulated derivatives trading soared after that,'' says Michael Greenberger, then director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now a professor of law at the University of Maryland. 
 At an April 21, 1998, meeting with Brooksley Born, the chairwoman of the commodities commission, Mr. Rubin made no secret of his feelings about her proposal. ''It was controlled anger. He was very tough,'' Mr. Greenberger recalls. ''I was at several meetings with him, and I've never seen him like that before or after.'' Ms. Born didn't return calls for comment. 
 Mr. Rubin says he was against the proposal because he feared it could create chaos in the markets, rather than actually improve oversight of derivatives. He says he believes that the financial system could benefit from better regulation of derivatives, perhaps in the form of more disclosure and new rules requiring individuals and firms to put more money down when they trade.
 But during his time in Washington, he says, ''the politics would have made this impossible. Even if I'd taken a placard and walked up and down Pennsylvania Avenue saying the financial system would come to an end without strict regulation of derivatives, I would have had no traction.''
 Mr. Greenberger is unbowed: ''What do we have now, if not chaos in the markets?''
 WHEN Mr. Rubin left Washington and returned to New York in 1999, he weighed the pros and cons of his next career move. ''I'd had the ultimate responsibility both at Goldman Sachs and at Treasury, and I didn't want that again,'' he wrote in ''In an Uncertain World,'' his memoir. ''I was at a stage in my life where I wanted to try to live a little differently.''
 That meant, he says, a position that didn't carry direct management responsibilities and allowed him to serve as elder financial statesman -- albeit one who was lavishly paid. Since arriving at Citigroup, Mr. Rubin has been awarded compensation worth at least $126.1 million, according to Equilar, a research firm. That would place him firmly in the top 25 percent of earners if compared to the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. 
 One person who insisted on anonymity because he remains close to Mr. Rubin said there was one central issue the former Treasury secretary didn't consider when he signed on at Citigroup: ''What if you a take a nonoperational role and something happens there and people blame you?'' 
 According to Mr. Rubin's many friends and supporters in Washington and on Wall Street, that's exactly the position he finds himself in.
 ''Bob has been unfairly taken to task, I really do believe that,'' says Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner and a Citigroup board member. ''He made an explicit deal when he came aboard. You can't say this happened on his watch because this wasn't his watch.''
 Indeed, Mr. Rubin's role at Citigroup has been unique. His contract stipulated that he wouldn't have specific business responsibilities and was free to use his perch to sound off on public policy -- even if his views diverged from those of the bank.
 And when it comes to the current financial mess at Citigroup and elsewhere, Mr. Rubin says his conscience is clear. ''Looking back, you have to say a lot of people made a lot of mistakes,'' he says. ''I don't blame people for being angry. They lost a lot of money.''
 Although Mr. Rubin regularly points out that he didn't directly oversee any of Citigroup's businesses, bankers inside the company say that he didn't need such authority to wield tremendous influence.
 ''He is like the Wizard of Oz behind Citigroup, he is the guy pulling on all the strings,'' said one Citigroup banker who was not authorized to speak publicly about the situation. ''He certainly was the guy deferred to on key strategic decisions and certain key business decisions vis-a-vis risk.''
 ''When you have responsibility with no accountability, that is a very dangerous thing on Wall Street,'' this banker added. 
 A LOOK at some of Citigroup's recent endeavors offers a window onto Mr. Rubin's role at the bank.
 Early in 2005, Citigroup's board asked the C.E.O., Mr. Prince, and several top lieutenants to develop a growth strategy for its fixed-income business. Mr. Rubin peppered colleagues with questions as they formulated the plan, according to current and former Citigroup employees. With Citigroup falling behind Wall Street rivals like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Mr. Rubin pushed for the bank to increase its activity in high-growth areas like structured credit. 
 He also encouraged Mr. Prince to raise the bank's tolerance for risk, provided it also upgraded oversight. Then, according to current and former employees, he helped sell the proposal to his fellow directors.
 On the surface, this appeared to be a sensible strategy. In hindsight, the timing could not have been worse: Citigroup was bulking up in mortgage-linked securities in 2006, not long before that market cratered.
 Mr. Rubin, who warned that Wall Street disregarded market risks for years, now says the sudden collapse of the mortgage market caught him off guard. But he also says that the way that Citigroup executed its expansion into new credit markets was lacking. ''We could afford to seek more opportunities through intelligent risk taking,'' he says. ''The key word is 'intelligent.' ''
 In early 2007, Citigroup belatedly began trimming its staggering exposure to the crumbling market for mortgage-backed securities. Though just footsteps from Mr. Prince's office, Mr. Rubin said he was unaware of the specific problems posed by that stockpile until last July. That was when Mr. Prince first convened daily risk-management meetings for Citigroup's highest-ranking executives.
 Mr. Rubin either attended those meetings with Mr. Prince or called in from the road for briefings. Participants at the meetings said Mr. Rubin helped shape the firm's response to the mortgage crisis. Mr. Prince was not available for comment.
 ''Bob was the elder statesman,'' says Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's chief financial officer. ''He could reflect on his experiences at Goldman and the Treasury and provide advice about how a prior situation paralleled the current situation.''
 As the stock market, spooked by the escalating housing mess, went on a roller-coaster ride last summer, Wall Street pressured the Federal Reserve for an interest rate cut to help calm credit fears. The Fed demurred. On Aug. 8, a day after the Fed decided against lowering rates, Mr. Rubin placed a phone call to Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, to compliment the decision, according to a person familiar with the call. 
 Although Mr. Rubin's interactions with federal regulators have drawn scrutiny in the past, this person said that Mr. Rubin acted ''on his own behalf and not on behalf of Citigroup.'' This person said Mr. Rubin made the call because he believed a rate cut might encourage reckless behavior on Wall Street.
 Among all of the time bombs lurking in Citigroup's portfolio, a particularly risky type of mortgage investment that carried a feature known as a liquidity put has drawn attention. Analysts say losses from those products could ultimately cost the bank tens of billions of dollars, and Mr. Rubin drew attention in Fortune magazine for not knowing more about that exposure. 
 ''Liquidity puts are a footnote to a $2.2 trillion balance sheet,'' he responds. ''No regulators saw it, to the best of my knowledge. No analysts saw it. No accountants saw it.'' 
 Citigroup's investors were unaware of them, too. The bank did not fully break out the liquidity puts as a matter of risk until November 2007.
 Since then, Mr. Rubin has walked a fine line between helping stabilize the company and not getting pulled too deeply into its daily affairs. After Mr. Prince resigned in November, Mr. Rubin reluctantly agreed to serve as interim chairman but left that post five weeks later when Winfried F. W. Bischoff became the permanent chairman.
 Even during that brief interregnum, his gold-plated Rolodex came in handy. When Citigroup turned to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for $7.5 billion in fresh capital, it was Mr. Rubin who personally flew to Abu Dhabi over Thanksgiving weekend to cement the deal. 
 WHAT'S more, Mr. Rubin's board-level executive committee has also started holding regular meetings for the first time since he joined in 1999. Every two weeks, the group convenes with the rest of the board for a briefing by the bank's top executives. Mr. Rubin offers big-picture observations about topics like credit market conditions and what new regulations might mean for Citigroup. But nitty-gritty issues, like how to value assets, are mostly left to others. 
 Mr. Rubin also helped recruit the man now responsible for pulling Citigroup out of the financial muck -- Vikram S. Pandit -- and the two have formed a strong bond. 
 ''We have a one-of-a-kind person to whom we all can rely on and seek advice,'' says Mr. Pandit, who became chief executive of Citigroup in December. ''That is a great comfort and a great attribute of this organization.'' 
 Mr. Rubin says that he ''committed to Vikram that I'd be active at Citi as he works through the problems.''
 For its part, Citigroup's board, Mr. Bischoff said, feels ''very well served by Bob'' and doesn't hold him accountable for the bank's woes. ''The responsibility ultimately rests with management,'' Mr. Bischoff said. ''Perhaps if he was the ultimate decision maker, things might be different.''
 Even as his critics and supporters debate the impact of the Citigroup debacle on Mr. Rubin's reputation,he says he remains focused on the challenges at hand. 
 ''I watched so many people get screwed up in Washington thinking about their legacy, and not on the implications of what they were doing,'' he says, calm as ever. ''I've seen a lot of ups and downs, a lot of turmoil.''
 Between college and law school, Mr. Rubin briefly lived on the Left Bank in Paris, spending hours at cafes that were frequented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Like them, he says, he remains something of an existentialist. 
 ''It'll be what it will be, like everything in life.''

HEADLINE: How McCain Lost in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT'S a nightmare. It's the Bataan Death March. It's mutually assured Armageddon. ''Both of them are already losing the general to John McCain,'' declared a Newsweek columnist last month, predicting that the election ''may already be over'' by the time the Democrats anoint a nominee.
 Not so fast. If we've learned any new rule in the 2008 campaign, it's this: Once our news culture sets a story in stone, chances are it will crumble. But first it must be recycled louder and louder 24/7, as if sheer repetition will transmute conventional wisdom into reality.
 When the Pennsylvania returns rained down Tuesday night, the narrative became clear fast. The Democrats' exit polls spelled disaster: Some 25 percent of the primary voters said they would defect to Mr. McCain or not vote at all if Barack Obama were the nominee. How could the party possibly survive this bitter, perhaps race-based civil war? 
 But as the doomsday alarm grew shrill, few noticed that on this same day in Pennsylvania, 27 percent of Republican primary voters didn't just tell pollsters they would defect from their party's standard-bearer; they went to the polls, gas prices be damned, to vote against Mr. McCain. Though ignored by every channel I surfed, there actually was a G.O.P. primary on Tuesday, open only to registered Republicans. And while it was superfluous in determining that party's nominee, 220,000 Pennsylvania Republicans (out of their total turnout of 807,000) were moved to cast ballots for Mike Huckabee or, more numerously, Ron Paul. That's more voters than the margin (215,000) that separated Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 Those antiwar Paul voters are all potential defectors to the Democrats in November. Mr. Huckabee's religious conservatives, who rejected Mr. McCain throughout the primary season, might also bolt or stay home. Given that the Democratic ticket beat Bush-Cheney in Pennsylvania by 205,000 votes in 2000 and 144,000 votes in 2004, these are 220,000 voters the G.O.P. can ill-afford to lose. Especially since there are now a million more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania. (These figures don't even include independents, who couldn't vote in either primary on Tuesday and have been migrating toward the Democrats since 2006.) 
 For such a bitterly divided party, the Democrats hardly show signs of clinical depression. The last debate, however dumb, had the most viewers of any so far. The rise in turnout and new voters is all on the Democratic side. Even before its deathbed transfusion of new donations, the Clinton campaign trounced the McCain campaign in fund-raising by 2.5 to 1. (The Obama-McCain ratio is 3 to 1.)
 On Tuesday, a Democrat won the first round of a special Congressional election in Mississippi, even though the national G.O.P. outspent the Democrats by more than double and President Bush carried this previously safe Republican district by 25 percentage points in 2004. A Gallup poll last week found Mr. Bush's national disapproval rating the worst (69 percent) for any president in Gallup's entire 70-year history. For all his (and Mr. McCain's) persistent sightings of ''victory'' in Iraq, the percentage of Americans calling the war a mistake (63) also set a new record. 
 ''I'm thrilled to be anywhere with high ratings,'' Mr. Bush joked on Monday night, when he popped up like Waldo on the NBC game show ''Deal or No Deal'' to root for an Army captain who was a contestant. But it turns out that not even cash giveaways to veterans can induce Americans to set eyes on this president. ''Deal or No Deal'' drew an audience 19 percent below its season average. The best deal for Mr. McCain would be for Mr. Bush to disappear into the witness protection program.
 But surely, it could be argued, the mud in the Democratic race will be as much a drag on that party's eventual nominee as the incumbent president is on the G.O.P. ticket. The counterargument, advanced by Mrs. Clinton in justifying her ''kitchen sink'' attacks on Mr. Obama, is that the Democrats are better off being tested now by raising all the issues the Republicans will. It's a fair point. The Wright, Rezko, Ayers, ''bittergate'' and flag-pin firestorms will all be revived by the opposition come fall. Voters should indeed see how Mr. Obama deals with them, just as Democrats also need to gauge how the flash points of race and gender will play out in the crunch. 
 The flaw in Mrs. Clinton's refrain is her claim that she, unlike her challenger, has already been so fully vetted that her candidacy can offer no more unpleasant surprises. ''I have a lot of baggage, and everybody has rummaged through it for years,'' she says. Perhaps the delusion that she has a get-out-of-scandal-free card comes from her unexpected endorsement from Richard Mellon Scaife, the nutty Pittsburgh newspaper publisher who once spent a fortune trying to implicate the Clintons in the ''murder'' of Vince Foster. Or perhaps she thinks Fox News will call off the dogs now that her campaign chairman, Terry McAuliffe, is appearing in network promos endorsing its ''fair and balanced'' shtick.
 But the incessant praise for Mrs. Clinton's resilience as a candidate by Karl Rove, Pat Buchanan and William Bennett reveals just how eager they are to take her on. The dealings of the Bill Clinton post-presidency, barely alluded to by Mr. Obama in his own halting bouts of negative campaigning, have simply been put on hold while the Democrats slug it out. Close observers of The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and Fox News can already read Rupert Murdoch's tea leaves, and not just those from China. ''Clinton Foundation Secrets'' was the title of The Journal's lead editorial on Friday profiling a rogues' gallery of shady donors. 
 Mrs. Clinton's supporters would argue that she's so battle-tested she could fend it all off. She's unlikely to get the chance. For all the nail-biting suspense being ginned up, the probable denouement remains unchanged. When the primary juggernaut finally ends -- following picturesque day trips to Puerto Rico and Guam -- the superdelegates will likely succumb to the math of Mr. Obama's virtually insurmountable pledged-delegate total. 
 There's also a way that two super-superdelegates, the duo on the Democrats' last winning ticket, could trigger a faster finale. Bill Clinton could do so by undermining his wife once more with another ill-timed, red-faced eruption. Al Gore could possibly do so with a well-timed endorsement before his party gets mired in yet another Florida recount.
 There's only one way this can end badly, no matter how long it lasts. That would be if the loser, whoever it is, turns sore and fails to rally his or her troops around the winner. It's all about ''the way the loser loses,'' as the Illinois Congressman Rahm Emanuel, who is neutral in the race, likes to say. While the Clintons are capable of such kamikaze narcissism, their selfish desire to preserve their own political future, if not the party's, may be a powerful check on those impulses.
 On the way to the finish line, the prolonged primary race, far from destroying the Democratic candidates, may do more insidious damage to the Republican nominee, lulling his campaign into an unjustified complacency. The Democrats should ''take their time -- don't rush,'' the McCain aide Mark Salter joked last week. Yet his candidate, as the conservative blogger Ross Douthat pointed out, keeps bumping up against a 45 percent ceiling in the polls even now, when the Democrats are ostensibly in ruins. 
 Mr. McCain is not only burdened with the most despised president in his own 71-year lifetime, but he's getting none of the seasoning that he, no less than the Democrats, needs to compete in the fall. Age is as much an issue as race and gender in this campaign. Mr. McCain will have to prove not merely that he can keep to the physical rigors of his schedule and fend off investigations of his ties to lobbyists and developers. He also must show he can think and speak fluently about the domestic issues that are gripping the country. Picture him debating either Democrat about health care, the mortgage crisis, stagnant middle-class wages, rice rationing at Costco. It's not pretty.
 Last week found Mr. McCain visiting economically stricken and ''forgotten'' communities (forgotten by Republicans, that is) in what his campaign bills as the ''It's Time for Action Tour.'' It kicked off in Selma, Ala., a predominantly black town where he confirmed his maverick image by drawing an almost exclusively white audience. 
 The ''action'' the candidate outlined in the text of his speeches may strike many voters as running the gamut from inaction to inertia. Mr. McCain vowed that he would not ''roll out a long list of policy initiatives.'' (He can't, given his long list of tax cuts.) He said he would not bring back lost jobs, lost wages or lost houses. But, as The Birmingham News reported, this stand against government bailouts for struggling Americans didn't prevent his campaign from helping itself to free labor underwritten by taxpayers: inmates from a local jail were recruited to set up tables and chairs for a private fund-raiser.
 The Democrats' unending brawl may be supplying prime time with a goodly share of melodrama right now, but there will be laughter aplenty once the Republican campaign that's not ready for prime time emerges from the wings.

HEADLINE: Rifts Mend, Unless Identity Politics Is a Different Stripe

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS

 BODY:
SENATOR Hillary Rodham Clinton's victory last week in the Pennsylvania presidential primary bought Mrs. Clinton time, but it's what might fill the time that troubles Democrats: an increasingly sharp dialogue between core Democratic constituencies -- blacks and a wide swath of women. 
 Will either of those constituencies leave their grievances at home come November? Will large numbers stay home altogether if their history-making candidate loses the nomination? The reassurances, and the warnings, are flying.
 Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all promised a resolution shortly after the last of the primaries in June, and have urged superdelegates to fall in line behind one candidate or the other. 
 But even as Mr. Dean and others lament the downward tone of the campaign, they say that with the convention in Denver in August, the healing will begin. They dismiss the intramural tensions wrought by the protracted season, citing historical patterns of voters uniting behind the nominee after similarly competitive primaries. 
 Still, depending on the circumstances (particularly if those circumstances involve the superdelegates overriding the popular vote or the choice of the pledged delegates), the historical comparisons might not hold up. Identity politics, some say, create a deeper schism, and the polarization by race exposed by results in Pennsylvania and elsewhere could indicate a rift that can't be mended easily.
 Certainly the depth of voters' devotion pulsates on every politics blog, with loyalists in one camp insisting they would never back the other's candidate. Some threaten to vote for John McCain or a third-party candidate. Whether that is fleeting angst or lasting sentiment remains to be seen. 
 Michael Dawson, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, posited last week at TheRoot.com that if Mr. Obama is not the nominee: ''The Democratic Party will face the Herculean task of trying to mobilize its most loyal constituency -- black voters -- in the face of deep and widespread black bitterness and active campaigns in the black community encouraging black voters to defect or abstain. You can already hear the angry comparisons. Just like in 2000, the protests will go, an election will have been 'stolen.' '' 
 In an interview, Mr. Dawson elaborated, saying that a Clinton nomination could result in disaffection among black voters. ''The sentiment is there and it's very dangerous,'' he said. ''I think it doesn't take any work at all for images of 2000 to become visible again in black discourse'' if Mrs. Clinton ''takes the nomination away from Obama.''
 The racial undertones have been exacerbated by the contentious remarks of former President Bill Clinton toward Mr. Obama. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina warned last week that Mr. Clinton's comments had caused an irreparable breach with African-Americans. 
 Jamal Simmons, an Obama supporter and Democratic analyst, agreed that this election cycle is different. The race-and-gender divide makes for a ''treacherous'' road ahead, he said. While Mrs. Clinton keeps pointing to her victory in Michigan (where Mr. Obama's name was not on the ballot), he noted: ''She lost every single precinct in the city of Detroit. You cannot win the state of Michigan without African-American voters.''
 Democrats including Mr. Simmons were quick to point out, though, that were Mrs. Clinton to be the nominee, she would still benefit from what many consider a change or anger election -- the wish of many voters to overturn the Republican hold on the White House after eight years, given the economy and the war in Iraq.
 But disenchantment could affect the November vote in states where victory is all about slim margins. There was Ohio, for example, where Senator John Kerry lost to President Bush in 2004, in part because Mr. Bush garnered a sizable portion of black voters when issues like a gay-marriage amendment were on the ballot. 
 ''Democrats can't win in November without black people,'' said James Rucker, executive director for ColorofChange.org, a grassroots online organization that says it has 400,000 minority activists, adding that ''party leaders know it and so do everyday black folks.'' 
 Much turns on what the superdelegates decide to do. In a Gallup poll in mid-March, before the Pennsylvania primary, 7 percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independent voters said they would not vote at all in November if superdelegates gave the nomination to Mrs. Clinton, and 2 percent indicated a third-party choice. In addition, 11 percent said they would vote for a Republican. 
 Maren Hensla, director of independent expenditures with Emily's List, which has campaigned heavily for Mrs. Clinton, acknowledged that some surveys also suggest that women (who voted 2-1 for Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania) may drift away if she is not the nominee. 
 But unlike the split between, say, Jimmy Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1980, she said, there is little policy difference between the 2008 Democrats. So perhaps any disaffection among women would not be enduring. 
 Other Democratic analysts believe the tensions will dissipate once a nominee is chosen. Stephanie Cutter, a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry in 2004, said the battle lines are ''something for the party to pay attention to.'' But, she added, ''It's the responsibility of everyone, including Barack and Hillary, to pull the base together.'' She said either could do that through endorsements and campaigning, by providing validation of the other. 
 Page Gardner, head of the Women's Voices, Women's Vote Action Fund, senses that the overarching issue of economic worry will persuade people -- especially her core target of unmarried women who have begun voting in larger numbers -- to overcome any disappointment. 
 Others also view the November lens as harboring ways of smoothing over differences. William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist, said he believed ''there is too much hysteria right now -- understandably people are upset.'' He predicted that Mr. Obama will win the nomination, and that both Clintons will campaign hard for a Democrat to win the White House, with Mr. Clinton ''regaining the affection of black voters.'' 
 Come fall, he said, ''The focus will be on McCain, who will be burdened with his association with the president, an economy in deep recession and an unpopular war in Iraq that rages on.''
 The high level of discontent toward the Bush administration is readily apparent in surveys of public opinion, which could help Democrats, said Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center. But, given the firm allegiances to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, he added: ''I think that does put a lot of pressure on the Democratic Party to say this person did not win or lose the nomination on the basis of his or her identity.''

HEADLINE: In Zimbabwe Jail: A Reporter's Ordeal

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK

 BODY:
HARARE, Zimbabwe -- I had never been arrested before and the prospect of prison in Zimbabwe, one of the poorest, most repressive places on earth, seemed especially forbidding: the squalor, the teeming cells, the possibility of beatings. But I told myself what I'd repeatedly taught my two children: Life is a collection of experiences. You savor the good, you learn from the bad.
 I was being charged with the crime of ''committing journalism.'' One of my captors, Detective Inspector Dani Rangwani, described the offense to me as something despicable, almost hissing the words: ''You've been gathering, processing and disseminating the news.''
And I'd been caught at it red-handed, my notes spread across my desk, my text messages readable on my cellphone, my stories preserved by Microsoft Word in an open laptop. 
 At one point, 21 policemen and detectives milled about my room at a small lodge in Harare, the capital. They knocked against one another as they ambled about, some kneeling, some on tiptoes, searching for clues in the cabinets and drawers. Men with rifles guarded the door. 
 They immediately found my two United States passports, ample evidence of subterfuge. One contained work papers indicating I was a reporter; the other, the one with my visa, said I had entered the country as a tourist.
 ''But you're actually a journalist?'' I was asked.
 ''Yes,'' I answered.
 ''And you are not accredited in Zimbabwe?''
 ''No, I'm not.''
 I had concerns well beyond myself, for certain Zimbabweans had been assisting me. Messages between us lived on in the phone. Whatever bad times lay ahead for me, I imagined things would undoubtedly be worse for these others, these friends.
 One of the cops gripped the phone. ''You're in terrible trouble,'' he admonished. His tone was menacing but there was also an odd curl to his smile that I took to be an invitation.
 ''Can you help me?'' I whispered.
 His right thumb was nimbly working the keypad of the phone, but then it dropped to his side and he used it to massage his forefinger, sign language for the universal lubricant of the greased palm. In a few minutes, I negotiated safe passage to the bathroom and left him $100 in my shaving kit.
 Then we stood shoulder to shoulder. ''What's this?'' he'd demand accusingly as we scrolled through the messages. Each time I'd nod yes, he'd hit delete.
 The crowded room was hot. Already, I felt jailed. I needed a breath of air, but when I moved toward the door, Detective Jasper Musademba, a well-built man in a jacket and tie, stopped me. He had been the most threatening of the police. ''If you try to go outside...'' he said sternly, stopping in midsentence. He made his hand into a gun and pulled the trigger.
 ''You'll kill me?'' I asked.
 ''Good,'' he remarked wryly. ''Then you've seen that movie.''
 An Electoral Limbo
 I'd come to Zimbabwe to cover the March 29 elections, momentous times in a contentious country. History was taking a gallant turn against long-shot odds. Robert Mugabe, the enduring political chameleon who'd led the nation since its liberation from Britain in 1980, seemed on the cliff edge of defeat.
 Day after day, Zimbabwe languished in a peculiar limbo. While the government refused to release the results of the presidential race, totals already had been posted at every polling station and there were solid reasons to think that Mr. Mugabe, the 84-year-old president, had suffered an unexpected comeuppance.
 This must have come as a shock to the ''old man,'' as Zimbabweans call him, not only since the election apparatus was so slanted in his favor but because he considered himself the father of his people. Knowledgeable sources told me the rebuke had at first left President Mugabe depressed and ready to concede.
 His power had flourished through methodical cruelty, including the murder of thousands of people in the dissident stronghold of Matabeleland. As he and cronies then acquired lavish mansions and enormous bank accounts, he thrust the nation into a calamitous economic meltdown, the main precipitator being a misbegotten takeover of productive farms from white landowners.
 Mr. Mugabe, who holds the genuine bona fides of a liberation hero, likes to present himself as one of freedom's great champions. Maintaining a veneer of democracy is important to his image. Civic groups are permitted to meet so long as their messages fail to reach the masses. Courts can convene so long as Mr. Mugabe reserves the right to sweep aside inconvenient decisions. Elections can be held so long as political adversaries survive beatings and jailings and torture -- and the results can be reliably rigged.
 On April 3, the day I was arrested, my means of observing these mechanisms oddly shifted from a vantage point outside to one within. My own freedom would depend on those remnant smidgens of civil liberty still granted the citizenry -- and on the many brave people who carry on unbowed against relentless intimidation.
 The veneer of freedom Mr. Mugabe permits the press is applied with the thinnest of coats. Though some independent weeklies are allowed to publish, the state controls the only daily newspaper and television station. Most Western reporters are routinely denied entry.
 I was new to Africa. My wife, Celia Dugger, and I arrived in January as The New York Times's co-bureau chiefs in Johannesburg. With elections coming in Zimbabwe, I soon made two trips to Harare, each time taking ritualistic precautions for safety. I left my credentials and laptop at home, entered the country as a tourist and interviewed people only behind closed doors. Each night, I destroyed my notes after e-mailing their contents to myself at an Internet cafe. I wrote my articles only upon returning to Johannesburg.
 But the presidential election presented new complications. Daily articles needed to be filed. I had to openly work the streets, then go back to a room with a reliable wireless link to transmit from my laptop. Over time, normally wary reporters began taking risks that mocked earlier prudence, announcing their names and affiliations at opposition news conferences. 
 Necessity numbed my own caution. My articles required continuous updating for The Times's Web site, so there I'd be in downtown Harare, a backpack slung over my shoulder, dictating quotes from my notebook and spelling names into the wavering connection of the mobile phone. Early on, I had asked that my byline be kept from the articles. But other reporters were less guarded about revealing themselves in print. I eventually followed suit.
 I was staying at York Lodge, a collection of eight cottages spread around a lovely expanse of shrubs and lawn. At age 58, after 33 years as a reporter, I'd like to think I have a nose for trouble, alert to danger like some frontier cavalry scout who tenses up at the sound of a suspicious birdcall.
 But the police had been at the lodge for 45 minutes before I knew a thing. I was filing another update for the Web site when I left the room for a breather about 4 p.m. Maria Phiri, a tall, wiry detective in hoop earrings and a red dress, called out, ''Hey you!'' I was stunned.
 Several men hurried my way. Their very first question had me reeling.
 ''Who are you?''
 A Land of 'No Law'
 Two reporters were rounded up at York Lodge; two others were warned away before returning from the field. The other unfortunate was Stephen Bevan, 45, an able British freelancer who works for The Sunday Telegraph. 
 We were taken in a pickup truck to the Harare Central Police Station, a large colonial-era complex colloquially known as Law and Order. The detectives' evident glee at our capture was soon tempered by the arrival of a familiar and implacable foe, Beatrice Mtetwa, the nation's top human rights lawyer.
 She is a striking woman with rectangular glasses and a neatly trimmed Afro.
 ''There is no crime called 'committing journalism,' whether it is with accreditation or without,'' she informed us privately in her exaggerated, lawyerly diction. This was actually news to us -- and quite a relief. In fact, the law had been amended in January. It was now only illegal to falsely claim to be accredited, and neither Stephen nor I had done that.
 But Ms. Mtetwa also explained the sinister realities of a woebegone place: ''Ultimately, there is no law in Zimbabwe. Your governments can't apply pressure; the British and the Americans have negative influence here. The police will hold you as long as they want.'' She was president of the nation's law society. The police had beaten her with truncheons the year before.
 Her colleague, Alec Muchadehama, had recently spent time in the Harare Central cells that now loomed before us. ''This is one of our worst places,'' he told us gravely. ''You'll need to brace yourselves.''
 The human mind is actually good at such things. It doesn't take much time to think of greatly admired people who have been wrongly locked up in the jails of the world. I already knew a dozen civic leaders in Zimbabwe with horrid tales of time in custody. Some were beaten, most often around their torsos and the soles of their feet. Some were simply held in the vile cells.
 I managed to call Celia with a borrowed phone. My wife somehow knows how to all at once be emotionally distraught and serenely levelheaded. She was already strategizing about how to free me; at the same time she was getting ready to assume the newspaper's Zimbabwe coverage from Johannesburg. 
 ''Don't worry, whatever the cells are like I can handle it,'' I told her, attempting a tough guy's bravado. I added a reporter's inside joke. ''Really, anything is better than having to file four stories a day for the Web site.''
 Not long after midnight, Detective Musademba escorted Stephen and me to the jail. Electricity no longer works in much of the decrepit complex. The hallways were entirely desolate and silent but for the squeaking of our shoes and intermittent drips from exposed pipes.
 At such an ominous time, my senses felt eerily deprived, except for smell. With every step, the odor of the urine-soaked lockup grew a bit stronger. 
 The Cell Door Slams Shut
 The uniformed jailers wrote our names in a ledger and asked us to empty our pockets. I was flush with $4,000 cash, an amount meant to last weeks in a nation where credit cards were of little use. About $150 of that had been converted into the ludicrously inflated Zimbabwean currency; crammed in my pants were bundles of $10 million bills that piled up four inches high.
 The jailers patiently counted the sum before stashing it in a safe. There was never an attempt at a shakedown. Bribery was more on our minds than theirs. Stephen doled out $40 for the tenuous privilege of spending our initial hours on a wooden bench in the admittance area instead of the dreaded cells.
 Sleep was impossible. The bench was hard, the room cold and noisy. Near dawn, one of the bribed night crew, fearing his supervisors, rousted us from the bench and hastily herded us upstairs into an unlighted empty cage.
 ''You can't be found wearing your socks,'' he warned urgently. ''It's not allowed. You can't wear more than one shirt either. Hide these things.''
 The heavy bars then clanged shut; a padlock clicked. We couldn't really observe the surroundings until morning, when the first sliver of sunlight pierced the one narrow window at the ceiling.
 The cell was about 7 feet wide and 15 feet deep. Three bare shelves of rough concrete extended a body's length from both of the longer walls. Only the top slab left enough space for a person to sit upright, albeit with slouched shoulders. There was a circle of concrete in a corner to be used as a toilet. Behind it was a faucet. Stephen tried the knob. It did not work.
 The floor was filthy. The odor of human waste infected the air. More bothersome were the bugs. ''Cockroaches the size of skateboards,'' I quipped. This was hyperbole. The insects were mostly tiny and black, others short, white and wormy. We were soon sharing our clothes with them.
 About 7 a.m. the cells were emptied for ''the count,'' a routine taking of attendance in a large room farther upstairs. I clumsily hid my socks in my pants and buttoned one shirt to completely cover the other.
 There were about 150 inmates, many of them staring our way. We were older; we were the only whites. We joined them on one side of the open room. As names were called, prisoners were obliged to acknowledge their presence and shift to the opposite wall. I parroted some of the others, using the Shona word ''ndiripo'' when my turn came. The gesture drew some cheers and applause. It seemed an icebreaker, and before the session was over, we were being tutored in how to say ''mangwanani,'' or good morning.
 Prison movies had made me fear predation. But the inmates were instead a forlorn lot, a fair selection of Harare's downtrodden, people who'd once had decent jobs and who'd now been reduced to scrounging and worse. Two of the more personable ones were car thieves. Only because their families were starving, they said. Two others, Donald and Lancelot, were accused of poaching after cutting the hindquarter off a deer that had been hit by a bus.
 We mingled easily, swapping stories and comparing bug bites. Most were in a worse fix than we were. None said they'd been beaten; they weren't political types. But few had lawyers -- and many were jailed without their families knowing. This had dismal implications. The jail provided prisoners no food. If no one knew you were there, no one knew to bring you something to eat. 
 At breakfast, Stephen and I were allowed downstairs and pointed toward a well-stuffed wicker bag. The empathetic wife of the British ambassador had personally overseen preparation of our first meal. Sandwiches of bacon and eggs were triple-wrapped to hold their warmth. Tea, coffee, cocoa and sugar were packed in little bags to use with a thermos of hot water. There were juice boxes, soda cans, chocolate bars, hard candies and breath mints.
 Neither of us had much appetite, but we were enormously grateful. Thwarted as journalists, we now had renewed purpose.
 We could feed the hungry.
 A Deadline Looms
 It was a Friday, and Fridays held a fateful deadline. If we didn't get bail, we'd be locked away all weekend. We were relieved to be sent back to Law and Order, where we again found Beatrice Mtetwa, our lawyer.
 The night before, I had wanly told her that the case against me seemed hopelessly open-and-shut. I had written articles, and anyone who Googled my name with ''Zimbabwe'' would have all the proof that was needed. She harrumphed at that, insisting that even a simple database search was beyond the technical expertise of the Harare police.
 I now realized she might be right. The Criminal Investigations Department had only a few computers, a shortage of chairs and no functioning toilet. Detectives who earlier had seemed so competently fearsome now reminded me of the beleaguered gumshoes on ''Barney Miller.''
 Detective Musademba hunt-and-pecked on an antique typewriter, making triplicates with carbon paper. He'd sometimes shake away his boredom by breaking into song and pounding out the beat with the palms of his hands.
 Detective Inspector Rangwani, in charge of the investigation, was lamenting his need for a copy of the updated statutes. ''May I use yours?'' he asked our lawyer, who took the opportunity to hector and berate him. 
 ''This is a police state,'' Ms. Mtetwa said brassily. ''The law is only applied when it serves the perpetuation of the state. How does it feel, Inspector Rangwani, to be used this way by the state?''
 The browbeaten cop looked bedraggled, his head sagging from his neck like a wilted house plant. He replied meekly, ''Madame, I agree with you and I have made a recommendation just as you have stated to drop the charges.''
 Suddenly, the nightmare seemed to be ending with a yielding snap of the finger. The inspector forwarded the matter to the attorney general's office, and the appropriate official there advised the police to set us free.
 But there was then an odd delay, then an abrupt reversal, the pretense of a working justice system lost in a maddening flicker. ''The law only applies when it serves the perpetuation of the state,'' Ms. Mtetwa repeated.
 Two South African television technicians had been arrested the week before on similar charges. That morning, a magistrate found them not guilty. Yet instead of being released, they were rearrested. Someone in the government thought this a useful time to suppress the zeal of interfering foreign media. 
 Clemens Madzingo, the police's chief superintendent, himself gave us the news. He is a huge, pit bull of a man. He stood in the doorway with a triumphant grin. New charges were forthcoming, he said. Proof of our misdeeds would soon be excavated from files in our confiscated laptops.
 ''Until then, you'll be back in the cells.''
 The Hard-Liners Prevail
 Things had turned badly for us; more important, things were more hapless for Zimbabwe. The government now bizarrely announced a recount of its unannounced election results. The hard-liners had apparently steeled Mr. Mugabe to fight on. In a fine Orwellian touch, they had accused the opposition of cheating. They now appeared set to finagle an election victory.
 Did our incarceration somehow suit such purposes? That possibility set us into anxiety overdrive. Our wives, our editors, our embassies: they were all working hard to get us out. And while these welcome efforts supplied hope, they also left us vaguely embarrassed. If pressure could be applied on Mr. Mugabe, it ought to be for Zimbabwe's sake, not ours. 
 Jail, once so forbidding, now seemed merely dreary and depressing. How would we keep warm? Was there a way to get clean? When will this end?
 I was fortunate to have Stephen as a comrade. I once observed that while we were amply accompanied by every sort of insect, the jail lacked rodents. ''Why would rats stay here?'' he responded with his wonderful dry wit. ''There's no food. They've left the country the same as everyone else.''
 More than a quarter of Zimbabwe's 13 million people have fled. The nation's primary income is the cash sent home by this diaspora. Soon to follow are many inmates and guards from the jail. They wanted our phone numbers in Johannesburg -- and pleaded with us not to forget them.
 We had befriended a few jailers, but those who allowed us favors would end their shift, followed by jailers more stern, some wielding lengths of rubber hose. Our socks went on, our socks came off. Sometimes we were left alone; sometimes we were stuffed in with many others. I delivered a parental lecture to a young cellmate who'd cut a man with a beer bottle in a bar fight.
 We continued to share our food. But even this enjoyable gesture of charity could trigger regret. During the two daily ''counts,'' we'd try to note who seemed hungriest: The acrobat? The peddler? The guy in the ''69'' T-shirt?
 At meals, we were permitted to select only a few inmates to join us downstairs. A short, emaciated man in a red jersey had meekly asked to be included. ''Stay close to me when they come for us,'' I told him. But then I forgot.
 ''I was near you,'' he later muttered disconsolately, ''right near you.''
 A Blanket, Then a Fall
 Sleep escaped me. The concrete was too hard, my body too bony. I had never so craved a pad and blanket. The insects were most annoying at night. In my wakefulness, I'd pull my sleeves over my hands but then the stretched fabric exposed my midriff.
 One time, when able to wander the bleak corridors, I found what once had been a bathroom, with the remnants of sinks and showers. In one corner was a heap of blankets, stiff and moldy and fetid. I was tempted to take one but they were simply too disgusting. I wasn't yet that cold or tired.
 Still, I had a fixation. Surely, a blanket was obtainable. We hadn't paid any bribes since that first night but we decided to raise the subject of contraband blankets with a favorite jailer. ''Yes, this can be organized,'' he agreed. The next day was Sunday; stores would be closed. He'd bring them from home.
 That night, we awaited his footsteps. The jail possessed no flashlights. The guard used the tentative glow from a cellphone to find the right key. ''I'm sorry but one blanket is very thin,'' he quietly apologized. Stephen and I vied in self-sacrifice for the lesser covering, and I won with quicker hands.
 The top shelf in the cell was seven feet off the ground. I climbed up and smoothed the flimsy material over the concrete, but when I stepped down I lost my balance and grabbed a swatch of fabric instead of the sturdy ledge. I tumbled sideways, my hand grasping at empty air. I bounced off one concrete slab on the opposite side and then fell flat on my back.
 That was how I spent my fourth -- and final -- night in the Harare cells, in pain, slapping at bugs, still unable to sleep.
 The Bail Hearing
 Detective Musademba collected us in the morning for a bail hearing. The transport was an old pickup whose engine required a rolling start. He recruited Stephen to help push. I was excused because of my backache.
 The courthouse is called Rotten Row, after a nearby street. It's a circular five-story structure built around four elaborate saucers that once fed into one another as a fountain. With the nation insolvent, there's no money to maintain either ornamentations or courtrooms. Floors are filthy. Microphone stands have no mikes. The building's clocks are each stymied at 7:10.
 Our hearing was pro forma; the magistrate released us each on bail of 300 million Zimbabwean dollars, about $7, and the police were ordered to surrender our seized passports into the custody of the bailiffs.
 The real showdown only came later, a hearing when Beatrice Mtetwa would argue we never should have been arrested at all. I sat fretfully in the ''dock,'' the enclosed rectangle reserved for the accused. Across the room in the witness box stood Superintendent Madzingo, the brawny police chief who'd pledged to scavenge through our incriminating laptops. What did he have?
 Nothing, it turned out. He testified that ''critical new evidence'' had caused the attorney general's office to reverse its initial decision to let us go, a hasty fiction that was not even loitering in the rough vicinity of the truth.
 When asked to provide documentation, he tendered the printout of an article scooped off my desk at York Lodge, something I'd brought to Harare as background for a possible feature article about a political candidate. 
 Ms. Mtetwa proceeded to hang up Mr. Madzingo like a side of beef.
 ''Who is the author of that article?'' she asked.
 The article wasn't mine. It had been written by one of the all-time-greats of The New York Times, Anthony Lewis.
 ''Can you tell us the date of that article?''
 It was published in 1989.
 Magistrate Gloria Takundwa first covered her giggles with fingers, then with the loose sleeve of her black robe.
 Freedom, and Uncertainty
 Beatrice Mtetwa said it was fortunate the case was before a magistrate. Most were independent, many were courageous. They were leftover gloss in Mr. Mugabe's veneer of freedom. Justice was seldom found in higher courts.
 The magistrate announced her decision on April 16. While we had expected it to go our way, our minds were infused with our lawyer's admonition: the law only matters when it serves the interest of the state. We suspected that the government intended to rearrest us, which turns out to be true.
 But whatever the intentions, we were better prepared. We fled quickly from Rotten Row, our car pirouetting through the streets until we were sure we weren't followed. We waited in the parking lot of a pork production plant until word came that our passports had been recovered.
 Then, by prearrangement, we rendezvoused with a driver in a fully gassed car, avoiding the country's airports and heading northwest through the winding roads of the Matuzviadonha Mountains, toward the Zambezi River and a small border crossing into Zambia.
 I had left the cells with a case of scabies, an infestation of microscopic mites that swelled my hands and wrists to nearly twice their size. But I am better now, back in Johannesburg, with Celia, with our sons, Max, 17, and Sam, 12. 
 In the meantime, Zimbabwe is beset with paroxysms of violence. Thuggery, torture and murder are familiar implements in Robert Mugabe's tool kit. Political opponents are being brutalized, as are everyday people whose voting defied him. The presidential election results are still unannounced.

HEADLINE: History Hints A Recession Would Hit City Hard

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Federal officials may still be debating whether the American economy will fall into a full-blown recession this year. But economists in New York City are pondering another question: If there is a national recession, how deep will it get here? 
 If the last two recessions are any guide, economists say, the city could be headed into a wrenching reversal that will last longer than the national downturn. Though by many measures the city's economy is still chugging along even as the nation's sputters, there are troubling signs: Business-tax revenues and the number of building permits are dropping while unemployment and office space availability are creeping up.
 Perhaps most important, big investment banks continue to report losses on securities tied to mortgages, causing the elimination of thousands of high-paying jobs on Wall Street, with many more layoffs in the works.
 James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said he believed the city had been in a recession for months. Employment in construction has already started to decline, as it usually does at the start of a recession, he said. Retail sales would be following suit, he added, if not for the surge of foreign tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar. 
 Once the layoffs on Wall Street start rippling through the city's economy, Mr. Parrott said, ''it's going to take something unforeseen to prevent us from having a massive job loss.'' 
 The situation has worsened enough that the New York City Independent Budget Office, which said a month ago that it expected a brief and mild recession, is preparing a forecast that is likely to be significantly bleaker, said Ronnie Lowenstein, the director. 
 The local economy, she said, ''will be considerably worse than it is now.''
 Still, predicting downturns is risky work. Every recession has its own personality, and the city's sprawling economy has reacted differently to each one. More dependent on Wall Street and more closely linked to the global economy than the rest of America, the city has been battered harder by recessions that started in the financial markets than by those that began in manufacturing. 
 Looking to history for clues about how New York might fare in a new recession, economists note that the city suffered more and for a longer period than the nation as a whole during the last two downturns -- at the start of the 1990s and in the early years of this decade.
 So far, however, no one is forecasting a recession that would rival the financial disaster that the city endured in the 1970s, when it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. That crisis was the most severe downturn in the city's fortunes since World War II.
 In 1973, the national inflation rate already was rising when the supply of foreign oil was disrupted. High interest rates, combined with falling productivity and rising unemployment, led to a condition known as stagflation.
 New York City fared much worse than the rest of the country. Unemployment and the crime rate soared as 600,000 jobs were lost. Several large corporations, including General Electric, packed up their headquarters and decamped to the suburbs, or farther away. 
 By the spring of 1975, the city was on the verge of defaulting on its debts. The State Legislature created the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which borrowed billions of dollars to keep the city afloat. (Experts widely believe the city's finances, even in a weakening economy, are much better today, with projections of a surplus of more than $4 billion this fiscal year.) 
 When the next national recession struck in early 1980, followed by another in mid-1981, New York City was still rebounding. Nationally, that downturn spurred thousands of business failures, many of them manufacturers. But the city's manufacturing sector had already shrunk markedly, leaving it with less to lose, economists said.
 As a result, those recessions were considered relatively mild in New York. In 1982, when the national unemployment rate had risen to 10.8 percent, it was 9.8 percent in the city.
 The next two recessions, however, were largely about Wall Street and what it financed -- and so New York felt the pain.
 In the mid-1980s, the city and its growing financial sector were on a tear. The stock market was rising steadily, and big investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers were growing from tightly held partnerships into big public companies. A building boom took root. Office buildings and condominiums sprouted across the metropolitan area, many of them financed by the aggressive lending of savings and loan associations. 
 By mid-1987, the city had added back about 300,000 jobs, and its unemployment rate had fallen below 6 percent. Personal incomes were rising along with the stock market. The city's median family income increased by more than 15 percent during the '80s.
 Then the stock market crashed in mid-October 1987, wiping out all of the year's gains in a single day. But its dire effects were not immediately felt. 
 The city's economy continued to expand, along with the nation's, for two more years. But the growth masked the cutbacks that had begun on Wall Street, where the banks had been eliminating jobs throughout 1988. 
 With Wall Street in a tailspin, a downturn was well under way in New York when the national recession officially began in July 1990. Two years later, the city's unemployment rate had risen to more than 11 percent.
 That national recession officially ended in 1991, but the downturn lingered in New York, for another year and a half by Mr. Parrott's estimate. Corporations continued eliminating layers of management in what came to be known as the first ''white-collar recession.'' Before it was over, one of every 10 jobs in the city -- about 360,000 in all -- were lost.
 The city did not begin to recover until 1994, when another financial boom began, this one culminating in the mania for dot-com stocks. The dot-com party came to an abrupt end in March 2000. This time, the job cuts started not on Wall Street, but in computer services. Employment in data processing and other business services fell fast, but overall employment in the city continued growing until the end of 2000.
 Then came the devastating terrorist attack on Sept. 11. About 80,000 jobs were lost in the 15 weeks after the attack, turning what had been a mild downturn into a deep recession. Travel and tourism-related businesses suffered even more than financial services. 
 Officially, the national economy pulled out of that recession at the end of 2001. But the city kept shedding jobs until 2003, eventually losing more than 225,000.
 What lessons, then, do those downturns hold for economists parsing the current economic troubles?
 Economists say the post-9/11 recession is less instructive because of the anomaly of the attack and its localized impact on the economy. 
 But some economists see parallels in the current situation to the recession of 1990, as both were preceded by easy and abundant credit. 
 Although the current national slowdown began with the bursting of a housing bubble in Sun Belt states, the city could again remain in recession after the national economy recovers because Wall Street firms financed much of that lending, economists said. 
 Mr. Parrott described the borrowing of recent years as ''excessive,'' saying that aggressive mortgage lending and the leveraged trading of mortgage-related securities inflated the bubble.
 Ms. Lowenstein said: ''Even if it didn't start on Wall Street, Wall Street is very much involved. Given the difficulties we're seeing in the financial sector, it's hard to imagine that we're not going to see some fairly significant losses that could well exceed what's happening in other areas of the country.''
 Though job losses on Wall Street this time around may not rise as high as during the last two recessions, she said, the damage could be equally severe. 
 ''There may be fewer financial-sector jobs lost, but each job is very much more valuable,'' Ms. Lowenstein said. ''The loss of those jobs has a much greater impact on the economy because they are so well-paid.''

HEADLINE: There's an Easy Way to Help Conserve Oil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Big Thirst'' (Week in Review, April 20) left me gratified, mystified and frustrated by turns. 
 Gratified because as a bicycle commuter, I am apparently the rarest of commuting Americans. And most efficient, in terms of energy per passenger mile.
 Mystified and frustrated because the energy expert Vaclav Smil's ''... Or Conserving It'' graphic describing three strategies for conserving oil doesn't mention the strategy that can be enacted immediately with absolutely minimal implementation cost. What is this mysterious and apparently obscure strategy? Drive the speed limit.
 The impact on the fuel economy would be even greater if the speed limit -- gradually raised by increments since being set to 55 miles per hour in the late 1970s -- were reset to 55. And if observing the speed limit were considered a public benefit instead of a public nuisance. 
 Consider the costs -- in dollars, lives and security -- of impatience.

HEADLINE: Signs of Attacks On the Opposition Rise in Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
Evidence of widespread retribution against people who supported Zimbabwe's opposition party in last month's election has begun to stream out despite the government's efforts to restrict press access to the worst of the violence.
 As Zimbabweans brace this week for the results of the March 29 presidential election to be released, this growing body of evidence -- in the form of witness accounts, photographs and other documentation, some compiled by an American diplomatic field team -- has raised serious questions about whether a free and fair vote is possible if, as expected, a runoff is scheduled. 
 A runoff would pit President Robert Mugabe, in power for 28 years, against his challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change. Mr. Tsvangirai, who left the country on April 7, has said he fears for his safety if he returns.
 The questions have grown to the point that the United Nations' top human rights official, Louise Arbour, publicly expressed worry on Sunday that violence could subvert any effort to resolve Zimbabwe's political crisis. 
 ''The information I have received suggests an emerging pattern of political violence, inflicted mainly, but not exclusively, on rural supporters of the opposition M.D.C. party,'' she said in a statement from her offices in Geneva.
 Jendayi E. Frazer, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, who has been touring the region, told the BBC in an interview published Sunday that the United Nations Security Council should consider sanctions on Zimbabwe if the post-election violence does not end. 
 Farmers from Masvingo, Mashonaland East and Manicaland Provinces who worked on behalf of the opposition and were interviewed by telephone in the past week described a pattern of ruling-party gangs visiting under the cover of darkness to beat and evict them. 
 Villagers from Manicaland said they were roused from sleep around midnight one night this month by young marauders who had come to punish them for voting against Mr. Mugabe. They said the gangs pelted them with stones fired from slingshots and dragged some from their homes. 
 The next day, rather than protecting them, police officers ordered them to empty their small huts of their meager possessions, witnesses said. Then the young thugs returned to the small settlement just north of the city of Mutare, bashing down people's homes with iron bars or setting them ablaze. 
 ''There was no chance to say anything; we were fearing for our lives,'' said Milton, a farm worker who watched from a corn patch as his house went up in flames, and who withheld his last name because he was frightened.
 A three-person team from the American Embassy in Harare drove to Manicaland Province on April 19-20 and captured images of the burned and demolished homes in the settlement where Milton lived. The photographs and videos focus on the more than 200 people made homeless in that campaign to terrorize those who voted for the opposition.
 ''At the time of our visit to the Mutare M.D.C. office, there were 106 children under the age of 12 and 113 adults (many of whom were elderly) camped in the open at the office grounds (sharing one toilet and with running water only for several hours at night),'' the team wrote on its return to Harare. 
 As the wait for the outcome of Zimbabwe's presidential election has dragged on for weeks, postponed in part to accommodate a partial recount of the parliamentary election held the same day, many opposition officials and leaders of civic groups have come to believe the delays were meant to buy time for ZANU-PF, the governing party, to carry out a campaign to intimidate the opposition ahead of a runoff. 
 There is also evidence that the government is seeking to intimidate aid groups that have the resources to help victims of the violence. One such group reported in a confidential April 16 e-mail message, obtained independently by The New York Times, that senior officials in rural districts had told them to stop distributing food until the presidential race was over or risk being seen as ''buying votes'' on behalf of Western donors. The group stated in the message that it had suspended food distributions. 
 On Friday, officials from the group, reached for comment about the message, pleaded not to be identified for fear that the government would bar them from working in the country and maintained that they had restarted food assistance.
 Senior officials in Mr. Mugabe's party have denied that it has organized attacks on the opposition. The justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, who lost his own parliamentary seat in the elections, has suggested it is the opposition that has fomented violence, and he challenged those accusing the party to come forward with proof. 
 The miseries of the people in Mutare -- supported by the accounts of residents and the photographic and video record of their homelessness -- are a microcosm of the violence that human rights groups say is now escalating across areas of the countryside where the opposition made major inroads into Mr. Mugabe's strongholds. 
 The ruling party has used the same kinds of violent tactics before. In 2005, Mr. Mugabe's government carried out a vast slum clearance effort called Operation Drive Out Trash in the opposition's urban bastions. It displaced 700,000 people, according to United Nations estimates. 
 Much of the fury now is against country people. Their homes and granaries have been demolished, their goats, chickens and cows slaughtered, their bodies beaten. In the weeks leading to the election, they worked for the opposition in growing numbers as they found themselves pushed ever deeper into destitution by the economy's implosion. 
 A doctor in Harare who said he had treated more than 200 victims of the violence in recent weeks visited Mashonaland East Province before the vote and watched as rural people campaigned openly, even putting posters on their cows' backs.
 ''They were enjoying themselves,'' said the doctor, who spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. ''They thought, 'Here is freedom. Here is democracy.' Now these same people are victims. They are targeted.''
 Tonderai Chakanetsa, a farmer from the Mudzi district of Mashonaland East, was one of those opposition workers. In an interview in Harare he described how he, his wife and their five children went into hiding in the forest early this month when they heard militias for the president's party were on the rampage.
 But when they ran out of food on April 16, he went home for more provisions. He was attacked as he locked up to leave, struck on the neck with a blunt object. ''I remember that suddenly some people started singing ZANU-PF songs and accused me of being a traitor,'' he said. Interviewed as he lay in a hospital bed, Mr. Chakanetsa had wounds on his face and back and trouble standing because his legs had been hurt. He had also been beaten on the soles of his feet.
 He escaped and made his way to the capital, Harare, but still did not know how his family was surviving in the forest. ''Based on what I experienced at the hands of ZANU-PF, revenge is uppermost in my mind if I go back home,'' he said.
 According to witness accounts provided to human rights researchers and journalists, organizers of the attacks have included ministers and members of Parliament from the governing party, as well as senior military officials. The accounts say ruling-party youth militias, veterans of the liberation struggle, soldiers and police officers have administered the beatings that are intrinsic to ''Operation Where Did You Put Your X?'' -- a campaign against those who marked ballots for the opposition.
 Some of the farmers interviewed in recent days said their attackers had demanded lists of opposition party members in their areas, including Daniel Muchuchuti, a farmer and opposition worker in a rural part of Masvingo Province. He said they broke into his house on April 8 after he and his wife had gone to bed.
 ''They dragged me outside and started kicking me and my wife,'' he said. Two of his front teeth were knocked out and three ribs were broken. He fled to Harare for medical care. He is afraid to go home, but said he did not know how his four children would survive without his labor.
 The impoverished farm workers who were uprooted north of Mutare said the farm they called home had been invaded in recent years by war veterans linked to Mr. Mugabe's party. The veterans drove off the white farmer who owned the farm and who had kept as many as 200 people employed in harvest season, they said.
 Now the workers say the farm is unproductive and they are unemployed. Many openly supported the opposition, despite threats from the veterans that they would be evicted unless they voted for ZANU-PF.
 Milton and other residents said the police came on April 13 and told them they would have to vacate their homes. 
 ''The owner didn't want us anymore,'' Milton said the police told them. ''We were from the opposition and his enemies.'' 
 His children, an 8-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy, cried bitterly at being forced out, he said, and the family watched in sadness as their two-room home with a small veranda went up in smoke.

HEADLINE: Provost Quits Over Degree to Governor's Child

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va. 

 BODY:
The provost of West Virginia University said Sunday that he would resign after being criticized for his handling of a master's degree that was improperly awarded to the governor's daughter. 
 In a memorandum sent Sunday to the deans who report to him, the provost, Gerald Lang, said an independent report on the controversy had persuaded him to step down after 32 years of involvement with the university in Morgantown.
 ''I am very sorry that my one action in ratifying a dean's decision in a single situation has had a negative impact on the institution,'' Mr. Lang wrote. ''I love this place and would never intentionally take an action that would reflect negatively upon it.''
 The memorandum will be distributed on Monday, a university spokeswoman, Amy Neil, said. The university will have no comment until then, Ms. Neil said.
 In the memorandum, Mr. Lang said his resignation would be effective June 30. ''I hope this decision will begin the healing process and focus attention onto the future,'' he said.
 Last week, a five-member independent panel led by two university faculty members issued a report saying that high-ranking academic officers and administration officials showed ''seriously flawed'' judgment last fall in revising the academic records of Heather Bresch, a daughter of Gov. Joe Manchin III and an executive at Mylan Inc. Ms. Bresch was awarded an executive master of business administration degree that she had not earned.
 Mr. Manchin would not comment on Mr. Lang's resignation, a spokeswoman, Lara Ramsburg, said Sunday. ''We leave those issues to W.V.U.,'' Ms. Ramsburg said. 
 The Associated Press sent an e-mail message to Ms. Bresch seeking comment Sunday on the resignation.
 The administrators who awarded the degree lacked documentation to prove her claims that she had finished her final semester with work experience credits, relying too heavily on oral assertions and caving to political pressure -- whether real or perceived, the panel said.
 The harshest words fell on Mr. Lang, the school's chief academic officer, and R. Stephen Sears, dean of the College of Business and Economics, who, the report said, ''should have treated Ms. Bresch like they would or should have treated any other student.''
 In the days after the report's release, calls on top officials to resign came from within the university and from around the state. The Charleston Gazette, the state's largest newspaper, said resignations were necessary, and some members of the faculty said Mr. Lang, Mr. Sears and the university's president, Mike Garrison, should resign.

HEADLINE: Reluctantly, A Daily Stops Its Presses, Living Online

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
With print revenue down and online revenue growing, newspaper executives are anticipating the day when big city dailies and national papers will abandon their print versions.
 That day has arrived in Madison, Wis.
 On Saturday, The Capital Times, the city's fabled 90-year-old daily newspaper founded in response to the jingoist fervor of World War I, stopped printing to devote itself to publishing its daily report on the Web. 
 (The staff will also produce two print products: a free weekly entertainment guide inserted in the crosstown paper, The Wisconsin State Journal, and a news weekly that will be distributed with the paper.) 
 An avowedly progressive paper that carried the banner of its founder, William T. Evjue, The Capital Times is wrapped up with the history of two larger-than-life Wisconsin senators, the elder Robert La Follette (whom it favored) and Joseph R. McCarthy (whom it opposed). But in recent years, the paper's circulation dropped to about 18,000 from a high in the 1960s of more than 40,000.
 ''We felt our audience was shrinking so that we were not relevant,'' Clayton Frink, the publisher of The Capital Times, said in an interview two days before the final daily press run. ''We are going a little farther, a little faster, but the general trend is happening everywhere.''
 The transition in Madison, while long foretold -- The Capital Times was doubly part of a dying breed, being the afternoon paper in a two-newspaper town -- has hardly been neat and clean and cathartic.
 More than 20 members of the newsroom staff lost their jobs, mainly through buyouts, but also through layoffs. Each departing journalist was profiled in the final paper, and lives on at the Web site Madison.com under the headline ''A Fond Farewell to Talented Colleagues,'' with a ''class photo'' taken next to the presses.
 The new staff total will be in the 40s. This includes seven new hires in areas like Web producing and arts coverage. Copy editors, by contrast, are ''exiting at a higher rate than reporters,'' said Paul Fanlund, the editor who arrived from The State Journal in 2006. 
 The Web strategy, while seen as a long-term solution, is still a work in progress, Mr. Fanlund says. It revolves around a portal, Madison.com, which is owned under the same joint arrangement mandating that both Madison papers share revenues, though they are editorially independent.
 The Capital Times will operate a nearly continuous Web newsroom and focus on repurposing online the cultural and entertainment material the staff will begin to produce in the supplement, 77 Square, to be inserted in The State Journal. 
 ''If there is a window of opportunity for newspapers on the Web, it is locally,'' said James L. Baughman, director of the University of Wisconsin journalism school in Madison. ''The reason the online version of the Cap Times may have life is that opportunity.''
 Once upon a time, the afternoon newspaper was the Internet of its day, Mr. Baughman said, giving afternoon baseball scores and stock market reports in a quick turnaround. It was the more lucrative slot as a result. 
 The liberal afternoon newspaper still has a sympathetic audience in Madison, but the changing pace of news is more important. ''The political activism is there, you can't deny it,'' he said of Madison's newspaper readers, ''but they want the morning box scores.'' 
 And while Mr. Fanlund takes pain to stress the need to continue the progressive editorials and watchdog role of the reinvented Capital Times, it is sports that serves as a perfect example of the changes he says have been long overdue.
 As an afternoon paper that did not publish on Sundays, he says, his sportswriters would be covering a college football game and ''it would be 48 hours until the articles would be read.'' Those writers, who will be making the transition online, ''see the Web as a new lease on life.''
 But the decision to migrate online, and in free weeklies, necessarily involves reinventing the core mission at the newspaper and the core audience. The subscribers to The Cap Times reliably moved to The State Journal, a less progressive paper with the morning slot. 
 In its account of The Capital Times's last daily press run, The State Journal reported that it had ''succeeded in garnering most of The Capital Times's former subscribers and will see its average daily circulation rise from 89,000 to at least 104,000 starting Monday.''
 In the Madison weekly Isthmus, one columnist wrote that the new Capital Times suddenly looked like a rival going after the same ''urban advertising market that Isthmus has cultivated for 32 years.''
 While acknowledging the long, proud print tradition there, the columnist, Marc Eisen, wrote: ''Cap Times editors and reporters see themselves as reimagining founder Bill Evjue's progressive vision for the Internet age. But, functionally, the new editions are all about the advertising.''
 Mr. Evjue is the old-world figure at the paper, the John Henry, of sorts, whose hammer -- his typewriter -- the staff still hears. The final paper showed him in a 1961 photograph pressing the button on new presses, embracing technological change.
 The final editorial of the print daily pledged itself to Mr. Evjue's purpose as ''an independent voice for peace and economic and social justice that speaks truth to power each and every day.'' 
 The editorial evoked him to give his endorsement of the steps the newspaper is taking: ''He would caution us not to worry about the form The Capital Times takes, but rather to be concerned with the content and character of our message.'' And, in its final words, to its final audience, wrote: ''All will be well.''

HEADLINE: LENDERS FIGHT STRICTER RULES ON MORTGAGES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The mortgage industry, facing the prospect of tougher regulations for its central role in the housing crisis, has begun an intensive campaign to fight back.
 As the Federal Reserve completes work on rules to root out abuses by lenders, its plan has run into a buzz saw of criticism from bankers, mortgage brokers and other parts of the housing industry. One common industry criticism is that at a time of tight credit, tighter rules could make many mortgages more expensive by creating more paperwork and potentially exposing lenders to more lawsuits.
 To the chagrin of consumer groups that have complained that the proposed rules are not strong enough, the industry's criticism has already prompted the Fed to consider narrowing the scope of the plan so it applies to fewer loans. 
 The debate over new mortgage standards comes in response to a severe crisis in the housing and financial markets that many economists trace back to overly loose credit and abusive loans. Those practices, combined with low interest rates, led to inflated market values that have declined rapidly in recent months as investors have begun to lose confidence in the financial instruments tied to those loans. 
 Four months ago, the Fed proposed the new standards on exotic mortgages and high-cost loans for people with weak credit. The Fed's proposals came after it was criticized sharply as a captive of the mortgage lending industry that had failed over many years to supervise it adequately.
 Proposals are pending in Congress on mortgage standards, but it is not clear whether they will be adopted this year. The Fed has its own authority under housing and lending laws to adopt mortgage standards.
 The plan presented by the Fed was proposed by its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Randall S. Kroszner, a former White House economist in the Bush administration who is now a Fed governor and leads the Fed's consumer and community affairs committee.
 The plan would not cover existing mortgages but would apply only to new ones. It would force mortgage companies to show that customers can realistically afford their mortgages. It would require lenders to disclose the hidden fees often rolled into interest payments. And it would prohibit certain types of advertising considered misleading.
 The Fed is expected to issue final rules this summer.
 Earlier this month, as the comment period was about to close, the Fed was deluged with more than 5,000 comments, mostly from lenders who said the proposals could affect loans that have not presented problems. Some bankers and brokers also said the rules would discourage them from lending to some creditworthy borrowers. 
 The plan was criticized in separate filings by three of the industry's most influential trade groups -- the American Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America. More modest concerns about some of the provisions were also raised by the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors.
 Regulators have been meeting about the proposals with bankers, brokers and consumer groups in recent weeks and are continuing to do so.
 Some of the groups seeking changes maintain that the proposals threaten to make borrowing for a home far more expensive and would unfairly deny mortgage brokers the right to earn certain fees. 
 Small community banks, which have played no significant role in the housing crisis, have urged the Fed to limit the scope of the proposed rules so that they do not discourage them from issuing loans. Lending groups have also raised concern that they would lead to frivolous and expensive litigation. 
 ''We support many of the provisions in the proposed rule, but we do have concerns about the increased regulatory burden, liability and reputational risks that lenders might face,'' said Kieran P. Quinn, chairman of Column Financial, Credit Suisse's mortgage lending subsidiary in Atlanta, and the chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 On at least one major aspect of the proposed restrictions -- how broadly they should apply -- the industry appears to be making headway. In a recent speech, Mr. Kroszner suggested that in response to criticism that the plan was including too many kinds of loans the Fed was considering whether to narrow the plan.
 ''We have heard from commenters who have expressed concern that in the current market environment, the proposed trigger could cover the market too broadly, and we will carefully consider the issues they raise and other possible approaches to achieve our objective,'' Mr. Kroszner said last month at a conference of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.
 Before this year, the Fed had applied an extra set of protection from abusive lending practices to a subset of subprime borrowers under the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act of 1994. The Fed has applied the law to fewer than 1 percent of all mortgages -- those with interest rates at least eight percentage points above prevailing rates on Treasury securities. 
 Some economists and housing experts say the Fed's lax oversight helped enable lending companies to reap enormous profits by providing millions of unsuitable and abusive loans to homeowners who often did not fully understand the terms or appreciate their risk. 
 As of January, the most recent month of available data, about a quarter of all subprime adjustable mortgages were delinquent, twice the level of the same period last year. Lenders began foreclosure proceedings on about 190,000 of these mortgages in the last three months of 2007.
 The new rules would apply extra protection to any mortgage with an interest rate three percentage points above Treasury rates. Officials said that they would cover all subprime loans, which accounted for about a quarter of all mortgages last year as well as many exotic mortgages known in the industry as ''Alt-A'' loans.
 These loans are made to people with relatively good credit scores but who might provide little documentation of their income or assets, or who make smaller than usual down payments or purchase loans that have unusual terms, like interest-only payments for an initial period.
 Many mortgage brokers and bankers complain that the lower threshold would unnecessarily include many borrowers who are not at risk from abusive practices.
 ''There are a lot of community banks that have shied away from these loans because nobody wants to be a higher-priced lender,'' said Karen Thomas, a lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers. ''With the trigger being set so low, it is encroaching on traditional, common sense mortgages. Our fear is it will result in less credit availability, which is not what we need in an already tight credit market.''
 But consumer groups say that the proposed rules are already weak and that efforts to further weaken them would render them all but useless.
 ''The Fed has accurately diagnosed that this is a brain tumor and responded by prescribing an aspirin,'' said Kathleen E. Keest, a former state regulator who is now a senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a group supporting home ownership. ''In the industry, there is a fair amount of denial. They just don't get it. There is a calamity within the industry, and they don't have a new script yet, so they rely on the old script, which is that regulation will raise costs.''
 But, she went on, ''What we now see is that the unintended consequences of deregulation are worse. Their line is that regulation will cut back access to credit. That's been their line ever since the small loan laws were adopted in the early 1900s.''
 At the same time, letters urging the Fed to further tighten the rules were sent by Sheila C. Bair, the Republican head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as senior members of the House Financial Services Committee.
 In her letter, Ms. Bair, whose agency regulates many banks, urged the Fed to apply the proposed restrictions to loans that are three percentage points or higher than equivalent Treasuries. To prevent lenders from evading the limit by creatively structuring the loan and fees, she also suggested that the Fed impose the tighter restrictions if the loan fees exceeded a dollar amount.
 While the Fed plan would require disclosures that could make it harder for lenders to include hidden sales fees that are usually paid to the mortgage broker, Ms. Bair suggested that the plan go further and ban some practices.
 The plan, for instance, would require subprime lenders to explicitly describe fees that are now hidden. But Ms. Bair has proposed the elimination of such fees, saying such a ban would ''eliminate compensation based on increasing the cost of credit and make the amount of the compensation more transparent to consumers.''
 Ms. Bair also proposed making it easier for borrowers to sue lenders without having to show that they were engaged in a pattern of abusive practices, which is a requirement under the proposed Fed rules. She said that forcing borrowers to show a pattern of abuse ''clearly favors lenders by limiting the number of individual consumer lawsuits and the ability of regulators to pursue individual violations.''
 Ms. Bair also recommended that the Fed eliminate a so-called safe harbor provision in the proposal that protects lenders who fail to verify the income or assets of a borrower in some circumstances.

HEADLINE: Olympic Protests, Then and Now

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

 BODY:
I was in Red Square one day during the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow when some poor protester apparently tried to set himself on fire. We never learned who he was or what really happened because of the amazing reaction of the authorities, which was caught on film by a tourist. 
 The first frame shows a tall flame and shocked tourists. In the next, a Volga sedan wheels into the square, then a middle-aged man is stuffed into the trunk. But in this and subsequent frames, the attention of the crowd is elsewhere -- every fourth man in the area is grabbing a camera, opening it and exposing the film. The tourist whose film I saw had been behind a tree away from the action. I suspect his was the only record of what happened. Most witnesses recalled only the fire and the goons grabbing their cameras. 
 It was an amazing display of the determination of Soviet authorities to allow nothing that would mar their grand show. ''O Sport, You Are Peace'' was the ubiquitous slogan on posters, souvenirs and T-shirts, but the Games had already opened under an American-led boycott over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That seemed only to redouble the Kremlin's efforts to crush the tiniest hint of discord or dissent.
 In the end, the 1980 Games revealed a lot more about the paranoia and ruthlessness of an authoritarian state than about its skill at organizing sports competitions -- at least to the West. Now, in the same way, we're learning a lot about China. And just as a lot of Russians then couldn't see a connection between their state's policies and the Games, many Chinese today seem genuinely angry and convinced that ''foreign enemies'' are deliberately trying to ruin their coming-out party. 
 I suspect that the International Olympic Committee also has not quite understood that a connection might be made between a country's human-rights record and hosting the Games.
 There are limits, of course, to the parallels between the sealed military camp that was the Soviet Union 28 years ago and the wealthy, exploding China of today. But that only makes the similarities in the reactions of the two Communist parties all the more striking. 
 The West may see China as the economic and military powerhouse of the 21st century, where presidents and magnates go to find a piece of the action. Yet the ruling party has remained remarkably ignorant of the rules of the open societies with which it deals, and remarkably insecure before every Tibetan or Uighur dissident, every human-rights activist and every Western critic. A state that sentences a dissident like Hu Jia to prison for ''inciting subversion of state power'' by linking the Games with human rights is not a self-confident one.
 Reared in a secretive, suspicious, paternalistic and highly bureaucratized culture, the Chinese Communist elite can only presume that the Western elites are like them, that protests over Darfur, Tibet or the persecution of dissidents are all cynical political maneuvers. 
 The attacks on the torch, thus, can only be the work of ''enemies.'' And these are everywhere. On April 17, the Xinhua agency carried a report about a German group's call for protests over Tibet. This, it said, ''reinforced an impression about a puppet show going on along with the Olympic torch relay, with the Dalai Lama and his supporters on the stage and anti-China forces behind the curtain.''
 Statements like that feed a common notion in the West that protests and boycotts only harden China's views and rally its people around the party. ''Quiet diplomacy,'' in this school of thought, is the more useful approach. Certainly it is more useful for governments and businesses seeking contracts in China. But is it effective? A Western diplomat hinting quietly that releasing a dissident would be good for China's image might only feed the sense that human rights are about public relations.
 In the end, debating whether mass protest or quiet diplomacy is more effective misses the point. The protests along the torch's route, including those on Sunday in South Korea, were not concocted by German think tanks, but were mostly an expression of genuine anger by people in free societies. That may not persuade the Chinese of the value of human rights, but they may learn that the cost of cynicism can be high.

HEADLINE: For 9/11 Wall, a Little Support And a Permanent Place

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center will not open for at least three years. But on his visit last week, Pope Benedict XVI was able to see -- in situ -- the largest single exhibit that the museum will offer.
 A 62-by-64-foot section of the trade center's original foundation wall, called a slurry wall, preserved and exposed, will occupy the heart of the enormous West Chamber of the underground museum. This wall section is identifiable because it looks much the way it did seven years ago. It was clearly visible from the spot where the pope blessed ground zero on April 20. 
 Elsewhere along the slurry wall, steel caisson cores have been erected where a new concrete liner will be poured in front of the old wall. The liner wall system will strengthen the slurry wall against caving in or leaking. Floor slabs in the trade center's basement once provided that extra bracing. High-strength steel cables, known as tiebacks, do so now.
 ''We are confident that it is safe at this stage,'' said Raymond E. Sandiford, chief geotechnical engineer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is constructing the museum. ''But we wouldn't want to rely on it for 100 years. We have to either line the slurry wall or reinforce the exposed wall so that the loads on it are very minimal.''
 The idea of displaying the slurry wall can be traced to a proposal in 2002 by the architect Daniel Libeskind, who was designated master planner of the trade center site. He said then that the walls around the site had ''withstood the unimaginable trauma of the destruction and stand as eloquent as the Constitution itself, asserting the durability of democracy and the value of individual life.''
 Six years later, the idea has survived.
 ''The core power of this site, the reason it resonates with so many people, is that this is where the tragedy took place,'' said Joseph C. Daniels, president and chief executive of the memorial and museum. ''The notion of authenticity and using actual artifacts that have a connection right back to that event is something this museum will be exhibiting and showcasing as much as possible.''
 However, there were sometimes stormy debates over what part of the slurry wall -- if any -- could be preserved, as a matter of practicality and economics, and how it could be done from an engineering standpoint.
 Steven M. Davis of Davis Brody Bond Aedas, the museum architects, advocated saving a large part of the wall, as did the engineers, Milan Vatovec, of Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, and Guy Nordenson, of Guy Nordenson & Associates. Others involved with the reconstruction of ground zero were not entirely persuaded that it was worth the effort, cost and potential risk.
 It was not until last July that it was determined that the construction budget could support the preservation of three original slurry wall panels, each about 20 feet wide, but no more. The wall is 64 feet high; more precisely, 64 feet below street level. Museum officials said it would cost $11 million to preserve that much of the wall.
 ''It's great that we were able to get that large a section,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We wish we lived in a world where we could get more. But we're pleased that we have a representation of this icon, since much of the design of the museum is concerned with the preservation of historic resources.''
 The new permanent support behind the old slurry wall is called a pilaster wall or a counterfort, referring to its role as a buttress. It consists of a concrete wall that is stiffened by large, discrete pillars (or pilasters) that are four to five feet thick. It will be further reinforced with new tiebacks -- steel bars that are two and a half inches in diameter -- anchored to bedrock.
 One of the first steps in preserving the slurry wall section began last Monday with the construction of a temporary cutoff wall to create a barrier against the high groundwater around the trade center site. This will permit the soil in the construction area to be drained so that excavation can begin directly behind the old wall.
 Digging will be done manually, in pits just large enough for workers to maneuver, because it has to go through a dense field of diagonal steel cable tiebacks, which tie the slurry wall back into bedrock. The tiebacks' ''high hat'' steel anchor heads embedded in the wall surface are what give the wall such a distinctive appearance.
 The old slurry wall and the tiebacks are not destined simply to be aesthetic relics. ''They will be a redundant system, which is not a bad idea,'' said Mr. Sandiford, of the Port Authority.
 What the public will see in 2011 is not exactly the slurry wall that existed in 2001. The anchor heads are those of tiebacks that were installed after 9/11 to stabilize the wall. And the surface has since been covered with a protective coating of liquefied concrete known as shotcrete.
 Mr. Daniels, the memorial and museum president, said he did not think the shotcrete coating diminished the power of the artifact; instead, he said, it expanded the story by offering evidence of the recovery and reconstruction effort.
 Some critical details of the future wall display have yet to be settled. For instance, an existing inclined buttress slab at the base of the wall may make it impossible for the museum to permit visitors to get close enough to touch the wall. Mr. Daniels said museum officials will explore ways to offer a ''tactile opportunity.''
 ''We think the slurry wall could take on the resonance of the Wailing Wall,'' he continued. ''The idea of being able to get that connection, which will link you to the past, is important.''

HEADLINE: With Slump Paramount, Fed Is Likely to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This time, will the Fed's words speak louder than its actions?
 Two days ahead of a Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting this week, the widely shared consensus is that the Fed is likely to cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to 2 percent from 2.25 percent, signaling that while financial markets have stabilized somewhat, concerns about an American economic downturn remain paramount.
 There is always a chance for a surprise, Fed watchers say. 
 ''I think it's going to be a contentious meeting,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed board member who is now a senior adviser at the Stanford Washington Research Group. ''There are lots of people on the board who have demonstrated they are pretty hawkish on inflation, and developments in the past month have given them ammunition.''
 Lowering the rate for a seventh time since August would be consistent with the comments by Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, that a recession is still possible this year and that, as Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. puts it, the risks are to the downside.
 Beyond what the Fed does, economists and other specialists will be looking for what it says. 
 Of particular interest is whether the Fed hints that this might be the last rate cut for a while, as many experts think, on the ground that further reductions will fan inflation and send the dollar to further lows.
 ''I don't think there's any question that they'll cut 25 basis points off the rate,'' said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist of Merrill Lynch. The real question is what they say about the future. It won't be an 'all clear' signal. But they'll find a way to tell the markets that they've done enough for now, simply put.''
 The reaction in the stock market has been positive of late, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising nearly 10 percent since a 17-month low on March 10. 
 The meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday, is of the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the Fed board of governors and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks.
 A month ago, the committee met on the heels of the Fed's startling participation in the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, an action Mr. Bernanke defended as necessary to avert market turmoil and the possible collapse of financial institutions.
 The Fed's involvement came in the form of an emergency $29 billion loan in return for mortgage-related securities of uncertain value as collateral.
 The committee also lowered the federal funds rate, the rate it charges banks for overnight loans, by three-quarters of a point, to the current 2.25 percent. Trying to still the chaos in the markets, it left the door open to more rate cuts if necessary.
 But two members of the committee dissented, saying that a smaller cut would have been preferable in light of the danger of inflation. The disagreement opened an unusual window into the Federal Reserve's internal debates under the leadership of Mr. Bernanke, who has called for greater transparency at an institution known for its secrecy.
 If anything, inflation fears have increased in the last few weeks. Soaring prices for food, oil and other commodities appear to be inflicting as much pain on Americans as unemployment and the shriveling of the mortgage market. These trends are certain to be a matter of lively discussion this week.
 It is hardly new for the Fed to be caught between a need to lower rates to stimulate the economy and a need to raise them to ward off inflation. 
 But added to these concerns is the weak dollar, which is helping to push up oil prices because oil is priced in dollars and oil producers are unhappy when cheaper dollars cut into their income. The cheaper dollar is also leading speculators to buy oil and other commodities, contributing to spikes in food and gold prices.
 If the Fed does signal a pause in lowering rates, it will not be welcome among many who feel that, with problems persisting in housing, the danger of a deepening economic slump should be the higher priority. ''It's our core view that financial conditions remain very stressed,'' said Lewis S. Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup. ''If what the Fed does is interpreted as precluding further action, it's going to hinder recovery of the markets and indicate a more downside risk for the economy.''
 A tricky aspect of the Fed's decision is that the impact of whatever it does may not be felt for more than six months. Many economists say it takes at least that long for interest rate cuts to have an economic effect.
 Similarly, the Fed may be waiting for the first signs of the impact of the tax rebates, which will begin going out this week.
 ''We're at the point in the monetary cycle where there are a wide range of opinions,'' said Bruce Kasman, chief economist of JPMorgan Chase. ''Most likely, their statement will reflect both sides of the risk spectrum. Inflation will get its paragraph, but we'll be hearing about an economy that remains quite weak.''

HEADLINE: Faltering Economy Plays to a Clinton Strength

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

DATELINE: FORT WAYNE, Ind. 

 BODY:
All politicians talk about jobs, but these days Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton does it with tactile, almost sensuous detail. She began a rally here on Saturday morning with memories of her father's fabric-printing business, feeling aloud the cloth, the silk screen and the squeegee he used to create patterns that would decorate strangers' drapes. 
 ''I'm trying to paint a word picture, and when I think about helping my dad at his print plant, it's very physical, the memories,'' she recalled in an interview after the crowds had dispersed. 
 Mrs. Clinton has spent her whole life climbing the ladders of education, wealth and power. Now, as part of her effort to hold off Senator Barack Obama and claim the Democratic presidential nomination, she is climbing back down them, sounding less like a Wellesley alumna than Roseanne Barr's old sitcom character, the den mother of her factory floor.
 Mrs. Clinton's campaign has hung on in part by asserting that Mr. Obama cannot win the crucial category of white working-class Democrats. Those men and women won her the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries, and for the logic of her campaign to hold, they must again side with her in Indiana, where polls suggest the race could be tight.
 So every speech she gave in Indiana on Friday and Saturday had the same topic sentence. ''My campaign is about jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs,'' she said, always to thunderous applause. 
 In Bloomington, she promised to bring nothing less than economic revolution to the decaying Rust Belt. ''You've heard of white-collar jobs and blue-collar jobs,'' she told her Fort Wayne audience, setting up a line about how efforts to address global warming and other environmental problems could spawn new industries. ''We're going to create green-collar jobs.''
 At a union hall in garbage-strewn Gary, Mrs. Clinton began her early-evening speech looking wan. But as she began talking about magnets and wheel bases, her eyes grew rounder and her small hands danced with expressive energy. She sounded as if, once she is done with the presidency business, she might like to try the steel one, joining those in the audience wearing ''Women of Steel'' T-shirts.
 Since the race started, Mrs. Clinton has cycled through several political personas: the battle-tested White House veteran, the fighter, the girl -- her word -- tougher than any boy. Now she is the Dream Boss: the one who will give you a job and provide health insurance, but also understand just how hard you work and the mundane details of what you do. Mrs. Clinton has a reputation as an effective listener, and she is finally putting that skill to full use in her appearances, showing her audiences how closely she tracks their concerns.
 ''Most people get a lot of meaning in their life from the work that they do,'' she said in the interview. ''People want to be seen, they want to be appreciated, they want to be acknowledged.''
 At the union hall in Gary, she grew so animated in describing the plight of old-line industrial workers that she described them in language from the oft-repeated poem, attributed to the German pastor Martin Niemoller, about the victims of Nazism. ''First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Socialist,'' goes the version inscribed on a wall at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. After coming for the trade unionists, it continues, ''they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Jew.''
 In Mrs. Clinton's version, she intoned: ''They came for the steel companies and nobody said anything. They came for the auto companies and nobody said anything. They came for the office companies, people who did white-collar service jobs, and no one said anything. And they came for the professional jobs that could be outsourced, and nobody said anything.''
 ''So this is not just about steel,'' she finished.
 Next, she shared the alarming news that American radiologists are losing jobs because X-rays are being sent electronically to India. But according to Frank Levy, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is only one firm in India that reads American images. The overseas radiologists who read American images are generally United States citizens themselves, Mr. Levy said, because doctors who have not passed American boards cannot be insured against malpractice.
 In these speeches, Mrs. Clinton moves smoothly from her audience's job concerns to her own. 
 ''Think about other important personnel decisions you have made,'' Mrs. Clinton urges, like choosing a surgeon to operate on a loved one or a negotiator for a new union contract.
 She never mentions just who the Democrats should be having second thoughts about. Instead she talks about her husband's years in office, playing on the prosperity that most voters enjoyed during the 1990s. 
 ''Each time a Bush became president, I was laid off,'' said Bill Campbell, 42, a machine operator who came to hear Mrs. Clinton speak in Bloomington. ''When Bill was president, I did well.''
 Mr. Campbell was far from the only man in the crowd, but in Bloomington and elsewhere, the men were significantly outnumbered. In particular, nurses and teachers flooded Mrs. Clinton's events. ''I'm a schoolteacher and she does her homework,'' said Nancy White, 69, in Bloomington. 
 Nearly all the crowds were large -- several seemed to cross the thousand-person mark -- and noisily appreciative. 
 After the event in Fort Wayne, Mrs. Clinton greeted supporter after ardent supporter waiting in the chilly wind, her quilted black Chanel-style coat and subtly highlighted hairdo contrasting with the many untended dye jobs and chapped, makeup-less faces.
 ''I was going to go to Wellesley, but I was going to have to pay back so much,'' a young woman told her.
 Another locked eyes with the candidate and mouthed a message: You're going to win, she said silently.

HEADLINE: Making Their Own Mistakes

 BODY:
When Pervez Musharraf was running Pakistan he repeatedly cut deals with tribal leaders intended to calm the country's lawless regions. The results were always disastrous. The Taliban and Al Qaeda used the time to regroup and launch attacks both inside Pakistan and against Afghanistan. 
 Now Pakistan's newly elected civilian government is trying again. We doubt it will have any more luck. The new leaders will need to do a better job than Mr. Musharraf monitoring developments along the border. And they need to develop a military fallback plan for when this deal falls apart. 
 It is not surprising that the new government is trying to set its own course. When then-General Musharraf and the United States did battle the extremists, both showed a lack of concern for civilian casualties. Mr. Musharraf never tried to explain why it was in Pakistan's interest to fight at all. It was always Washington's war. 
 The latest agreement, as reported by The Times, would require the tribes to expel foreign militants, cease their own attacks and kidnappings, and allow freedom of movement to the Frontier Corps, the local security force. The deal also calls for an exchange of prisoners in return for the gradual withdrawal of the Pakistani military from part of the tribal region of South Waziristan. 
 The top militant leader accused of masterminding former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination has ordered his fighters to halt activities in the regions.
 The Bush administration doesn't like the deal, but its own policy failure is undeniable. The C.I.A. calls the lawless border ''a clear and present danger'' to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the West. A recent Congressional investigation says the administration never developed a comprehensive plan -- one integrating diplomacy, intelligence, law enforcement and economic aid -- to address that clear and present danger. 
 Since 9/11, the United State has poured $10 billion into Pakistan -- mostly for ex-General Musharraf's army. But it has not crushed Al Qaeda or managed to shut down militant safe havens. American intelligence officials say Al Qaeda is gaining strength in its Pakistani refuge.
 The new democratic government so far has exceeded expectations: rival politicians are cooperating and they have promised to lift media restrictions and make other needed reforms. It deserves Washington's support and some time to find its way. 
 American officials need to work quietly with the new government to lay the ground for a new military strategy, should the peace agreement unravel. And it needs to do a lot more to help strengthen Pakistan's democracy and improve the lives of ordinary Pakistanis. 
 The Bush administration may -- finally -- throw its weight behind Senator Joseph Biden's call for a $2.5 billion package of additional nonmilitary aid. The administration and Congress should approve that aid immediately. That will give the new government more political room to go after the militants if yet another peace deal falls apart. And it is the only hope of persuading Pakistanis that this is more than just Washington's fight.

HEADLINE: Eyes on Blue-Collar Voters, Obama Shifts Style

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ADAM NAGOURNEY. 
Jeff Zeleny reported from Anderson, Ind., and Adam Nagourney from Washington.

DATELINE: ANDERSON, Ind. 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama is making subtle changes to his campaign style and message in an effort to strengthen his appeal to blue-collar voters and to avoid a defeat in Indiana that aides fear could give Democratic Party leaders further pause about his viability in a general election.
 On Sunday, Mr. Obama went to a Methodist church in Indianapolis, the kind of event rarely on his public schedule. He suited up for a game of basketball on Friday night before television cameras. And the big, energy-filled stadium rallies that were the bread and butter for most of his campaign have once again given way to smaller town-hall-style meetings, where he is seen talking with people and not at them.
 Mr. Obama is seeking to absorb the lessons of his defeat in Pennsylvania. The changes reflect concern that he is being portrayed by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as distant and culturally out of touch with many working-class Democrats, a worry underlined by her lopsided victory among many of those voters in that state on Tuesday and last month in Ohio. 
 Mr. Obama, in an appearance with Chris Wallace broadcast over the weekend on ''Fox News Sunday,'' played down his problems among blue-collar voters, saying that Mrs. Clinton had done better in part because ''they are less familiar with me than they are with her, and so we probably have to work harder.''
 ''I've got to be more present,'' he said. ''I've got to be knocking on more doors. I've got to be hitting more events. We've got to work harder because although it's flipped a little bit, we've always been the underdog in this race.''
 In interviews with several associates and aides, Mr. Obama was described as bored with the campaign against Mrs. Clinton and eager to move into the general election against Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee.
 So the Obama campaign is undertaking modifications in his approach intended to inject an air of freshness into his style. 
 In strategy sessions last week, advisers concluded that Mr. Obama, of Illinois, needed to do a better job reminding voters of his biography, including his modest upbringing by a single mother and one of his first jobs as a community organizer helping displaced steel mill workers. He also has to sharpen his economic message, they said, to improve his appeal and connection with voters in hope of capitalizing on the sensibilities that served him well in Midwestern states.
 Mr. Obama's advisers are also debating whether he should give another major speech intended to lay out themes of his candidacy -- particularly the change he would bring to Washington -- that they fear have been muddled in one of the toughest months of his campaign.
 But Mr. Obama swatted aside a call by Mrs. Clinton, of New York, for a debate before the primaries on May 6 in Indiana and North Carolina. His performance in the last debate, before the Pennsylvania primary, was widely viewed as flat and uninspired, and his decision not to risk a rematch suggested a desire to try to keep his message more fully under his control. 
 Mr. Obama closed his Pennsylvania primary campaign by delivering a sharp scolding of Mrs. Clinton's record. His tone has since taken a noticeable shift toward the positive, reflecting the view of some of his supporters that the attacks on Mrs. Clinton may have been a mistake. 
 As a result, they said, he had decided -- at least for now -- not to take on Mrs. Clinton directly. In one sign of that, he has spent more time trying to shore up his own shortcomings and challenges, often to the point of nearly ignoring her, as he intensified his attacks on Mr. McCain.
 But questions face his campaign that were barely discussed among his advisers only a few months ago, when he seemed on the cusp of quickly winning the Democratic nomination. Is his candidacy now off the table for some white voters? Was it bound to happen anyway? Have voters' concerns about his patriotism and religion become a permanent weight on his biography?
 Mr. Obama's aides said that they remained confident he would win the nomination. ''We feel very good about the position that we are in,'' said David Axelrod, his chief strategist. ''But we have gotten to the position we are in by taking every week and every contest seriously.''
 Still, they said they were no longer as hopeful as they once were that the contest could be resolved before June 3, the day of the last primaries. As a result, they were girding for six weeks of attacks by Mrs. Clinton and potential election defeats that could raise further questions among superdelegates -- the elected Democrats and party leaders who will ultimately determine the nominee -- about Mr. Obama's strength as a general election candidate. 
 Mr. Obama's best hope for avoiding a prolonged contest, associates said, is to defeat Mrs. Clinton here, as well as in North Carolina, next month. Accordingly, Mr. Obama is making a particularly intense effort in this state, which appears highly competitive. Radio and television commercials are blanketing the airwaves. An army of volunteers is being organized to drive into Indiana. The campaign has opened 22 offices in an effort to mimic its success in the Iowa caucuses. 
 While Mrs. Clinton has raised enough money to compete aggressively in Indiana, Mr. Obama's overall advantage in fund-raising is allowing him to build a heavier presence in the other states still on the calendar.
 A victory in Indiana, some Obama associates said, might make it more difficult for Mrs. Clinton to go on and send even more superdelegates toward his camp. Which was why Mr. Obama, on a trip through central Indiana this weekend, spent his spare minutes dialing uncommitted superdelegates. Back in Chicago, a more sophisticated operation was methodically checking in with superdelegates who had already pledged to Mr. Obama -- just to make certain there had not been any slippage.
 That said, a loss in Indiana could be problematic for Mr. Obama in no small part because it adjoins his home state. And even before the presidential race, he was a familiar face to voters in northwest Indiana who watch Chicago television stations.
 When Mr. Obama walked into his campaign events this weekend, no music played from the loudspeakers. At a stop on Saturday in Marion, Ind., the applause quickly subsided as he took his seat on a stool and listened as a local resident, Bernard Smith, 55, told of how he was laid off from his job at a plant in town after 31 years. His income reduced by half, he now works at the Dollar General store.
 Mr. Obama's sleeves were rolled up, his suit jacket left behind stage. He took questions for nearly an hour, often weaving in the fact that he was raised by a single mother and his grandparents. ''Nobody is looking for a handout,'' the senator said. ''Nobody is looking for easy street.''
 In discussions with donors and supporters last week, Mr. Obama's advisers played down the loss in Pennsylvania, noting that both sides had expected Mrs. Clinton to win there. 
 Still, the message belied private frustration and disappointment that Mr. Obama shared with a few associates and advisers, particularly over the hardening narrative that he could not appeal to working-class voters, and a personal frustration for comments he made about some small-town voters being ''bitter'' at their economic conditions. (Mrs. Clinton seized on those remarks, which have shadowed his campaign.)
 ''Everyone's got a real calmness about where we are,'' said David Plouffe, who is Mr. Obama'scampaign manager, ''but a real sense of urgency that we have eight contests coming up in pretty rapid succession.''
 Mr. Obama, who often complains aloud about the rigors of the campaign, had been scheduled to spend Sunday with his family in Chicago. But fearful of losing Indiana, he told his advisers that he wanted to campaign, so two events were hastily added.
 The senator attended services at St. Luke's United Methodist Church, a visit intended to help contradict the fictitious rumor that he was not Christian. And in addition to a game of 3-on-3 basketball in Kokomo, he also dropped by the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.
 For the last year, advisers had been reluctant to highlight him playing basketball, thinking it could raise racial stereotypes or make him look less serious. But in Indiana, where basketball is sacrosanct, Mr. Obama scored four baskets and his team won the 20-minute game, a far better showing than his much-derided bowling outing in Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Kremlin Joins Russians Keeping an Eye on Prices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Tamara V. Nikolskaya was laden with plastic shopping bags, scurrying about the Enthusiast outdoor market in eastern Moscow on Friday to pick up last-minute items for Sunday's Orthodox Easter feast. 
 ''Yes, prices are rising,'' she said, as she scrutinized loaves of bread at one of the many stalls bedecked with goods for the Easter rush.
 Government officials have also been watching price tags warily. Though typically insulated from public criticism, the Kremlin has been particularly sensitive to the effects that rising food costs might have on Russians as their country begins to succumb to a global trend that has sparked street protests by hungry citizens in some countries. 
 As inflation rates approached 12 percent last year, the government imposed export tariffs and introduced a price freeze on some staple goods amid fears of public dissatisfaction ahead of recent elections. 
 With President Vladimir V. Putin's party now firmly in control of the Parliament and his hand-picked successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, set to assume the presidency next month, the government has decided to repeal some of these measures. Still, fears of a new spike in food costs, which could undermine the Kremlin's previously unshakable popularity, remain evident. 
 With a 6 percent increase in food prices since Jan. 1 and some economists warning that year-end inflation could reach 13 percent, concern among government officials is warranted, analysts say. 
 The issue has exposed a rare split in the government between the nation's top two economic heavyweights. The Kremlin is trying to forge an economic policy that would prolong Russia's strong economic performance while avoiding the pitfalls of high economic growth that drew the United States into the subprime mortgage crisis. 
 Aleksei L. Kudrin, the finance minister who is known for his fiscally conservative policies, has called for sharp cuts in federal spending to prevent economic overheating. Such a policy could be unpopular and could harm domestic producers in the short term, but it would, Mr. Kudrin said, help bring inflation under control. 
 Lowered spending would also tone down Russia's impressive economic growth, something Elvira S. Nabiullina, the economic development and trade minister, has said that Russia would do well to avoid. The economy grew by around 8 percent last year -- the fastest of Mr. Putin's tenure. 
 Ms. Nabiullina has called for increased spending on transportation, energy and other infrastructure projects to ensure that the economy keeps humming, a policy echoed by President Putin, who will become prime minister shortly after Mr. Medvedev's inauguration on May 7. 
 Though many analysts have questioned the sustainability of such spending, few consider Russia's current economic predicament a major calamity. 
 ''Relative to the other crises Russia has had over the years, this is a pretty minor situation,'' said Roland Nash, the chief strategist at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank based in Moscow. 
 Higher commodity prices on average are good for Russia because of the country's large export-based economy, Mr. Nash said, especially since wages for all but the poorest have kept abreast of the rising costs. 
 ''I don't expect there to be queues for bread in the shops,'' he said. ''Russia learned that lesson a long time ago.'' 
 Russians' real income has increased 25 percent over the last two years, and the number of people living below the poverty line declined by 23 percent, Tatyana Golikova, Russia's health minister, said in a news conference on Friday. However, if incomes and rising fixed costs, such as utilities, are adjusted for inflation, about half of this gain is lost. Real disposable income adjusted for inflation was up 10.6 percent in February compared with the previous year, according to the government statistics agency.
 Still, neither Ms. Nikolskaya nor many others bustling around the market on Friday seemed particularly concerned about rising costs, even as some of the Russian news media had warned of food shortages, ration cards and bread lines reminiscent of the Soviet days.
 ''For now, everything is fine,'' Ms. Nikolskaya, an elderly Muscovite, said. ''I've already bought the kulichi, and the eggs are already painted,'' she said, referring to traditional Easter cakes, which one popular Moscow bakery said had gone up in price by 10 and 20 percent this year. 
 Consumer confidence is high, and a sense of panic is lacking at present. Yet two-thirds of the population considered rising prices the main issue that Mr. Medvedev should tackle upon taking office, according to a recent poll. 
 Many Muscovites can afford to splurge every once in a while on a fancy Easter cake and perhaps a new car. Outside the capital, the mood appears different. Average monthly wages in Moscow had reached about $1,300 by January, according to the government statistics agency. Out of view of Moscow's shimmering new skyscrapers, however, average earnings can be as low as $250 a month, though prices of staple goods generally tend to be less than those in the capital. 
 Retired people, as usual, have had the most difficulties. 
 ''Earlier, I could afford to buy many things and went to the market frequently,'' said Tatyana N. Ivanova, a retiree with wispy purple hair shopping at the Enthusiasts market. 
 ''It is difficult for pensioners,'' she said, ''because we have barely enough to live on.'' 
 While there have been no reports of food-related protests, the Kremlin must take measures to contain inflation quickly lest Mr. Medvedev lose the support of Russians accustomed to the steady wage increases and economic growth that made Mr. Putin so popular, said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
 ''While there is little, if any, interest to rally around human rights,'' she said, ''people do not hesitate to act when it comes to their economic well-being.''

HEADLINE: Yup. Things Were Different Before Clinton-Obama.

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Has Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's battle with Senator Barack Obama been going on forever, or does it just seem that way?
 For perspective, consider America as it was when the battle effectively began -- Oct. 22, 2006, when Mr. Obama said on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that he had changed his mind and was considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
 The average price of gas then stood at $2.20 a gallon. 
 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld directed war strategy in Iraq. 
 J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, as speaker of the House, and Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, called the signals in the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 Eliot Spitzer, poised to win the governorship of New York, was a rising star in national Democratic politics.
 Katie Couric was just seven weeks into her new job as anchor of the ''CBS Evening News.'' 
 Neither Peyton nor Eli Manning had won a Super Bowl.
 The length of the contest has become a factor all its own, testing the endurance, determination and sure-footedness of both campaigns. The trailing Mrs. Clinton, who focused her initial strategy on knocking Mr. Obama out in the coast-to-cast series of contests on Feb. 5, now aims to preserve her chances by extending the game -- to the August convention in Denver, if necessary.
 It's the Economy
 Since Mr. Obama edged toward the race, there have been two winters, two World Series champions, changes of government in Britain and France and the introduction of the Apple iPhone. There have also been profound changes in political circumstances. 
 In the fall of 2006, the war in Iraq dominated Americans' political agenda. Mr. Rumsfeld's stewardship, characterized by a relatively parsimonious approach to the commitment of troops, was under fire in both parties. But antiwar sentiment stoked rank-and-file Democrats so strongly that it helped to dislodge Republican Congressional majorities that November.
 That dynamic gave an edge to Mr. Obama, whose initial opposition to the Iraq war set him apart from Mrs. Clinton. That edge has since faded; the administration's post-Rumsfeld troop surge has reduced violence, if not secured major political gains, and has robbed the Iraq issue of some of its urgency.
 The reverse has happened with the economy. In November 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy had added jobs for the 38th consecutive month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 12,000 for the first time. A summer increase in gas prices had receded.
 Now, gas prices are at record highs, the Dow has fallen below 13,000, after topping 14,000 in 2007, and the economy has shed jobs for three consecutive months. The widespread expectation of a recession has helped Mrs. Clinton, whose advantage among working-class voters is built partly on nostalgia for the economic stewardship of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
 Whiskey and Hoops
 As a result, the candidates and their campaigns have had to change a lot more than their clothing to account for shifting weather.
 In her journey from front-runner to underdog, Mrs. Clinton has replaced her campaign manager and chief strategist and seen Mr. Clinton careen from political asset to liability and back again. Adapting tactics to openings Mr. Obama has provided, she has shelved the quavering emotion of mid-winter New Hampshire in favor of springtime expressions of grit; seeking a contrast with Mr. Obama's relationship to small-town America, she displayed her attachment to firearms and taste for whiskey shots in Pennsylvania.
 Mr. Obama's team has remained comparatively stable, but his 18-month trek has required adjustments of its own. The soaring speeches and mammoth crowds that fueled his rise in donations and in the polls have lately proven powerless to stop Mrs. Clinton from carrying Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania. Seeking inroads with the sort of working-class whites Mr. Obama needs, his strategists have been moving him from the lectern to the basketball court as he shoots for twin victories in the Indiana and North Carolina primaries on May 6 to halt Mrs. Clinton's renewed momentum.
 The electorate, too, has changed. For one, 3.7 million Americans have died since Mr. Obama revealed his presidential ambitions, government statistics show. An additional 6.2 million Americans have gotten married, including Mr. Obama's press secretary, Bill Burton. 
 The daughter of Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson was just a year old when the contest began. It will still be years before she is eligible to vote, of course, but, said the campaign-weary Mr. Wolfson, she is old enough to know the names of all the candidates.

HEADLINE: Better Days, and Even the Candidates, Are Coming to W.W.E.

BYLINE: By R. M. SCHNEIDERMAN; Brian Stelter contributing reporting.

 BODY:
For most of 2007, the reputation of World Wrestling Entertainment seemed to be in tatters, its ratings and share price staggering after a suicide-murder involving one of its biggest stars.
 This week, W.W.E. managed something that Katie Couric and CBS couldn't: host all three presidential candidates on its prime-time broadcast. 
 Each candidate taped a special message for last Monday's episode of ''W.W.E. Raw,'' the company's longtime wrestling extravaganza on USA Networks. In their best mock-wrestler voices, Hillary Rodham Clinton renamed herself Hill-Rod, John McCain renamed his fans the McCainiacs, and Barack Obama played off the familiar tag line of a W.W.E. star, the Rock: ''Do you smell what Barack is cooking?'' 
 After the messages from the real candidates, the show staged a match between political look-alikes (with a Bill Clinton stand-in as an underhanded manager). 
 Monday's show drew 4.97 million viewers, according to Nielsen, just a little under its 2008 average of 5.19 million. But the candidates were able to reach 1.45 million male viewers ages 18 to 34, just above the show's average this year. 
 Those numbers represent a business turnaround for the W.W.E. in the year after the death of one of its star wrestlers, Christopher Benoit. 
 Chris McCumber, W.W.E.'s executive vice president for marketing in the United States, said ''W.W.E. Raw'' was the network's ''Monday Night Football,'' ''except for us it's better because there's no off-season. It's 52 weeks a year and it's live.''
 A spokesman for the Obama campaign said it did the W.W.E. taping ''for the same reason we taped a segment with Rachael Ray -- this campaign has been about reaching out to new voters and getting them involved in politics, so it's important to reach as broad an audience as possible.''
 W.W.E.'s quick recovery is the result of many steps the company has taken, including expanding overseas and online, where its digital revenues grew 47 percent last year in part because of a mobile content deal with AT&T Mobile. W.W.E. was also able to react quickly, turning the issue of steroids to its advantage, even as the public grew increasingly weary of steroid scandals and corporate foot-dragging in other sports, like baseball and bicycling.
 ''The Benoit thing was a tragedy,'' said Alan Gould, an analyst for Natixis Bleichroeder, a New York-based research firm. ''But I don't see that changing the fan base or the economics or the long-term value of this franchise.''
 ''W.W.E. Raw,'' the flagship broadcast, marked its 15th anniversary last December. Also in December, W.W.E. signed a new contract keeping ''Raw'' on USA through 2010. The company has two other TV franchises: ''SmackDown'' on CW (moving to MyNetworkTV in the fall) and ''ECW'' on Sci-Fi.
 The turnaround was completed by a company that -- while public -- is still very much a family-run enterprise. In 1982, Vince McMahon, a promoter and announcer, took over his father's wrestling business, and with his wife, Linda, began to build the World Wrestling Federation into a national brand (the company changed its name -- and initials -- after losing a legal battle with the World Wildlife Fund). 
 Mr. McMahon, who still plays the part of the corporate overlord on some of the company's broadcasts, is chairman of the company and his wife is chief executive.
 Mr. McMahon was in the midst of a wrestling drama -- in the story line, he was faking his own death in a terrorism-related plot -- when he received word on June 25, 2007 that Mr. Benoit, 40, one of W.W.E.'s most popular wrestlers, had died, along with his wife and their 7-year-old son.Acting on that news -- and that was all the organization knew --W.W.E. canceled its sold-out show in Corpus Christi, Tex., and instead showed a three-hour tribute to Mr. Benoit, whom the McMahons said they knew as a wonderful father and a mild-mannered veteran of the ring. 
 A day later the gruesome details emerged: Mr. Benoit had murdered his wife and son, placed Bbibles on their corpses, then hanged himself in the family's home in suburban Atlanta. The police also found steroids -- long a public relations liability for W.W.E. -- in the wrestler's home.
 The company quickly went on a public relations blitz. Mr. McMahon broke character, appearing on news and cable television, to highlight W.W.E.'s steroid policy, which the company then bolstered with the suspension of at least 10 performers over the new few months. 
 Still, Mr. Benoit's death had an immediate impact. In the month after the murders, ratings for two of the company's television programs fell. By mid-August, W.W.E. shares had dropped by more than 15 percent. And some even worried that Mr. McMahon's company would lose sponsors.
 That did not happen. Ratings gradually improved and sponsors -- Unilever, Bayer, Procter & Gamble, Electronic Arts, Warner, Paramount, Universal, Sega and the Army National Guard -- remained committed.
 The company had dealt with steroid scandals previously. In the 1990s, George T. Zahorian, a doctor in Pennsylvania convicted of steroid distribution testified that he had sold anabolic steroids to stars like Hulk Hogan, as well as to Mr. McMahon. The company was widely criticized, and Mr. McMahon was later indicted, but eventually acquitted, on charges of steroid distribution.
 The company, then still called the W.W.F., took a hard line, implementing an independent drug-testing program, catching and suspending dozens of wrestlers, even big names like the Ultimate Warrior and Davey Boy Smith.
 Then in November 2005, Eddie Guerrero, 38, one of W.W.E.'s top stars, died of heart failure, which some said might have been caused by years of drug abuse.
 In the aftermath of Mr. Guerrero's death, Mr. McMahon imposed a stricter drug policy, which mandated that performers be tested randomly at least four times a year. Whether that policy is keeping performance enhancing drugs out of the ring remains a point of contention. 
 Nonetheless, investors appear to have shed most of their concerns. Fans wear company-branded gear, attend live events, purchase DVDs, read wrestling magazines, receive updates and videos on their mobile phones, download ring tones and go to the W.W.E. Web site, which attracted more than 16 million individual visitors a month during the most recent quarter.
 All have helped fuel W.W.E.'s revenues, which increased by about 21 percent, to $485.7 million in the 2007 fiscal year. During the same period, profits increased by roughly 7 percent, or $3.5 million, to $50 million. And in February, the W.W.E. announced it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 50 percent to 36 cents (largely benefiting the McMahons, who own 66 percent of the shares). 
 Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ''Mad Money,'' said in a March episode of his program that Wall Street ignores the company ''because I think they're snobs.''
 ''They don't watch W.W.E. Maybe they look down on you when you watch it. Too bad for them.''
 Awash in cash, W.W.E. is investing globally. It currently shows programs in 23 languages in more than 130 countries, and is now concentrating on expansion in Latin America, China, India, Australia and Japan.
 ''Here's the formula we've been using very successfully,'' said Linda McMahon, the chief executive ''We first introduce our product into the marketplace via the television show. Once we've introduced our talent and our story lines via television, then we follow with live events and licensing and merchandising.''
 Such success abroad has come at an opportune time for W.W.E, which still faces considerable challenges at home. While the presidential candidates' appearance on ''W.W.E. Monday Night Raw'' may attest to wrestling's cultural significance in the United States, the show's television ratings are down slightly year over year and it lost viewers in the 18-to-34 age group. Analysts say W.W.E. lacks the charismatic and marketable stars it once had. 
 Until recently, its domestic pay-per-view revenues had been declining, in part because of competition from the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading brand in mixed martial arts. 
 But Dana White, president of the U.F.C., said: ''People have been trying to count the W.W.E. out for years,'' he said. ''They're a powerhouse.''
 As long as the company remains a powerhouse, more politicians may have to come calling. When asked about Mr. McCain's involvement in the program, his campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds gave this statement:
 ''McCainiacs are freedom-loving people that believe our country is strengthened by personal empowerment and individualism. So reaching out to W.W.E. fans made sense, and it appears to be a successful relationship worth building on.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about World Wrestling Entertainment's comeback efforts misidentified the employer of Chris McCumber, who likened the wrestling show ''W.W.E. Raw'' to ''Monday Night Football.'' He is the senior vice president for marketing and brand strategy of the cable network that broadcasts the show; he does not work for World Wrestling Entertainment. The article also misspelled the name of Mr. McCumber's network. It is USA Network, not Networks. And the article misstated the beneficiaries of a recent increase in W.W.E.'s quarterly dividend. The dividend will be received by Class A shareholders; it will not benefit the McMahon family, which controls the company but owns Class B stock.

HEADLINE: Continental Ends Talks With United On a Merger

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Continental Airlines said Sunday that it had abandoned merger talks with United Airlines and was planning to remain an independent carrier, a blow to lengthy efforts by United to find a merger partner.
 Continental's decision, announced by the airline Sunday afternoon, will change the complex game of musical chairs that the airline industry is playing after the merger announcement last week by Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines.
 Continental's move was a stunning development for United's parent, UAL, which had been negotiating in expectation of reaching a deal by late this week. As recently as Friday, it looked as though Continental, based in Houston, and United, based outside Chicago, were on the way to reaching a merger agreement. 
 Continental decided to drop the discussions after UAL announced worse-than-expected earnings, which sent shares falling last week. On Tuesday, United said it lost $537 million during the first quarter, on sharply higher costs for jet fuel. The airline, which spent more than three years under bankruptcy protection earlier this decade, said it would cut flights and eliminate a further 1,000 jobs. 
 Directors at Continental, who met Sunday afternoon, feared that a merger with United could put their company in peril. Continental, which had been expected to take management responsibilities in a deal with United, survived two bankruptcy filings of its own in the 1980s and 1990s, and has been considered one of the industry's best-run carriers.
 With the United-Continental deal scrapped, a new set of pairings is likely to take place. UAL is expected to push to reach a deal with US Airways, with which it had also been discussing a merger, people involved in the talks said.
 In a statement, United's chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, said on Sunday night: ''Consolidation is under way. Ensuring you have the right partner is everything. We will pursue all options to ensure a strong, sustainable future for our airline and will not shy away from the touch choices necessary to create value for our shareholders and benefit our employees and customers.'' 
 Meanwhile, Continental is expected to press ahead with preliminary talks to create a three-way alliance -- short of a full merger -- with American Airlines and British Airways.
 In a letter to Continental employees, Lawrence W. Kellner, the airline's chief executive, and Jeffery A. Smisek, its president, wrote: ''The board very carefully considered all the risks and benefits of a merger with another airline, and determined that the risks of a merger at this time outweigh the potential rewards, as compared to Continental's prospects on a stand-alone basis.''
 They said they worried a deal would put company's operational and financial strengths ''at risk.'' They also hinted at forming a new alliance, saying, ''We are considering alternatives to SkyTeam'' -- an alliance with Delta and Northwest -- ''as we carefully evaluate which major global alliance will be best for Continental over the long term.''
 The executives did not mention American or British Airways.
 The two sides had agreed on several issues in their talks. Mr. Kellner would have run the combined company, while United's chief executive, Mr. Tilton, would have stepped away from day-to-day operations.
 Mr. Tilton had advocated strongly for industry consolidation, saying it was the only solution to help the struggling airlines become consistently profitable. US Airways' chief executive, W. Douglas Parker, has also pushed for consolidation, making an unsuccessful hostile bid last year for Delta before it emerged from bankruptcy protection.
 Mr. Kellner, in his letter, at least seemed sympathetic to the industry's plight, telling employees, ''Every U.S. carrier, including Continental, is under enormous pressure from record high fuel prices, a slowing U.S. economy and a weak dollar.''
 United's stock closed at $21.43 on Monday. That evening, Delta and Northwest announced their merger plans. On Tuesday, United's shares closed below $14. They ended the week at $15.21, off 29 percent for the week.
 On Tuesday, United's chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace, said repeatedly that the airline was in compliance with the covenants of its bank agreements. But, Mr. Brace added, ''With the recent spike in fuel prices and the softening economy the trajectory of our covenant coverage is downward.''
 Because of steps the airline was taking to cut costs, he said, ''it's really very difficult to predict whether we will have an issue or not.'' 
 On Wednesday, after the sharp drop in its stock, United issued a statement saying that it was in compliance with the terms of deals governing its credit arrangements with banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Credit Suisse.
 Analysts said the situation created doubt about United's health, an issue that has hovered around United since it emerged from bankruptcy protection in early 2006. That concern was a reason talks between Delta and United, which took place while Delta was under bankruptcy protection earlier this decade, never gained traction.
 Meanwhile, Continental's next steps are far from clear. Although it planned to pursue discussions with American about joining its alliance with British Airways, the corporate cultures of Continental and American differ significantly. American, as the nation's biggest airline until the Delta-Northwest deal is completed, is likely to want to dictate the terms under which the much-smaller Continental comes on board. 
 At the same time, Continental's membership in the SkyTeam alliance could offer much greater reach than a deal with American and British Airways. The new Delta will be bigger than American, and other members in SkyTeam include KLM and Air France, which have a broader base than American and British Airways across Europe and the rest of the world.
 Meanwhile, in a further sign of the industry's problems, Eos Airlines, a business-class carrier, said Sunday that it had filed bankrupcy protection and ceased flying. Eos said it filed for Chapter 11 protection in New York on Saturday. Eos offered business class flights between New York's JFK Airport and Stanstead Airport in London. It was the latest in a series of small airlines to file for bankruptcy protection in the last few weeks.
 Eos made its final flights from London to New York on Sunday, and canceled flights in the opposite direction. It began flying in 2005.

HEADLINE: Study Warns Job Losses Will Strain Government Health Programs

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Leading health researchers projected Monday that each percentage-point rise in unemployment during the economic downturn would swell the uninsured by 1.1 million, stoking demand for government health coverage just as states face pressure to cut benefits.
 While governments at all levels have faced a similar situation in past recessions, the researchers warned that the impact of this downturn might be worsened by its proximity to the last recession, in 2001, and by the cumulative effect of rising health costs.
 ''You could have more people at the tipping point, so we could be underestimating things a little bit,'' said John F. Holahan, director of health policy for the Urban Institute, which conducted the study for the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
 The number of uninsured Americans has grown relentlessly in good times and bad this decade, and now stands at 47 million, or 16 percent of the population. Mr. Holahan said the increase projected by his team would be in addition to the growth normally expected from rising insurance costs and the erosion of employer-sponsored coverage.
 The unemployment rate has increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent since March 2007. But Mr. Holahan said job losses often accelerated late in a recessionary cycle. ''The heaviest hit is still likely to come,'' he said.
 The study projected that each rise in unemployment of one percentage point would also add 600,000 children and 400,000 adults to the two primary state and federal health insurance programs for the low-income uninsured. That would require an additional $3.4 billion for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, with $1.4 billion of it from the states.
 The money will not be easy to find. A percentage point increase in unemployment typically translates into a drop in state general fund revenues of 3 percent to 4 percent, the Urban Institute said. A survey found that 27 states and the District of Columbia were forecasting budget deficits for the coming year, collectively exceeding $39 billion. Cuts to Medicaid or the children's health program have been proposed in 13 states. ''Because of state balanced-budget requirements, Medicaid and other assistance is most likely to be cut when state residents have the greatest need for help,'' the study concluded.
 The downturn is already having an impact on the economics of health care. The Kaiser foundation found in a poll this month that nearly 3 in 10 of those surveyed said they or their families had a serious problem paying for health care because of the economy. The frustration was evident at all levels, with 28 percent of middle-income respondents saying health costs had become a serious problem.
 In the poll of 2,003 adults, which had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 42 percent of respondents said that in the past year they or a household member had forgone some kind of medical care because of cost. Twenty-four percent said they had skipped a recommended test or treatment, up from 17 percent in 2005. 
 ''This is emerging as a pocketbook issue, and not just as an issue of moral principle or access to care,'' said Drew E. Altman, the foundation's president. 
 The poll found that nearly a quarter of respondents said they or a family member had either taken a new job or declined to do so in the past year primarily because of health benefits. And 7 percent said that in the past year they or someone in their household had decided to marry mainly to gain coverage for a spouse.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Calling For More Food Assistance

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Citing hunger riots in developing countries and soaring grain prices around the world, Senate Democrats called on Monday for a swift increase of $200 million in foreign food aid, on top of an additional $350 million that President Bush has requested in a supplemental spending measure. 
 In response, the administration urged Congress to give it more flexibility to buy food for donation from local and regional providers, a method that antihunger experts say is cheaper and more efficient than buying and shipping American commodities, as well as encouraging agricultural development. 
 This month, Mr. Bush directed the Agriculture Department to release $200 million in commodities to address the crisis, and on Monday the United States Agency for International Development said that it was coordinating that program in addition to $40 million in emergency food aid. 
 A.I.D. said the United NationsWorld Food Program and private organizations would deliver those resources to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Kenya, Mauritania, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. 
 At a news conference, Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Robert P. Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, both Democrats, called for adding $200 million in food aid to the supplemental spending measure that will provide additional financing for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 ''This is the worst global food crisis in more than 30 years,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''It threatens not only the health and survival of millions of people around the world, many of them children, but it also is a threat to global security. 
 ''As many as 36 countries, almost one-fifth of the world's nations, are now facing food crises requiring help from abroad.'' 
 A spokesman for the White House, Scott Stanzel, said the administration was monitoring the crisis and moving swiftly to respond. 
 ''We appreciate the shared concerns of members of Congress,'' Mr. Stanzel said. 
 He urged greater flexibility in running the programs.
 ''The president has continually asked Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world,'' he said. ''This flexibility would not only get food to people in emergency situations faster, it would also build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. Unfortunately, Congress has repeatedly failed to act on this proposal.'' 
 The administration has urged Congress to use the farm bill, which is in House-Senate talks, to allow up to 25 percent of United States food aid to be bought from local or regional providers. In 2007, the United States donated more than 1.5 million metric tons of food, valued at $1.2 billion. 
 The Senate proposed a much more modest pilot program to buy up to $25 million in food for donation from producers overseas. Farm bill negotiators continued to debate that on Monday. Separately on Monday, three Democrats, Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Bill Nelson of Florida, and a Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, sent a letter to Mr. Bush urging at least $60 million in added emergency food aid, specifically for Haiti, which has had food riots. 
 ''The United States must now demonstrate leadership and resolve and help one of its closest neighbors,'' the senators wrote. ''We must come to the aid of the Haitian people.'' 
 A spokeswoman for A.I.D., Gina Jackson, said she could not specify how much of the $240 million emergency aid was for Haiti.

HEADLINE: Oil Price Rise Fails to Open Tap

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As oil prices soared to record levels in recent years, basic economics suggested that consumption would fall and supplies would rise as producers drilled for more oil.
 But as prices flirt with $120 a barrel, many energy experts are becoming worried that neither seems to be happening. Higher prices have done little to suppress global demand or attract new production, and the resulting mismatch has sent oil prices ever higher.
 That has translated into more pain at the pump, with gasoline setting a fresh record of $3.60 a gallon nationwide on Monday. Experts expect prices above $4 a gallon this summer, and one analyst recently predicted that gasoline could reach $7 in the next four years.
 A central reason that oil supplies are not rising much is that major producers outside the OPEC cartel, like Russia, Mexico and Norway, are showing troubling signs of sluggishness. Unlike OPEC, whose explicit goal is to regulate the supply of oil to keep prices up, these countries are the free traders of the oil market, with every incentive to produce flat-out at a time of high prices. 
 But for a variety of reasons, including sharply higher drilling costs and a rise of nationalistic policies that restrict foreign investment, these countries are failing to increase their output. They seem stuck at about 50 million barrels of oil a day, or 60 percent of the world's oil supplies, with few prospects for growth. 
 ''According to normal economic theory, and the history of oil, rising prices have two major effects,'' said Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. ''They reduce demand and they induce oil supplies. Not this time.''
 With global supplies tight, geopolitics continue to play a big role in pushing up oil prices. Oil futures closed at $118.75 a barrel, up 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after strikes by oil workers in Scotland and Nigeria that shut down nearly 1.7 percent of the world's daily production.
 Countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been the main source of production growth in the past three decades, as new fields were discovered in Alaska, the North Sea and the Caspian region. 
 But analysts at Barclays Capital said last week that non-OPEC supplies were ''seemingly dead in the water.'' Goldman Sachs raised similar concerns last month, saying that growth in non-OPEC supplies ''can no longer be taken for granted.''
 At the same time, oil consumption keeps expanding.Global consumption is forecast to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, to 87.2 million barrels a day, with much of the growth in demand coming from China, India and the Middle East, according to the International Energy Agency, a group that advises industrialized countries.
 In the United States and through much of the developed world, the higher fuel prices have led drivers to reduce their consumption, and gasoline demand is expected to drop this year. But that drop will be more than offset by the rise in energy demand from developing countries. In the next two decades, demand is projected to jump by 35 percent, and developing countries will consume more oil than industrialized countries.
 Higher oil prices mean record profits for oil companies that have, to some extent, masked the supply problems. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both expected to deliver knockout performances when reporting quarterly earnings this week, even as they struggle to increase production.
 ''What is disturbing here is that things seem to get worse, not better,'' said David Greely, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''These high prices are not attracting meaningful new supplies.''
 The outlook for oil supplies ''signals a period of unprecedented scarcity,'' Jeff Rubin, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said last week. Oil prices might exceed $200 a barrel by 2012, he said, a level that would very likely mean $7-a-gallon gasoline in the United States.
 Some regions are simply running out of reserves. Norway's production has slumped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001, and in Britain, output has dropped 43 percent in eight years. Production from the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska has dropped by 65 percent from its peak two decades ago.
 In many other places, the problems are not below ground, as energy executives like to put it, but above ground. Higher petroleum taxes and more costly licensing agreements, a scarcity of workers and swelling costs, as well as political wrangling and violence, are making it harder to raise production. 
 ''It's a crunch,'' said J. Robinson West, chairman of PFC Energy, an energy consulting firm in Washington. ''The world is not running out of oil, but rather it's running out of oil production capacity.''
 Mexico, the second-biggest exporter to the United States, seems increasingly helpless to find new supplies to offset the collapse of its largest oil field, Cantarell. A combination of falling production and rising domestic consumption could wipe out Mexico's exports within five years.
 Foreign investment could help Mexico produce oil from deeper waters, but that is a controversial proposition in a country where oil has long been seen as part of the national patrimony.
 Another country, Russia, is also a focus of analysts' worries. Russia is not exactly running out of places to look for oil -- a huge chunk of eastern Siberia remains unexplored -- and the country has been the biggest contributor to the growth in energy supplies in the last decade. 
 But Russian energy officials warned recently that the days of stunning growth that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union were over, as the country focuses on stabilizing its output. Russia today produces about 10 million barrels of oil a day, up from a low of 6 million barrels in 1996. 
 The Russian government has been muscling Western companies to gain more control over its energy resources. That rise in energy nationalism could freeze new investment and slow any meaningful growth in supplies there for years.
 As countries like Russia slow output, analysts say OPEC will have to pick up the slack. The oil cartel accounts for 40 percent of the world's oil exports and owns more than 75 percent of global reserves. But there are serious concerns that OPEC will also find it tough to increase production. 
 Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is completing a $50 billion plan to increase capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, but it signaled recently that it would not go beyond that. That means Saudi Arabia could fall short of the 15 million barrels a day that most experts had expected it to produce in the long run.
 OPEC's 13 members plan to spend $150 billion to expand their capacity by five million barrels a day by 2012. But OPEC will need to pump 60 million barrels a day by 2030, up from around 36 million barrels a day today, to meet the projected growth in demand. Analysts say that without Iran and Iraq -- where nearly 30 years of wars and sanctions have crippled oil production -- reaching that level will be impossible.
 Not everyone is pessimistic about energy supplies. A study by the National Petroleum Council, an industry group that provides advice to the secretary of energy, concluded that the world still had plenty of petroleum resources that could be tapped. 
 In fact, high prices have set off a global dash for oil. Brazil, for example, has struck large offshore fields that could turn the country into one of the world's top 10 producers. But developing new fields can take many years.
 To make up the shortfall, the world is also increasingly turning to fuels from unconventional sources, like biofuels or heavy oil. Canadian tar sands, for example, have attracted large investments.
 But the International Energy Agency estimates that current investments will be insufficient to replace declining oil production. The energy agency said it would take $5.4 trillion by 2030 to raise global output. Otherwise, it warned that a crisis before 2015 involving ''an abrupt run-up in prices'' could not be ruled out.

HEADLINE: For Gamers, The Craving Won't Quit

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The troubled economy and rising prices for food and gas won't keep fast-twitch video gamers from splurging on their latest must-have diversion, Grand Theft Auto IV. 
 During the next two weeks, some five million couch jockeys are expected to plunk down $60 to buy Grand Theft Auto IV, a violent and episodic game that hits stores Tuesday.
 The release is expected to be one of the biggest video game debuts ever, extending a franchise that has already sold 70 million copies since its arrival in 1997. 
 But customers' intense desire for video games extends beyond Grand Theft Auto. Despite pressure on consumers' entertainment budgets, they keep spending more money on games. Over all, the industry is having a banner year. Software sales were up 63 percent in March compared with March 2007, according to NPD Group, which tracks sales. Equipment sales were up 46 percent over the same period. 
 ''People say that if consumers are down to their last $50, the last three things they'll buy are milk, eggs and video games,'' said Colin Sebastian, a video game industry analyst with Lazard Capital Markets. 
 Avid fans of the Grand Theft Auto games acknowledge that buying the new Grand Theft Auto -- and spending hours descending into a free-for-all of crime and punishment set in an animated facsimile of New York City -- can require some financial sacrifice. But for many, the purchase of the game is justified by its entertainment value. Finishing the game can take more than 40 hours, turning a $60 investment (tax not included) into entertainment that costs less than 70 cents an hour (food and bathroom breaks not included). 
 Ryan Holt, 21, a student at the University of Northern Colorado, plans to spend $90 to get the collector's edition, which comes with a duffel bag, art book and soundtrack. It pinches his budget, but he said there are things he would sacrifice before a great video game.
 ''I'd probably give up my cellphone,'' he said. ''Probably not food. That's really tough. I like food.''
 Demonstrating the industry's strong growth, Nintendo announced late last week that it would increase its monthly production of Wii video game consoles to 2.4 million, from 1.8 million. In January, the video game retailer GameStop beat its own projections for quarterly sales growth, even as many other retailers struggle, Mr. Sebastian said.
 ''It's hard to see that there is any effect of economic distress affecting industry sales. In fact, the industry is thriving despite woes elsewhere in the economy,'' Anita Frazier, a video game industry analyst at NPD Group, said. 
 To some extent, the growth is no surprise. The industry is in the middle of a predicted upturn related to the recent introduction of three new video game consoles: the Wii, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. New consoles mean new games and motivated consumers. 
 Video game industry executives and analysts -- and, more important, consumers -- say the devotion to the hobby is driven by a peculiarity of games: they can be addictive.
 ''When gamers are in it, it's like a druglike state. It feels so good,'' said Jennifer Aaker, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. She said players face constant challenges and receive instant feedback, a superstimulating artificial environment. 
 Not only is the play experience emotional, but the purchase is emotional, too, Professor Aaker said. Players want to be the first to buy the game and master it, sweeping aside the matter of affordability.
 ''The last thing that comes to mind is: 'Can I afford it?' That question isn't even on the radar,'' Professor Aaker said. ''The question is: How fast can I buy it?''
 In tough times -- and in good times -- playing games offers a chance for escape, devotees say. That goes double for the Grand Theft Auto series, according to J. R. Jobe, 27, of Lawton, Okla.
 ''You can go along with the stories, which are pretty good, or you can just play around and blow stuff up,'' Mr. Jobe said. ''If you don't feel like blowing stuff up, you can jump in a cop car and run over criminals.''
 Mr. Jobe, who works as a floor manager in a local tribal casino, said playing is a kind of relief from day-to-day drudgery. That's why he has been saving a bit from each paycheck for Grand Theft Auto IV. It is a mild sacrifice, given the cost of gas and the need to pay the rent and buy school lunches for the children, but he said he needs some entertainment, too.
 ''My wife wants me to go shopping or go to P.T.A. meetings, and sometimes I don't want to do that,'' he said. He thinks he is entitled to something in return. ''I explain to her: When I get off work, it's my way to calm down. It's like my cigarette.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the resilience of video game sales in a slow economy miscalculated the price of an hour's entertainment from Grand Theft Auto IV. The game costs $60 and can take 40 hours or more to complete, making its cost per hour $1.50 or less, not less than 70 cents.

HEADLINE: Earnings Up Almost 10% At Verizon In Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Verizon Communications said on Monday that sales of more expensive wireless contracts helped drive earnings up nearly 10 percent during the first quarter, offsetting declines in traditional phone service. 
 The carrier said it also benefited from strong demand for wireless data plans and sales of its new fiber optic television service. 
 ''Results for the first quarter were strong and demonstrate that we weathered the economic uncertainty,'' Doreen A. Toben, Verizon's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts on Monday.
 But while the wireless business showed growth over all, the company signed on fewer new customers during the first quarter than it did during the period last year. Verizon signed up 1.5 million new wireless customers during the first quarter, beating AT&T's 1.3 million during the period, but fewer than the 1.7 million new subscribers Verizon added a year ago.
 Based in New York, Verizon ended the quarter with 67.2 million wireless subscribers, behind AT&T with 71.4 million. Verizon's churn rate -- the proportion of customers who cancel their service -- was 1.2 percent, the industry's lowest rate, while AT&T's churn rate was 1.7 percent.
 Verizon lost another 8.2 percent of its landlines during the quarter, a trend the company is trying to counter with the addition of new services like its digital television service, FiOS TV. The company added 263,000 customers to FiOS TV during the quarter, for a total of 1.2 million.
 On Wall Street, the results were greeted with relief that Verizon, like AT&T last week, appeared largely unscathed by economic woes. Shares of Verizon rose 91 cents on Monday, to close at $37.95.
 ''Over all, they were mostly in line with what we expected,'' said John Hodulik, an analyst with UBS. ''Some of the growth engines were strong, but other core areas, like business, were off. The company is increasingly dependent on wireless data for growth.''
 During the first quarter, Verizon began offering a $99.99 monthly cellular plan with unlimited calling and no roaming charges. The company said the percentage of customers opting for plans costing $99 or more rose from 4 percent before the new plan was introduced to 15 percent in the first quarter.
 Dennis F. Strigl, Verizon's president and chief operating officer, said a high percentage of customers who chose an unlimited plan also chose a premium data package, further bolstering revenue. ''At this point, we're very happy with the way this plan is moving in the market for us,'' Mr. Strigl said. 
 Verizon's revenue rose 5.5 percent, to $23.8 billion, from $22.6 billion a year ago. Net income for the quarter rose to $1.6 billion, or 57 cents a share, from $1.5 billion, or 51 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2007. 
 Excluding items, Verizon said net income would have increased to $1.7 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $1.6 billion, or 54 cents, in the year-ago quarter, in line with analysts' forecasts.
 Verizon Wireless reported $11.7 billion in wireless revenue during the quarter. AT&T reported $11.8 billion in mobile revenue.

HEADLINE: Junk Bonds, Mortgages And Milken

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 ''The financial crisis we're in today stems from the invention by Drexel Burnham Lambert of the junk bond,'' Martin Lipton, the superlawyer who co-founded Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, said derisively at a conference last month. ''You can draw a straight line from Drexel Burnham to the financial world today.'' 
 Was Mr. Lipton right? 
 On Monday, I found myself sitting across from Michael R. Milken, the onetime ''junk bond king'' of Drexel. Dressed in a blue suit, lavender shirt and reddish power tie, Mr. Milken was presiding over his annual conference at the Beverly Hilton. He was also offering his opinions on the credit mess -- and rebutting critics like Mr. Lipton. 
 ''We've had plenty of trillion-dollar losses before,'' Mr. Milken said nonchalantly. Then, playing the role of a Zen master, he added: ''The question is whether the future will be like the past.'' 
 Frankly, Mr. Milken, who is undoubtedly brilliant, can be a pretty bland speaker. But what caught my attention was a 10-page paper he wrote last week that dissects the current state of the markets. It reads like an impassioned defense of himself. 
 Critics who compare the subprime debacle to the bubble in high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds that Drexel helped inflate two decades ago are ''people who don't understand markets very well,'' Mr. Milken said. He suggests that ''their rationale is that both types of financial instruments are risky.'' 
 And he says junk bonds, or those rated below investment grade, ''have little in common with mispriced subprime mortgages,'' which he says are the real culprits.
 ''Having financed several of America's largest home builders, I know a few things about the housing industry,'' Mr. Milken said. ''What happened to housing was not a failure of securitization, but rather a disastrous lowering of underwriting standards and other unfortunate practices.''
 Criticizing securitization -- the slicing and dicing of debt that he helped popularize -- is ''like condemning scalpels because a few unqualified surgeons have injured patients,'' he said. 
 Mr. Milken is playing the role of Master of the Universe again -- the master of ceremonies at his conference, held just blocks away from the former Drexel office where he had barked orders from his X-shaped trading desk. 
 He has spent the past two decades trying to rehabilitate his image after pleading guilty to six felony counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, paying $600 million in fines and spending 22 months behind bars. He has remade himself as a thought leader and impassioned crusader against prostate cancer, a disease he battled. His former nemesis Rudolph Giuliani, the man who prosecuted him, is now singing his praises. (Mr. Giuliani is another prostate cancer survivor.) 
 The high powered conference is itself a testament to the good will that Mr. Milken has generated on and off Wall Street over the years. The speakers include everyone from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas impresario whom Mr. Milken backed in the 1980s with, yes, junk bonds. 
 By Milken standards, this is a sedate affair. It's certainly no Predator's Ball, the lavish poolside party that Mr. Milken used to throw at the Beverly Hills Hotel back in his Drexel days. 
 But despite everything Mr. Milken has done to rehabilitate his reputation, he is still dogged by questions about his legacy in the financial markets, especially now, given the role that Wall Street financial engineers played in fostering the spread of risky, subprime lending. 
 Indeed, Mr. Lipton's sneering assertion is not uncommon, even in the halls here. 
 But Mr. Milken's detractors are misinformed. Did he invent the junk bond? Yes. Did he help make securitization popular? Yes. Did he have anything to do with the current mess? Absolutely not. 
 Blaming Mr. Milken for today's credit crisis is like blaming the inventor of paper money. 
 He may have made some mistakes along the way, but Mr. Milken helped create a new generation of companies and an entirely new way to finance nascent ideas that have helped fuel the global economy far beyond his exit from Drexel. The list of companies that would not exist without him is long: MCI, CNN and Turner Broadcasting (now part of Time Warner), Barnes & Noble and Occidental Petroleum, just to name a few.
 Toward the end of every bubble, people misuse the financial tools at their disposal, and then a witch hunt begins for the villain. Then, of course, the regulators jump in and try to fix things -- and often go a bit overboard. 
 That's exactly what Mr. Milken said worries him most: that excessive regulation will send the economy into an even deeper funk. The biggest financial companies have every motivation to push for more regulation to quash competition, the way they did of him in 1990, he said. 
 Using a somewhat strained analogy of medieval class conflicts, Mr. Milken said: ''In England and other monarchies, the king enjoyed the allegiance of the nobles, who lorded it over the mercantile class. But with the spread of knowledge through the new technology of printing, the precursor of modern banking and capital markets began to develop. Eventually, some merchants acquired enough wealth to challenge the standing of the nobles.'' 
 So what did the nobles do? ''Turned to the king'' -- that is, the government. In the early 1990s, Mr. Milken said, similarly unwise regulation, urged in part by large vested interests, helped push the economy into a full-blown recession. 
 Still, Mr. Milken is an optimist. For all the carnage in the market recently, he said the worst is probably over. ''When you read the newspapers, it sounds like Charles Dickens,'' he said referring to a ''A Tale of Two Cities.'' He said, ''I would stress that these times are good times, not bad times.''

HEADLINE: With Demand Slipping for Its Pickups and S.U.V.'s, G.M. Will Lay Off 3,550

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
General Motors said Monday that it would slash production of big trucks and sport utility vehicles by nearly 140,000 units this year, a move that would eliminate assembly shifts at four plants and cause about 3,550 workers to be laid off. 
 G.M., the world's largest automaker, has gradually slowed production of many vehicles because of declining demand, but this is the largest one-time cut in recent years. 
 G.M.'s need to make such a large cut, even after many of its truck and S.U.V. plants have been shut down for much of March and April because of a strike at a parts supplier, indicates how sharply sales of these vehicles have fallen.
 Sales of G.M.'s full-size pickups, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2007 model year, fell 16 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Autodata, which tracks industry statistics. Sales of G.M.'s large S.U.V.'s were down 28 percent in the same period.
 The declines mirror overall decreases in those segments for the industry, but G.M., the top player in both segments, has been hurt the most by the rapid shift in consumers' preferences.
 The announcement came on a day when the national average price of regular gasoline hit a high of $3.603 a gallon and a slumping housing market continued to cause a decline in demand for trucks.
 ''With rising fuel prices, a softening economy and a downward trend on current and future market demand for full-size trucks, a significant adjustment was needed to align our production with market realities,'' the president of G.M.'s North American operations, Troy Clarke, said in a statement. 
 ''This is a difficult move,'' he said, ''but we remain committed to retaining and growing our leadership position in the full-size truck market.''
 One of two shifts will be eliminated on July 14 at a plant in Janesville, Wis., that builds the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon S.U.V.'s and at a full-size pickup truck plant in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, G.M. said. Also on July 14, one of three shifts will be cut at a plant in Flint, Mich., that builds heavy-duty pickup trucks, and a pickup plant in Oshawa, Ontario, will go to one shift from two on Sept. 8.
 G.M. said the cuts would reduce truck production by 88,000 units, about 11 percent of its total full-size truck sales in 2007. The planned 50,000 cut in S.U.V. production represents about 15 percent of its sales last year in that segment.
 Affected workers who do not leave the company voluntarily through an ongoing buyout program that offers them as much as $140,000 will continue receiving benefits and most of their pay under the automaker's ''jobs bank'' program, as part of the contract with the United Automobile Workers. 
 G.M.'s 74,000 hourly workers have about three more weeks to decide whether to take a buyout.
