HEADLINE: Health Care: A National Conversation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The High Cost of Health Care'' (editorial, Nov. 25) captures the true complexities facing the challenges of the American health care system. 
 Those who truly immerse themselves in the issues of health care are well aware that indeed reform is not near, nor will it ever be achieved until there is a fundamental compromise on all the matters outlined. 
 The greatest obstacle to achieving universal health care will come from those who choose to avoid these fundamental issues while guided only by their political ambitions. 
 Reno DiScala, M.D. Glen Cove, N.Y., Nov. 25, 2007 
 To the Editor:
 Your otherwise thoughtful editorial about the health care crisis facing the United States curiously dismisses the idea of a single-payer health care plan as ''no panacea'' for the cost problem and as having ''limited political support.'' 
 But the question isn't whether a single-payer plan is a panacea -- it is whether a single-payer plan would significantly reduce costs compared with insurance-based plans, and the answer is a decided yes.
 The administrative costs of Medicare are approximately 20 percent of the administrative costs of private insurance plans, and all of those administrative savings in a comprehensive Medicare-for-all system could be poured into more and better health care. 
 As to whether a single-payer plan has political support, it depends on whether you ask the average person or the average politician. Whereas polls show that a majority of the people favor a single-payer plan, the politicians, many of whom are beholden to the insurance industry, would like you to believe otherwise. 
 Instead of wringing your hands about the supposed unworkability and unpopularity of a single-payer plan (even in the face of the highly successful and popular Medicare, with a 40-year track record), The Times should put its considerable influence behind the only real solution to the health care crisis: Medicare for all.
 Peter Hanauer Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 25, 2007
 To the Editor:
 A single-payer, government-run system was only briefly mentioned and was immediately dismissed as ''no panacea for the cost problem.'' The truth is that single-payer, government-run health care has been a panacea.
 In the 46 years that I've practiced family medicine, I've found Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, all of them single-payer government-administered health care programs, more predictable, uniform and reliable than the for-profit health care insurance companies. This is better for doctors and hospitals and certainly better for the patients.
 I like one form to file, one payer, one set of rules for everyone and the assurance that everyone has health care coverage when patients come to see me.
 Melvin H. Kirschner, M.D. Van Nuys, Calif., Nov. 25, 2007
 To the Editor:
 With regard to ''The High Cost of Health Care,'' the amount we spend on health care, while troubling, should not be the main issue in the great health care debate. The focus should be on two things: one, the 47 million uninsured who cannot regularly participate in the health care system (not all of which is due to the high cost); and two, the poor state of our nation's health in comparison to other countries that spend far less in this area.
 Many of our citizens do not have good health, despite the expensive technology, drugs and specialists indicative of our health care system. Our infant mortality rate remains high in comparison to other nations, and older adults live many years with chronic illness and disability.
 We can expect many of our health status indicators to get worse, not better, in the coming decades as our uninsured population grows, our minority and immigrant populations grow, and as baby boomers age. 
 These demographic influences are the rationale for the Healthy People 2010 goals of reducing racial and ethnic health disparities and extending years of healthy life. We are the richest nation. First, let's allocate our economic, medical and research resources to provide good health to every American; then we can figure out how to do it cost-effectively. 
 Jan Warren-Findlow Charlotte, N.C., Nov. 25, 2007
 The writer is an assistant professor of public health sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
 To the Editor: 
 The Times is right to call health care costs ''the worst long-term fiscal crisis facing the nation.'' 
 Although universal coverage could be cheaper to finance and easier to administer, few concur on how to preserve consumer choice or how to persuade the uninsured to buy into the system. 
 Here's how: 
 Extend Medicare coverage to all, financed by an increase in the withholding tax and elimination of the tax subsidies for employee health insurance. Those willing to settle on a Canadian-style system can have one, but those wanting to opt out could receive a tax credit to buy alternative or supplemental policies offered by the private market.
 Insurers would be required to accept all applicants and offer community rates, with the government underwriting catastrophic costs above a defined level. 
 The Medicare withholding tax could be progressively structured and the credit capped to provide fairness.
 Allan Ostergren Director, Institute for SocioEconomic Studies White Plains, Nov. 26, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 I would certainly not agree with ''almost all economists'' that ''the main driver of high medical spending here is our wealth.'' The per capita income of Americans is less than that of several European countries, and certainly not enough to explain our spending twice as much per capita on health care. 
 Where we are unique is in leaving most of our health system to the tender mercies of profit-maximizing investor-owned businesses.
 You are right that Medicare-for-all ''is no panacea for the cost problem.'' As now structured, Medicare pays specialists extravagant fees to perform tests and procedures, which drives up costs. But it could easily be reformed. In any case, some sort of single-payer system will be necessary to control costs, even if not sufficient. 
 Marcia Angell, M.D. Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 25, 2007
 The writer is a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and a former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 Have any of us ever recommended a physician based on his or her prudent allotment of health care dollars? The cardiologist who forgoes cardiac catheterization in your elderly grandmother because her short life expectancy doesn't justify the expense? The neonatologist who declines to aggressively resuscitate your premature newborn because its tiny chance of intact survival doesn't justify the astronomical cost of months of neonatal intensive care? The emergency medicine doctor who refuses to med-flight your teenager after a deadly car crash because he isn't going to make it anyway? 
 It's easy to blame doctors for spending lavishly on their patients. But it is simply hypocritical for patients to criticize the spendthrift culture of American medicine while continuing to demand any intervention available despite its high cost and/or low likelihood of benefit.
 There's no such thing as a free lunch.
 Joshua U. Klein, M.D. Brookline, Mass., Nov. 25, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Several states are already pursuing their own health care payment programs. The federal government should not develop a one-size-fits-all national program but rather encourage all of the states to develop programs. Placing the responsibility for financing and administering the program at the state level would preserve the disparities in expenditures on health care from one region to another; it would foster experimentation and competition among states to develop and carry out cost-saving strategies.
 As the state programs prove themselves, even Medicare might be delegated to them. 
 John A. Rowland Rocky River, Ohio, Nov. 26, 2007
 To the Editor:
 With malpractice insurance approaching $100,000 a year for many health care providers, litigation plays more than a ''minor role'' in driving up costs. How often do physicians recommend additional treatments just to avoid a potential lawsuit? 
 Does the legal environment diminish the availability of quality health care by reducing the supply and increasing the cost? How many patients are put at increased risk, and forced to pay higher costs, simply because of a hostile attitude toward the medical profession by often-greedy lawyers? 
 Malpractice occasionally occurs, and there should be remedies for those who are harmed. But there's an army of litigators out there who are eager to generate income at the expense of the system. Why else would so many trial lawyers make substantial contributions to politicians who are willing to ignore any possibility of medical liability reform? 
 Health care costs cannot be contained without addressing the legal issues.
 William L. Burge Ballwin, Mo., Nov. 25, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Missing from the editorial was the problems we face in end-of-life care and its effect on all of medicine. Although hospice use has increased, so has the number of people dying in intensive care units. Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of nursing home patients each year are transferred to hospitals for acute care from which they can derive no benefit because of that person's underlying health. 
 This type of care is more prevalent in our large teaching hospitals, training young doctors that inappropriate, expensive care is the norm, which has contributed to the widespread excessive use of procedures and drugs.
 It takes judgment to determine what is suitable for each individual's unique health situation. Any solution to our health care problem must emphasize appropriate care tailored to the individual needs of every patient. 
 Kenneth A. Fisher, M.D. Kalamazoo, Mich., Nov. 26, 2007

HEADLINE: Congress Called Near Compromise on Fuel Economy Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators are nearing agreement on a measure to set significantly higher fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, according to aides and lobbyists following the talks.
 A deal could come as early as Wednesday to require all passenger vehicles sold in the United States to reach a combined fleetwide average of 35 miles a gallon by 2020. If enacted into law, the measure would be the first major increase in vehicle fuel economy standards in two decades. 
 The legislation would allow the automakers to calculate mileage based on the size and weight of vehicles, as long as their entire line of products meets the 35-mile-a-gallon standard, satisfying a central demand by Senate sponsors of the bill. 
 Such a deal would also provide incentives for the three big American manufacturers to continue building small cars in this country, preserving an estimated 17,000 jobs. The United Automobile Workers union and members of Congress from automaking states insisted on that provision as a condition of supporting the broader compromise.
 The deal also appears to include mileage credits for so-called flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on a mixture of gasoline in relatively small proportions, and ethanol. It is comparatively inexpensive to convert vehicles to run on ethanol blends, but the fuel is available at a limited number of service stations, so the gasoline savings are expected to be minimal in the next few years. 
 Aides briefed on the negotiations said that difficult issues remain to be resolved, with Senate Democrats insisting on a strict reading of the 35 mile-a-gallon standard and adherence to the 2020 deadline.
 But Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a stalwart supporter of the auto industry, is pushing for concessions to help the financially struggling American automakers. 
 The House and Senate passed broad energy legislation earlier this year, but they have been unable to resolve differences between them. The fuel economy measure is considered among the most effective ways to reduce the consumption of oil -- which is selling at near-record prices -- and the production of greenhouse gases that contribute to the warming of the atmosphere.
 The House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said this week that she hoped to gain passage of an energy bill containing the new mileage rules by the middle of next week.
 Reaching agreement on that timetable is likely to require Congressional leaders to drop provisions like a mandate that electric utilities nationwide generate 15 percent of their power from renewable sources, including wind, solar and hydroelectric power. Utilities lobbied intensively against that requirement.
 A House-passed measure to repeal $16 billion in tax breaks for the oil industry is also expected to be scrapped, aides said. President Bush threatened to veto the entire package if the oil and gas tax bill were included.
 A provision passed by the Senate but not the House would require the increased use of alternative fuels like ethanol and liquids produced from wood or municipal waste, with a goal of 36 billion gallons of such biofuels by 2022. A version of that measure is expected to survive, although negotiators are still working on complex formulas for different types of biofuels.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Dingell said Tuesday evening that there was no final agreement on any specific provision concerning automotive mileage standards, but that the congressman was committed to helping pass a bill this year. She said that negotiators hoped to resolve their differences by Wednesday evening.

HEADLINE: Oil Producers See the World And Buy It Up

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Flush with petrodollars, oil-producing countries have embarked on a global shopping spree.
 With a bold outlay of $7.5 billion, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is about to become one of the largest shareholders in Citigroup.
 The bank had already experienced the petrodollar's power this month when another major shareholder, Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, cleared the way for the ouster of its chief executive, Charles O. Prince III.
 The Dubai stock exchange, meanwhile, is negotiating for 20 percent of a newly merged company that includes Nasdaq and the operator of stock markets in the Nordic region. Qatar, like Dubai a sheikdom in the Persian Gulf, might compete in that deal.. 
 In late October, Dubai, which has little oil but is part of the region's energy economy, bought part of Och-Ziff Capital Management, a hedge fund in New York. Abu Dhabi this month invested in Advanced Micro Devices, the chip maker, and in September bought into the Carlyle Group, a private equity giant. 
 Experts estimate that oil-rich nations have a $4 trillion cache of petrodollar investments around the world. And with oil prices likely to remain in the stratosphere, that number could increase rapidly. 
 In 2000, OPEC countries earned $243 billion from oil exports, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. For all of 2007 the estimate was more than $688 billion, but that did not include the last two months of price spikes. 
 ''If you look at gulf countries, they have a total common economy that is about the size of the Netherlands,'' said Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist of Lehman Brothers. ''These are tiny countries, but they have to place collectively over $5 billion a week from their oil revenues. It's not an easy thing to do.''
 The explosion in investment has set up some of its own cross-currents. While the recent decline in the value of the dollar is making investment in the United States cheaper, many investors are holding back out of fear that the dollar will decline further, diminishing the worth of their dollar holdings. 
 Many oil investors are also worried about a potential political reaction in the United States similar to the furor of last year when Dubai tried to acquire a company that operates American ports. European leaders, at the same time, worry that Russia is using its oil revenues to snatch up pipelines and other energy infrastructure in their region.
 Such concerns seem to be driving investments to other parts of the world, many analysts say.
 ''The investments are diversifying outside the United States, though the U.S. still has the bulk of it,'' said Diana Farrell, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, a research arm of the McKinsey consulting firm, which calculated in October that petrodollar investments reached $3.4 trillion to $3.8 trillion at the end of 2006.
 ''Europe is a prime target,'' she added, ''but at least 25 percent of foreign investments from the Persian Gulf are in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.''
 Though oil-producing countries have been looking at investments in the West since the 1970s, their strategies back then were largely confined to safe assets with a low return, like United States Treasury debt.
 By 2001, with the collapse in oil prices, many of the oil exporters had depleted their dollar reserves, economists say.
 But the boom in oil prices in the last five years has changed all that. It has persuaded oil producers to set up or expand ''sovereign wealth funds'' as vehicles to invest far more aggressively in the West, in their own economies and in emerging markets.
 Other petrodollar investments are made through government-owned corporations, corporations and individuals like Prince Walid, who owns stakes not only in Citigroup but also News Corporation, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, PepsiCo, Time Warner and Walt Disney.
 The oil-rich nations are also investing more in real estate, private equity funds and hedge funds, analysts say, and increasingly they are investing the money on their own, bypassing the major financial institutions of the United States and Europe.
 ''The oil-producing countries simply cannot absorb the amount of wealth they are generating,'' said J. Robinson West, chairman of PFC Energy. ''We are seeing a transfer of wealth of historic dimensions. It is not just Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Investment funds are being set up in places like Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea.'' 
 Precise figures of the global picture in petrodollars are not easy to come by, in part because the big investors in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere are not obliged to disclose their portfolios or activities. 
 The lack of transparency is a problem to leaders of Western industrial economies. In October, Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary of the United States, and the finance ministers of other major industrial democracies called for an international code of ''best practices'' by cross-border investors requiring greater disclosure of assets and actions.
 The petrodollar era has benefited the world economy, economists say, notably by enhancing liquidity at a time when foreign currency reserves of export giants in Asia are also making the world flush with cash.
 Recently Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has spoken of a ''global savings glut'' that has lowered interest rates worldwide. Ms. Farrell, of the McKinsey Institute, estimates that petrodollars may have kept American interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point lower than they would otherwise be, a direct benefit to American consumers.
 But the flood of investments is also causing problems, like overheated economies and asset bubbles in oil-rich nations.
 ''The gulf countries are pouring credit into their economies, adding to excess liquidity,'' said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of the International Institute of Finance, an organization of leading private financial companies. ''It is eroding the earning power of local citizens and becoming a source of economic instability over time.''
 Some investment deals have fallen through, to the embarrassment of all sides. This year Qatar sought to do a leveraged buyout of a retailer in Britain, the J Sainsbury supermarket chain. 
 After starting the bid in July, Qatar faced concerns from unions, the Sainsbury family and others over whether the Qataris wanted Britain's third-largest grocery chain just for the underlying real estate and whether the company could survive the amount of debt being incurred. The deal fell through three weeks ago, , when Qatar said that the global credit squeeze made the borrowing costs too high.
 The decline in the dollar has also introduced new uncertainties into predicting petrodollar investment patterns. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that while some countries in the gulf were trying to diversify their investments away from the dollar and into euros and pounds sterling, the Saudis were trying to quell that trend out of fear that the dollar will decline further and diminishing the value of their assets.
 A measure of discord over the dollar was apparent at the OPEC meeting in Saudi Arabia this month. Iran and Venezuela, the two biggest political foes of the United States among the oil producers, complained that oil was being sold in a currency whose value was eroding by the day.

HEADLINE: Indexes Up Sharply on Some Good News

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Stock markets snapped back yesterday as promising news on credit and oil emerged from the Middle East, offering investors some reassurance about two recent trouble spots. 
 Financial shares, an albatross on the market of late, rose after a Middle Eastern sovereign fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, invested $7.5 billion in Citigroup, the troubled Wall Street bank. Investors hope the infusion can help stabilize the bank as it struggles to work off its exposure to subprime mortgage securities. Shares of Citi rose 52 cents, to $30.32. 
 Crude oil futures fell more than $3 a barrel after Saudi Arabia's oil minister announced an increase in production. The price decline briefly allayed fears that high oil prices would drag down holiday spending.
 The developments sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 215 points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,958.44. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 21.01 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,428.23. The Nasdaq index climbed 39.81 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,580.80. 
 The gains went a long way toward making up for Monday's sell-off, when all the major indexes entered correction territory after dipping 10 percent below their recent highs.
 ''The equity market is suffering a degree of denial lately,'' said Rob C. Carnell, chief international economist at ING. ''It would love to go up, and it will go up on anything remotely favorable.''
 Yields on Treasury bonds, a traditional safe haven for investors, rose slightly after the 10-year note hit a three-year low. The 10-year note was 3.95 percent, up from 3.84 on Monday.
 ''It was a relief that there were signals of stabilization, particularly for major financial institutions such as Citi,'' said Beth Dater, chief investment officer at AG Asset Management.
 Investors appeared unfazed by a pair of disappointing economic reports yesterday, including a survey that showed consumer confidence this month fell to the lowest level in two years.
 Analysts said a gloomy outlook could increase the chances of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve when it meets next month. 
 Russ Koesterich, who heads investment strategy at Barclays Global Investors, said, ''It's the perversity of taking some of these weak economic stats and spinning them around as more evidence for Fed cuts.''
 There was good news for investors concerned about pressures on spending and inflation: crude oil prices dropped $3.28, to $94.42 a barrel, in New York trading. High oil prices have fueled fears of rising prices, causing concern that consumers would be paying so much more for energy that they would spend less on other goods. 
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Is Referee In Delaware River Fight

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
If litigation is war by other means, then the Supreme Court case of New Jersey v. Delaware is nothing less than civil war -- the latest battle in a dispute over the two states' Delaware River boundary, which has flared up periodically for well over a century.
 Earlier Supreme Court face-offs involved the two states fighting over fishing rights and oyster beds. The case that was argued Tuesday morning has a more modern focus: a huge liquefied natural gas storage and processing plant that BP wants to build on New Jersey's Delaware River shore in Logan Township. 
 New Jersey wants the $600 million plant and the economic boost that its construction and operation would bring. Delaware declared in 2005 that the project would violate its Coastal Zone Act and refused to issue a permit.
 The problem for New Jersey is that operating the plant requires a 2,000-foot pier, which would reach from the New Jersey shore to the navigable part of the river, so tankers can dock and unload.
 Under a 1934 Supreme Court decision that settled a long-disputed boundary, Delaware owns the entire riverbed, from its own shoreline up to the low-water mark on the New Jersey side. But that fact, which neither side in the current case disputes, is not the end of the case, but only the beginning, as the argument on Tuesday made clear.
 A major complicating factor is that in 1905, before the boundary was settled, the two states entered into a compact that is still in effect. It provides that ''each state may, on its own side of the river, continue to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and nature'' under its own laws. 
 The word riparian refers to shoreline, and under traditional land-use law, ownership of shoreline property conveys the right to build a pier or wharf extending far enough into the water to make the property accessible. 
 To New Jersey, permitting the BP project is simply an exercise of ''traditional riparian authority'' recognized under the compact, its lawyer, H. Bartow Farr III, told the justices.
 But ''the question that's really at the rub of this case,'' Delaware's lawyer, David C. Frederick, said when his turn came, ''is what you do on the wharf.'' 
 The ''crucial distinction here,'' he said, was that Delaware was entitled to exercise its police power to block an activity that it considers dangerous or a ''nuisance.'' 
 The justices' many questions during the animated session indicated that they found neither argument completely persuasive.
 ''Obviously, the right to 'wharf out' does not include the right to use the wharf for whatever you like,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said to Mr. Farr.
 And Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. objected to Mr. Frederick that if Delaware was entitled to a veto power over the uses of New Jersey-based piers and wharves, then the effort in the 1905 compact to preserve New Jersey's riparian rights was ''worthless'' and ''meaningless.'' Could Delaware declare that docking a sailboat was a ''nuisance''? he asked. 
 New Jersey brought its case against Delaware directly to the Supreme Court, invoking the court's exclusive constitutional authority to decide suits between states under what is known as the court's ''original jurisdiction.''
 That fact presents a potential, highly unusual wrinkle. Justice Stephen G. Breyer recused himself from the case due to his ownership of BP stock, raising the possibility of a 4-to-4 tie. 
 Ordinarily, a tie vote at the Supreme Court means that the lower court judgment is affirmed, without an opinion and without setting a precedent. But in this instance, there is no lower court judgment. There is simply the report of a lawyer from Portland, Me., Ralph I. Lancaster Jr., whom the justices appointed as a special master to investigate the dispute and make a recommendation. He recommended a ruling for Delaware.
 Kenneth S. Geller, a co-author of ''Supreme Court Practice,'' the leading manual on Supreme Court procedure, said in an interview that he was unaware of a tie vote ever occurring within the court's original jurisdiction. If the court could not decide the case, he said, the states would probably have to find a political solution.

HEADLINE: For Abu Dhabi and Citi, Credit Crisis Drove Deal

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and JULIA WERDIGIER; Vikas Bajaj, Eric Dash, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Louis Uchitelle contributed reporting

 BODY:
A falling dollar, a growing pile of oil revenue and an interest in not being overshadowed by neighboring Dubai's increasingly high profile spurred Abu Dhabi to break with its low-key investing tradition to purchase a big $7.5 billion stake in Citigroup. 
 That is the view of analysts, economists and deal makers who keep an eye on the secretive Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, with assets estimated at $650 billion. Despite its size, Abu Dhabi's royal family has been largely content to pour money into low-return, low-profile investments -- until now. 
 But Abu Dhabi, the largest oil producer of the seven city-states that compose the United Arab Emirates, is worried enough about the eroding value of its pile of petrodollars that it appears ready to pursue more big-ticket deals. 
 With the dollar shrinking, ''they're watching them depreciate and that's driving their anxiety,'' said Marc Ginsberg, former United States ambassador to Morocco, who has worked with companies in other emirates. 
 Citigroup's motivations were just as great. The company's shares have dropped sharply since October, when billions of dollars in write-downs first started to mount. Later, Citi took another $8 billion to $11 billion charge related to bad subprime mortgage investments, which could wipe out its fourth-quarter profit. As a result, it offered Abu Dhabi generous terms to get its money.
 Both sides were driven together by the credit crisis that struck the American economy with such force this summer. Abu Dhabi, like other oil producers, has an interest in making sure the United States economy does not weaken further, said Mr. Ginsberg. 
 And ever since Charles O. Prince III resigned as chairman and chief executive last month, and while Citi's board has searched for a new leader, analysts and investors have renewed calls to dismantle the company.
 Sources close to the deal, who did not want to be quoted because they were not authorized to comment, said Abu Dhabi, a longtime Citi client, had been looking to make a play in financial services to take advantage of market dislocation. They said the emirate had considered buying mortgages or distressed loans. 
 But in recent weeks, it decided to invest directly in financial institutions. The Abu Dhabi fund's original plan was to buy small stakes, say $1 billion or so, in five or six different firms. But it zeroed in on the idea of making a big investment in Citigroup, those close to the deal say, after Mr. Prince was ousted.
 Through its relationships with Citi in the Middle East -- Citi has 14 offices and 4,000 employees in the region -- Abu Dhabi reached out about making a deal. The point person for Citi was Michael S. Klein, the co-head of Citigroup's investment bank, who had spent time in the Persian Gulf region when he ran Citigroup's Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The negotiations took place in large part over the telephone and in video conferences before Mr. Klein and later Robert E. Rubin, the new chairman of Citigroup and a former Treasury secretary, boarded a plane to the Gulf to complete the deal.
 Abu Dhabi's 4.9 percent stake means that nearly 10 percent of Citigroup will be controlled by Middle Eastern investors. Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia already owns a stake of roughly 5 percent after bailing out the company in the early 1990s.
 Given sensitivity to past Arab investments, particularly last year's aborted sale of some American ports to a Dubai firm, Citigroup officials alerted Congressional leaders in Washington before announcing the deal with the sovereign fund. 
 ''I spoke to them at some length about it the day before,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and a senior member of the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, referring to senior Citigroup officials. 
 ''It seemed to me that this is good for Citigroup, it's good for jobs in New York. It bolsters their capital position, allows what is fundamentally a very strong company to weather a difficult time,'' said Mr. Schumer. 
 He contrasted the sovereign fund's deal with Citi to the aborted Dubai ports deal. ''My worries relate when there is a very strong security interest as in the ports deal or if they are buying an entity that is not purely an economic one,'' he said.
 Abu Dhabi has given assurances in other deals that their investments are driven only by economic considerations, not political ones. ''They have made those assurances and have lived up to them in the past,'' Mr. Schumer added. 
 In a complex transaction that has been blessed by federal regulators, the Abu Dhabi fund will have no role in the management or governance of Citigroup, nor any presence on its board.
 ''I think this is a terrific deal for Citi and the global market place as a whole,'' said Sanford I. Weill, Mr. Prince's predecessor and mentor. ''One has to be impressed with how quickly the new leadership team put this together.''
 But Abu Dhabi's ruling family, headed by Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will own the largest individual stake in Citigroup when the deal closes, edging out Prince Walid of Saudia Arabia.
 The sovereign fund, started in 1976, has nearly double the assets of the next largest, Norway's government pension fund, according to Standard Chartered, a British bank. 
 Bankers in the Middle East said the sovereign fund had traditionally funneled more than three-quarters of its cash into other big global investment funds, and eschewed large individual company deals. Investing through other funds has allowed the Abu Dhabi fund to maintain a low profile and to track money flows around the world that could make future big investments like the Citi deal easier.
 Sheik Khalifa is also the fund's chairman and president of the U.A.E., which was ruled by his father, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, for nearly 40 years until his death in 2004. Sheik Zayed was largely credited with helping transform the U.A.E. from a collective of nomadic Bedouin tribesmen to an oil-rich nation with a high literacy rate. 
 While Abu Dhabi contains about 94 percent of the oil reserves in the U.A.E. and includes about 87 percent of the country's land mass, the city-state's international profile has paled in recent years in contrast to that of its neighbor, Dubai. 
 Thanks to a series of big-name deals and an audacious growth strategy, Dubai is becoming a tourism destination, a regional financial center and a favored buyer of marquee assets. On Monday, Dubai International Capital said it had bought a substantial stake in the Sony Corporation. 
 ''They are different animals,'' said David Butter, the Middle East regional head at the Economist Intelligence Unit, comparing Dubai's growth strategy with Abu Dhabi's. ''The purpose of A.D.I.A. is to invest surplus cash in assets that would provide steady gain and returns over time,'' he said, while Dubai, with less oil reserves, has had to create its own sources of wealth. 
 Recently, though, Abu Dhabi has ''generally been changing its approach'' to investments, said Mr. Butter. With the creation of a new investment arm, Mubadala Development, in October of 2002, Abu Dhabi started to invest directly in projects like Nigerian telecommunications and power plants in Algeria. 
 With the Citigroup deal, the Abu Dhabi fund has purchased part of one of the world's biggest banking franchises for a bargain price. A Punk, Ziegel & Company analyst, Richard Bove, raised his rating on the bank yesterday to buy, from market perform, saying the dividend was safe and the franchise was strong. 
 Citigroup's stock closed at $30.32, up 52 cents yesterday, the day after the announcement of the sovereign fund's stake. 
 Like other sovereign wealth funds, the Abu Dhabi fund is looking for investments to help diversify foreign currency reserves earned from exporting oil. 
 Its shift in investment strategy is not immediately being accompanied by an increase in public transparency. Several calls to the company's headquarters in Abu Dhabi went unreturned.

HEADLINE: Mugabe Says He Will Attend Meeting With Europeans

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said Tuesday that he would attend a summit meeting of European and African leaders next week, a move guaranteed to provoke divisions over human rights and a boycott by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. 
 The meeting, in Lisbon, is intended to increase Europe's influence on the African continent, where China has a growing economic presence. However, it may now be overshadowed by Zimbabwe.
 Since the first meeting of the European Union and African leaders in Cairo in 2000, efforts to repeat the event have foundered, because southern African nations have threatened to stay away if Zimbabwe's president were excluded. Despite Zimbabwe's dire economic situation, to many Africans Mr. Mugabe remains a hero of the struggle that brought independence to his country in 1980.
 Britain, the former colonial power in what is now Zimbabwe, was adamant that Mr. Brown would not participate in the summit meeting if it included Mr. Mugabe, who is accused by critics of ruining Zimbabwe's economy, rigging elections and suppressing opposition.
 Luis Amado, foreign minister of Portugal, which holds the European Union presidency, recently said he would prefer that Mr. Mugabe not attend. 
 Though that hope has now been abandoned, South Africa is leading efforts to mediate an agreement between Mr. Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and the Zimbabwean opposition to start a process of transition and ensure fair elections next year. Such a deal could be presented at the Lisbon meeting.
 European officials say Mr. Mugabe, like other leaders, has applied for a visa to visit Lisbon and that formal permission will be granted next week. ''Yes, I'm going,'' he was quoted Tuesday as telling Portuguese Lusa news agency in Mozambique.
 Ed Smith, the British government spokesman in Brussels, said Mr. Mugabe's presence would undermine the summit meeting, diverting attention from the important issues that need to be resolved. ''In those circumstances the prime minister has been clear that neither he nor any senior government minister will attend if Mugabe is present,'' Mr. Smith said. 
 Cold Reception for U.S. Envoy
 HARARE, Zimbabwe, Nov. 27 (AP) -- Zimbabwe's government newspaper offered a chilly, racially tinged welcome on Tuesday to the new United States ambassador, James D. McGee.
 In a column in the newspaper, The Herald, its political editor, Caesar Zvayi, said Mr. McGee had criticized Zimbabwe's democratic and human rights record in statements to the United States Senate before his arrival and, as an appointee of President Bush, was likely ''to turn out to be the house Negro.'' 
 Mr. McGee, an African-American who began his assignment in Harare last week after formally presenting his diplomatic credentials to President Mugabe, declined to respond to Mr. Zvayi's remarks.
 Though ''one of our own, at least as far as skin color is concerned,'' Mr. McGee, a Vietnam veteran, earned three medals for ''bombing hapless villagers'' there, Mr. Zvayi wrote. Mr. McGee earned three Distinguished Flying Crosses during his service in Vietnam. 
 But, Mr. Zvayi wrote, Zimbabwe welcomes Mr. McGee, ''and hopes he will not shame the ancestors in whose loins he crossed the Atlantic to his adopted home.''

HEADLINE: Cable Wins Compromise on F.C.C. Plans

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
In the face of a lobbying blitzkrieg by the cable television industry, the Federal Communications Commission drastically scaled back Tuesday evening a proposal by the agency's chairman to more tightly regulate the industry.
 The compromise was a significant, though not total, victory for the cable industry, whose executives and lobbyists had worked to erode support on the commission for the agenda of the chairman, Kevin J. Martin. Among other things, the commission agreed to postpone for months the decision Mr. Martin had hoped would be made on Tuesday, over whether the cable television industry had grown so dominant that the agency's regulatory authority over it should be expanded. 
 But Mr. Martin and some consumer groups insisted that the decisions by the commission could nonetheless help to make programming more diverse and ultimately reduce cable costs. 
 One of the new rules adopted on Tuesday, for instance, would make it significantly less expensive for independent programmers to lease channels.
 At an acrimonious two-hour hearing that ended shortly before midnight, Jonathan S. Adelstein, a Democratic commissioner, and Robert M. McDowell, a Republican commissioner, criticized the process leading up to the votes. They suggested that Mr. Martin had relied on misleading data about the cable industry's reach, and suppressed more reliable data already in the commission's hands, to justify his regulatory agenda. 
 Mr. Martin disputed them, saying that the F.C.C.'s own data was not reliable, and that the most reliable data available showed that the industry had grown so large that greater regulation was justified. He said no data was suppressed.
 Industry executives and their lobbyists were relieved by the outcome.
 Kyle McSlarrow, the president and chief executive of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the industry's most powerful trade group, said that the commission's decisions ''sends an important message that consumers are best served by marketplace forces, not government micromanagement.''
 As part of the lobbying effort, top cable executives and lobbyists met last week with senior White House officials. Two lobbyists involved in those meetings said on Tuesday that they included Joshua B. Bolten, the chief of staff; Allan B. Hubbard, the president's top economic adviser at the White House; and Joel D. Kaplan, the deputy chief of staff and a longtime friend of Mr. Martin's. 
 A White House spokesman did not return a call seeking comment about the meetings or about whether any officials had contacted the commission.
 Politically, the compromise enabled Mr. Martin to say that he had won something for consumers, although the fight showed that he had lost considerable support from both Democrats and Republicans both at the commission and in Congress.
 ''As a package, these are all important steps,'' Mr. Martin said in an interview Tuesday evening shortly before the commission vote, referring to both the cable provisions and others the agency adopted, including one that extended the Do Not Call registry for five years and another to enable small lower-power radio stations to more easily get on the airwaves. 
 Mr. Martin is a rare Republican appointee of President Bush who has not been afraid to impose stiff regulations where he says there are market failures. In the case of the cable industry, he has complained about increasing prices, vulgar programs and market tactics that he has said have discouraged competition from other paid television providers. 
 In the process, he has alienated cable television executives, who have complained to senior White House officials and lawmakers that Mr. Martin had overreached. They say that he has sought to change the business models of the industry's largest players in an ill-advised effort to help the telephone companies, which have begun to challenge the cable industry by offering their own paid television service.
 Besides the measures on industry dominance and access for independent programmers, Mr. Martin had proposed to set up a new complaint procedure that would impose arbitration to resolve disputes between the cable operators and broadcasters like the NFL Network and the Hallmark channel. But he abandoned that after it became clear on Tuesday morning that he did not have the support he had originally expected.
 A third proposal, to make it less expensive for independent programmers to lease access to channels, was approved 3 to 2, with dissenting votes from Mr. McDowell and another Republican commissioner, Deborah Taylor Tate. But it will be delayed from going into effect until early next year. 
 Mr. Martin had thought earlier this month that he had the support of two of the agency's Democrats for his original proposals, which would have given him a majority of the five-member agency. The commission's two Republicans had in varying degrees publicly questioned some of the proposals.
 But after the recent lobbying barrage, Mr. Adelstein, who is up for renomination soon, began to express reservations about the proposals. 
 Republicans in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr. Martin echoing the industry's concerns, as did senior cable television and network executives. 
 The proposal that drew the most fire was a finding that the industry had become so dominant that the agency should have expanded powers to impose more regulations. 
 Mr. Martin had called for the agency to invoke this authority under the so-called 70/70 rule of the Cable Communications Act of 1984. Under that provision, the agency may adopt any rules necessary to promote ''diversity of information sources'' if the commission concludes that cable television is available to at least 70 percent of American households and that at least 70 percent of those households actually subscribe to a cable service. 
 That finding would provide the legal basis for the commission to adopt rules aimed at increasing programming and reducing rates for consumers and to put a cap that would prevent more growth by the nation's largest cable company, Comcast.
 The data originally used for the finding was based not on direct numbers from companies, but on surveys by industry analysts. Under the compromise, cable companies will have two months to submit the numbers of customers and size of their markets, which the agency could use next year to determine whether the industry had reached the threshold for more regulation.
 Mr. Martin had moved forward even though he did not appear to have the support of his two Republican colleagues, in the hopes that he could gain support from the two Democrats at the agency. Consumer groups said they had received what they took to be unambiguous commitments from the Democratic commissioners. 
 But in recent days, Mr. Adelstein disputed that he had given the groups a firm commitment.

HEADLINE: Battle-Scarred and Emerging a Fighter

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: MILFORD, N.H. 

 BODY:
He has beat his Diet Coke addiction -- ''too much caffeine.'' He no longer shrinks from foreign policy talk and salts his speeches with lines like, ''I saw a piece recently in the Guardian newspaper, a British newspaper.'' And where he once meandered from topic to topic, the John Edwards of today tries to keep it concise.
 ''Because I want to take your questions, I am not talking about what I think is a moral crisis, which is climate change,'' he told an audience at Dartmouth College in November. ''I hope somebody will ask me about it. I think it's a huge issue facing the world. I am not talking about poverty, which is my personal passion.'' 
 Then it's on to Iraq and Iran.
 Mr. Edwards, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 and then ran with Senator John Kerry as his vice-presidential choice, has not dispensed with his old self as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination this year. Poverty was a central theme in the 2004 primary campaign, with his signature ''two Americas'' speech on economic inequality, and it is still a focus today. 
 Mr. Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina, also remains an emotional, wide-eyed campaigner speaking out against injustices, invoking his mill-worker father and the corporations he fought as a personal injury lawyer in courtrooms.
 But there have been certain refinements in the four years since Mr. Edwards first stumped through Iowa and New Hampshire, a reporter who has seen both campaigns has found. 
 Much of the change is in style, as his competitors have noted. Mr. Edwards was sunny and optimistic in 2004, to the point of criticizing other candidates for their ''sniping.'' 
 ''If we are the party of anger in 2004, we will not win,'' he said back then. He also said, ''I don't believe voters in New Hampshire care about what someone said seven years ago about whatever they were talking about. I don't think they care about what somebody said yesterday about some small nuance of some issue.''
 But this time he is often the one doing the sniping, usually singling out his rival Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. He has criticized her record on Iraq and Iran, hammered her for accepting donations from corporate lobbyists and portrayed her as a Washington insider, no different from Republican politicians -- lines of attack that are similar to those of liberal bloggers. 
 This shift in style is, in some ways, more consistent with Mr. Edwards's resume as a ferocious and successful trial lawyer, but it raises the question of which is closer to his true self, the candidate of 2003 or of 2007?
 Mr. Edwards insists he has not fundamentally changed, but the experience of the last campaign, the return of his wife Elizabeth's incurable cancer, and his intense preparation for this campaign have undoubtedly had an effect.
 ''I do think that when you go through a national campaign, the intensity of a national campaign, and the experience we've had with Elizabeth's health, it does make you tougher,'' he said in an interview between campaign stops in New Hampshire. ''It seasons you. There's also more depth because I have done a lot of work both during the last campaign and since the last campaign. It's a combination of all those things.''
 The most obvious difference in this campaign comes in what Mr. Edwards emphasizes and what he does not. While Mr. Edwards in 2004 played up his single Senate term as a way to overcome doubts about his experience and political heft, today he hardly mentions that part of his resume -- nor does he mention his run on a presidential ticket, a unique experience among his rivals -- presumably in the interest of promoting himself as a Washington outsider.
 Instead, his courtroom days are front and center, mainly used to portray himself as a fighter.
 ''I beat them, and I beat them, and I beat them again,'' he thundered here at a town-hall-style meeting, describing his trial victories against big corporations with a line reprised from 2004.
 While lobbyists fell in his gun sights then, he has stepped up the attack to accuse them of ''corrupting the government'' -- a shift he describes as ''directness and honesty.'' ''Using a word like 'corruption' would have been a hard thing in 2004 because nobody uses words like that,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''You're supposed to be more careful. It's not politically correct.''
 This edgier side has brought accusations of hypocrisy from opponents and cost him an important supporter in this state, where he is trailing in the polls and came in fourth in 2004.
 State Senator Lou D'Allessandro, a kingmaker who was chairman of Mr. Edwards's campaign here in 2004 and who was lobbied heavily by most of the Democratic contenders, decided earlier this month to support Mrs. Clinton.
 ''He is a lot different,'' Mr. D'Allessandro said in an interview. ''He is in attack mode now rather than talking about the two Americas and using that warm, embracing style that he had.''
 The last time, of course, Mr. Edwards, with his positive message and tone, found it hard to be heard in a crowded field.
 It bears noting that he was never entirely warm and fuzzy then, either. Before he got to the talk about ''building people up, not tearing them down,'' he raged against ''George W. Bush'' -- he almost always used the initial -- ''walking around that ranch with his huge belt buckle,'' ignoring the plight of ''real America.''
 Mr. Edwards said he believed he had bridged the failure of the last campaign with the spunk of the new one.
 ''I'm seasoned enough to now believe that you need both,'' he said, ''that hope alone won't do it, that there are fights that have to be taken.''

HEADLINE: When Fuel and Politics Mix

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Farhana Hossain contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
As oil prices flirt with record highs, hovering around $95 a barrel on Tuesday, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are offering few quick fixes but profoundly different long-term approaches to energy policy.
 Over the next decade or two, the differences could have a major effect on billions of dollars in government spending, on the relative prices of gasoline versus renewable fuels and on the efficiency of American cars and trucks.
 For Democrats, the goal of energy policy is largely about reducing oil consumption and has become inseparable from the goal of reducing the risk of climate change.
 For the Republican candidates, energy policy is primarily about producing more energy at home -- more oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; more use of American coal to produce liquid fuel; and, as with Democrats, more renewable fuels like ethanol. 
 By contrast, all of the Democratic candidates would repeal billions of dollars in tax breaks for oil companies, spend billions more each year to develop alternative fuels, and require cars and trucks to be far more fuel-efficient.
 Indeed, most of the Democratic rivals are proposing plans that are more aggressive than the bills that Democratic leaders in Congress are hoping to pass before year-end. The disparity raises questions about whether the candidates' plans are politically realistic. The candidates, however, are quietly acknowledging limits to what they can offer in the way of immediate relief, aside from putting more money into a program that helps low-income people with the cost of heating oil. 
 ''There are no short-term solutions,'' said Leo Hindery, the chief economic adviser to John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina who has positioned himself to the populist left of his principal Democratic rivals. 
 The Republican contenders, maintaining the traditional conservative approach of relying on market forces, are much more reluctant to impose change through restrictions on oil and coal or mandates for alternative fuels.
 ''The truth is that the answer to high prices is high prices,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, a top economic adviser to Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts. ''This is one area where the public expects more from politicians than politicians can deliver.''
 To be sure, the party contrasts are muddled in some areas. 
 Among the Democrats, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois supports the development of coal-based ''clean'' liquid fuels -- an idea that grates on many environmentalists who see coal as a major contributor to global warming. Senator Obama also is open to government support for nuclear power while Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she is agnostic on the issue.
 Within the G.O.P. group, Senator John McCain of Arizona has broken with the Republican orthodoxy on increasing energy production. Senator McCain repeatedly opposed oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a top goal for both President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress.
 Likewise, Senator McCain and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, are the only Republican candidates to support mandatory limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. Mr. Huckabee, who has positioned himself as a standard-bearer for social conservatives and Christian evangelicals, recently called action on climate change a ''moral issue.'' 
 Manik Roy, a lobbyist for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the Republican candidates may be more divided than they appear about controlling greenhouse emissions.
 Mr. Romney, for example, said he opposed government restrictions. As governor of Massachusetts, he stayed out of a regional ''cap and trade'' plan by Northeastern states to impose ceilings on emissions by electric utilities and let companies trade their emission allowances. 
 But shortly after he made that decision, his state regulators imposed their own restrictions on such emissions.
 For consumers, the precise effects are difficult to predict. Democratic mandates to sharply increase the use of renewable fuels could initially lead to higher prices at the gas pump, much as the mandate to blend ethanol into gasoline contributed to higher prices in 2005.
 But over time, a large expansion of biofuels could both reduce their own production costs and put downward pressure on oil prices. Much would depend on how fast new technologies, like ellulosic ethanol, become practical on a large scale.
 The Republican proposals to expand domestic oil and gas drilling could damp oil prices, though not for at least five years because of the long lead times to discover and develop new reserves. Likewise, Republican support for coal-based liquid diesel fuel could eventually drive down prices for gasoline. But without expensive and still unperfected technology to capture carbon dioxide, such liquids would increase the production of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say would aggravate global warming. 
 At the same time, Republican proposals to encourage more oil and gas drilling, and the candidates' reluctance to require lower greenhouse emissions, could boomerang by prolonging what President Bush has called the nation's addiction to oil.
 Though they differ on the details, the Democrats all closely link the goals of ''energy independence'' and slowing global warming.
 Most of them would create a cap-and-trade program, under which the government would set a ceiling on carbon emissions and require companies that burn fossil fuels to bid for carbon permits through an auction. The ceilings would be steadily lowered over the coming decades, with a goal of reducing carbon emissions as much as 80 percent below current volumes. 
 But for Republicans, energy policy is quite separate from the issue of climate change -- and some of the candidates have been skeptical that global warming needs to be addressed. 
 The Republican candidates have mostly been silent about repealing tax breaks for oil companies. Though all the candidates support investment in biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel (Iowa, after all, dominates the early primary race in both parties), most of the Republicans oppose mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions that would effectively penalize the use of oil and coal. 
 In a written response to questions about his energy positions, Mr. Romney said on Friday that ''now is not the right time to raise taxes on our oil companies'' and expressed doubt about requirements to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
 ''While it is likely that human activity is contributing to climate change, I am not sure how much, or what we can do to significantly reduce or reverse this effect,'' Mr. Romney wrote. Any new mandates for renewable fuels should be ''a collaborative effort between industry, scientists, and the agriculture and energy communities.''
 By contrast, the leading Democratic presidential candidates have jumped ahead of their own colleagues in Congress -- possibly too far ahead to be politically realistic.
 In Congress, for example, Democratic leaders have coalesced behind a cap-and-trade proposal under which the government would initially give away about half the carbon-emission allotments to the factories and electric utilities that would need them, granting them a large subsidy to help pay for future investments. But most of the Democratic candidates insist that companies should bid for all the allotments in an auction and pay for them, which would raise much more money for the government.
 The Democratic candidates are also running ahead of their counterparts in Congress on fuel economy. The Senate recently passed a bill that would increase the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2017. The current requirement is 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 21.3 miles per gallon for pickups, sport utility vehicles and minivans.
 Most of the Democratic candidates would go much further. Senator Clinton says she would require 40 miles per gallon by 2020 and 55 miles per gallon by 2030. Mr. Edwards favors 40 miles per gallon by 2016, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico wants to push to achieve 50 miles per gallon by 2020.
 But those requirements could be impossible to pass. In the House, Democrats from Michigan and other car-producing states strenuously oppose even the Senate's comparatively modest plan. After months of stalemate, House and Senate Democrats are close to agreeing on a compromise before Christmas.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Major Candidates On Energy: Hillary Rodham Clinton: Invest $150 billion over the next 10 years to ''cut foreign oil imports by two-thirds from 2030 projected levels.'' One-third of money would go toward developing alternative energy.
John Edwards: Create a $13-billion-a-year fund to finance research and development of energy technologies
reduce oil imports by ''nearly a third of the oil projected to be used in 2025.''
Barack Obama: Invest $150 billion over the next 10 years to develop new energy sources. Reduce ''oil consumption overall by at least 35 percent by 2030.''
Rudolph W. Giuliani: Advocates an Apollo-like project. Says ''every potential solution must be pursued,'' including increased energy exploration and ''aggressive investment in alternative energy sources.''
John McCain: Says his national energy strategy will ''promote the diversification and conservation of our energy sources that will in sufficient time break the dominance of oil in our transportation sector.''
 Mitt Romney: Advocates program similar to Apollo and Manhattan Projects. Emphasizes need for domestic drilling along with development of alternative energy sources. Chart lists TAX BREAKS FOR OIL AND GAS COMPANIES as well as personal profiles for each candidate. (pg. C4)

HEADLINE: China Rejects Europe's Call For Currency To Rise Faster

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
China signaled Tuesday that it would resist European demands for rapid appreciation of the yuan and would instead continue gradual progress toward a more flexible exchange rate.
 As Beijing comes under increasing pressure to curb its soaring trade surplus with Europe, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told the visiting French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, on Monday that China was determined to move at its own pace in permitting its currency to trade more freely, the state-run media reported.
 The European Union, China's biggest trading partner, accuses Beijing of holding the yuan at an artificially low level to assist Chinese exporters, contributing to the trade imbalance. China's surplus is forecast to widen 30 percent this year, to 170 billion euros, ($252 billion). 
 While Mr. Sarkozy was winding up his three-day visit Tuesday, a delegation of European monetary officials, including the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet; Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg; and the European Union monetary affairs commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, began two days of talks in Beijing.
 ''We will have a large tour d'horizon on all matters, including of course the currency question,'' Mr. Trichet said in Beijing, referring to the coming broad survey of policies, Reuters reported.
 The United States, the No. 2 trading partner with China, and other developed economies are also demanding that Beijing allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. will lead a delegation of senior Bush administration officials to Beijing next month for a third round of regular economic talks, during which China's trade surplus will again come under scrutiny, trade analysts have said.
 Senior Chinese leaders have said they want more balanced trade but have so far refused to give ground on currency policy.
 While China is criticized for what its trading partners say are unfair barriers to foreign products, rampant intellectual property theft and the poor quality of some of its exported goods, it is the value of its currency that draws the most hostility, trade specialists say.
 Since Beijing allowed a 2.1 percent increase in the value of the yuan against the dollar in July 2005, it has allowed the currency to appreciate by almost 10 percent. Most analysts expect this to continue.
 But the Chinese currency has declined sharply against the euro, and some European monetary specialists say it is undervalued by as much as 25 percent.
 Chinese officials and some trade experts counter that the trade statistics alone can be misleading.
 They note that exchange rates and trade balance figures are part of increasingly complex international commercial relationships.
 Chinese government officials say that foreign businesses based in China are benefiting from the export boom just as much as local manufacturers.
 More than 50 percent of exports from China in the first nine months of this year were shipped from factories with foreign ownership, according to Chinese government and European Union statistics. The customs value of these exports when they leave Chinese ports does not take into account the value of materials, technology or design from abroad.
 Chinese officials also say the trade statistics fail to reflect the benefits that foreign retailers and consumers gain from the flood of cheap, good-quality Chinese manufactured goods now widely available in international markets.
 Some trade experts say that even if Beijing did allow a sharp increase in the value of the yuan, there is no guarantee that this would lead to an immediate change in the trade balance.
 They note that in response to international pressure, Japan allowed the yen to rise for long stretches in the 1990s without significant impact on its trade surplus.
 Foreign companies and governments would be better advised to pay attention to China's numerous barriers to imported goods and services, according to Chinese and foreign trade experts.
 The European Union estimates that these barriers cost European businesses about 20 billion euros in lost trade each year.

HEADLINE: Bourbon's Shot At the Big Time

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
IN the recent history of whiskey, bourbon would seem to have had a lot going for it. It's homegrown, for one thing. Grass-roots acceptance counts for a lot when you are battling for shelf space. Bourbon has always been right up there with college football, Nascar and canned beer -- the sort of whiskey that anyone can order without fear of being labeled effete or snobbish. 
 Yet, awareness is not always enough in the whiskey business. The days are long gone when ''Dallas'' ruled the airwaves and J. R. Ewing made bourbon and branch a household term. When bourbon distillers looked up 20 years ago they saw the market moving in two directions, both away from them. Affluent drinkers were exploring the wonders and complexities of single malts while younger bar-goers were turning to vodka and rum.
The dive in sales forced bourbon producers to accept that the whiskey market had changed. They might not be able to compete with vodka, but to avoid permanent relegation to the dusty back shelves of liquor stores, bourbon producers would have to find a way to attract the budding connoisseur class. 
 Enter the small batch, the single barrel and the special selection, marketing terms for what the industry calls high-end and superpremium bourbons. These whiskeys are chosen to emphasize complexity and even elegance, a quality that has rarely been associated with bourbon and a word that no doubt panics bourbon marketers who still favor the rural look of bib overalls, boots and gimme hats (that effete snob thing). 
 If you love whiskey but haven't thought of bourbon as being in the same league as a good Scotch, Irish and even, these days, rye, you owe it to yourself to give it another try. A well-made, well-aged bourbon offers a gorgeous spectrum of flavors, beginning with a distinctive sweetness that can, depending on the distiller's aim, turn spicy and peppery with clear fruitiness, or mellow into a creamy caramel toffee with highlights of citrus.
 Confidence bred of success has led distillers to pay more attention to their best whiskeys. Meanwhile, microdistilleries all over the United States are getting into the act. While they have not yet made their presence felt on a national scale -- whiskey takes a lot of time -- it's easy to anticipate their eventually making a mark.
 Clearly, the producers' efforts to improve quality, coinciding with the rebirth of the cocktail culture, have been a big success. The resurgence in spirit sales in the United States has been led by the high-end brands, said David Ozgo, chief economist for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group, and that is especially true of bourbon. 
 From 2002 to 2006, sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey rose by 12.23 percent. In the same period, sales of high-end whiskeys ($20 to $30) rose by 27.62 percent and sales of superpremium bourbons (above $30) rose by 60.52 percent. 
 Sales are one thing. The Dining section's tasting panel recently evaluated 25 bourbons strictly to answer another question: How good are these whiskeys, anyway? The short answer is, very good. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Pete Wells, editor of the Dining section, who has written extensively about drinks, and Ethan R. Kelley, the spirit sommelier at the Brandy Library in TriBeCa. 
 To begin, let's get our nomenclature straight. While many people believe that bourbon must come from Kentucky, it's not true. Bourbon can be made anywhere in the United States as long as two federal conditions are met. First, the blend of grains from which the whiskey is distilled must be at least 51 percent corn. Second, the whiskey must be stored in charred new oak containers. If it is aged in the oak containers (federal regulators do not seem to like the word barrel) for two years or more it qualifies as straight bourbon whiskey.
 Bourbon is not Tennessee whiskey, like Jack Daniel's, which is essentially made like bourbon until it is filtered through charcoal, at which point it becomes Tennessee whiskey. Bourbon is also not corn whiskey, which by law cannot be stored in charred oak containers. A whiskey can be distilled 100 percent from corn, but if it so much as kisses those charred oak containers it becomes bourbon.
 While these laws may seem rigid, they leave a lot of room for creative distilling. Once you've got your 51 percent corn in the blend of grains (which distillers call the mash bill), you've got important decisions to make. Most distillers probably use 65 percent to 75 percent corn, blended with some proportion of rye, wheat or malted barley, and each grain provides different characteristics. The corn offers the sweetness and lush texture that are the basis of so many bourbons. Wheat adds a mellow roundness, while rye provides a spicy, peppery fruitiness and a dry quality. Barley can add a creaminess and a grainy sweetness.
 Producers must also decide how long to age their whiskeys. Younger whiskeys tend to be more aggressive and fiery. Aging tames the whiskeys, rounding off raw edges and bringing out a smooth complexity. 
 Younger and older whiskeys have their attractions, but with bourbon long-term aging is particularly beneficial, at least in my opinion. I loved the smoothness and the added complexity in some of the older bourbons we tasted, but the combination didn't always sit well with Ethan.
 ''I don't know if bourbon was designed to be so elegant and proper,'' he lamented, though not unhappily.
 We all noted the wide range of flavors in these bourbons, from creamy chocolate and fruity to grassy and herbaceous. ''It was not the full frontal corn assault that once dominated bourbon,'' Pete said, noting that the flavors in some bottles seemed beyond the realm of what might be acceptable in bourbon.
 The bourbons we tasted ranged in price from $14 to $120, and while a $20 bottle, Jim Beam Black, was our best value, there was some correlation between price and quality. 
 The most expensive bourbon, the 16-year-old A. H. Hirsch Reserve, was something of an anomaly. It was among the last batches of whiskey distilled at Michter's Distillery in Schaefferstown, Pa., which closed in 1989. 
 The name Michter's lives on as a brand, but it is distilled in Kentucky (Michter's U.S. 1 Bourbon did not make our cut). The A. H. Hirsch is a fine whiskey, smoky and complex, but the $120 is mostly for its rarity. 
 Naturally, the bourbon industry wants to capitalize on the cocktail craze, which is fine, but anybody who makes a mixed drink of our No. 1 bourbon, Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 20-Year-Old, needs some remedial shaking and stirring. This is clearly a sipping whiskey of wonderful complexity, which would be wasted in even the finest mint julep or bourbon punch. The same goes for our No. 2, the fruity and chocolate-and-caramel-flavored Vintage 17-Year-Old. 
 If mix you must, I would suggest our No. 3, the brisk, spicy Knob Creek, which tastes as if it has a rye component. It might be the perfect whiskey for one of those cocktails that seem to be at home with either rye or bourbon. 
 Some of the biggest names in bourbon did not make our list. Wild Turkey just missed. It was good bourbon, but the panel did not find it distinctive enough in this company. We also liked the Van Winkle's 10-Year-Old, which we thought would be great for cocktails. Maker's Mark did not come close. 
 While the rules do not require it, most bourbons do, in fact, come from Kentucky. One that does not is the Hudson Four Grain Bourbon, distilled by Tuthilltown Spirits in the Hudson Valley. We liked it very much but left it off the list because it is virtually impossible to find. 
 Each of us also had a favorite or two that did not make the list. Ethan liked an Elijah Craig 18-Year-Old and an Eagle Rare Single Barrel 10-Year-Old. Pete liked the Eagle and the Wild Turkey. Florence liked the Elijah Craig and the Virginia Gentleman, an old brand that has the distinction of being distilled in Kentucky then redistilled in Virginia. I very much liked a Corner Creek Reserve 8-Year-Old and Bulleit.
 The strongest bourbon in the tasting was Wild Turkey, at 101 proof. The final strength of a whiskey is another choice that distillers must make. 
 While the just-distilled whiskey can be as high as 160 proof, those pesky federal laws mandate that it must be watered down at least to 125 proof before entering those charred oak containers. 
 By the time it is bottled, it can be as low as 80 proof, so producers have a lot of room to find just the right strength. If you find a bourbon that seems too strong, do what the producers do and add more water. Or ice.

HEADLINE: A Rural Dance Tradition in Twilight

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

DATELINE: OMAHA 

 BODY:
It was a Sunday afternoon at the South Omaha Eagles Hall, a Czech stronghold in an increasingly Hispanic neighborhood here. Under a low ceiling and fluorescent lights, Lila Dvorak, 74, danced a two-step polka to the music of a three-piece combo. 
 Ms. Dvorak is Czech-American, and a child of the Great Depression, like almost all of the 150 or so people present. She is a regular at the dances and wore a fancy magenta dress for the occasion. ''Polka people are happier people,'' she said. ''I don't think you see anyone around here with a long face.''
 All over the United States, where there are Eastern Europeans, there is polka. In the isolated farmland counties of eastern Nebraska, where it is not uncommon to drive 30 miles for groceries, polka helps tie people together. The dances and the radio shows devoted to the music keep old friends in touch and circulate local news.
 Brought to the United States by Central European immigrants in the mid-19th century, polka is now part of American vernacular culture, a music with little commercial viability but a strong social function. From state to state, its details and dance steps carry codes of Old World origin and New World region. 
 This evening Mark Vyhlidal was calling the tunes, with a reduced version of his usual ensemble, the Mark Vyhlidal Orchestra. Mr. Vyhlidal, 45, is a central figure in the polka scene of eastern Nebraska. At the Eagles Hall his band topped the bill, playing in two-song sets: polka, waltzes and what he calls ''modern,'' which mostly means Nashville-style country music. Earlier that day he had been busy promoting the gig on the radio. Starting at 9 a.m. every Sunday for the last 19 years, he has broadcast from KJSK in Columbus, Neb., as host of ''All-Star Polka Show,'' a kind of weekly newspaper for the older generations here.
 Polka reflects their lives: their sense of humor and romance, and what they remember of Czech family ritual. And Mr. Vyhlidal's listenership, spanning a 200-mile radius, including parts of South Dakota and Kansas, wants to hear about itself. 
 In between songs by famous local Czech-American bandleaders like Al Grebnick and Ernie Kucera, Mr. Vyhlidal makes room for callers and their family news: deaths, births, deployments, knee replacements. He stays unfailingly crisp and upbeat, except when he reads a funeral home advertisement; then his voice takes on deep, sympathetic tones. At 11:15, it's time to turn up the volume, as Mr. Vyhlidal announces the week's polka dances at the bars and veterans' halls.
 He is a naturally gifted musician. In his band he plays accordion, valve trombone, trumpet and keyboards, all of which he taught himself. He writes his arrangements at his kitchen table, without a piano. His son Jacob, 8, plays button accordion, and his version of the polka war horse ''Apples, Peaches, Pumpkin Pie'' has become a popular feature at the band's shows.
 A Labor of Love 
 At dances, the audience gathers near the stage, where the cornmeal on the floor eases the glide, to cheer on the rare sight of a polka fan from the next generation. Mr. Vyhlidal has kept his current band intact since the early 1990s, and its players are among the younger and more versatile polka musicians around. But they have to schedule the gigs around other employment. 
 In Mr. Vyhlidal's case, he almost never plays during the cold months, since a function of his day job -- superintendent of public services for the city of Fremont, 40 miles northwest of Omaha -- involves driving a snowplow. Playing polka isn't a living, although it could have been in the 1970s, when dances were much more plentiful. 
 ''It's a getaway from normal life,'' said Mike Helgesen, 60, the Vyhlidal band's tenor saxophonist.
 Mr. Vyhlidal added: ''A lot of it is about the heritage. Keeping it going. There are songs we know that have been around for a hundred years, and they're still being played.''
 Styles for States
 Polka came to Nebraska in the 1850s, when Czechs fled worsening economic conditions in Bohemia and Moravia, drawn by the promise of large tracts of American farmland. In the beginning polka meant just one thing: a specific, two-beat couples dance. But now it describes a range of dances and rhythms usually achieved with an accordion, a tuba and sentimental lyrics about family, food, love and rural memories. 
 There are plenty of stylistic differences. Polish polka, for instance, is a different animal from Czech. It is faster and more staccato, with every instrument playing more fills; it sounds urban, and it swings. Czech polka is simpler, more legato and emotional. In a small combo it can sound heavy and sad, even at a medium tempo.
 Polka took off in the United States with the advent of radio and records, just like the rest of American popular music; by the 1940s, a popular polka bandleader like Frankie Yankovic was selling millions of records. For Czech polka, the significant name around here was that of Mr. Kucera, a drummer from Abie, Neb.
 At one time or another, Mr. Kucera, who started his band in the early '40s, seemingly employed nearly every polka musician in the area. He was all farmer, pure Czech, a great soul. ''The older he got, the more sublime he got,'' said Bud Comte, the proprietor of Renee Sound Studio, a polka recording studio with an attached feed store in David City, Neb. Mr. Kucera retired from performing in 2000; he died in July at 87.
 Nebraska's leading Czech polka bands have always had to play in several styles. Touring all over the Midwest and down into Texas, they are at pains to replicate the polka style of each area's ethnic group: German in parts of upper Wisconsin and Minnesota, Slovenian in lower Wisconsin, Czech in Texas. (Polish polka is usually beyond the call of Czech bands.) 
 But even within Czech polka there are differences. In the '60s Ron Nadherny, 73, a drummer and bandleader based in Omaha, used to tour with John Wilfahrt, better known as Whoopee John, one of the country's most famous polka bandleaders. ''We found out that in Iowa the tempo was a little slower than it is here,'' Mr. Nadherny said. ''In Minnesota it was a little faster than it is here. Wisconsin, it went like a bat out of you-know-what. And they all danced to it with different steps.''
 In Nebraska polka is farmers' music, and since the farm crisis of the 1980s, the farming population here has shrunk to a fraction of what it used to be. As a result, most of the rural counties have been thinning slowly and steadily, some losing more than 10 percent of their populations since 2000. At the same time, non-Czech immigrant populations have greatly increased; since 1990, entry-level jobs at meatpacking plants across Nebraska have nearly quadrupled the state's Hispanic population, mostly in its cities, to more than 130,000. 
 Sometimes it seems as if Mr. Vyhlidal is propping up the music as the polka scene slips away. Most of the great bandleaders have retired or died; many of the orchestras and eight-piece bands have shrunk to three-piece combos. There are fewer places to play, and the surviving ballrooms are drawing much smaller crowds. Even the tighter police presence on the small roads around Omaha has played a role in polka's demise: it discourages the time-honored practice of drinking plenty of Busch Light at a dance. 
 And it's possible that Ms. Dvorak might lose her Sunday party soon: the Fraternal Order of Eagles building in South Omaha is for sale.
 Spinning at the Starlite
 On a Sunday evening at the Starlite Ballroom -- the area's largest polka palace and the only one with a wooden dance floor -- Lenny Blecha, 42, leaned against the bar, watching his wife dance with a succession of old men. It was the annual birthday dance for his distant cousins Bob and Greg Blecha, father-and-son farmers and jacks-of-all-trades from Pawnee City, Neb. Their band, the Bouncing Czechs, split the bill with the Mark Vyhlidal combo. The crowd looked sparse, maybe 200 people; it was an unusually warm day, and many farmers had been out harvesting. 
 The Starlite Ballroom opened in Wahoo in 1964. On a rural highway set against alfalfa and corn fields, about 25 minutes west of Omaha, it routinely drew 800 people for Saturday night polka dances in the '60s and '70s. Some of the booths are stenciled with a ''reserved'' sign, but now you can sit where you please. 
 Lenny Blecha runs an auto-body shop in Table Rock, Neb., and also buys and sells polka records on eBay. Television, he says, has hurt live music in general, and all of his friends listen to rock and country. But he's still incredulous that even the older folks in the rural counties aren't doing more to keep the polka bands working and the dances running. 
 ''Most of these people here are senior citizens, and if something says 'Free,' they're going to show up,'' Mr. Blecha said. ''If it's a dollar donation, the dance hall is full. If they charge you five dollars, half the crowd won't be there.''
 He ordered a beer. ''I'm one of the youngest here, and we get a lot of compliments,'' he added. ''People wish there were more of us. And the younger generation I visit with, they don't understand. I say: 'Why don't you go visit with your parents and grandparents and find out what they listened to? This brings you back to your roots.''' 
 But older locals seem to have a more philosophical view of the decline of their polka traditions, citing the same reason over and over, in much the same way. It is one of the binding narratives for a highly sentimental music. 
 ''It's our generation's fault,'' said Darlene Kliment, 68, who owns the Starlite with her husband, Ron. ''When we were growing up, our parents would take us to the dances. We'd fall asleep on the side of the stage, or in the booths. 
 ''But then when our generation grew up, we got baby sitters.''

HEADLINE: For a Tunnel To Go 16 Miles, No Light Yet

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
GARDEN CITY, N.Y.
 A reasonably sane person contemplating the modest proposal of the developer Vincent Polimeni to build a $10 billion, privately financed, 16-mile tunnel linking Long Island and Westchester -- the longest autos-only tunnel in the world and the first to be privately built in the United States -- might start with two thoughts.
 The first: This might be a brilliant idea or a nutty one, but in an era of shrunken ambitions, give the guy credit for a big idea that goes back to Robert Moses, who in the 1960s championed a bridge over pretty much the same route. 
 The second: If Moses couldn't get his bridge built back when projects this grandiose actually came to fruition, Mr. Polimeni's prospects rank somewhere between an N.B.A. title for the Knicks and a Hillary-Rudy unity presidential ticket.
 Still, before surrendering to thought No. 2, let us take a moment to consider Mr. Polimeni's proposal for two three-lane tunnels (with a third service tunnel linking them) to be built underneath Long Island Sound by 2025. 
 Mr. Polimeni, who with his son Michael views the world from a boxy office tower in Garden City, came up with the idea after realizing that advances in drilling technology made the proposal possible and that similar projects, like the Chunnel linking England and France, were either under way or completed around the world. 
 Look at the map, as Moses did in the 1960s, and it's easy to see the logic. Instead of being funneled toward Queens and the Bronx over the Throgs Neck or Whitestone Bridges, cars and trucks headed north and west to upstate and New England and south and east to Long Island could save hours of time and millions of gallons of gas by using a tunnel under the Sound. No unsightly bridge! Environmentally friendly high-tech air-scrubbing and venting!
 The promoters say it would save time, and with up to 80,000 cars not stuck idling in gridlocked traffic, it would reduce fuel consumption by more than 24 million gallons a year and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 235 tons per day. It's safe to assume that those numbers will not go unscrubbed. And there's always the rejoinder that if the ride is that simple, maybe it will simply produce more cars and more pollution.
 ''This is very doable from an economic standpoint and from an engineering standpoint, with minimal environmental impacts and with enormous environmental benefits in terms of air quality,'' said Patrick Halpin, a former Suffolk County executive, who is working with the developers. ''The question is, do we really have the political will to do something about the traffic congestion that is choking the region?''
 State Senator Carl L. Marcellino, chairman of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee, who happens to represent the high-dollar Gold Coast area that would be the project's Long Island terminus, says he'll begin holding hearings on it in January.
 Senator Marcellino, whose predecessor, Ralph Marino, a former Senate majority leader, got much of the credit for killing the proposed bridge in the 1960s, didn't sound exactly welcoming. ''This project is expected to cost close to $10 billion, and my constituents and I have raised about 10 billion questions,'' he said. 
 The review process should ask that and more -- nuts and bolts ones on the impact of the project on existing roads and highways and big picture ones about whether it's needed (why not more ferries?), whether the price is right ($25 tolls?) and whether an all-auto project of this magnitude makes any sense. Don't expect it to happen without a rail component as well. 
 Still, out of the box, the local concerns popped up first. Steve Otis, the mayor of Rye, which would be the Westchester terminus of the tunnel, immediately condemning the idea and Senator Marcellino citing a laundry list of neighborhood concerns.
 ''The lawyers are going to have a field day,'' he said. He didn't sound overly bothered. Asked if he thought the project would happen, he said: ''If I had to guess right now, I don't think so. It's got a lot of hurdles to jump over.''
 HERE are two other issues. The first is whether the civic technology for killing projects is so much more refined than the technology for building them that you can't attempt a project like this anywhere near high-dollar neighborhoods in the Northeast.
 The second is whether the cooperation between city and suburb is so flaccid that there just isn't the political will to get this done, whatever its merits.
 If it's a lousy idea, it's hopeless. If it actually makes sense, economically and environmentally, the question is whether the handful of people who really matter in Manhattan, Albany, Nassau and White Plains think this is worth investing political capital on. 
 The early reaction will be worth watching. Either this dies a quick death or we're at the beginning of a process that will make the seemingly endless rebuilding of the Tappan Zee Bridge look like an impulse purchase at the mall.

HEADLINE: They're Mad, They're Bad, They Sell Accent Pieces

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
IF the flame-colored lettering on the fire exit at the Manhattan apartment of Garry Jensen and Elena Bertinetto looks like graffiti, that is because it is: domesticated graffiti, if you will. Walking through Harlem, Mr. Jensen and Ms. Bertinetto spotted the artist at work and hired him on the spot. 
 That chandelier over the dining table? It came from a shop at the Marche aux Puces flea market, and it cost about $8,000. The dealer said two others like it were in a home once owned by Coco Chanel. 
 Starting to get the picture? This European husband and wife, who are as bad as two former investment bankers can be, have just started an online home decor shop, Deeply Madly Living, that cultivates an outlaw image with its design picks and slogan ('''Cool' living for the wild at heart''), but doesn't shy away from $9,500 cabinets. Their newly decorated apartment in Manhattan's garment district cost $2.1 million. That lithograph in the foyer is indeed a Picasso. 
 But you are perhaps distracted by the dark lettering beneath the flowered chiffon sleeve of Ms. Bertinetto's blouse, which is, on closer inspection, a tattoo of her husband's name. She is the daughter of an Italian diplomat, and you can image how her conservative parents must have felt about that. 
 Mr. Jensen, who is Danish, also has his partner's name on his arm. Beside it is a rendering of a motorcycle engine, so meticulously done it could be an illustration in a mechanic's handbook. His tattoos are covered by a long-sleeved purple dress shirt, but Mr. Jensen, who does most of the talking (and says he was so hard-charging when he was in finance that his nickname was the Rottweiler), is happy to roll up his sleeve and show them to you. 
 ''Elena is essentially the motor of my life,'' he says. ''As an investment banker, I had the Elena tattoo, which was unheard-of. It raised a lot of eyebrows when we went out together in the summer.'' The engine tattoo, he adds, was done after he left Lehman Brothers, for the second time, in February. He also bought himself a Harley-Davidson.
 How much, by the way, was he making when he left Lehman? ''The year I walked, two and a half million. But it wasn't guaranteed. The base salary was two hundred thousand.'' 
 Do not hate them because they are beautiful, rich and cultivated, and because the custom revolving home-theater thing that separates the living area from the dining room cost around $22,000. 
 Mr. Jensen, 46, wears a ring with his aristocratic German great-grandfather's family crest, but he says that he never received a penny from his family, and that may be true. When he was 14, his father, an architect, announced that he was quitting the business and moving to the Canary Islands to build his own house on the beach and live. 
 Garry Jensen, left behind in Denmark to finish his education, worked as an apprentice at a Danish bank rather than finishing high school, then worked at J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers in London, Moscow and New York. His long hours, he says, cost him his first marriage. (He has 10-year-old twin sons who live with their mother in Rome.)
 Ms. Bertinetto, who is 40 and wears knee-high python boots, got a bachelor's degree in financial regulation and economic policies in Rome, but after that spent a few years traveling, restoring frescoes on ceilings and walls and painting murals in villas throughout Europe, and then worked in banking. 
 They met on a plane in 2000, where Ms. Bertinetto was reading Charles Bukowski, a really bad boy, and they married in 2004, in a four-day celebration in the Canary Islands. This month they started the Deeply Madly Living site, which sells accent pieces like a ceramic skull with a bullet hole in the temple. The name was inspired by Ms. Bertinetto's declaration to her husband that she loved him deeply, madly and was thinking of getting another tattoo to that effect. 
 O.K., go ahead, hate them. 
 THE couple bought their 2,400-square-foot apartment in 2005, the year that Mr. Jensen, who had briefly given up the investment business to live with his wife in the Canary Islands and enjoy life, rejoined Lehman Brothers. 
 A renovation for the apartment's previous owners by the New York architectural firm of Workshop/apd was already under way, and Mr. Jensen and Ms. Bertinetto decided to retain the architects. One unusual and practical feature of the original design: what looks like a single wall between the master bedroom and the guest room is actually two back-to-back walls, one of which pulls away from the other on a track, creating a space between them so that two rooms can become three. 
 Mr. Jensen and Ms. Bertinetto also brought their own ideas to the design. A metal fire door in the master bedroom was replaced with a glass door that looks out on a lime-green balcony. A wall of the utility closet was pushed back to open up the entrance. 
 Ms. Bertinetto did some of the detail work in the apartment herself. A door in the entrance hall that appears to be made of stamped metal is actually wood covered in $6.99-a-foot silver contact paper. 
 In the living and dining areas, Ms. Bertinetto wanted open space that would have a degree of visual separation. Working with Shadi Shahrokhi, a New York designer and architect who runs SHAdi + Company, she and Mr. Jensen created a revolving unit that functions as a partition, with a painting on one side and a flat screen TV and music system with retractable speakers on the other. 
 The furnishings are modern pieces mixed with reimagined flea market finds. The dining room table, which at first glance appears to be mosaic tile inlaid in a classic white Parsons table, is in fact a mosaic church altar top, for which Mr. Jensen paid $500 at an Italian flea market 15 years ago, encased in a modern table of lacquered African wood. 
 Two contemporary leather sofas from Spain share space with a pair of Chesterfield chairs from a London flea market. Ms. Bertinetto dispatched the old-school mood of the chairs by having them reupholstered in purple velvet. 
 A pool table that Mr. Jensen rescued after it had been tossed out of a Canary Islands hotel has been painted in a graffiti style. The legs, as is only appropriate, have been painted in canary yellow enamel. Even the couple's silverware and Ms. Bertinetto's oversized aquamarine engagement ring stone were found in flea markets.
 The most devoted flea market shopper, however, must at times buy retail. Deeply Madly Living (www.deeplymadlyliving.com) was prompted in part by Mr. Jensen's annoyance at having to spend hours on the Web searching for what he considered cool coffee table and lamps. 
 And cool the site strives to be. 
 It opens with a fellow in a fedora dancing against a gritty urban backdrop. The products, which can also be viewed at the company's garment district showroom include a $1,600 table lamp with a shade made of aviator sunglasses; a $940 chair made from bicycle parts and wheels; a $14,400 Swedish-made No Gravity Lounge Chair, which employs a material used by NASA that adapts to one's body shape and temperature; and $160-per-pair Pop Art-like silkscreens that depict a young woman pulling out a tooth with pliers and eating a doughnut filled with razor blades. The artist, a young woman, had some eating disorder issues that stemmed from a broken heart, Ms. Bertinetto says. (''She never left her home -- she ate, ate, ate. She found comfort in sugars and sweets and, of course, blew up. That's why she depicts doughnuts with blades in them, ice creams with pills.'')
 There is also a $4,900 coffee table emblazoned with the phrase ''Live Hard'' (perfect if you're having bikers over for canapes), $150 ceramic pistol paperweights and a $350 decorative ceramic skull with a bullet hole in the temple, plated in platinum or gold. (''Sophisticated and edgy, this piece responds to the ultimate evolution in punk art, a movement initiated in the 1970s and questioning the values of bourgeois society,'' the promotional copy reads. And if you yearn to be edgy, but aren't quite sure where you'd put a skull with a bullet hole: ''An ultimate provocation to the basic simplified values of society, where high-end materials are expected to go hand in hand with polished, sophisticated shapes.'' Capisce? You just put the skull next to your Saporiti sofa.) 
 So what's up with that stuff?
 ''Other than we have identified some provocative items that we consider cool and edgy and truly original as accent pieces that will help to reinvent someone's home and turn it into something interesting for the mind and eye?'' asks Mr. Jensen. A heck of a sound bite, establishing once again that while you may take the boy out of business, you can't take business out of the boy. ''Some pieces just caught our attention and have a bit of a bad attitude, maybe my rebellious attitude.''
 And the man dancing on the video? 
 We'll give you a hint: A woman's name is tattooed on his arm, and the ring he flashes has a family crest.

HEADLINE: In the Theater District, Merchants and Fans Are Eager for Reopening Night

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT; Annie Correal, C .J. Hughes and Jennifer Mascia contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The tentative settlement of the Broadway strike won rave reviews from merchants in the Theater District whose businesses had flopped during the prolonged closings -- and from frustrated fans waiting to see the shows.
 ''We're very excited, because now everything can get back to normal,'' said Carlos Ribeiro, the owner of Brazil Brazil on West 46th Street -- Restaurant Row. The restaurant's night trade had plummeted 85 percent during the strike, he said.
 The lack of business was painfully evident last night, with only two patrons sitting in the 30-table restaurant. 
 Receipts had fallen 30 percent at Gift Expenses, a souvenir shop on Eighth Avenue that caters to tourists with miniature Statues of Liberty, picture postcards and reproductions of Broadway Playbills, according to a cashier, who declined give her name.
 ''This is very good,'' she said after hearing about the deal just before 11:30 p.m. ''I'm very happy.''
 The television at the bar of Bisteca Fiorentina on Restaurant Row had switched from sports coverage to news of the settlement. A big smile spread across the face of an assistant manager, Gheorghe Tanasa. 
 The restaurant lost half of its normal nighttime business during the strike, and is now looking for a rebound, Mr. Tanasa said. ''I hope tomorrow our phone will start ringing,'' he added.
 On West 44th Street, opposite the theater where ''The Phantom of the Opera'' should have been playing, the three-story Angus McIndoe Restaurant suffered a 90 percent plunge in its after-theater business, said a manager, Chuck Novatka.
 ''I'm from the Hamptons,'' he said, ''and I'm equating this with missing a July or August there. This time of year is most of our business.''
 News of the agreement was also welcomed by Broadway fans.
 ''I had to come outside when I heard the cheering,'' said Laura Heywood, 28, a producer for Sirius Satellite Radio who lives on West 48th Street, near the site of the negotiations. ''I missed five shows during the strike. I have tickets for 'Little Mermaid' tomorrow, so it's good timing.''
 At 48th Street and Broadway, outside the Proskauer Rose law firm where the talks had taken place, Karim Simmons, 40, of Bayside, Queens, held up a large green poster that read: ''Welcome back, Broadway. The show will go on.''
 Nathan England, 24, a native of Wales, was visiting New York from Hamburg, Germany, with his girlfriend. Last night was their final one in the city. 
 ''Typical,'' he said. ''We're leaving tomorrow. We would have definitely gone to a musical, no question. It's one of the reasons we came to New York. 
 ''We wanted to see a Knicks game, the tree at Rockefeller Center and a musical. Oh well. I guess it's one reason to come back.'' 
 They had hoped to see ''Avenue Q,'' he said.
 A group of pedicabs stopped at the corner of Broadway and 45th Street. The drivers exchanged news of the strike's end, and after the announcement, one lifted his fist into the air and shouted, ''Thank you.'' 
 A driver from Istanbul, who would not give his name, said that business had been slower this year than last year, and he thought that the strike was partly to blame. Men and women selling purses and sunglasses outside Planet Hollywood and the Virgin Megastore agreed. 
 Tending his hot dog, sausage and pretzel cart on Broadway near the TKTS discount ticket stand, Hicham Sahraoui said he had suffered a 50 percent drop in sales. ''I'm very happy we can all start making some money again,'' he said.
 As an aspiring actor and a practicing bartender at Smith Bar and Grill on Eighth Avenue, Daniel Cardona had dual cause to celebrate. The theatergoers who often duck into the bar for a quick drink during intermissions will be returning, he said. And, he added, ''I'm going to go see a couple of shows myself now.'' 
 Fellow workers in the theater industry said they, too, were relieved to go back to work.
 George Costacos, an Actors' Equity member, said: ''None of us thought this was going to last this long. And as we know, one union affects all unions, especially stagehands. We, as actors, are in their hands, and we have tried to show our support for them.''
 Before the negotiators announced an agreement, several members of the stagehands' union were singing ''Kumbaya'' and calling their families on their cellphones, saying, ''I hope to be back home soon.'' 
 Some headed home, and some headed to nearby bars or restaurants.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Weighs Maine's Tobacco Law

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
The latest battleground in the federalism wars at the Supreme Court is an unlikely one: the state of Maine, which is trying to prevent under-age consumers from buying cigarettes over the Internet.
 Maine maintains that it is doing nothing more than protecting public health and carrying out the desire of Congress to curb smoking among young people. Its 2003 law requires those who sell tobacco products directly to consumers to use only those delivery services that verify the age of the recipient.
 The trucking industry, supported by the federal government, warns to the contrary that the Maine statute opens the door to the very patchwork of conflicting state regulations that Congress meant to pre-empt when it deregulated motor transportation. 
 Two lower federal courts agreed with the industry, and found that the state law was pre-empted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994. In arguments on Wednesday, the Supreme Court appeared inclined to reach the same result.
 ''What if every state enacted a slightly different law?'' Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked Paul Stern, Maine's deputy attorney general. ''Wouldn't you agree that there would be just the kind of patchwork regulation at the state level that this statute was intended to stop?''
 If Maine, or the 38 other states that signed a brief supporting it, had allies on the Supreme Court, those justices did not make themselves known during the argument. Attacks on Maine's position came from across the court's spectrum, reflecting that pre-emption cases often do not follow the usual ideological lines.
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer told Mr. Stern that while the state's goal might be a worthy one, the answer was to ''convince Congress to pass a law.'' He continued, ''It's just that if every state does it differently, it's going to be a nightmare.''
 When Mr. Stern observed that the federal government did not regulate the shipment of tobacco products and that the state law therefore filled ''a regulatory void,'' Justice Antonin Scalia responded: ''Well, maybe because Congress wanted the regulatory void.''
 By contrast, the court appeared receptive to the arguments presented on the other side by Beth S. Brinkmann, representing the New Hampshire Motor Transport Association, the industry organization that brought the lawsuit, and by Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, an assistant to the solicitor general, who argued for the federal government that the state law was pre-empted.
 Ms. Brinkmann said the state law placed an ''enormous'' burden on shippers like United Parcel Service and Federal Express. ''It's not flipping a switch to create a new service like this,'' she said, adding that ''many systems would have to be completely re-engineered to take in new data about age and addressee'' to comply with the law's requirements.
 There was some indication during the argument that the impact of the state law might be somewhat more theoretical than real. In 2005, major shippers entered into a settlement with New York State under which they agreed not to deliver cigarettes directly to consumers. The voluntary agreement, referred to as an ''assurance of discontinuance,'' is in effect nationwide.
 New York is one of five states that has a ban on the shipment of cigarettes directly to consumers; the others are Arkansas, Connecticut, Maryland and Ohio.
 Several justices sounded puzzled about whether these laws, or the New York agreement with the shippers, might themselves be pre-empted. The question went unanswered.
 Questions were also raised about requirements the states might impose on shippers of alcoholic beverages. Ms. Brinkmann said that given the states' authority under the 21st Amendment to regulate alcohol, the issue was more complex constitutionally than tobacco-related regulation.
 The federal law at issue was passed to put motor transportation on the same deregulated footing as the airline industry. Mr. Stern said that Congress was concerned with economic regulation, not regulation for health. 
 But Justice David H. Souter, clearly unpersuaded, said the issue was whether Congress ''intended to permit any regulation with respect to delivery services to survive,'' no matter the rationale. ''Isn't that the tough question that you've got to face?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: The Immigration Divide, Seen From Three Angles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Immigration Wilderness'' (editorial, Nov. 23):
 It's sad that anti-immigrant sentiments are now fast escalating in the United States, a country where election-year politicians sing praises of its history of immigration, assimilation and diversity. 
 Since the Senate immigration bill fell apart in June, right-wing xenophobia has added fuel to government persecution of people whose only crime has been their desire to live and work with dignity. 
 From a moral point of view, separating a mother from her breast-feeding child, raiding a factory and severing parents from their wages, and denying a working family its all-important driver's license are anything but American. 
 All of the above are gross violations of civil and human rights -- rights that we earned through centuries of struggle and sacrifice. How can we be so oblivious to that precious history?
 Partha Banerjee
 Brooklyn, Nov. 23, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The nation should be in ''an angry place'' when it comes not to immigration, but to illegal immigration.
 My grandfather was a legal immigrant from Turkey, and my wife is a legal immigrant from Shanghai. In the latter case, we went through the lengthy, frustrating and expensive process required by our laws to make that happen. That's how it is supposed to work in the United States.
 Now to read that applicants for citizenship must wait months even for a receipt and up to 18 months to process an application should put us all in ''an angry place.'' That's the right place to be in response to our government's failure to provide immigration services to those of us who follow the rule of law. 
 The collapse of the rule of law is evident in the complacency surrounding the influx of illegal aliens and to our government's failure to enforce the law.
 Henry Emurian
 Baltimore, Nov. 23, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Lost in the name-calling surrounding immigration is any discussion of emigration. It's as if immigrants just materialize at our borders.
 For most migrants, the decision to leave hearth and home is fraught with anguish, even filled with peril. Why don't we stop throwing brickbats and begin a conversation about the causes of mass migration? 
 Let's start debating family planning, education and economic policies that help poor people help themselves. 
 The right policy choices could make emigration -- and immigration -- less of an agonized choice for millions. We might even bring a spark of intelligence to our own political debates along the way. John Seager

HEADLINE: Room for Blood, Sacrifice and Lyricism in Gluck's House of Atreus

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
It took 90 years, but Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride'' has finally returned to the Metropolitan Opera. On Tuesday night the Met unveiled a grimly effective production of this work, one of the greatest of all operas, staged by Stephen Wadsworth and vibrantly conducted by Louis Langree in his company debut. The opera's previous history at the Met amounted to just five performances, with the original French libretto translated into German, during the 1916-17 season.
 This 1779 work, Gluck's crowning achievement, has yet to attain the place in the canon it deserves. In 1997 the New York City Opera presented a sensuous production that had been introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera. More recently it has enjoyed a renaissance, thanks to the star power of the superb American mezzo- 
 soprano Susan Graham. She has made the title role a calling card, singing it to acclaim in Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, Salzburg and London. It was for her that the Met mounted this staging, a co-production with the Seattle Opera, although lining up Placido Domingo to sing the role of Oreste was surely another inducement. 
 For too long Gluck was seen merely as a valuable reformer who rescued opera from the excesses of the Baroque, setting the parameters for a more direct approach during the Classical period. Today, Gluck's refinement and nobility are starting to be admired for their own merits. 
 He was nearly 66 when this opera had its Paris premiere. His music was inspired by Nicolas-Francois Guillard's unusually literate and economical libretto, freely adapted from a French play that was modeled on the Euripides tragedy. Set in the uncivilized region of Tauris, ruled by the brutal Thoas, the story tells of the anguished Iphigenie, Agamemnon's daughter, who has been conscripted into serving her enemies as high priestess in a temple to Diana (Diane in French). 
 Gluck relates the story in music of sweeping yet subtle urgency. Long stretches of dramatic recitative, by turns poignant and incisive, segue into elegant spans of high-flown arioso, which merge seamlessly into magisterial arias, ensembles and choruses. Mr. Langree, best known to New Yorkers as the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival, was especially good at pacing the performance so that the opera unfolded in a continuous, tautly dramatic flow. 
 The work opens with stunning boldness. The orchestra plays a deceptively simple minuet that breaks suddenly into tempestuous music depicting a storm both outside the temple and in Iphigenie's mind. In a horrible dream, which she relates to her priestesses in impassioned phrases, she has seen her father fleeing her murderous mother, Clytemnestre. In the dream, Oreste, Iphigenie's beloved brother, appears. Yet some potent force is compelling her to kill him.
 Mr. Wadsworth depicts Iphigenie's tormenting past quite literally. When the curtain goes up, in silence, we see Ms. Graham, moaning and sleeping fitfully in the temple. Nearby, actors recreate the moment when young Iphigenie was thrust on an altar by her father, wielding a sacrificial knife. Suddenly Diane descends from above to rescue the girl, lifting her to safety. Understandably, this staging tour de force elicited a round of delighted applause from many in the audience, completely undermining the intended horror.
 If Mr. Wadsworth went too far here, over all he has mounted a severe, dark and compelling production. The towering single-unit set by Thomas Lynch shows the expansive interior of the temple, its russet-brown walls studded with candles and an imposing statue of Diana. Bordering it is a narrow antechamber where prisoners can be enchained. Dividing the stage into three compartments allows Mr. Wadsworth to create affecting juxtapositions. When two intruding Greeks, who turn out to be Oreste and his devoted friend Pylade, are seized by Thoas's soldiers and condemned to death, they play their agonized scene together in the antechamber. At the same time, the shaken Iphigenie huddles silently within the temple, while outside a bored soldier on guard leans against the exterior wall, oblivious. 
 Though written for a soprano, the title role seldom ventures beyond high A. Ms. Graham has the top notes, no problem, though at times she seemed to be easing her voice into extended passages that hovered in her upper register. But that was the only cautious aspect to her intense and vulnerable performance. She sang with rich, throbbing sound and tragic grandeur, including a magnificent interpretation of ''O malheureuse Iphigenie'' (one of Gluck's trademark major-key laments). She threw herself about the stage, shaking with despair when Oreste explains that Agamemnon's murder has been avenged by his son (that is, Oreste), who has killed Clytemnestra. (This is before the siblings recognize each other and reveal themselves.) 
 Gluck wrote Oreste for a baritone. But for a German-language production in Vienna two years after the opera's Paris premiere, he refashioned the role for a tenor by altering segments of the vocal lines. Gluck was surely prompted to make this adjustment to accommodate a star tenor in Vienna. The Met was similarly prompted to accommodate its longtime star tenor, Mr. Domingo. The company is presenting the Paris version, but with the adapted tenor part. 
 As a result, the music loses some of the contrast between the tenor and the baritone voices in the intimate scenes between Oreste and Pylade. But Mr. Domingo's Oreste, a new role (amazingly, his 125th), has many compensations. Much of the part sits comfortably in his middle voice. The burnished sound and the vigor of his singing continue to be astonishing. There were phrases in which you could hear him conserving power, getting by. But the artistry, integrity and physicality of his impetuous portrayal drew you in.
 As Pylade, the tenor Paul Groves gave an ardent, and richly expressive performance. He has had a tendency to put pressure on his essentially lyric voice, though, as he did on this opening night. 
 The baritone William Shimell was a gravelly voiced, blustery Thoas. The appealing soprano Michele Losier, as Diane, bravely allowed herself to descend from on high hooked up to just two wires, singing all the way. 
 In a heavy-handed but wrenching final touch, this production ends with an invented scene, using dance music taken from a later Paris revival. As Greek soldiers and Diane's priestesses celebrate the routing of Thoas outside the temple, Iphigenie inside, racked with guilt and confusion, clutches a remnant of her mother's dress. Haltingly at first, then desperately, she embraces her brother, as the reality of her murderous family sinks in.

HEADLINE: LENDERS TIGHTEN FLOW OF CREDIT; GROWTH AT RISK

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Floyd Norris and Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Credit flowing to American companies is drying up at a pace not seen in decades, threatening the creation of jobs and the expansion of businesses, while intensifying worries that the economy may be headed for recession. 
 The combined value of two leading sources of credit -- outstanding commercial and industrial bank loans, and short-term loans known as commercial paper -- peaked at about $3.3 trillion in August, according to data from the Federal Reserve. By mid-November, such credit was down to $3 trillion, a drop of nearly 9 percent. 
 Not once in the years since the Fed began tracking such numbers in 1973 has this artery of finance constricted so rapidly. Smaller declines preceded three recessions going back to 1975; at other times such declines tended to occur in conjunction with an economic downturn. 
 Policy makers at the Federal Reserve are growing increasingly alarmed about the problem, which is an outgrowth of the woes of the housing and mortgage industries. Just yesterday, the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said that the latest market turbulence appeared to be reducing credit to businesses and consumers, hinting that the central bank, in response, was prepared to cut interest rates further. 
 Mr. Kohn's unexpected pledge that the Fed would pursue ''flexible and pragmatic policy making'' that might help counter the trend and shore up the economy spurred a rally on Wall Street that sent stocks soaring. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 331 points, to 13,289.45, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 2.86 percent, to 1,469.02. 
 For now, though, the situation is looking bleaker for many businesses. Already, companies in everything from furniture manufacturing to Web site design are tightening their belts, delaying expansion and scrambling for other sources of cash.
 ''This is a very big deal,'' said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist in the United States Economic Research Group at Goldman Sachs. ''You're basically crimping the growth of the more vulnerable companies. If they can't borrow the money, their options are much more limited. They'd have to have less ambitious hiring plans, buy less machinery and cancel projects.''
 Two years ago, in what now seems like another era, Carmen Murray easily borrowed $100,000 from a local bank to finance her company, Rodeo Carpet Mills, which makes high-end rugs in an industrial stretch near Los Angeles. Getting a check was as simple as returning a mass-mailed flier.
 Today, Ms. Murray is seeking a fresh loan from the bank to finance an expansion to supply Las Vegas hotels with floor coverings. She needs new machinery and 15 more workers, bringing the total work force to 45. If she manages to get the money, it will not come easily. 
 ''They want this; they want that,'' Ms. Murray sighed. ''I got the sense that I have to start all over again. They need to know who I am and all about my business.'' 
 A survey of bank loan officers conducted by the Federal Reserve in October found that about one-fifth of lenders had tightened lending requirements for commercial and industrial loans for large and midsize businesses over the previous three months. A slightly smaller proportion reported tightening lending to small companies. 
 By themselves, commercial bank loans have actually surged: large companies have tapped prearranged lines of credit to weather the financial chaos that has accompanied the unraveling of the American real estate market.
 But this source of finance has been nowhere near enough to compensate for the virtual shutdown of the short-term commercial paper market. Much of this debt had been pledged against the value of mortgages, making them effectively radioactive in markets around the globe.
 In recent years, a lot of commercial lending was inspired by an upward spiral of enrichment: banks made new loans, then swiftly sold them off for profit, using the proceeds to extend still more. But with much of the financial world unnerved by the mortgage meltdown, buyers for commercial loans are scarce.
 ''Since the resale market went away, major banks have had much less availability to make loans,'' said Mark A. Sunshine, president of First Capital, a private commercial lender. ''Absolutely, credit is much less available.''
 Some of the drop reflects the subsiding in the run of mergers, diminishing the demand for credit by companies buying other companies. Some can be explained by what many economists view as a healthy return to the skeptical scrutinizing of prospective borrowers by banks. But lenders and borrowers from northern Virginia to southern Arizona confirm that the credit tightening has already begun to cut money reaching healthy companies as well, affecting their spending and hiring.
 What loans are being extended are going primarily to companies with longstanding relationships with banks. Lenders are reluctant to bet their increasingly scarce capital on riskier, less-established companies in a time of economic anxiety. That leaves many of those companies on a limb. 
 ''Small businesses are just inherently more risky, and banks are going to be more conservative in protecting their assets,'' said Jody Keenan, who chairs the board of the Association of Small Business Development Centers in Burke, Va. ''We're starting to see a tightening already, particularly for very small companies. We're talking about real impacts in local communities.'' 
 A slowdown among smaller companies could be especially costly to the economy in terms of jobs. More than half of American jobs are at companies with fewer than 100 workers, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 In recent months, smaller companies have been adding jobs even as larger firms have been shedding workers, according to the ADP National Employment Report, which tracks changes at companies with payrolls overseen by ADP. From May to October, 276,000 of the 378,000 jobs added were at companies with fewer than 50 employees, the report found. 
 To be sure, the strongest companies with property to put up as collateral and years of profits they can point to are still able to borrow, often at increasingly favorable terms. 
 The downturn in the housing market has made banks reluctant to sink money into anything related to real estate, from title companies to bathroom tile manufacturers.
 But lenders have sought refuge in more vibrant areas -- notably agriculture, which has benefited from the rise in global demand and the sudden boom in ethanol production. 
 Richard Brown, president and chief executive of the Krause Corporation, which makes soil-tilling equipment at its factory in Hutchinson, Kan., relies upon lines of credit from banks to smooth out the seasonal nature of the business. Though it sells its products mostly in the spring and fall, the company must make them year-round.
 Mr. Brown said banks had been calling him relentlessly to offer new loans. 
 ''They're trying to maintain their business and get past the subprime debacle, and where can they go?'' Mr. Brown said. ''Agriculture in this country is very strong.'' 
 But in other parts of the economy, notably the auto industry, access to credit has tightened considerably, as banks steer their limited capital away from companies with declining sales.
 A year ago, when he needed new machinery, Doyle Hayes, president and chief executive of Pyper Products, an auto parts maker in Battle Creek, Mich., went back to the local branch of Comerica bank, where he has been doing business for years. He borrowed $300,000.
 Last week, when Mr. Hayes needed $140,000 for a new robot, he did not even bother to inquire at the bank. ''We knew what the answer was going to be,'' he said, meaning the bank would have turned him down. ''When the auto industry goes down, anything that has four wheels becomes suspect.''
 Still, Mr. Hayes did not put off the purchase. ''You can't save yourself into prosperity,'' he said. He managed to borrow the money instead from Battle Creek Unlimited, a nonprofit economic development arm of the city. 
 In Arizona, Dennis Long, president of Enterprise Resource Group, which manages computer networks for businesses in the Phoenix area, is keen to expand, particularly by picking up work from the federal government. But that requires hiring a sales representative, and he lacks the capital to go beyond his $100,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank.
 ''The bank says we're maxed out,'' Mr. Long complained. ''It just seems like before they were a little more 'Let me see what I can do,' where today I just get 'no.'''
 In Los Angeles, Ms. Murray, too, has grown accustomed to a less-than-exuberant reception from the bank. Having started at the rug factory as a receptionist some 25 years ago, she now owns the company. A Mexican-American entrepreneur, she hopes to capture contracts that are set aside for minority-controlled companies.
 She may eventually try an alternative source of finance aimed at small lenders, with the state guaranteeing her loan. Curiously, at one such institution in Los Angeles, Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation, the volume of lending has slowed considerably in recent months, said Mark Robertson, the firm's president and chief executive.
 It may be that the effects of the credit tightening are still unfolding, he suggested. Eventually, a parade of would-be borrowers may show up at his door. His business tends to move in the opposite direction of the economy: when times are bad, more people need help to qualify for a loan. Perhaps things just have not gotten bad enough.
 But Mr. Robertson thinks another factor may be at play. Business prospects are so uncertain that smaller entrepreneurs have lost their nerve for risk.
 ''Any business owner that is experiencing less traffic to their establishment is not willing to take on more debt,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''Everybody has kind of a wait-and-see, hold-off sort of attitude.''

HEADLINE: Spreading the Misery

 BODY:
The nation's foreclosure crisis is metastasizing, and communities are in harm's way as property values and tax bases decline and crime increases. 
 In the third quarter, there were 635,000 foreclosure filings, a 30 percent increase from the previous quarter and nearly double from a year ago, according to RealtyTrac, a national real estate information service. That works out to one for every 196 households. Michigan and Ohio, which were hit early and hard by a combination of economic weakness and reckless lending, continue to reel. Foreclosures rose last year in Colorado, Georgia and Texas and are now surging in California, Nevada, Arizona and Florida. In those states unsustainable mortgages are at the root of the problem. 
 The Bush administration has been far too slow to respond, with some officials apparently worried that helping today's troubled borrowers might encourage future borrowers to take on too much debt. That misses a critical point: much of this crisis can be traced to lenders' failure to vet borrowers and the government's failure to regulate the industry. And it misses an even bigger point: unless something is done quickly, whole communities, not just people who lose their homes, will suffer. 
 Foreclosed properties damage the value of nearby homes and the tax bases of municipalities. There is also a strong correlation between foreclosures and crime. For every one percentage point increase in a neighborhood's foreclosure rate, violent crime rises 2.3 percent, according to a recent study by Dan Immergluck of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Geoff Smith of Woodstock Institute, a research and advocacy organization in Chicago. 
 Reports from Cleveland, Atlanta and the sprawl around Los Angeles and Sacramento -- from low-income city neighborhoods to middle-class suburbs -- all tell a similar story: when vacancies appear, so do looters, vagrants, prostitutes and drug dealers. In Cleveland's inner city, it takes 72 hours for a vacated house to be looted, a community activist told CNN recently, with lootings often followed by violent crime. In the suburbs, the descent may be slower, beginning with graffiti and vandalism and moving to gang activity and other crime. 
 Police departments may not be able to keep up, in part because foreclosures are projected to strain municipal budgets. Neighborhood watch groups are quickly overwhelmed. The United States Conference of Mayors met this week to discuss the impact of foreclosures. Based on the mayors' experience, their estimates of the number of coming foreclosures, and the damage inflicted on community life, were grimmer than projections from the federal government and the housing industry. The question is whether their concerns will be heeded. 
 As more foreclosures take their toll, the need becomes ever more obvious for a comprehensive, national effort to avert evictions. Last week, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. wisely shifted his position on loan modifications, endorsing the idea that some at-risk loans should be modified en masse rather than on an inefficient one-by-one basis. If Mr. Paulson backs up his new stance with a plan of action, the socio-economic costs of foreclosures may yet be contained.

HEADLINE: Dow Surges on Hints of a Cut in Interest Rates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Capping a series of wild swings, the Dow Jones industrial average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than four years yesterday after a top Federal Reserve official hinted at another interest rate cut and oil fell below $91 a barrel.
 Still, few analysts were willing to call an end to the upheaval, and the rally came amid new indications that problems in the credit market are taking a toll on businesses and consumers. Analysts described the volatility as a symptom of the uncertainty that has racked Wall Street for weeks. 
 But it was a wave of relief that moved the markets yesterday. The comeback began on Tuesday, after a $7.5 billion foreign investment in Citigroup helped restore investors' confidence in the ailing credit market. 
 The Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, further reassured investors yesterday by pledging to follow ''flexible and pragmatic policy making'' as the bank decides how to cope with the financial upheaval. The unusually candid remarks were taken as a sign that the Fed policy panel was considering a rate cut at its Dec. 11 meeting.A steep drop in oil prices and bargain-hunting added to the rally. 
 The Dow has gained 546 points over two days, a leap of nearly 4.3 percent. It gained 331 points yesterday to close at 13,289.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up 2.86 percent, or 40.79 points, to 1,469.02. The index, which was down for the year Monday, has risen 4.4 percent in two days and is now up 3.5 percent for the year.
 Even as Mr. Kohn suggested that market turbulence could tighten credit lines, there were other signs that the economy was slowing. Orders for durable goods fell more sharply than expected in October, and a Fed survey found business conditions gradually deteriorating across the country. Housing inventories rose last month as existing-home sales continued to decline.
 On Monday, both major stock indexes were down 10 percent from their record highs. The Dow's gain yesterday was the fifth consecutive day of triple-digit moves in the blue-chip index. 
 ''This is a soap opera,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's, noting that the market has exhibited a touch of melodrama. 
 But he warned that the market's erratic behavior, where triple-digit gains or losses are caused by news from a single event, speech or company, reflected the knee-jerk mentality of investors who simply do not know where the economy is headed. 
 ''We see a light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said, ''and it could be another train.''
 Many analysts echoed the sense of uncertainty. ''We're flying blind,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management. In this environment, ''you can talk yourself into any kind of position.''
 Investors chose bullishness yesterday, in large part because of Mr. Kohn's remarks that the Fed ''will act as needed'' to address the current volatility. Anxiety in the credit markets has made banks and mortgage companies less eager to lend, leading many investors to call for another cut in interest rates. 
 Treasury yields ticked up for a second day, a sign that investors were confident enough to move away from the safe quarters of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year note was 4.03 percent, up from 3.95 percent, on Tuesday.
 Crude oil futures settled at $90.62 a barrel in New York trading, down more than $7 from its noninflation-adjusted record high set on Friday. 
 Mr. Kohn, in his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, acknowledged that ''uncertainties about the economic outlook are unusually high right now.'' 
 He noted that ''the increased turbulence of recent weeks partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of September and in October.'' And pointing to ''heightened concerns about larger losses at financial institutions now reflected in various markets,'' he said the results could be ''a more defensive posture in granting credit, not only for house purchases, but for other uses as well.''
 Mr. Kohn, who will vote at the bank's policy meeting on Dec. 11, acknowledged the ''moral hazard'' debate that has hung over recent discussions of Fed policy, referring to the reluctance to reinforce investors' poor decisions by lowering interest rates. But he said that ''when the decisions do go poorly, innocent bystanders should not have to bear the cost.''
 ''We should not hold the economy hostage to teach a small segment of the population a lesson,'' he said, suggesting that a rate cut would be justified. 
 His remarks were strongly worded, but Fed officials still seem deeply divided. The bank issued a statement last month that suggested it would be reluctant to lower rates again before next year. Less than two weeks ago, a Fed governor, Randall S. Kroszner, said that ''the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year.'' 
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has also hinted that he is skeptical of an additional rate cut, citing underlying strength in the economy. He is scheduled to speak tonight in Charlotte, N.C.
 But yesterday's economic data suggested that strength may be abating. Spending at retail outlets is softening, and businesses are pessimistic about holiday sales, according to the beige book, a regular survey of national economic conditions conducted by the Fed. 
 Foreign money appears to be keeping many domestic businesses in the black, as tourists and export buyers are attracted to American goods by a record-low dollar, the survey showed. 
 ''The beige book reflected what we already know, that we are seeing the economy broadly decelerating,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, chief United States economist at IdeaGlobal.
 Businesses also appeared more cautious about spending as they anticipate a drop in demand. New orders for durable goods -- major products like airplanes and appliances -- declined in October by 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said.
 A major indicator of spending -- orders for nonmilitary capital goods, excluding aircraft -- fell 2.3 percent, suggesting that consumers are reluctant to make bigger discretionary purchases. It was the first drop in the category since June; orders were down 1.2 percent from last October. 
 Inventories at businesses in October ticked up 0.2 percent, after a September rise of 0.3 percent. The increase could suggest declining demand and a gloomier outlook for business activity.
 Existing-home sales dropped for the eighth consecutive month. Sales fell 1.2 percent in October to a 4.97 million annual pace, down from 5.03 million in September, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. Inventories of homes also rose last month, by 1.9 percent.

HEADLINE: The Twins Are Not Sharing the Wealth

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Unfortunately for Minnesota Twins fans, Carl Pohlad is no Ewing Kauffman. 
 The owner of the Kansas City Royals from their birth in 1969 until his death in 1993, Kauffman operated the Royals as if they were a public trust and financed them partly with his personal fortune. Kauffman spent what he had to spend to keep players like George Brett, Frank White, Willie Wilson, Dan Quisenberry and Bret Saberhagen.
 I don't know if Pohlad has put any of his personal fortune into the Twins, but it is considerable. A longtime banker, the 92-year-old Pohlad is tied for 114th on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people in the country with a fortune estimated at $3.1 billion. 
 He is the wealthiest baseball owner on the list, which also includes John Malone (Braves, tied for 188th, $2.4 billion), Mike Ilitch (Tigers, tied for 297th, $1.6 billion), and Tom Hicks (Rangers) and George Steinbrenner (Yankees, tied for 380th, $1.3 billion). 
 I will not suggest to Mr. Pohlad what he should do with his money. He has done fairly well this far without my advice. 
 And when I suggested several years ago that Manny Ramirez could take $20,000 from his $20 million-a-year salary and give it to his old high school team in upper Manhattan for new uniforms to replace their ratty apparel, I was excoriated by some readers who said it was none of my business what Ramirez did with his money.
 But what Pohlad does with his money is the business of Twins fans. They support the team, and they will fill the new park when it opens in 2010. If the Twins keep winning or even remain competitive, the fans may continue to fill the new park.
 The Twins have a good track record. They won the World Series in 1987 and 1991, went on hiatus during the rest of the '90s but have won four division titles in the past six years. All of this activity has come under Pohlad's ownership.
 But the Twins have also always been a low-revenue team, meaning they have difficulty retaining their best players because they can't or won't pay competitive salaries. 
 This off-season, they have already lost their center fielder of nine years, Torii Hunter, as a free agent, and they are seriously considering trading the game's No. 1 pitcher, Johan Santana, to one of four teams -- the two from New York, the one from Boston and the Angels, the one pretending to be from Los Angeles.
 ''Our first choice all along has been to retain Santana as well as Hunter,'' Dave St. Peter, the club president, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''Would we like to have retained them both? Yes. Now we're perfectly prepared to go to spring training with Johan pitching for us.''
 Contrary to a widespread view, the Twins did not let Hunter simply walk away. They offered him $15 million a year for three years. The Angels signed him for five years and $90 million.
 In this instance it wasn't the money that prevented the Twins from retaining Hunter. They made a decision that at his age, 32, they didn't want to give him more than three years. With greater revenue, the Angels can more easily afford to commit to more years and squander some of the money if Hunter's performance should fall off drastically during the contract.
 The Twins have also made a solid offer to Santana -- a four-year extension for $80 million on top of his $13.25 million salary for 2008. No pitcher has a contract that averages $20 million a year. In fact, the only players who average $20 million or more a season are Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez, and they signed those contracts as free agents. Santana cannot be a free agent for another year.
 If the Twins trade Santana to one of the four teams they're talking to, he will most likely get between $20 million and $25 million a year for a minimum of six years. The Twins have not offered more than four years, because they do not believe in such extended contracts for pitchers.
 History, beginning with Wayne Garland's 10-year contract with Cleveland in 1976, clearly demonstrates the foolishness of long contracts for pitchers. The San Francisco Giants' seven-year, $126 million contract with Barry Zito already looks foolish, and it's only a year old.
 But Zito's contract had a major impact on the Twins, and some baseball officials believe it marked the end of Santana's tenure in Minnesota.
 Because the Twins always have had one of the lower payrolls in the major leagues, they are criticized by wealthier teams for not using the money they get from revenue sharing on their payroll. 
 In the last five years, the Twins have received an average of $20 million a year in revenue sharing, but their payroll has not increased proportionately. The aggregate increase in those five years has been $16 million. 
 Ewing Kauffman had his own revenue-sharing plan. He shared his revenue with the Royals. But he owned the Royals in a different economic era. Salaries were increasing steadily but not exponentially. 
 Certainly between revenue sharing and Pohlad's Forbes-worthy wealth, the Twins could afford to pay Santana what they would have to keep him at home, even if it meant in this one instance exceeding their desired length of a contract for a pitcher.
 ''I think our track record relative to fielding a competitive team speaks for itself,'' St. Peter said. ''We're trying to make the smartest baseball decisions we can make. We'll make the decisions we feel are in the best interests of the team. If that's keeping Johan for the year or signing him to an extension or trading him, we'll have to see.''

HEADLINE: Not Down and Out In Moscow

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
 THE price of a Gulfstream G550 airplane, fitted with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million. But that is small change to some of the Russian rich.
 ''It seats up to 18 passengers,'' said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative. ''But none of them ask for that many seats because it is for a private family or a company president.''
 Mr. Firer was manning the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital. In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury purveyors had set up display stands, hoping to interest newly moneyed Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worthy of 50 Cent.
 Mr. Firer warily eyed a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his. 
 ''That's a nice car, but it is nickels and dimes compared to us,'' he said. ''After the United States, Russia is the second-biggest market for private aircraft.''
 Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as awash in cash as Dallas was in its heyday. 
 ''We went through the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans came into giant wealth and flocked to Europe, where they were viewed as materialistic,'' said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University. 
 Like the Saudi high rollers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's most visible free spenders. The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the klondike. Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference on the luxury industry has drawn Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods to markets like Russia. (The conference is sponsored by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
 Russia has 53 billionaires worth a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people. In addition, the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires who are collectively worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think tank here. (The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level.)
 ''There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- that is why we are all here,'' said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler. She was attending the fair for the first time in conjunction with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry Group. ''The women are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune.''
 Wandering the halls Sunday night, dressed in evening attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described both themselves and their clients as millionaires.
 ''I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,'' said Ms. Yumatova, who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers. 
 The Millionaire Fair, an annual consumer event founded by a Dutch entrepreneur named Yves Gijrath, is in its third year here. Mr. Gijrath, who stages similar events in Amsterdam and Shanghai, said the show's purpose is to introduce wealthy Muscovites to foreign luxury brands that they may not have encountered on their travel to popular watering holes like Cap Ferrat, Gstaad and Courchevel. He estimated that this year's show could generate direct and follow-up sales of about $743 million.
 ''Over the last five to 10 years, car brands and fashion brands were the first adopters to set themselves up in the Russian market, but otherwise there is no tradition of luxury brand awareness here,'' Mr. Gijrath said. ''Now every luxury brand is interested in Russia: boats, real estate, interior design, watches, antiques, helicopters.'' 
 The fair seemed primarily aimed at the nouveaux riches, the type of brand-driven Russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknives, Movenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears. Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
 ''Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best,'' said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, in front of a wall-size re-creation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue tile. ''Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.''
 Indeed, vendors here said that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old, by Russian standards) have already moved on from flashy logos to the kind of understated limited-edition brands that would not market themselves at a trade show.
 Still, several thousand people, whether cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or just tourists, thronged the halls every day. And some of them were buying.
 On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads.
 Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that outfits high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000, to a Russian millionaire.
 By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car grilles, resembling interlinked chain bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each. He showed a reporter a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had encrusted with colored Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
 ''The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made out of cubic zirconium, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,'' Mr. Karapetian said. ''He is going to keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage.''
 Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase ''Russian millionaire'' did not convey much exclusivity at the moment, given the surge in real estate prices here. ''If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash,'' he said. ''There are more of them than you think.''
 Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm. The company had erected four red British-style telephone booths, stuffed with piles of counterfeit million-dollar greenbacks. Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
 Passers-by stopped to toss piles of money around, ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth, or just to pocket a couple of million.

HEADLINE: $200 Billion To Invest, But in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Heather Timmons contributed reporting from New Delhi.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
As governments in the Middle East take big stakes in American companies, China's state-run investment fund has quietly shifted its focus from overseas deals to bolstering the country's troubled banking system.
 The fund, the China Investment Corporation, plans to spend roughly two-thirds of its $200 billion assisting Chinese banks, according to a person familiar with the company's decision making. 
 In contrast to other sovereign wealth funds -- like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which invested $7.5 billion for a 4.9 percent stake in Citigroup this week -- the Chinese have no immediate plans to take a large stake in any foreign company.
 The remaining third of the fund, roughly $70 billion, that is not committed to shoring up banks with needed cash has been parked in very short-term money market instruments, this person said, with the exception of two previously announced investments: a $3 billion stake in the Blackstone Group, taken in June, and a $100 million stake in the state-controlled China Railway Group, which plans to go public next month. 
 ''We don't have any more significant investment plans,'' said the person knowledgeable about the fund, insisting on anonymity because the government tries to restrict public comment on its policies. Despite China's keen interest in natural resource companies, the fund does not plan to bid for Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton, two primarily Australian mining companies currently sparring over a possible merger. 
 Though the China Investment Corporation is still drafting a strategic plan, it intends to largely pursue a portfolio approach -- making many small purchases of equities, bonds and other investments, rather than big-ticket acquisitions, the person familiar with the fund's decision making said.
 Some of the differences between the Chinese investment strategy and those of Arab region funds are a function of their relative size and experience.
 The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, for example, started in 1976. It occupies its own skyscraper, with three trading floors and total square footage equivalent to a third of the Empire State Building. While many ruling families in the region relied on one or two investment advisers a generation ago, today their own, often Wall-Street-trained sons and daughters invest their swelling oil profits.
 By contrast, the China Investment Corporation has only been active for six months. It has fewer than two dozen employees, mainly people who have transferred from China's central bank and have little familiarity with equity investments. Indeed, the fund is seeking senior managers willing to move to Beijing to help it invest the nearly $70 billion it wants to commit to opportunities abroad. 
 The China Investment Corporation did not consider a stake in Citigroup and is not looking to acquire distressed financial assets in the United States, the person close to the fund said, and it has ruled out investments in foreign airlines, telecommunications businesses and oil companies as potentially contentious. 
 Chinese officials remember the bitter opposition in Congress two years ago when the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation sought to buy Unocal. The effort failed amid wide objections in the United States.
 Such sensitivities have also led the fund to decide not to pursue overseas technology companies as a way of bringing advanced technologies to China.
 ''That's political, and we don't do that,'' the informant said.
 To be sure, other state-run Chinese businesses continue to buy substantial holdings abroad. Last month, for instance, Citic Securities, a government-run investment bank, and Bear Stearns said they would take $1 billion stakes in each other and set up a joint venture in Hong Kong.
 But China Investment Corporation, having generated headlines last spring with its Blackstone investment and come under scrutiny from Washington, faces powerful pressures to take a more cautious approach to overseas investing.
 Concern has been growing in Western capitals about the rising influence of sovereign funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valued at $650 billion. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and finance ministers of other leading economies called last month for these essentially government funds to make greater public disclosure.
 China has been particularly eager to stay out of the limelight cast by overseas acquisitions as elections get closer in the United States and officials at the European Union and in Washington grow increasingly critical of China's rising trade surpluses.
 ''There is some hesitation to make too much waves,'' as well as a wariness of the declining dollar, said Victor Shih, a Chinese finance expert at Northwestern University. 
 The dismal performance of China Investment in Blackstone has also encouraged a tepid approach. The fund paid $29.605 a share for the private equity firm, just as credit markets began to turn against risky deals; it has since lost almost $1 billion of its $3 billion, setting off criticism even on Chinese Internet sites. Blackstone shares closed at $21.47 on Wednesday.
 The person close to the China investment fund defended the Blackstone purchase. ''The decision to invest in Blackstone,'' he said, ''was cautious and focused on much longer-period returns and not about the share price over six months or a year -- we do not worry about it.'' 
 But the biggest source of pressure on the Chinese state fund lies in the continuing need to strengthen the chronically weak Chinese banking system as the economy continues to grow 11 percent a year.
 Chinese and Western bankers agree that banks in this country fall short of Western standards in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers and in controlling fraud. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans at Chinese commercial banks have dropped steeply, to 6.2 percent in September from 12.4 percent in March 2005, according to the China Banking Regulatory Commission. But this is mainly because banks have stepped up their lending, actually increasing their exposure to bad debt if the economy slows and recent borrowers default. 
 China Investment plans to inject roughly a third of its assets into the Agricultural Bank of China and the China Development Bank, two state-owned institutions preparing for initial public offerings in the next year or two. The exact amount of those investments has not been set and will depend on a continuing assessment of the extent of the banks' nonperforming loans.
 The fund plans to spend one-third more to buy the Central Huijin Investment Company from China's central bank. 
 As the central bank has spent foreign currency reserves acquiring large stakes in the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the China Construction Bank over the last three years, it has parked those stakes in the Central Huijin Investment Company. They will now be transferred to China Investment. 
 The person familiar with the dealings of the fund said the details of both transactions still had to be worked out. Another person with broad knowledge of Chinese financial policy making described the plans as ''a done deal.''

HEADLINE: Size Limits For Cable Look Likely

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Coming off a setback at the hands of the cable television industry, the head of the Federal Communications Commission moved to reassert himself on Wednesday by proposing that the commission quickly adopt a rule that would prevent Comcast, the nation's biggest cable company, from becoming larger, commission officials said.
 In a separate move, the chairman, Kevin J. Martin, said he had come up with a plan to enable the Chicago investor Samuel Zell to close the buyout of the Tribune Company by the end of December. 
 The crux of the plan involves granting Tribune a temporary waiver from media rules that restrict a company's owning both a newspaper and television or radio station in the same city. 
 The two moves reflected Mr. Martin's attempt to navigate a series of politically difficult proposals through a deeply divided commission. He is trying to strike alliances with the two Democratic commissioners on some issues and the two Republicans on others. The outcome will most likely determine for many years the rules governing the reach of the nation's largest media conglomerates.
 In the process, Mr. Martin has alienated powerful and politically connected executives from the cable TV industry, who have complained to the White House that his policies are inconsistent with the broader deregulatory agenda of the Bush administration. From the other side, he has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers about his efforts to loosen the restrictions on owning differing types of media properties in the same city. 
 In the case of the buyout being led by Mr. Zell, Tribune owns newspapers and radio and TV stations in five cities and cannot complete the acquisition without the commission's approval.
 Company lawyers had feared that the agency's planned action on ownership rules would come too late for them to close the deal by the end of the year, as the company had hoped, to save more than $100 million in possible taxes and other expenses.
 Mr. Martin said in a telephone conference call with reporters that his proposed order would enable the company to complete the buyout next month by granting Tribune a temporary exemption while the agency considers new rules that would loosen the broadcast-newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the 20 largest markets, which he said he expected to complete next month. 
 The decisions on the cable rules and the Tribune deal are part of a broader battle at the commission over the ownership rules for the nation's largest media companies. 
 They reflect Mr. Martin's struggle to stake out what he says is a middle position between complete deregulation, as the industries have sought, and more vigorous government oversight, as consumer groups have demanded. In addition to the Tribune buyout, the commission is considering whether to approve the merger of the nation's only two satellite radio companies.
 Officials said that Mr. Martin notified other commissioners this week of the agenda for the agency's next formal meeting on Dec. 18, and that it included a vote on his proposal to prohibit a cable company from controlling more than 30 percent of the market. Comcast is at about that level. 
 The proposal would also defer a final vote on a related plan to restrict a cable television company from providing more than 40 percent of its channels with shows from its affiliated programmers.
 Officials said that it was possible that Mr. Martin could ultimately take the cable item off the agenda. But the officials and consumer groups lobbying on the issue said the two Democratic commissioners have told them in recent days that they would support the proposal, which would give Mr. Martin the three votes he needs from the five-member commission.
 Mr. Martin has long complained that cable rates have risen significantly faster than inflation over the last decade. He also has said that there was not enough competition in the marketplace and that the cable companies have erected impediments to more diverse programming. He has urged the cable companies to offer a la carte plans that would let their customers pay only for the channels they watch.
 Cable executives have replied that a la carte would be a disaster for consumers because the more popular programs subsidize the less popular ones. They have complained to senior White House officials and top lawmakers that Mr. Martin has overreached.
 On Tuesday evening, Mr. Martin suffered a setback in promoting his agenda to more tightly regulate cable television when the commission voted to postpone a vote on his proposal to adopt a finding that the industry had grown so large that the commission's regulatory authority over it should be expanded.
 The cable concentration caps, as they are known, have long been the subject of debate and litigation at the commission. Six years ago a federal appeals court struck down a rule that was similar to the one Mr. Martin is now proposing. 
 The three-judge panel concluded that the commission had failed to provide an adequate justification to overcome the First Amendment rights of the cable companies.
 The proposal has languished at the commission for months. By forcing a public vote at the same time that the agency is expected to consider loosening the media ownership rule, Mr. Martin could be seeking to improve his chances of success. 
 The two Democratic commissioners have strongly criticized the plan to loosen the media ownership rule because it could lead to greater industry consolidation. They have also indicated that they would vote for the cable cap. 
 At a hearing on Tuesday evening, one Democrat, Michael J. Copps, said: ''Ever since I arrived at the commission six years ago, I have been deeply concerned about increasing concentration in the cable industry. I simply can't see how American consumers benefit when a handful of vertically integrated media giants have so much control over so much content.''
 And the other Democrat, Jonathan S. Adelstein, said that he voted to approve the item on Tuesday while it was circulating. 
 Still, the commission is certain to face strong lobbying against the measure by the industry.
 Earlier this year, Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and chief executive of Comcast, met separately with commissioners to discuss a series of regulatory concerns, including a possible cap on ownership. The company has also filed a stream of economic studies and analyses that it has said demonstrate that limits on ownership could be more harmful to competition. 
 In a letter to the commission, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said that since the 2001 court decision to strike down the cable ownership limits, the paid television market had become more competitive.
 ''Direct Broadcast Satellite has since shown itself to be a very effective competitor -- and numerous additional competitors to incumbent cable operators have emerged,'' the association said.

HEADLINE: Reduced Power For Musharraf, Now a Civilian

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL and JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
A day after resigning as army chief, Pervez Musharraf will be sworn in as a civilian president on Thursday, leaving him with vastly reduced powers and Washington with a far more complex Pakistan to deal with in its fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. 
 Bowing reluctantly to pressure at home and abroad, Mr. Musharraf, 64, relinquished his military role in a somber ceremony on Wednesday, ending eight years of military rule. He turned over control of the army to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, 55, a former head of Pakistan's premier intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence.
 The move sets up the potential of competing power centers in Pakistan, with an army chief separate from the president and the recent return from exile of the country's two main opposition leaders. That is likely to complicate Bush administration antiterrorism policy here, something officials in Washington were hoping to avoid, and one reason they supported Mr. Musharraf for so long. 
 Senior army commanders grumbled increasingly in recent months that Mr. Musharraf was so engrossed in his own political survival that he had become distracted from battling the country's spreading insurgency, Western military officials said. 
 Though finally stepping down as army chief, he is likely to retain much of his old power as a civilian president, fortified by his emergency decree on Nov. 3, and loyalists he chose at the top of the military, according to Pakistani officials and analysts. 
 But in fairly short order, Mr. Musharraf, who plunged the nation into political turmoil with his emergency decree and has been a sometimes frustrating partner in Washington's fight against terrorism, will become a diminished figure, they said, a civilian president in a country where traditionally the power lies with an elected prime minister, or the military chiefs who have overthrown them. Mr. Musharraf came to power in such a coup. 
 Though General Kayani is considered loyal to the president, the real levers of power will pass to him, and he is believed to favor removing the army from the center of politics, they said. ''Kayani is loyal to Musharraf, but also to Pakistan,'' one Western military official said. 
 And as much as Washington has supported Mr. Musharraf, having a chief of the army on the job full time is a change likely to be welcomed. Bush administration officials have already praised General Kayani as someone they can work with. 
 General Kayani, an infantry commander and a graduate of the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, which he attended in 1987 and 1988, has been described by Western diplomats and military officials as well liked and by far Pakistan's most capable commander.
 He has already played a prominent role in cooperating with the United States. He was promoted to full general and made vice chief of Army Staff in October. He immediately visited units serving on the front lines in Pakistan's tribal areas, and said that sorting out the difficulties plaguing western Pakistan was a priority, a Western military official said. 
 Even with his new oath of office, Mr. Musharraf will confront considerable political challenges. Before giving up his army post, he transferred the power to lift the de facto martial law to the presidency in a decree last week, and so any decision to lift it remains firmly in his hands.
 He continues under intense pressure to rescind the decree he used to suspend the Constitution and appoint a new Supreme Court. The decree has been criticized by opponents and Western diplomats as a blatant move to have his recent election as president confirmed. 
 Mr. Musharraf is also under pressure to free the senior lawyers and judges who declared his emergency decree illegal and remain under house arrest. Once freed, they are likely to resume their campaign against him.
 Not least, with parliamentary elections set for Jan. 8, he will also have to deal with two political opponents who are freshly back from exile, the former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, the man he overthrew in a coup in 1999. 
 Both politicians have called for Mr. Musharraf's resignation and for changes in the Constitution to curb the president's powers over Parliament. As leaders of Pakistan's largest political parties, either could head the next government as prime minister, perpetuating their power struggles with Mr. Musharraf as president.
 While the military under General Kayani is likely to support Mr. Musharraf as president, it is unlikely to intervene to save him in further political tests of will, said a former general and political analyst, Talat Masood. 
 One indication of the mood is a letter that 20 former generals, air marshals and admirals, including Mr. Masood, sent this week to President Musharraf calling on him to resign as head of state as well as chief of the army. 
 They called on him to lift the emergency and restore the Constitution, withdraw curbs on the news media and release political prisoners. Imposing the emergency as chief of army staff was bringing the armed forces into disrepute, they said. 
 ''The actions he is taking are really detrimental to the state,'' Mr. Masood said. They had encouraged other countries to interfere in Pakistan's affairs, specifically Saudi Arabia and the United States, in a way they never had before, and caused Pakistan to lose international respect, he said. He also criticized Mr. Musharraf for suggesting that Pakistan's nuclear weapons would not be safe if he were not in power, which he said was simply untrue.
 One of the hardest things for Mr. Musharraf now may be to stop giving the commands. 
 ''He's the one who wants to sit in the driving seat,'' said Pervaiz Elahi, who served as chief minister of the Punjab under General Musharraf. ''As commander in chief and president, I still see him as controlling the army for five years,'' he said. 
 He added that he did not think General Kayani would seek to change anything. ''Kayani is a person who just goes by the book,'' he said.
 Though no longer in control of the army, Mr. Musharraf will retain some levers of influence within the military and the intelligence services, like his personal relationship with Gen. Nadeem Taj, the head of the Inter-Intelligence Services, officials said. 
 Yet other officials said that even with the extra powers given to the president in recent years, such as chairing the National Security Council, real power resides with the army chief. Unlike the American system, a civilian president in Pakistan is titular head of the armed forces. 
 ''By the law of inertia he will continue to have some hold of the army,'' said I. A. Rehman, director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. But he predicted that during the coming months Mr. Musharraf's influence would diminish. ''He will still have ears in the army, but he will not be able to dictate to them,'' Mr. Rehman said. 
 Much depends on who forms a government after parliamentary elections, because military appointments, among other things, technically reside with the prime minister, said Najam Sethi, editor of The Daily Times.
 In a recent interview, Mr. Musharraf indicated that he hoped his supporters in the previous governing coalition would be returned with a majority again, but some of those members complain that his own mistakes during the past nine months have damaged their chances at the polls.
 A series of high-handed actions turned Mr. Musharraf from a popular domestic figure and a trophy of sorts for Washington -- he signed up to the fight against terrorism immediately after 9/11 -- to an embattled leader at home and an increasing embarrassment for the Bush administration. 
 In an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ''The Situation Room,'' President Bush said he appreciated that Mr. Musharraf had ''kept his word'' to step down as military chief. 
 ''I also hope that he enhances Pakistani democracy, and taking off his uniform is a strong first step,'' he said. ''And having elections that are out from underneath the emergency law would be a clear signal that he has put Pakistan back on the road.''
 Mr. Musharraf's friends and critics alike point to his decision to dismiss the chief justice of the former Supreme Court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, in early March as his biggest blunder, one that inexorably led to the imposition of emergency rule on Nov. 3. 
 ''He lost his head and tried to fire the chief justice,'' said Humayun Gauhar, a friend and the ghostwriter of Mr. Musharraf's memoir, ''In the Line of Fire.'' 
 Mr. Musharraf was prompted by his fear that the increasingly independent court under Justice Chaudhry would eventually rule against him in his effort to be re-elected as president while he remained as army chief, Mr. Gauhar said. 
 Because of his military mind-set, Mr. Musharraf failed to calculate, Mr. Gauhar said, that the chief justice would mount a popular movement of lawyers against Mr. Musharraf.
 ''Asking the chief justice to retire was a command,'' Mr. Gauhar said. ''I don't think the refusal was ever in his scheme. A civilian would always keep that possibility in mind.'' 
 The firing of the chief justice brought out a latent public dissatisfaction with military rule. Mr. Musharraf's refusal to give up his military post became the focus of the opposition and obscured many of his earlier achievements, his supporters said. 
 When he seized power in 1999 and ousted Mr. Sharif, the former prime minister who returned to Pakistan last weekend, Mr. Musharraf was seen as a welcome newcomer who had the ability to clean up the pervasive corruption in Pakistan's politics. He described himself as a modernizer. He encouraged the opening of independent television stations, and freed up the statist economy. 
 Born in India in 1943, he came to Pakistan as a refugee at partition in 1947. That status made him an outsider to the feudal society that had produced most of the nation's rulers. 
 In the beginning of his rule, he moved swiftly against corruption, said Farook Adam Khan, who served then as prosecutor general for the National Accountability Bureau. But after a year, the general switched gears, Mr. Khan said, stopped pursuing corruption cases and acquiesced to the religious parties in his coalition over various efforts at reforms. 
 Mr. Musharraf's supporters say that removing his uniform may come just in time for the president to regain some of his standing. 
 ''As a president without uniform he will help us in the coming elections,'' said Mr. Elahi, the former minister who is touted as a likely prime minister if his pro-Musharraf party retains majority.

HEADLINE: Sharif, Bhutto and the (Ex-) General

 BODY:
The triumphal return of Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister that Gen. Pervez Musharraf overthrew in 1999, has made the contest for Pakistan's future more uncertain than it already was and injected another player into the game: Saudi Arabia. 
 Mr. Sharif presents himself as an uncompromising champion of democracy and constitutional rule, but his years in office tell a different and more troubling story -- one of corruption, high-handedness and attempts to bully independent journalists and jurists. 
 What makes Mr. Sharif so formidable today is not his record, but the strong backing of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have long been powerful political and economic players in Pakistan, and they have championed politicians and parties inclined to favor Saudi-style Sunni fundamentalism. It was apparently at Saudi insistence that Mr. Musharraf let Mr. Sharif return home, after having sent him back on his previous attempt in September.
 Mr. Sharif's chief civilian rival is Benazir Bhutto, another former prime minister. Though her own years in office were also seriously marred by corruption, Ms. Bhutto is a somewhat more plausible champion of secularism, democracy and a real fight against Al Qaeda and Taliban bases on Pakistani soil. The Saudis do not relish her returning to power. 
 Ms. Bhutto's cause has been damaged by inept and clumsy American support. By clinging too long to Mr. Musharraf, and by pressing Ms. Bhutto to negotiate with him, the Bush administration has weakened its influence in Pakistan.
 For now, Mr. Musharraf remains in charge. After rigging his re-election as president, he finally made good on his often-voiced promise to retire from the military. Yesterday, he turned over his command to his successor -- one day before he was sworn in for a new five-year term. His powers, in theory, should be reduced, but he has made it clear that he won't give up easily. He has set parliamentary elections for January. If the emergency rule imposed by him remains in place, it would make a free and fair contest impossible. 
 Despite these obstacles, both Mr. Sharif and Ms. Bhutto have filed to run, while demanding an end to emergency rule and threatening to boycott the polls if it is not lifted. That is a sound strategy. There is nothing to be gained by promising Mr. Musharraf and his allies a free ride. 
 Their next step should be joining forces to maximize opposition strength and help assure the dictatorship's defeat. It is not too late for Ms. Bhutto to repair her democratic credentials and for Mr. Sharif to establish his.

HEADLINE: Putin Gathers His Forces for Election on Sunday

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 28 

 BODY:
His valor is extolled on billboards across the nation, and his daily feats dominate the television news. At a keynote election speech last week, his handlers even showcased a shimmying girl band singing an ode to that heartthrob in the Kremlin -- ''I want a man like Putin, full of strength!''
 Thousands of candidates are vying on Sunday for seats in the next Parliament, but the election is really about only one politician, President Vladimir V. Putin. 
 After steadily securing control over Russia since taking office in 2000, Mr. Putin has transformed the election into a vote of confidence on his leadership and on the nation's economic recovery, and he is throwing the full weight of his government and party machine into the fight.
 But to many in the opposition, the fight does not seem entirely fair.
 Opposition parties have been all but suffocated by strict new election laws, scant television coverage, curbs on organizing and criminal inquiries. Workers at government agencies and companies that receive state financing said their bosses were urging them to pull the lever for Mr. Putin's party, United Russia.
 A professor in Siberia, Dmitri Voronin, for example, said in an interview Wednesday that he and others at his university had been repeatedly called in by administrators and told that if they did not vote for United Russia, they would be dismissed.
 An overwhelming victory for United Russia, which is all but assured, could embolden Mr. Putin to maintain power over the government after he formally leaves office next year. He cannot run for a third consecutive term, according to the Russian Constitution, and he has promised to abide by that rule.
 But he has also said he will continue to exert influence over Russia after the presidential election in March. Whomever Mr. Putin endorses is most likely to become president, but he has not indicated a preference. 
 To make the case that Mr. Putin has rescued Russia after the crises of the 1990s, the Kremlin has relied on the sophisticated imagery seen in American campaigns.
 Mr. Putin's speech last week was at a rally that had the trappings of a Democratic or Republican convention at Madison Square Garden, with Mr. Putin shaking the hands of the faithful as he walked through the arena, just as American candidates do.
 ''Together, my friends, we have already done so much,'' he told the crowd at the Luzhniki arena here. ''We have strengthened the sovereignty and revived the integrity of Russia. We have revived the power of law and the supremacy of the Constitution.''
 At the same time, the party has deployed stylish television commercials that make its opponents' ads seem like high school productions.
 The advertisements often appeal to patriotism, drawing an implicit contrast between the country's current success, spurred by high oil prices, and the failings of the years after the fall of the Soviet Union that were scarred by economic collapse, crime and political chaos.
 ''Today, we are successful in politics, economics, arts, sciences, sports,'' the announcer says in an ad to a stirring brass accompaniment and images of Mr. Putin and other smiling Russians. ''We have reasons for pride. We enjoy respect and deference. We are citizens of a great country and we have great victories ahead. Putin's plan is a victory for Russia!''
 Mr. Putin has high approval ratings, and it is clear that for some Russians the stability and the sense of authority that he projects are more important than having an active opposition.
 Mr. Putin's opponents contend that he is popular only because he has prevented the spread of criticism of his policies.
 Prosecutors have confiscated more than 15 million campaign newsletters, calendars and fliers from the Union of Right Forces, one of the mainstream liberal parties that have been harassed. Nikita Y. Belykh, a party leader, was briefly detained by the police last weekend at protests conducted by an opposition coalition, Other Russia, led by Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion. Mr. Kasparov was arrested and sent to five days in jail.
 ''United Russia, through all the mechanisms at its disposal, does not allow other political parties to enter the political landscape,'' Mr. Belykh said.
 He added that the party had received numerous reports of people being threatened with retribution if they did not vote for United Russia.
 That was the experience of Professor Voronin, who lives in Prokopyevsk, 2,000 miles east of Moscow. Speaking by phone, he said local United Russia officials had guaranteed party leaders that they would win 80 percent of the vote in the region.
 ''They periodically summon directors of the local branches of the universities, directors of technical schools, specialized schools, head doctors of clinics and hospitals and give them instructions on how to vote,'' Professor Voronin said. 
 Nonpartisan groups monitoring the campaign, like Golos, a watchdog group here, said such complaints were common. Mr. Putin said Wednesday that he had no doubt the election would be fair.
 ''We know the value of authentic democracy and are interested in conducting honest, maximally transparent and open elections without organizational shortcomings and malfunctions,'' Mr. Putin said. ''We are sure that this will be done.''

HEADLINE: Shutting Up Venezuela's Chavez

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
 It was a fascist general in 1930s Spain who coined the phrase ''Viva la muerte!'' or ''Long live death!'' Essentially meaningless, the words captured the cult of soil, blood and savagery that coursed through European Fascism, in its Francoist and other forms.
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela hates fascists; they are central to his repertoire of insults. But he has not hesitated to deploy the imagery of death to bolster his leftist brand of petro-authoritarianism, now operating under the ludicrous banner of ''Fatherland, Socialism or Death!'' 
 The slogan looks almost quaint in its anachronism. Chavez would no doubt claim Cuban revolutionary, rather than Spanish fascist, roots for it (Fidel Castro also invoked fatherland and finality). The bottom line is this: Latin America's oil-gilded caudillo is getting serious about ruling for life, just like Franco and Castro.
 I might add Vladimir Putin to that list. Like the Russian leader, Chavez has already used gushing oil revenue, a pliant judiciary, subservient institutions and the galvanizing appeal of vitriolic anti-Americanism to concoct a 21st-century, gulag-free authoritarianism. But even Putin has not contemplated going as far as Chavez now intends to take his ''Bolivarian revolution.'' 
 Venezuelans will vote Sunday in a referendum that would remove all limits on presidential re-election, grant Chavez direct control over foreign currency reserves, allow him to censor the media under a state of emergency declarable at his discretion, expand his powers to expropriate private property and create the second formally socialist nation in the Americas alongside Fidel's.
 ''The measures amount to a constitutional coup,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, who edits an opposition newspaper. Certainly, they would prod Venezuela from an oppressive rule comparable to Mexico's under its once impregnable Institutional Revolutionary Party toward the dictatorial absolutism of Cuba.
 Unlike other votes during Chavez's nine-year presidency, and unlike the assured victory of Putin's United Russia Party in voting the same day, the referendum is not a foregone conclusion.
 Overcoming inertia, opponents led by students have energized a ''No'' campaign. A general once close to Chavez has denounced a looming coup d'etat. Polls suggest a close outcome.
 But awash in petrodollars -- oil accounts for about 90 percent of Venezuelan exports -- Chavez commands formidable resources. They are centered in the armed forces; a huge nomenklatura scattered across the bureaucracy and newly nationalized industries; the so-called Boliburgesia (Bolivarian bourgeoisie) of traders grown rich working the angles of a corrupt system; and the poor whom Chavez has helped and manipulated.
 Certainly, the oil money Chavez has plowed into poor neighborhoods (at the expense of an oil industry suffering chronic underinvestment) has reduced poverty. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America said last year that the extreme poverty rate had fallen to 9.9 percent from 15.9 percent. 
 But more than spreading socialist ideals, Chavez has spread a form of crony capitalism, dedicated to his greater glory, that has imbued the economy with all the resilience of a house of cards.
 Foreign investment has plunged, scared off by nationalizations. A huge disparity between the official and black-market exchange rates has encouraged get-rich-quick schemes for favored ''Chavistas'' while erecting endless barriers to trade. Price controls on staples have made eggs unavailable. This week, you can't find chickens. Chavez's socialism delivers subsidized gasoline and glittering malls but no milk.
 Latin America has been here before, with the disastrous import-substitution and highly regulated models of the 1960s and '70s. Most of the region has moved on, but not Chavez, who trumpets ''growth from within,'' whatever that is. The World Bank's recently released ''Doing Business 2008,'' a ranking of the ease of conducting commerce, places Venezuela 172nd out of 178 countries.
 Despite this, the country does huge business with the United States, as its fourth-largest crude oil supplier and a big importer. Chavez's ''socialism'' and his chumminess with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad do not extend to cutting off the ''imperialist empire.'' Chavez is too shrewd to sever his lifeline.
 A possible conclusion would be that he's harmless -- a wily barracks-bred buffoon whose leftist rhetoric is just a veneer for a petrodollar power play. Perhaps that's why the United States -- and Latin American nations -- have been so muted, or silent, before Chavez's attempted ''constitutional coup.'' Oil speaks.
 But Chavez's grab for socialist-emperor status is grotesque and dangerous -- as Fascism was -- a terrible example for a region that has been consolidating democracy. King Juan Carlos of Spain got it right when he recently interrupted Chavez's trademark verbal diarrhea with a brusque: ''Why don't you just shut up?''
 Venezuelans should watch that regal routine on YouTube -- it's even been set to music -- and follow suit on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Nascar Hits A Bump In the Road

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Hearing a faint ping from its psychic engine for the first time this decade, Rudy Giuliani's newly discovered sport of auto racing is making its annual postseason pit stop in New York. 
 For this year's champion, Jimmie Johnson, it is more of a homecoming. Johnson and his wife, Chandra, have been renting in Manhattan for four years, but on Sunday they will move into the home they have bought in Chelsea.
 Any sport whose champion can afford New York prices for an auxiliary residence cannot be doing too badly. Although Nascar was rebuffed from building on Staten Island and is having ambiguous television ratings and possibly declining attendance, the sport is still claiming to be the robust younger brother to football. 
 ''You hear about soccer moms; well, we've got Nascar dads,'' said Johnson, who was so poised in the urban setting of the ''21'' Club yesterday he could easily have been passed off as the smooth public-relations ace rather than somebody who makes left turns for a living. 
 Older hard-core fans do not confuse this Johnson with the legendary Junior Johnson, the symbol of a vanished breed of bootleggers. This Johnson, while hardly of silver-spoon heritage, is one of the young faces who have helped make Nascar so attractive to campaigning politicians.
 ''I've seen George W.,'' Johnson said respectfully, ''and Giuliani has been there.''
 The swarm can only increase during the impending silly season of presidential primaries, with candidates and television crews descending on the fume-filled speedways of America, grinning and shaking hands the way politicians used to do while noshing the knish at delicatessens on the Lower East Side.
 In 2004, President Bush went to the Daytona 500. Not to be outdone, his opponent, John Kerry, said, ''There isn't one of us here who doesn't like Nascar and who isn't a fan,'' then segued into a critique of administration economic policies. 
 Now everybody wants to get into the act. New York's governor, Eliot Spitzer, is said to be a legitimate Nascar buff, and John McCain went to the Sylvania 300 in New Hampshire last year. We can soon expect to hear Mitt Romney telling how he tried to get auto racing included in the 2002 Winter Games, and Hillary Clinton explaining the fine points of the Car of Tomorrow, which Nascar unveiled this year with considerable grumping. 
 The most recent convert was Giuliani, the Yankee fan, who in July attended his first auto race in Daytona Beach, Fla., not bringing up the fact that he is more of an opera buff. 
 No doubt, Rudy will find that Nascar has elements of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ''Hamlet,'' what with the lusty energy in the stands and the skulduggery in the garage, to say nothing of the battling Earnhardts, with the stepmother, Teresa, and the brooding crown prince of North Carolina, a k a Dale Jr. 
 For all the plot lines, Nascar has hit something of a plateau, with the final race in the Nextel Cup series, outside Miami, finishing 79th in the weekly television ratings in the first year of an eight-year relationship with ESPN and ABC. But George McNeilly, the ESPN spokesman for its Nascar account, said yesterday that the network was quite satisfied with the traffic on its Internet site, as well as the target male audience for live racing.
 Johnson noted that all sports were experiencing a drop-off in television viewers, and he added, ''How do you get people to watch five or six hours of racing tests?'' But he insisted the sport was healthy.
 ''They're coming off a decade of astronomical growth,'' said Chip Ganassi, proprietor of a racing empire that competes with Johnson and the Hendrick stable. Ganassi, who was at the same luncheon as Johnson yesterday, added: ''Sometimes I think we get too hung up on television ratings. You have to look at the bigger picture.'' 
 A few years back, Nascar seemed likely to expand to every major population area, including New York. But civic resistance on Staten Island killed those plans a year ago, one of the few political setbacks Nascar has had. Recently, Nascar agreed to sell the property to ProLogis, a builder of warehouses, raising the specter of lumbering truck traffic at all hours. That'll learn 'em.
 Facing rumors of change in Nascar, Brian France, now the chairman of the family-owned business, dropped into media center before the final Chase race, insisting his family had no plans to sell Nascar but more or less admitting that the sport had hit a speed bump.
 ''We're not immune to the economy,'' France said. 
 Nascar still has the clout to stage a sedate little victory lap in Times Square, although the drivers refrained from swerving across four lanes of traffic like their exotic brethren in the yellow cabs. 
 In this ongoing age of Nascar, Jimmie Johnson, the champion with the pad in Chelsea, felt right at home.

HEADLINE: Study Details How U.S. Could Cut 28% of Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The United States could shave as much as 28 percent off the amount of greenhouse gases it emits at fairly modest cost and with only small technology innovations, according to a new report.
 A large share of the reductions could come from steps that would more than pay for themselves in lower energy bills for industries and individual consumers, the report said, adding that people should take those steps out of good sense regardless of how worried they might be about climate change. But that is unlikely to happen under present circumstances, said the authors, who are energy experts at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
 The report said the country was brimming with ''negative cost opportunities'' -- potential changes in the lighting, heating and cooling of buildings, for example, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels even as they save money. ''These types of savings have been around for 20 years,'' said Jack Stephenson, a director of the study. But he said they still face tremendous barriers. 
 Among them is that equipment is often paid for by a landlord or a builder and chosen for its low initial cost. The cost of electricity or other fuels to operate the equipment is borne by a tenant or home buyer. That means the landlord or builder has no incentive to spend more upfront for efficient equipment, even though doing so would save a lot of money in the long run.
 Another problem, the report said, is that consumers often pay no attention to energy use in choosing gear. Computers, for instance, can be manufactured to use less power, but with most users oblivious to energy efficiency when they are shopping for a computer, manufacturers perceive no competitive edge in spending the extra money on efficiency.
 ''What the report calls out is the fact that the potential is so substantial for energy efficiency,'' said Ken Ostrowski, a leader of the report team. ''Not that we will do it, but the potential is just staggering here in the U.S. There is a lot of inertia, and a lot of barriers.''
 The country can do the job with ''tested approaches and high-potential emerging technologies,'' the study found, but doing the work ''will require strong, coordinated, economywide action that begins in the near future.''
 The report focused on describing the problem, rather than on advocating fixes. But it did mention some possible solutions. Rules for utilities could be rewritten so they make as much money in promoting conservation as in selling electricity, the study said. 
 The task might also require emissions limits and other government mandates, as well as incentives like tax breaks to promote efficient buildings, cars and appliances, the study said. The McKinsey report said ''lifestyle changes'' by Americans could play a role in improved efficiency, even though they were not a major factor in the potential gains the report cited.
 ''A broad public education program around wasteful energy consumption could be mounted,'' the report said. Modeled on the ''Keep America Beautiful'' campaign of the 1960s, it could promote reduction in ''carbon littering'' by increasing people's awareness of the problem.
 In contrast to improved efficiency, measures like capturing carbon dioxide from coal power plants and storing it would be relatively costly, and they account for less than 10 percent of the potential to cut emissions, the study said. The potential contributions from new nuclear plants and renewable energy supplies from wind or solar sources are also relatively modest, the report said.
 The study, released yesterday in Washington, was conducted by McKinsey & Company for DTE Energy (the parent company of Detroit Edison), Environmental Defense, Honeywell, National Grid, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Pacific Gas & Electric and Shell. 
 Its release comes a week before a United Nations climate conference is to convene in Bali, and as Congress approaches a vote on proposals to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.

HEADLINE: Food Banks, In a Squeeze, Tighten Belts

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Food banks around the country are reporting critical shortages that have forced them to ration supplies, distribute staples usually reserved for disaster relief and in some instances close.
 ''It's one of the most demanding years I've seen in my 30 years'' in the field, said Catherine D'Amato, president and chief executive of the Greater Boston Food Bank, comparing the situation to the recession of the late 1970s.
 Experts attributed the shortages to an unusual combination of factors, including rising demand, a sharp drop in federal supplies of excess farm products, and tighter inventory controls that are leaving supermarkets and other retailers with less food to donate. 
 ''We don't have nearly what people need, and that's all there is to it,'' said Greg Bryant, director of the food pantry in Sheffield, Vt. 
 ''We're one step from running out,'' Mr. Bryant said. 
 ''It kind of spirals,'' he added. ''The people that normally donate to us have less, the retailers are selling to discount stores because people are shopping in those places, and now we have less food and more people. It's a double, triple, hit.'' 
 The Vermont Food Bank said its supply of food was down 50 percent from last year. ''It's a crisis mode,'' said Doug O'Brien, the bank's chief executive.
 For two weeks this month, the New Hampshire Food Bank distributed supplies reserved for emergency relief. Demand for food here is up 40 percent over last year and supply is down 30 percent, which is striking in the state with the lowest reliance on food banks.
 ''It's the price of oil, gas, rents and foreclosures,'' said Melanie Gosselin, executive director of the New Hampshire Food Bank.
 Ms. Gosselin said household budget squeezes had led to a drop in donations and greater demand. ''This is not the old 'only the homeless are hungry,''' she said. ''It's working people.''
 Lane Kenworthy, a professor of sociology and political science at the University of Arizona, agreed, saying: ''The overall picture is that household incomes are kind of stuck. There's very little way to increase income, and most people have a very heavy debt load. Any event that increases your costs is really, really troublesome, because you're already stretched thin.''
 The food bank in Manchester delivers provisions to a housing project each week, and on a recent Monday, Matthew Whooley, 26, of Manchester, was waiting in line with his wife, Penny, and their four children.
 ''Every week there's less and less food,'' Mr. Whooley said. ''It used to be potatoes, meat and bread, and last week we got Doritos and flour. The food is getting shorter, and the lines keep getting longer.''
 In part, food banks are suffering because farmers are doing well. The food banks rely on supplies from the federal Agriculture Department's Bonus Commodity Program, which buys surplus crops like apples and potatoes from farmers. 
 ''Right now, the agricultural economy is very strong and the surpluses aren't available for us to purchase,'' said Jean Daniel, a department spokeswoman. ''Certainly we're empathetic, but unfortunately we cannot count on those bonus commodities every year.''
 Supplies from the surplus program dropped to $67 million worth last year, from $154.3 million in 2005 and $233 million in 2004. Figures for this year are not available, Ms. Daniel said.
 Food bank operators are lobbying for passage of a farm bill currently stalled in the Senate that would raise emergency aid for food banks to $250 million a year, from $140 million. That figure has remained steady since 2002. 
 Susannah Morgan, executive director of the Food Bank of Alaska said, ''The biggest problem is that the federal government's programs are dropping as need is growing.''
 Ms. Morgan said the decline has affected rural Alaska, where native tribes run most food pantries. She said about 10 percent of the state's rural food banks have closed because there is not enough federal help coming in.
 ''They don't feel staffing and heating is worth it for the small amount of food,'' Ms. Morgan said.
 Further complicating the picture, Ms. Morgan and others said, is tighter inventory monitoring, which has left many stores with less to donate.
 ''They know exactly what they have, down to the can,'' said Darren Hoffman, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, whose supplies are down 11 percent this year. ''They can track a lot better and don't order in bulk. Efficiency has kind of been the enemy of the food bank.''
 Extra food -- items that are not selling or seasonal inventory that is no longer needed -- is now often sold to low-cost retailers, said Tim Viall, executive director of the Greater Stockton Food Bank in Stockton, Calif. 
 ''We're getting fewer canned goods than last year from retail grocers, because they're selling it to warehouse food stores,'' Mr. Viall said. ''We're putting more reliance on canned food drives, and we're trying to ramp up the fresh fruit and produce. We are in the heart of one of the most productive agriculture areas in the world, and we're trying to take advantage.'' In places where community donations are down and there are no food manufacturers to solicit, pantries and food banks are making difficult choices. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul food pantry in Cincinnati is giving families less food this year because there is not enough. It has started to ask smaller families to take fewer products.
 ''Donations are down, and people who need help is up,'' said Liz Carter, executive director of the food bank. ''So what are we going to do. We just made the decision that instead of giving people six or seven days worth of food, we're going to give them three or four days of food, which is a drop in the bucket.'' 
 Ginny Hildebrand, executive director of the Association of Arizona Food Banks, said many pantries were facing similar situations.
 At a recent conference for food bank employees, Ms. Hildebrand said, ''Everybody was saying the same thing. They're all hit by an increase in demand, all hit by the impact of the higher costs of food, and all hit by federal reductions. We just don't have the quantity of products available that we used to.'' 
 Ross Fraser, a spokesman for America's Second Harvest, which distributes more than two billion pounds of donated food and grocery products annually, said the shortages at food banks were the worst the organization had seen in 26 years.
 ''Suddenly it's on everyone's radar,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''Food banks are calling us and saying, 'My God, we have to get food.'''

 Broadway
 'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS! THE MUSICAL' The seasonal show based on the seasonal book is back, and so is Patrick Page in the title role. He is simply great. The 10-and-unders in the crowd have no idea what a professional performance they're getting for their parents' money. The adaptation has its weak spots, but they don't last long (1:30). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'THE NEW MEL BROOKS MUSICAL YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN' This tiring adaptation of Mr. Brooks's 1974 movie, directed by Susan Stroman and starring an amiable but overwhelmed Roger Bart, never seems to stop screeching at you. This means that: a) it soon wears out its voice, and b) it leaves you with a monster-size headache (2:45). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Ben Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs. (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BINGO WITH THE INDIANS' Ideas and actors ricochet around the stage in Adam Rapp's chaotic yet intriguing dark comedy about a theater group planning to steal money from a bingo game (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Caryn James)
 'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 
 (Jason Zinoman) 
 'THE CONSTANT COUPLE' This 1699 farce by George Farquhar, presented with a light hand by the director Jean Randich, is a charming divertimento about rakish men and scheming women, involving a healthy amount of duplicity and cross-dressing, comeuppances to men who eminently deserve them, and no true villains. Sir Harry Wildair, the dashing protagonist who courts two women at once (Bradford Cover has fun with the part), was so popular in his day that he inspired a sequel. The Pearl Theater Company, devoted to reviving classic plays of various stripes, works within its resources, marshaling a nice cast (including Rachel Botchan and Jolly Abraham), and the whole thing comes to a satisfying and not entirely expected conclusion (2:05). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Anne Midgette) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FRANKENSTEIN' This dreary musical slog through the Mary Shelley novel, with an ill-used Hunter Foster in the title role, is not to be confused with the uptown spoof from Mel Brooks. It won't be (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE GLORIOUS ONES' An energetic new musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens about a commedia dell'arte troupe in which bawdy shenanigans of yore are combined with the sweet sentiments of traditional American musical comedy. It's like a whoopee cushion that emits a wistful sigh (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'HOODOO LOVE' The playwright Katori Hall appears to have a strong and promising voice. But she is still working out how to articulate what she wants to say, and this uneven play is definitely a step along the way to an arrival that is still in the future. Ms. Hall casts a sprawling net around the story of an aspiring blues singer in 1930s Nashville, hauling in a fair number of cliches, some rather arbitrary plot points and some strong moments when the singer, Toulou, follows the man she loves, evades her no-account brother and turns to her elderly neighbor for some hoodoo help that ends up creating tragedy for all. Oddly, in a play that purports to be about music, the music is somewhat of an afterthought (2:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Midgette) 
 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) 
 'MAKE ME A SONG: THE MUSIC OF WILLIAM FINN' A neon portrait of William Finn, composer of ''Falsettos,'' ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'' and much else, glows above the stage of this eager revue, and his voice, with a hint of the same sardonic smile, emerges from all of his songs, no matter which member of the four-person cast is singing them. Discursive scenes in themselves, Mr. Finn's songs are good revue material, making for a pleasant entertainment, though the presentation seems slightly stock -- with an eager, can-do, ain't-Broadway-grand spirit, given the acerbic nature of these specific and personal vignettes. Sally Wilfert, Sandy Binion, D. B. Bonds and Adam Heller are the earnest singers; Darren R. Cohen is the tireless pianist, literally at the evening's center (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.
 (Midgette) 
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Ginia Bellafante)
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'PETER AND JERRY' A beautifully acted double bill of linked plays by Edward Albee, ''Zoo Story'' and ''Homelife,'' written more than 40 years apart, that confirm his enduring and unparalleled skills in exploring the feral soul beneath civilized skins. Pam MacKinnon directs the top-flight cast: Johanna Day, Bill Pullman and Dallas Roberts. (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 
 'THE PIANO TEACHER' Elizabeth Franz gives a haunting performance as a gentle-hearted woman who discovers that evil has tainted a seemingly blameless life. Julia Cho's finely wrought play tells a thought-provoking story about the transmission of violence and the corruption of innocence (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. 
 (Isherwood) 
 'POLITICAL IDOL' Uneven but at times hilarious, this musical revue satirizing the presidential primaries does to politics what ''Forbidden Broadway'' does to theater (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (James)
 'REBEL VOICES' These staged readings, earnest but flat, present voices of the disenfranchised, from Frederick Douglas to 1930s labor organizers and today's antiwar activists (1:30). The Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (James) 
 'THE RECEPTIONIST' The ever-wonderful Jayne Houdyshell answers phones, gossips and gives motherly advice in an office where disturbing work is afoot. Adam Bock's play, essentially a gloss on the ''Twilight Zone'' formula, is a zippy hour and change of comedy and suspense (1:10). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 
 (Isherwood) 
 'RICHARD III' Michael Cumpsty adds to his accomplished gallery of Shakespearean portraits with his seductive turn as the lively schemer in quest of a crown who does away with half the court. The production, directed by Mr. Cumpsty and Brian Kulick, puts a firm accent on the black comedy in a play as deeply dyed in dramatic irony as it is drenched in blood (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) 
 'SECRET ORDER' Taut and twist-filled, Bob Clyman's entertaining drama goes behind the scenes at a prestigious (and fictional) Manhattan cancer institute to discover plenty of passions getting in the way of dispassionate science (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 
 'SPEECH AND DEBATE' Stephen Karam's modest dark comedy about three misfit high school students, which includes a singing, dancing tribute to ''The Crucible,'' is funny, cliche-free and brilliantly performed (1:45). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (James) 'THINGS WE WANT' Jonathan Marc Sherman's thickly whimsical comedy of despair has a seriously cool cast (Paul Dano, Peter Dinklage and Josh Hamilton) and a director to match in Ethan Hawke. But this dysfunctional family portrait mostly feels like an internal monologue distributed among four characters (2:00). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. 
 (Hampton) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 Off Off Broadway
 'ON THE BORDER' This intelligent if uneven piece by Howard Pflanzer aspires to realize the ideal of the critic Walter Benjamin of a text completely made up of quotations. Mr. Pflanzer has assembled excerpts from Benjamin's and others' writings to create a fever-dream depiction of the night Benjamin died, in 1940, as he tried to flee France and the Nazis. Memories, friends, nightmares loom out of the conglomerate evening: Charles Baudelaire, Bertolt Brecht, a nightmare cabaret host (Felix Gardon) who later reappears in the guise of Franz Kafka. Barbara Vann, a founder of the Medicine Show Theater in 1970, has created a show with many vivid images and smart ideas; it may have been impossible to do more to bring this one together (1:40). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Midgette) 
 'THE PIONEER: 5 SHORT WORKS BY EUGENE O'NEILL' These early, little-known one-acts by Eugene O'Neill at the Metropolitan Playhouse are rich if not particularly subtle; when they work, they work by brute force. What comes through strongest is O'Neill's sympathy for the downtrodden and trapped, and his instinctive understanding of what makes a play dramatic (1:30). The Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302. (Rachel Saltz)
 Extravaganzas
 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS: CELEBRATE!' An occasion to celebrate (2:15). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. 
 (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' A superspectacular (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. 
 (Van Gelder) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'THE FANTASTICKS' The Little Musical That Wouldn't Die redux (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' P. L. Travers meets Dr. Phil (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 
 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 Last Chance
 'CRIME AND PUNISHMENT' The novel every high school student dreads is somehow made compelling (and short!) in this three-actor production by the Writers' Theater of Chicago. John Judd is outstanding as the inspector who patiently waits out poor Raskolnikov (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE 4TH GRADERS PRESENT AN UNNAMED LOVE-SUICIDE' Imagine Pinter as a 9-year-old and you get a sense of the eerie style of this Chicago import about a group of classmates putting on the play of their friend who just committed suicide (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 
 'HAMLET' The Wooster Group's sometimes ravishing, often numbing homage to a fabled theatrical event: Richard Burton on Broadway as the Prince of Denmark in 1964. Juxtaposing a film of the performance with live actors, who replicate the on-screen action, the production teeters between hypnotic and narcotic. Elizabeth LeCompte directs (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8750; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 
 'A HARD HEART'Kathleen Chalfant, as a cerebral genius, miraculously finds the lifeblood in Howard Barker's otherwise bloodless, essay question of a play about a war-torn city (1:40). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (James)
 'LULU' Performed in German with English supertitles, this new production of Frank Wedekind's famous drama of desire is part of the BAM Next Wave festival (1:50). Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; closes on Saturday. 
 'ODE TO THE MAN WHO KNEELS' Richard Maxwell, one of the few truly original theater auteurs to emerge from the past decade, has created a bleak, droll and strangely beautiful musical about cowboys and the women who hurt them (1:15). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 966-3651; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 
 'THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE, I CAN FEEL IT' This unfocused multimedia piece about the '60s and politics feels like a student thesis (1:30). The Tank @ Collective Unconscious, 279 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (James)
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Saturday. (Genzlinger)

HEADLINE: Beautiful Manhole Covers, but at What Price?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''New York Manhole Covers, Forged Barefoot and Sweaty in India'' (front page, Nov. 26): I'm so sorry to hear that manhole covers are made under such miserable conditions for workers in India. For the first time this morning, I looked at each one I passed on the Upper West Side on my way to work: at least half were made in India. 
 I'm especially sorry because my daughter, 3, so loves them: she jumps on them and draws on them with her sidewalk chalk. We've always paid close attention to the things that distinguish New York City -- the manhole covers, the water towers, the public transportation system that lets us live here without owning cars. 
 Let's distinguish ourselves in this way: ensure that our city buys products made under humane conditions.

 New York, Nov. 27, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The horrifying photograph of foundry workers in West Bengal, India, is a scene out of Dante's ''Inferno.'' 
 It is shocking to contemplate that in the 21st century these primeval conditions still exist in a country that prides itself on its technological and academic achievements, and proclaims itself as the world's largest democracy. For shame! Mark Davis
 Forest Hills, Queens, Nov. 26, 2007
 To the Editor:
 ''Those Lovely Manhole Covers'' (editorial, Nov. 27) suggests that high worker safety standards should be enforced by Indian suppliers of manhole covers. But it would be a mistake to mandate such standards without first considering economic feasibility.
 American foundry workers enjoy a much higher standard of living than their Indian counterparts. They get paid much more, and their safety standards are (and should be) correspondingly higher. 
 To enforce similar standards in India would mean spending more on safety than is spent hiring the people themselves! 
 This unrealistic business model would lead to the closing of Indian foundry shops and loss of jobs for the poor people who need them most. 
 Of course safety is important, but such idealistic proposals will ultimately harm those whose safety they advocate.

HEADLINE: Economics, Immigrants and Lou Dobbs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks (''Follow the Fundamentals,'' column, Nov. 27) does well in listing the attributes of the United States economy in which we shine: competitiveness, overall strength, ''productivity leader in virtually every industry.'' 
 But he glosses over the issues of daily concern to millions of Americans: poverty, lack of health insurance, wages that on a inflation-adjusted basis have been virtually stagnant in the last seven years for 90 percent of the population while the wealthiest have been able to pile up riches at rates unheard of since the age of the robber barons. 
 Hope turns to despair when despite hard work you can't get ahead, when pensions shrink or disappear, when your home is being foreclosed or when you can't scrounge your kid's college tuition together. All the praise of the United States economy solves no problems for the struggling millions who can no longer legitimately hope to climb the ladder of economic progress.
 Emil B. Rechsteiner Groton, Mass., Nov. 28, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Creating a pejorative like ''Dobbsianism,'' with its implication of rabble-rousing, and saying that ''elite opinion'' does not support Lou Dobbs's campaign to end illegal immigration is insulting, not only to Mr. Dobbs but also to people like me. I am neither rabble nor a nincompoop, but a highly educated, real liberal -- a fervent lifelong union member and a believer that America should take care of its own citizens first.
 The people of this country have demonstrated again and again that they are overwhelmingly against illegal immigration and want something done about it. Lou Dobbs, for a long time, was the only public person who recognized this and supported it. He didn't create it; the selfish corporate interests and bought politicians who acted against the will of American citizens managed to do that very nicely all by themselves.
 Gail Chapman Forest Hills, Queens, Nov. 29, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks claims that Dobbsianism falsely embraces a fear that America is fragile, yet the United States has a potent economy. This may be true for the top 1 percent. It is not true for the large, regressive middle class. 
 We've replaced steaks with corn flakes; we can't afford to get sick; our kids can't afford health insurance; we hope that our 10-year-old van keeps running because we can't afford a new one; our kids can't buy a home because housing prices are exorbitant; our purchasing power continually regresses; cost-of-living increases are absurd; and worst of all, the poverty and near-poverty classes are growing. This certainly is not a great economy for us. 
 Mr. Brooks also mentions that we outsource seven million jobs every quarter but create more than seven million. Actually, prestigious manufacturing jobs are replaced by hamburger flippers; this is not a dynamic economy.
 Thank God for Lou Dobbs. 
 Cliff Price Livermore, Calif., Nov. 28, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks is bewildered that Americans agree with Lou Dobbs's attacks on American trade policy when, in Mr. Brooks's view, the economy is so fundamentally strong. But the average American's pay isn't keeping up with the cost of health care, energy and food. Most Americans feel threatened by global integration because they sense that their wages will be depressed when they compete for jobs and wages with workers paid far less than they. 
 Mainstream economic theory says they're right: even as trade with developing nations helps raise total national income, it depresses incomes for the 70 percent of the work force who aren't college educated, whether employed in manufacturing or not. That's why inequality is rising.
 The future will bring more outsourcing, not less, and even many college-educated workers will probably see their wages fall. 
 Ross Eisenbrey Washington, Nov. 27, 2007
 The writer is vice president, Economic Policy Institute.
 To the Editor:
 Many thanks for setting the record straight on the dangers of Lou Dobbs's xenophobia and the damage it inflicts on American minds that ingest only CNN.
 Andrea M. P. Neves Middleburg, Va., Nov. 27, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks trots out the usual macro numbers to denote the strength in the United States economy, but it's at the micro level where individuals and families are truly stretched thinner and thinner where he seems to ignore our collective pain. 
 Increased costs on all fronts -- health insurance, groceries, gas and home heating fuels and mortgages -- while wages stagnate create deeper fissures between the middle and lower classes when compared to the upper middle class and wealthy. 
 What Lou Dobbs is saying speaks more to the anxieties we feel to be certain, but economic conservatives who think that those upper-middle-class and wealthy Americans and corporations shouldn't be bearing more of a tax burden than those who can barely afford to get by, much less save and prosper, will be in for a rude awakening.
 The Republican way of running things is not working, and only by continually gaming the system does the free-market aura remain in place. 
 Peter L. Kohan Union, N.J., Nov. 27, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks is right to note that America's shift against globalization cannot be explained by economic indicators. Could it be that 9/11, and our leaders' reactions to it, are more important? We are reminded to fear foreigners, with a continuing threat level orange, with surveillance and a threat so severe we resort to rendition and torture. We go it alone, withdrawing from treaties and taking unilateral positions, earning resentment around the world. 
 With our leaders addressing the world from a lonely and fearful crouch, how can we expect the people to be confident and embrace it? We can only hope that our leaders in 2009 will change direction.
 Ken Novak Palo Alto, Calif., Nov. 28, 2007

HEADLINE: Economy Surged in Summer; Trend Isn't Expected to Last

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
The economy barreled ahead in the summer, growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate. The performance was the strongest in four years but is not expected to last through the current quarter amid the housing slump and credit squeeze. 
 New-home sales edged up in October, but sales activity still hovered near an 11-year low.
 The Commerce Department's new reading of the gross domestic product from July through September, released Thursday, was even better than the government's initial estimate of a 3.9 percent growth rate for the period. Stronger exports and more inventory investment by businesses were the main reasons for the improvement.
 A second report from the department showed that new-home sales increased 1.7 percent in October from September. That left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728,000. Even with the nudge up, sales have plunged 23.5 percent over the last 12 months. In September alone, sales dropped to a pace of 716,000, the lowest level since 1996.
 The median sales price of a new home fell to $217,800 in October, down 13 percent from a year earlier. It was the biggest annual decline in prices since September 1970. The median price is the point at which half the homes sell for more and half for less.
 Sales rose in all parts of the country except the West, where they tumbled 15.7 percent from the previous month.
 The big increase in gross domestic product did not change the picture forming in the current October-to-December quarter. That picture is somewhat grim, with indications the economy will lose considerable steam. Growth is expected to slow to a pace of just 1.5 percent or less in the final three months of this year.
 The upgraded figure for the third quarter matched economists' forecasts. The strong showing suggested that the economy was resilient even as the housing market plunged deeper into turmoil and credit problems intensified. Federal Reserve officials and other economists -- looking at fresher barometers of economic activity -- have warned that the economy is in for a rough patch.
 Another report said the number of new people signing up for jobless benefits last week rose sharply, suggesting that employment conditions are weakening as national economic activity slows. The Labor Department reported that new applications for unemployment insurance mushroomed by a seasonally adjusted 23,000, to 352,000. It was the highest level since Feb. 10.
 There have been signs in recent weeks that the housing and credit problems are affecting the behavior of consumers and businesses alike.
 The Fed has cut interest rates twice this year -- in September and late October -- to keep the housing collapse and credit squeeze from throwing the economy into a recession.
 At their October meeting, Fed policy makers signaled that further rate reductions might not be needed. Since then, however, financial markets have suffered more turmoil. The housing slump has deepened, consumer confidence has sunk and shoppers are flashing signals of caution.
 Against that backdrop, investors and some economists think the Fed may lower rates when policy makers meet Dec. 11.

HEADLINE: From Both Sides in Broadway Strike, a Message: Take Me Seriously

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
After a two-and-a-half week strike that sapped the city of nearly $40 million, wiped away millions of dollars of potential ticket sales and left hundreds of actors, musicians and stagehands without paychecks, the payoff finally arrived. And anyone not intimately familiar with the business of Broadway could be forgiven for asking: Is that it? 
 The tentative five-year agreement focuses on a handful of work rules on the minimum number of stagehands needed and how long they can work. 
 The league representing producers and theater owners will have more flexibility in the number of stagehands required to work each day during the load-in, the lengthy and costly period when a show is moving to a theater.
 The league also gained ground on continuity calls, or requests for work right before or after a performance, for tasks related to that performance. Those are the main changes, but there are others on smaller points -- such as a wage freeze at $56 an hour for mopping -- that could yield, all together, tens of thousands of dollars, if not more, in savings a year for each production. 
 These changes were not inexpensive: union members will receive yearly raises of as much as 4.5 percent over the next five years in addition to some other pay increases in specific areas.
 But details aside, both sides -- the League of American Theaters and Producers and the stagehands' union, Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees -- came away having made their points, and loudly. 
 The producers insisted: Change must come to this business. 
 To which the union responded: It won't come cheap or easy.
 ''The money lost in these three weeks will not be recovered by the men or the management,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, a veteran producer and manager, ''but the messages that both sides sent to each other are more significant.
 ''For the men, it's that this is our work, we've earned it and we're proprietary about it. And the management message is that what you thought was a disparate group isn't, and that if you push us too hard, we will take a strike.''
 Broadway was too busy getting ready, and too tired otherwise, to bother itself with score-keeping yesterday. The true meaning of the changes in the stagehands' contract will be known only when they are put into practice anyway. The stagehands still have to vote on the agreement next week, so everyone around Broadway was being discreet.
 The strike meant millions of dollars in lost profits, but during the strike, producers had no bills to pay -- no actors and no rent. Most of their fixed costs, like insurance, were covered by a $20 million fund they had amassed to help them withstand a walkout. The rumors during the strike that this or that show was about to close were somewhat nonsensical, since the shows were simply in hibernation. 
 But that changed last night, when the lights were turned on, rent kicked in and everyone came to work. If audiences don't come as well, there will be trouble.
 ''Frankly, there are going to be a lot of wild discounts going on for the next few weeks,'' said Chris Boneau, a Broadway press agent.
 The four-day musicians' strike of 2003 did not have much of an effect on ticket sales, but that was four days, and in March. Thanksgiving week and Christmas week are the pillars of the holiday season on Broadway. So now that bills are being paid, people have to come back, and fast.
 What all of this means over the long term is harder to say, other than that the league and the Broadway unions are probably looking at each other differently now.
 After months of negotiations, league officials were genuinely surprised to find that the union wasn't giving in on a range of points, even on rules the league thought were plainly unreasonable. 
 When the strike began, the first on Broadway in the union's 121-year history, the league also expected to see fault lines between Local 1 and the other Broadway unions, but these lines never really materialized. The new director of Actors' Equity Association, John P. Connolly, turned out to be a stalwart defender of Local 1, giving fiery speeches at news conferences. Equity's own contract with the league is up next year.
 In an open letter to the actors' union during the strike, league officials said, ''Before the recent vitriol aimed at us by Equity, we had no expectation that next summer's production contract negotiation would be difficult in any respect.'' 
 But the league had its own surprises in store. For years, the league, made up of producers and theater owners, was seen as a somewhat paradoxical institution. The theater owners collect rent as long as there's a show playing, while the producers are tossed about on the tempestuous economic tides of Broadway. 
 The parties would seem to be working at cross purposes in a collective bargaining situation, and for years producers complained that the owners were giving away the store in labor negotiations just to keep the theaters occupied.
 But this time was different. An unusually unified league, driven by a new, aggressive generation of producers, amassed that $20 million fund, set bargaining deadlines, hinted at a lockout and imposed rules in its determination to make real changes.
 ''What was it that was so intensely crucial that they would push the whole proceedings to the cliff's edge?'' asked Mr. Connolly, who said he was taken aback by the league's doggedness. 
 It would be difficult to find anyone who would have predicted that the league would walk out of negotiations on the Sunday before Thanksgiving and, unhappy with what they were hearing from the union, cancel performances for the entirety of the second most lucrative week of the year. It was a self-inflicted wound worth millions. But it was a sign that the league meant business.
 And after all that huffing and puffing, what did the league get? Depending on how you look at it, the league either made a dent with a howitzer or took the first and most difficult steps in making a decades-old contract more efficient. 
 But Broadway moves on. As Kevin McCollum, a producer of ''Rent,'' ''Avenue Q'' and ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' pointed out, there are new challenges.
 ''The months of January and February,'' he said, ''historically have been more devastating than any strike.''

HEADLINE: The Economic Effect of the Writers Strike

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
According to a new report from the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, the economic impact of even a long strike by screenwriters would not be much. If the strike, now about four weeks old, were to last for five months, the report said, the Los Angeles area would see economic activity drop by about $380 million, or roughly one-tenth of 1 percent of the region's $380 billion in annual activity, and personal income growth for area residents would fall by just a quarter of 1 percent in 2008. Written by the economist Jerry Nickelsburg, the report, released yesterday, described the strike's likely effect as ''modest and transitory.'' It said widely published higher estimates of the strike's impact had failed to account for the entertainment industry's stockpiling of programs and movies; spending by consumers on other entertainment; and the large number of reality television shows, which are unaffected by the walkout.

HEADLINE: Manhattan: Job Numbers Continue To Rise

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City has replaced nearly all of the jobs lost since employment in the city peaked before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, according to federal data released yesterday. The number of jobs in the city, adjusted for seasonal hiring trends, rose to 3.742 million in October, from 3.738 million in September, figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. That was the highest level of employment in the city since January 2001, when there were 3.748 million jobs. Employment in the city has risen steadily all year, outpacing the rate of job growth in the nation, the Labor Department said, but some economists expect that trend to be disrupted soon by various labor strikes and layoffs at big financial firms.

HEADLINE: The Rally Continues, but Just Barely

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street extended its rally with modest gains in the major indexes after two days of sharp advances, despite economic readings that painted a mixed picture of the economy.
 On Tuesday and Wednesday, the market posted its biggest two-day rally in five years. Hopes have been growing that financial companies may be starting to recover from the credit crisis and that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates to calm the markets.
 Oil prices spiked early yesterday, and then fell back somewhat after a fire at an Enbridge Energy Partners pipeline carrying crude from Canada to the Midwest. The oil price recovery gave some strength to energy stocks. 
 Financial companies, which had shown gains Wednesday, retreated, as did retailers after a weak showing by Sears. Its shares fell $12.25, or 10.5 percent, to $104.09. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.28 points, or 0.17 percent, to 13,311.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.70 point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,469.72, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.22 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,668.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.98 points, or 0.52 percent, to 766.06.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 3.43 billion shares, compared with 4.45 billion Wednesday.
 Bond prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to 3.93 percent from 4.03 percent Wednesday. The 10-year note's price rose 26/32, to 102 18/32. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
 Light crude for January delivery rose 39 cents, to settle at $91.01 a barrel, in choppy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Exxon Mobil was up 67 cents, to $88.59, while ConocoPhillips advanced $1.10, to $78.82.
 Among financial companies, Merrill Lynch fell 38 cents, to $57.41, while Bank of America fell 22 cents, to $44.63.
 Stocks' fluctuations followed the mixed economic readings.
 The Commerce Department reported that economic growth in the third quarter was 4.9 percent, faster than originally thought, although analysts are expecting a slowdown in the fourth quarter.
 Home prices showed a quarterly decline for the first time in 13 years in the third quarter, according to figures from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which reported a 0.4 percent drop nationwide for the July-September period.
 The economic reports came as investors awaited clarity on the Fed's direction on interest rates. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted yesterday evening that another interest rate cut might be needed to bolster the economy. He spoke before the Chamber of Commerce in Charlotte, N.C.
 Investors have sent stocks sharply higher in recent days in part because the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, suggested another interest rate cut could be in store. The Fed, which has cut rates at each of its last two meetings, is to meet again Dec. 11.
 Wall Street has also been calmed as financial institutions have found some assistance. E*Trade Financialsaid yesterday that the Citadel Investment Group would provide $2.5 billion in cash to shore up E*Trade's balance sheet. The company also said Mitchell H. Caplan had resigned as chief executive. E*Trade fell 46 cents, or 8.7 percent, to $4.82.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 5-year notes and 14-day cash-management bills.

HEADLINE: Oxygen Suppliers Fight to Keep a Medicare Boon

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
Millions of people with respiratory diseases have relied on oxygen equipment, delivered to their homes, to help them breathe. A basic setup, including three years of deliveries of small oxygen tanks, can be bought from pharmacies and other retailers for as little as $3,500, or about $100 a month. 
 Unless, that is, the buyer is Medicare, the government health care program for older Americans. 
 Despite enormous buying power, Medicare pays far more. Rather than buy oxygen equipment outright, Medicare rents it for 36 months before patients take ownership, and pays for a variety of services that critics say are often unnecessary. 
 The total cost to taxpayers and patients is as much as $8,280, or more than double what somebody might spend at a drugstore. 
 The high expense of oxygen equipment -- which cost Medicare over $1.8 billion last year -- is hardly an anomaly. 
 Medicare spends billions of dollars each year on products and services that are available at far lower prices from retail pharmacies and online stores, according to an analysis of federal data by The New York Times. The government agency has paid above-market costs for dozens of items, a comparison of Medicare figures with retail catalogs finds. 
 For example, last year Medicare spent more than $21 million on pumps to help older and disabled men attain erections, paying about $450 for the same device that is available online for as little as $108. Even for a simple walking cane, which can be purchased online for about $11, the government pays $20, according to government data. 
 These widespread price discrepancies, including those for oxygen services, have been noted in dozens of regulatory reports. 
 But when officials and politicians have tried to cut these costs, they have often encountered a powerful foe: the companies that sell these devices, who ask their elderly customers to serve, in effect, as unpaid lobbyists, calling and writing to their representatives in Congress, protesting at rallies, and even participating in political attacks against individual lawmakers who take on the issue.
 As the nation's elderly population grows, dozens of industries have tried to harness the political might of older Americans for corporate goals. Physician groups, medical device manufacturers, insurance companies and other businesses have rallied aging voters to protest even minor legislative changes.
 ''These industries rely on a basic threat: If you mess with us, we can turn the seniors against you,'' said former Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, who tried cutting Medicare payments while he was in Congress. ''Angering seniors is the quickest route to political suicide.''
 Many of those battles focus on the $427 billion Medicare program. Because of fierce patient and corporate lobbying, for instance, Medicare still pays prices for many items that are based on rates established in the early 1980s, when devices were often much more expensive than they are now. 
 Even as the actual cost of many machines and services has fallen, Medicare has only occasionally lowered what it pays.
 ''There's no question that parts of Medicare are mispriced,'' said Herb B. Kuhn, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing Medicare. Mr. Kuhn said the program had made price refinements and was in the process of carrying out a competitive bidding system to help bring down the cost of products like oxygen equipment. 
 But, Mr. Kuhn acknowledged, officials have confronted political and logistical obstacles in adjusting a program that last year provided services to 43 million older and disabled Americans. 
 The battles over oxygen equipment highlight many of those challenges. 
 Medicare pays the same rental amount to provide each oxygen patient with equipment and services, regardless of how often they are used. 
 For patients who require constant monitoring and frequent deliveries of tanks, high prices may be justified. And for people who use equipment for only a few months, renting may be cheaper than buying. 
 But Medicare overpays for the many patients who require less care, like those who use equipment only at night or during vigorous activities, regulators and lawmakers say.
 Earlier this decade, legislators ordered the government agency to pay less and use the competitive bidding program.
 Then the oxygen industry started fighting back. Companies organized themselves into a deep-pocketed lobbying force that has defeated attempts to cut Medicare's rates, and has attacked the competitive bidding program. 
 The companies that profit from Medicare say their tactics are appropriate and the payments they receive are fair. 
 When the government pays for oxygen equipment, ''it also gets an enormous number of other services that are keeping patients out of hospitals,'' said Peter Kelly, president of a large oxygen supply company. ''Those avoided hospital visits end up saving Medicare billions.'' 
 For instance, Mr. Kelly's company, Pacific Pulmonary Services, whose customers are mostly Medicare patients, provides everyone with access to 24-hour emergency technicians, weekly check-in phone calls and other services that might not be available to people who buy equipment on their own. 
 Oxygen suppliers that bill Medicare also incur significant administrative costs, Mr. Kelly said. 
 ''At some point, shrinking Medicare reimbursements will inevitably impact our ability to offer this high level of patient care,'' Mr. Kelly said. 
 But lawmakers have argued that companies are offering extra services to justify high fees. 
 ''I would guess we're grossly overpaying for about 80 percent of the people who receive these services,'' said Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee who recently pushed to cut Medicare's oxygen spending. 
 More Patients, More Money
 A study released last year by the office of the United States inspector general found that oxygen companies checked equipment for malfunctions much more frequently than manufacturers recommended and performed routine maintenance that patients could do on their own. Executives at oxygen companies challenge those findings.
 As America becomes an older nation, it is also, by some measures, becoming sicker. Lung diseases and other breathing impairments, which are often a result of smoking, today affect an estimated 35 million Americans, up 40 percent since 2002, according to the American Lung Association. 
 For Medicare entrepreneurs like Mr. Kelly, these trends have provided opportunities. 
 His company operates in 15 states, delivering oxygen tanks and equipment to about 45,000 patients. Last year, Mr. Kelly's firm collected more than $100 million from Medicare for delivering various equipment and services.
 ''When Katrina hit New Orleans and the fires hit Southern California, oxygen suppliers rushed in to make sure patients had enough oxygen,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''There's no one else standing by to make sure these patients can breathe.'' 
 Other companies that sell medical equipment have also flourished. More than 114,000 home medical equipment suppliers billed Medicare last year, according to HME News, an industry newsletter. Over 1,500 of them collected more than $1 million. One of the largest oxygen equipment suppliers, the publicly traded Lincare, collected over $789 million from Medicare last year, according to corporate filings. 
 Large private investment firms have also jumped in. Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a $16 billion private equity group, has invested in numerous companies that profit from Medicare. One of its executives is Thomas A. Scully, who ran Medicare for almost three years, until 2003.
 The government's overall bill for Medicare soared last year to an average of $8,568 per beneficiary, up from $5,522 in 1999, an increase that outpaces inflation by 34 percent. 
 The rapid increase has drawn the attention of lawmakers. In 1997 and 2003, Congress lowered oxygen reimbursements by a total of about 39 percent.
 At the time, oxygen executives acknowledge, they were disorganized and relatively politically naive. Since then, companies that manufacture and sell home medical equipment have spent more than $18 million lobbying Congress on various issues, according to federal records. 
 ''We're willing to spend what it takes to make sure we are heard,'' said Joseph S. Lewarski of Invacare, an Ohio manufacturer of oxygen equipment.
 Strength in Numbers
 While any industry can hire lobbyists, few can marshal tens of thousands of older citizens to accuse politicians of trying to take away their lifelines. That ability, say lawmakers and their staff members, is the real clout of home medical equipment companies and other industries that sell to the elderly.
 When Congress proposed cutting oxygen payments last year, for instance, trade groups and companies began warning patients that if the law changed, there might be no one to repair their equipment or provide emergency services.
 ''I'm scared to death that they are going to cut us off,'' said Beverly Karagin of Morning Sun, Iowa, whose husband has used oxygen equipment for about 11 years. Mrs. Karagin wrote her senators and congressman after her oxygen delivery company told her about proposed payment cuts, she said. 
 ''If something goes wrong with the machine and Medicare won't pay to repair it, my husband could die,'' Mrs. Karagin said in an interview. ''I told them that this is a matter of life and death.'' 
 Lawmakers say such fears are unfounded. After patients take ownership of the equipment, Medicare pays for repairing machines and backup systems. 
 Even so, last year ''our office received over a thousand phone calls from oxygen patients in two days, and all of them said they were going to die if we passed this law,'' said a high-ranking Congressional staff member who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
 Other lobbying efforts have attacked individual legislators, accusing them of harming elderly Americans. 
 VGM & Associates, which provides back-office services to home medical equipment providers, helped pay for commercials last year that said Bill Thomas, then a Republican representative from California, was abandoning elderly war veterans. Mr. Thomas, who retired last year, had led an effort to cut Medicare's oxygen rates.
 ''Bill Thomas wants to hurt older and disabled Americans,'' the commercial claimed. 
 Ron Bendell, president of VGM, said he ''wanted to let Congress know we won't take this lying down.'' 
 Such lobbying tactics have drawn sharp criticism from Capitol Hill.
 But they have also been effective.
 On Dec. 18, 2005, Mr. Thomas inserted a midnight change into the $40 billion Deficit Reduction Act to cut oxygen reimbursements. At the time, Medicare paid for unlimited equipment rentals. Mr. Thomas sought to cap those rentals at 18 months, which would save the government hundreds of millions of dollars each year. 
 Before the sun rose, Senator George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican who has received tens of thousands of dollars in political contributions from executives at oxygen companies, called another lawmaker to discuss how to block the proposal, according to the senator's staff members. 
 He then informed lawmakers overseeing the legislation -- which had essentially already been approved by both houses of Congress -- that he would upend the entire bill if the oxygen cuts and other modifications were not scaled back, according to staff members who worked closely on the legislation. 
 ''We literally had the legislation signed and ready to go, and then Voinovich threatened to kill it all,'' said a high-ranking Congressional staff member who had direct involvement in the process, but requested anonymity to avoid angering Senator Voinovich. 
 Congress gave into the threat, consenting to 36 months of oxygen payments before ownership transfers to patients, the system that exists today. 
 A spokesman for Senator Voinovich acknowledged that the late-night phone call had occurred and said the lawmaker ''will never have a problem sticking up for the elderly and patients when Congress tries to give them the short end of the stick.'' 
 More recent attempts to cut oxygen reimbursements have also failed. President Bush, in his 2007 proposed budget, asked Congress to cut Medicare's oxygen payments by 63 percent, and the House of Representatives passed legislation halving Medicare's oxygen rates.
 Neither of those proposals made it into law. 
 ''It doesn't seem sensible that a small industry should be able to manipulate the entire U.S. Congress into overpaying for oxygen,'' Representative Stark said. ''But that's the world we live in now.''
 Similar tactics have doomed efforts to rein in spending on dozens of other Medicare items, as well. Lawmakers or regulators have proposed changing payment policies for motorized wheelchairs, mental health services, X-rays, diabetic supplies, orthotics, hospital beds, nutrition drinks, allergy therapies, ambulance trips and numerous other products and services. 
 Competitive Bidding
 Some legislators say the only way to lower Medicare's payments is to bypass the political process altogether, to insulate individual politicians from blame.
 Last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing Medicare, announced guidelines for a national competitive bidding system for home medical equipment. 
 In 10 metropolitan areas, Medicare requested that suppliers of some products, like oxygen, submit bids. The agency is in the process of setting payments based on those submissions. The companies proposing the highest prices will be excluded from the program. 
 The national competitive bidding process was to begin last January, but was repeatedly delayed. Mr. Kuhn, the Medicare official, blamed technological difficulties for those delays. 
 But other high-ranking Medicare officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said political pressure from medical equipment companies was also to blame for the slow start. 
 Medicare has also tried to improve the quality of services these companies provide. In 2005, the agency released more than 100 pages of proposed requirements for equipment suppliers participating in Medicare. But, after industry executives complained to the agency and to politicians, the final requirements were cut to 14 pages, eliminating numerous standards, and undermining the initiative's goals, some Medicare officials say.
 A spokesman for the agency defended those cuts, and said the final requirements maintained most of the standards. 
 Some within Congress say the answer is not competitive bidding at all, but rather that lawmakers must resist political pressure as they try to keep Medicare's costs down. 
 ''All you have to do is pick up an equipment catalog or search for 'oxygen device' on eBay to figure out better prices than what we're currently paying,'' Mr. Stark said. 
 Such concerns are becoming more common as the population ages and Congress increasingly confronts pressures from elderly voters, lawmakers say. But unless legislators make hard choices, costs will spiral out of control.
 ''This isn't rocket science,'' Mr. Stark said. ''We're the government. This is supposedly what we get paid to do.''

HEADLINE: Spas and Stars, but Ojai Tries to Stay Grounded

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
FINDING the ideal small-town retreat is getting tougher these days, at least for urban escapees whose checklist for perfection includes some potentially contradictory traits.
 It has to offer seclusion, but within a two-hour drive of a major city. Natural beauty, but no weather extremes. Relaxation, but plenty to do when the mood strikes. Interesting neighbors, but not so many that traffic backs up or real estate prices get out of hand.
 On all but that last count, Ojai, Calif., may be one of the few small towns in America actually to meet those demands.
 In a valley less than 90 miles northwest of central Los Angeles and 15 miles inland from the Pacific, Ojai is a low-key hideaway known for attracting an eclectic mix of artists, spiritual gurus, health devotees and entrepreneurs -- and, more recently, Hollywood actors and executives. 
 Real estate agents generally avoid discussing celebrity clients, but local newspapers said that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, were house hunting in Ojai this summer, and the former ''Dallas'' star Larry Hagman owns a solar-powered spread there. 
 But by all accounts, high-profile residents tend to keep a low profile around town.
 ''Ojai is going to cater to a very nonpretentious type of buyer,'' said Larry Wilde, co-owner of the Coldwell Banker Property Shoppe. ''For those who want massive wining and dining and shopping, they're going to go to Santa Barbara or Malibu.''
 In fact, the valley's slow pace is precisely why Eric Goode, part owner of New York City hot spots like the Waverly Inn and the Maritime Hotel, bought a home in Ojai nearly 20 years ago.
 ''I wanted a place that was the opposite of New York,'' he said. ''It's just a funny, sleepy town.'' Mr. Goode spent a couple of years in Ojai as a child and recently set up a sanctuary for 300 endangered turtles and tortoises from the Bronx Zoo -- a project that has increased his visits to Ojai to about once a month.
 ''I'm torn between the urban world and the natural world, so I go out there for my dose of the natural world,'' he said, though that doesn't exclude merging Ojai and his work life down the road. ''I would love to buy a hotel there.'' 
 The town's name comes from a Chumash Indian word meaning ''moon'' or ''nest,'' and a shot of the valley that appeared in the 1937 Frank Capra film ''Lost Horizon'' bolsters the area's status as a modern-day Shangri-La.
 With just 8,000 residents, Ojai has long had an anti-development stance, preserving its reputation as a haven for healthy living, in contrast to the crowds, pollution and excess of Los Angeles. It is also something of a spiritual mecca, home to the Krotona Institute of Theosophy and a retreat dedicated to the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti, once an Ojai resident.
 These days, visitors and transplants are more likely to be seeking a massage or a Mediterranean-style ranch. Those in search of more active pursuits will find miles of trails for hiking, biking and horseback riding, as well as golf courses, tennis courts and yoga classes. But the growing popularity of spa vacations has put Ojai on the map. 
 One of the main draws is the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa (www.ojairesort.com), a 220-acre Spanish colonial-style resort that finished a $90 million renovation last year. With three pools, four restaurants, an 18-hole golf course, a 31,000-square-foot spa and activities ranging from guided hikes to art lessons, it's a popular escape for Los Angeles residents as well as for travelers who fly in.
 It's also a favorite location for corporate retreats and special events, making headlines Labor Day weekend when the ''Private Practice'' star Kate Walsh held her wedding there. 
 With weekend rates starting at $400 a night and a 50-minute massage priced at $140, the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa draws a deep-pocketed crowd for its style of deep-tissue relief. On the more economical end of the spectrum, weekend room rates at the Oaks at Ojai spa (www.oaksspa.com) start at $190 a person, based on double occupancy, but include meals and classes, while a 50-minute massage costs $75.
 Ojai Valley's prices have provoked some grumbling among locals about the town's increasingly exclusive feel and guests' tendency to stay on campus rather than spend money in town. Based on a recent midweek visit, the temptation to stay put is understandable: lushly landscaped grounds, pristine pools and an army of lined-up lounge chairs lure you into a reclined position, then the sun, scent of lavender and trickling of a nearby fountain make even a walk to the tennis courts seem taxing.
 But the town of Ojai offers its own charms, and prides itself on its indifference toward sunglasses-wearing celebrities who do make an appearance downtown. 
 ''I've never seen paparazzi up here,'' said Ojai's mayor, Carol Smith. ''You can stroll around town and not be harassed.''
 INDEED, nonresidents are more likely to draw attention by misinterpreting the refill policy at the Ojai Coffee Roasting Company -- as a friend and I did during our visit to the cafe. Yet a man in a beige kilt didn't attract a second glance from the morning crowd trading greetings and newspapers. 
 At the moment, a hot-button issue for Ojai residents is a proposal that would ban chain stores from setting up shop in town, a measure many locals support as a way to preserve Ojai's small-town character and architectural appeal.
 ''We don't have a Gap, we don't have a McDonald's,'' Mayor Smith pointed out. ''Most of the shops you'll see here are unique or are owned individually.''
 However, some local business owners worry that the proposal is too restrictive, and could actually lead to empty storefronts downtown. As it is, the shops along Ojai Avenue skew more toward tourists, mostly selling art, jewelry, clothes and trinkets. (Another celluloid connection: The Primavera Gallery sells paintings and drawings by Anthony Hopkins.)
 There are also lots of real estate offices downtown, which until recently were doing a booming business. Mr. Wilde of Coldwell Banker said the market peaked in 2005 after nearly a decade of price increases but has since slowed down. ''There's an awful lot on the market between a million and three million dollars,'' he said. ''That's the market that's being impacted the most.''
 For $1 million, buyers can expect to find a 1960s 2,000-to-3,000-square-foot home on an acre or less that will probably need some renovations, Mr. Wilde said. For a bigger house on a larger parcel, with the Mediterranean style and updated kitchen that high-end homeowners seek, a $2 million to $3 million price tag is more typical.
 The median sale price for previously owned houses in Ojai is about $600,000 so far this year, according to Data Quick Information Systems, down 8 percent from 2005. That year, 56 homes sold for more than $1 million, versus 2 in 1995, when the median sales price was just $199,000.
 Mr. Wilde attributed some of the past decade's run-up to the influx from Hollywood, though he declined to discuss any of his celebrity clients. 
 Another Ojai resident who felt the pull of the valley's slow pace is David Allen, a consultant and author of the best seller ''Getting Things Done,'' about working more productively so you have time to enjoy life. 
 He moved to Ojai 15 years ago, buying a 1920s ranch house he describes as ''a teardown we just haven't bothered to tear down,'' and now runs his business there, taking care of his bonsai plants in his downtime.
 ''Ojai has all the really cool things of a small town, but not the downsides, like close-mindedness or provinciality,'' Mr. Allen said. ''You'll see a $2.3 million custom-designed home going up next to an old hippie shack -- and everybody kind of likes it that way.''
 Preserving that mix may be Ojai's biggest challenge, but it's one Mayor Smith thinks its residents will master. ''I want this town to stay a real town -- I don't want it to become only rich retired people,'' she said. ''And I don't think it will.''

HEADLINE: Citing Statistics, Giuliani Misses Time and Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
In almost every appearance as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination, Rudolph W. Giuliani cites a fusillade of statistics and facts to make his arguments about his successes in running New York City and the merits of his views.
 Discussing his crime-fighting success as mayor, Mr. Giuliani told a television interviewer that New York was ''the only city in America that has reduced crime every single year since 1994.'' In New Hampshire this week, he told a public forum that when he became mayor in 1994, New York ''had been averaging like 1,800, 1,900 murders for almost 30 years.'' When a recent Republican debate turned to the question of fiscal responsibility, he boasted that ''under me, spending went down by 7 percent.'' 
 All of these statements are incomplete, exaggerated or just plain wrong. And while, to be sure, all candidates use misleading statistics from time to time, Mr. Giuliani has made statistics a central part of his candidacy as he campaigns on his record. 
 For instance, another major American city claims to have reduced crime every year since 1994: Chicago. New York averaged 1,514 murders a year during the three decades before Mr. Giuliani took office; it did not record more than 1,800 homicides until 1980. And Mr. Giuliani's own memoir states that spending grew an average of 3.7 percent for most of his tenure; an aide said Mr. Giuliani had meant to say that he had proposed a 7 percent reduction in per capita spending during his time as mayor.
 Facts and figures are often the striking centerpieces of Mr. Giuliani's arguments. He has always had a penchant for statistics -- his anticrime strategy as mayor was built around a system known as Compstat that closely tracked crimes to focus law enforcement efforts. On the campaign trail he often wields data, without notes, with prosecutorial zeal to hammer home his points.
 But in recent days, both Mr. Giuliani's Republican rival Mitt Romney and Democrats have accused him of a pattern of misleading figures and have begun to use the issue to try to undercut his credibility.
 An examination of many of his statements by The New York Times, other news organizations and independent groups have turned up a variety of misstatements, virtually all of which cast Mr. Giuliani or his arguments in a better light. ''He's given us a lot of work up until now,'' said Brooks Jackson, the director of Annenberg Political Fact Check, which is part of Factcheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania that has corrected statements by candidates in both parties. 
 Aides to Mr. Giuliani dismiss questions about his use of statistics as nitpicking, arguing that no one can dispute the big points he makes by using the statistics: that crime dropped significantly during his tenure, say, or that he worked to restrain spending in New York.
 ''The mayor likes detail, and uses it frequently on the campaign trail in ways the other candidates don't,'' said Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani. ''And at the end of the day, he is making points that are true.''
 Mr. Giuliani is not alone in citing statistics in a questionable way. Last month, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said that financing for the National Institutes of Health had decreased under President Bush; it has increased. Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, said the national debt had doubled under President Bush; it has not.
 But with Mr. Giuliani running so strongly on his record, statistics have taken on a central role in his campaign.
 In recent days, Mr. Giuliani seems to be taking greater care to be precise. 
 At the Republican debate on Wednesday night, he was careful when referring to crime statistics in Massachusetts during Mr. Romney's term as governor, which had been the subject of a debate over the weekend. And at a ''Politics and Eggs'' breakfast on Monday in Bedford, N.H., he took greater care to describe his record on cutting taxes.
 Last weekend, speaking about his belief in supply-side economics, Mr. Giuliani said, ''I lowered, argued for lowering, and got the hotel occupancy tax lowered by 33 percent. And I was collecting $200 million more from the lower tax than the city had been collecting from before I was mayor from the higher tax.''
 In fact, the increase in revenues from the hotel occupancy tax was just over a quarter of what Mr. Giuliani asserted -- the city's hotel tax revenues grew by roughly $58 million during his term, according to the city's Independent Budget Office -- and a booming economy, as well as the reduction in crime Mr. Giuliani helped produce, probably played a part. 
 Factcheck.org has reported that the Giuliani campaign exaggerated when it boasted on its Web site that ''Mayor Giuliani increased the police force from 28,000 to 40,000,'' noting that most of that increase came from his merger of the Transit and Housing Police Departments with the New York Police Department, a transfer of more than 7,000 existing officers to the department. 
 The campaign argues that giving housing and transit police officers jurisdiction beyond the city's public housing and subways gave the city more flexibility to fight crime. It said that it usually notes the effects of the merger when describing the size of the police force, and said it would change a post on its Web site to mention the merger when citing the increase.
 And the group also found that Mr. Giuliani erred at a Republican debate when, while calling for tort reform, he said that 2.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product ''is spent on all these frivolous lawsuits.'' That statistic, the group reported, came from a study that pegged the cost of all civil claims at 2.2 percent of the G.D.P., without judging whether the cases had merit or not.
 Even some people who support Mr. Giuliani's proposals say he risks undercutting his own arguments when he relies on imprecise or questionable statistics. 
 In a recent radio advertisement by the campaign about his health care proposal, Mr. Giuliani repeated another false statement that he had been using on the campaign trail. In the advertisement Mr. Giuliani, who has had prostate cancer, asserted that his chances of surviving prostate cancer in the United States were 82 percent, while his chance of surviving in England would have been only 44 percent. His point was that the American health care system is far superior to England's government-run system, which he refers to as ''socialized medicine.''
 The figure came from an article written by one of Mr. Giuliani's health care advisers, but was soon discredited: the source of the research that was used to derive the statistic said that its data had been misused. The Office for National Statistics in Britain said that the true five-year survival rate was 74.4 percent -- still lower than in the United States, but by a much smaller margin. Mr. Giuliani stood by the statistic, however, and kept using the advertisement, though it has since gone off the air. 
 Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review magazine, said Mr. Giuliani's plan ''may be the best of the Republican health care plans.'' 
 ''The trouble is that the exact statistic he used was misleading,'' Mr. Ponnuru said in a recent interview, elaborating on a blog post he wrote. ''It became an argument about the statistics, and he dug in and defended it when he was wrong.''
 Another radio advertisement that Mr. Giuliani ran over the summer stated that as mayor he ''turned a $2.3 billion deficit into a multibillion-dollar surplus.'' 
 That was also misleading. According to independent fiscal monitors, Mr. Giuliani did have to close a $2.3 billion deficit in his first budget, and did accumulate a multibillion-dollar surplus during his tenure. But by Mr. Giuliani's last full fiscal year in office, the city was spending more than it was taking in in revenues, and Mr. Giuliani ended up spending almost all of the surplus to balance his final budget.
 Last weekend, questions about Mr. Giuliani's use of facts moved front and center in the campaign. Mr. Giuliani charged that ''violent crime and murder went up'' in Massachusetts while Mr. Romney was governor. The number of reported killings did go up in those years, but the state's overall rate of violent crime went down, according to statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Mr. Romney accused Mr. Giuliani of having ''a real problem with facts,'' and aides circulated a statement calling Mr. Giuliani's crime statistics ''about as accurate as his prostate cancer survival numbers for England.''
 ''He has now done this time and again, making up facts that just happen to be wrong, and facts are stubborn things,'' Mr. Romney said.
 Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who once worked for Mr. Giuliani, said he doubted that the issue would hurt him politically.
 ''When he talks about New York, people see it,'' Mr. Luntz said of Mr. Giuliani, ''and they feel it, and if a number isn't quite right, or is off by a small amount, nobody will care, because it rings true to them.''

HEADLINE: On Nuclear Seesaw, the Balance Seems to Shift to Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is known for overheated, boastful pronouncements. So it was hardly a surprise earlier this month when he declared that despite demands from the United States and other countries that Iran stop enriching uranium, Tehran was pressing ahead and negotiations were out of the question.
 ''From our point of view,'' he said, ''this subject is closed.''
 But in this case, Iran's intransigence is not only real; it also appears to be defeating attempts by the rest of the world to curtail Tehran's nuclear ambitions, at least for the moment. 
 Nine months after the United Nations Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on Iran to press it to stop enrichment, and threatened more if it refused, Iran has steadily increased its enrichment of uranium, which can be used to produce electricity or fuel bombs. At the same time, the nations that joined together behind the sanctions are divided. 
 The foreign ministers from the six nations that backed the sanctions are now facing another decision on Iran, having agreed to pass a new Security Council resolution if there were no signs of progress in negotiations with Tehran by Friday.
 But nothing seems to be bending the will of Iran, which is flush with oil revenues. The incentive strategy, led by Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy adviser, has failed to entice Iran to stop enrichment in exchange for economic, political and technological rewards. So has the punishment approach, as Russia and China hold firm to the view that further pressure will only intensify the standoff.
 In May, desperate to engage Iran, the six nations offered a brief freeze in further sanctions if Iran freezes its enrichment program at the current level, effectively dropping their demand that Iran stop enrichment altogether. But that ''double freeze'' proposal barely got Tehran's attention.
 ''The chosen strategy of pressure and engagement is not working,'' said one senior European official involved in the diplomacy. ''As a result, you have a lot of people desperately banging on the door of the Iranians. All of them are coming back empty-handed.''
 Last week Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported that while Iran was answering questions about past nuclear activities, it had crossed the threshold of putting into operation 3,000 centrifuges, which enrich uranium. He added that restrictions on inspectors precluded his agency from determining whether Iran's program was intended to generate power or make weapons.
 On Friday, Mr. Solana is to meet in London with Iran's new nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, before reporting to officials from the six countries. But Mr. Jalili has repeatedly stated that enrichment is not negotiable, and Iran's official government spokesman says it will not be on the agenda.
 Representatives of the six nations -- the United States, Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany -- will meet Saturday in Paris to discuss a new Council resolution. In interviews, officials from those countries expressed a growing consensus that the momentum in their diplomacy had evaporated and that any new resolution would be weak. 
 ''As far as new ideas, I don't have any new ideas to offer,'' Mr. Solana told reporters on Wednesday. Privately, he has told governments that the most they can ever hope for is a cap on Iran's enrichment program in the future, according to officials involved in the conversations.
 The Security Council twice has imposed limited economic and political sanctions aimed at freezing Iranian assets linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Although there is considerable debate in Iran on the wisdom of a policy that isolates the country, the sanctions have hardly budged Iran.
 Kim Howells, a senior official in the British Foreign Office, told a Parliament committee on Wednesday that the current sanctions were ''pretty weak,'' adding, ''I don't think the U.N. is going out of its way to cripple Iran in any way.''
 Behind the scenes, the impasse has encouraged independent initiatives, complicating the joint diplomacy of the six powers.
 Switzerland floated a plan, criticized by the six countries, that would allow Iran to expand its enrichment program but would set limits on how fast. 
 Russia has recently tried but failed to sway Iran to compromise. During a recent visit to Tehran, President Vladimir V. Putin was granted a rare audience with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr. Putin made no threats, but focused on the benefits that would flow to Iran, including the delivery of sophisticated nuclear technology, if it made some gesture on enrichment, according to officials familiar with the visit.
 Iranian officials described the meeting as very friendly, but when Mr. Putin sent his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, to Tehran, Mr. Lavrov received a frosty reception, and returned home frustrated, Russian, Iranian and European officials said.
 Still, Russia prefers to make the next priority not more sanctions but winning Iran's cooperation on allowing wider inspections of its nuclear sites by the United Nations agency, Russian and Western European officials said. 
 China, whose trade with Iran is soaring, has taken what might be characterized as a passive-aggressive diplomatic approach. 
 It did not send a representative to a key meeting of the six powers in Brussels on Monday, causing the meeting to be canceled. The Chinese delegation also refused to attend the previous scheduled meeting of the group, to protest both a meeting Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, held with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader, and the decision by the United States Congress to honor him. The Chinese are expected at Saturday's meeting.
 The only negotiation with Iran that seems to be progressing is the limited one aimed at resolving the United Nations agency's questions about Tehran's past nuclear activity. Under a formal agreement last summer with the agency, Iran has begun to turn over documents and make various officials and former officials available for interviews. 
 As long as Iran is making progress on this front, the United States and its European allies are likely to have a difficult time persuading Russia and China to agree to further sanctions. 
 Instead, the United States, Britain, France and Germany are working to persuade their own companies and banks to limit investments and dealings in Iran. Other countries, including Italy and Spain, have resisted a French proposal to impose new European Union sanctions. 
 Meanwhile, Dr. ElBaradei, whom Iranian officials have described as a friend, has been criticized in some official quarters in Iran for his recent report, which called on Tehran to abide by Security Council resolutions and faulted it for a ''confidence deficit'' about the nature of its nuclear program. 
 Earlier this month, Dr. ElBaradei planned a trip to Iran to expand his inspectors' access and restart negotiations. Although President Ahmadinejad and other officials agreed to see him, Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's top decision-maker, did not, and Dr. ElBaradei called off the trip. 
 The Iranians argue that once questions about their past are resolved, they cannot be penalized for enriching uranium, because Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
 ''Enrichment is a right of all countries,'' Mohammad Saeidi, the deputy director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said in an interview one week ago. ''Once the past ambiguities are resolved, we have every right to do it.''
 Perhaps the biggest setback in the recent attempts to negotiate with Iran was the failure of the ''double freeze'' proposal. Early last May in Brussels, the six powers first presented a visiting Iranian delegation with what they considered the generous offer to temporarily ''freeze'' all further punitive action in the Security Council if Iran put a temporary ''freeze'' on expansion of its enrichment program. 
 Until then, the six countries had taken the position that negotiations could start only if Iran halted enrichment entirely. The proposal, titled ''The Way Forward to Negotiations,'' included agreement by the six counties to discuss with Iran the timing and methods for uranium enrichment in the future and binding assurances for the supply of nuclear fuel, officials said. 
 But the Iranians at the table did not even bother to read the document, nor was there ever an official response from Tehran.
 Mr. Solana repeated the offer last month during a meeting with Iranian nuclear negotiators in Rome, but it was rejected, officials involved in the talks said. 
 Even so, the apparent softening of the six powers' demand on uranium enrichment -- however brief -- may have helped convince Iran that its policy of defiance was paying off.
 ''Of course the proposal could be seen as moving our red line,'' said one senior official involved in the diplomacy. ''But we are diplomats. We have to find a formula for negotiations with Iran.''

HEADLINE: China Agrees to Remove Certain Export Subsidies

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Bowing to American pressure on the eve of high-level talks to reduce economic tensions, China agreed Thursday to terminate a dozen different subsidies and tax rebates that promote its own exports and discourage imports of steel, wood products, information technology and other goods.
 The action mostly affects exports by Chinese companies that have foreign investors or are joint ventures with foreign companies. Nearly 60 percent of Chinese exports are produced by these businesses. Also affected were tax breaks that China gives its own companies if they do not import goods themselves. 
 There were no clear indications Thursday on which exports, if any, would become more expensive and which imports would benefit, since the precise amount of subsidies that different companies get is not public.
 Despite the progress announced Thursday, the Bush administration remained concerned about increasingly aggressive actions by China in recent months to use subsidies, regulations and other government measures to promote national champions in major sectors where foreign countries have been strong, including energy, aerospace, telecommunications and financial services.
 The intent of the new agreement, negotiated by Susan C. Schwab, the top United States trade envoy, is to help American companies compete against China. While Ms. Schwab acknowledged that some of the loss of subsidies might be borne by Chinese companies owned in part by Americans, she trumpeted the agreement as a major breakthrough.
 ''This outcome represents a victory for U.S. manufacturers and their workers,'' Ms. Schwab said after the accord was signed by Chinese and American representatives at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. ''It shows that President Bush's policy of serious dialogue and resolute enforcement is delivering real results.''
 Ms. Schwab said she hoped that the negotiated settlement on subsidies, after months of litigation at the W.T.O., would improve the atmosphere on other disputes over China's currency policies, antimonopoly rules, regulations and other practices that seem aimed at discouraging foreign imports and investments.
 But no breakthroughs on these other matters appear to be in the offing two weeks ahead of the next round of the ''strategic economic dialogue'' with China set up last year by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 In advance of that session, negotiators led by Ms. Schwab, Mr. Paulson and Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez are trying to hammer out agreements on food and product safety, improved access to China for American banks and insurance companies and an easing of China's restrictions on foreign companies. 
 Lately, however, the administration has charged that China has become more protectionist in crucial areas by erecting nontariff barriers through the use of increasingly sophisticated regulations and government-imposed standards that hurt foreign companies but help domestic ones.
 Asked whether the latest agreement represented a trend away from such industrial policy practices, Ms. Schwab was noncommittal. ''I would like to think that it's a signal the trend is changing,'' she said. ''We don't know for sure.''
 The agreement on subsidies was hailed in the United States by the National Association of Manufacturers and other groups critical of China's economic practices. But it met with skepticism among familiar critics of China, especially those who charge that China keeps its currency value low to promote exports.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, who has criticized China, said the agreement was ''a small step on the long road toward playing more fairly'' in trade.
 Alarmed by a trade deficit that soared to $232 billion last year, and is likely to go much higher this year, Mr. Schumer and other lawmakers, including Republicans, are calling for legislation to impose sanctions on China over its failure to let the value of its currency appreciate faster.
 The Chinese currency has appreciated 12 percent against the dollar since mid-2005, but it has declined against the euro, making it harder than ever for Europeans to sell to China.
 The subsidies affected by the agreement on Thursday were those declared illegal by the United States, Mexico and other trading partners with China, citing W.T.O. laws. 
 But the move by China will not affect other subsidies on certain kinds of steel products, heavy-duty tires, paper and chemicals that the United States also charges are unfair. The Commerce Department has invited manufacturers of these products to seek relief by requesting duties on these products, and that process continues.
 Also unresolved are other American legal actions through the dispute resolution mechanism of the W.T.O.
 These actions charge that China discriminates against foreign auto parts by requiring local content for automobiles; fails to enforce copyright and trademark rules on software, videos and other property; and restricts imports of films, music and books.
 The Chinese have been irate over American actions that challenge their economic practices at the W.T.O. and over the imposition of duties by the Commerce Department. 
 But Ms. Schwab said Thursday's agreement on subsidies vindicated the administration's approach of using negotiation to resolve disputes and to oppose punitive legislation that is pending in Congress on currency and other policies.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Reinforces Suggestions of Rate Cut

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged on Thursday that a ''fresh wave of investor concern'' had led to tougher credit conditions that posed new risks to the economy, reinforcing the view that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates again, when it meets on Dec. 11.
 Speaking one day after another top Fed official signaled that policy makers might have to reduce interest rates to head off trouble, Mr. Bernanke pledged that the Fed would remain ''exceptionally alert and flexible'' in setting policy. 
 ''Economic forecasting is always difficult, but the current stresses in financial markets make the uncertainty surrounding the outlook even greater than usual,'' Mr. Bernanke said in prepared remarks to a business group in North Carolina.
 Noting that investors have been shaken by losses and write-downs on soured mortgages, Mr. Bernanke said a new round of turbulence in financial markets had reversed some of the recovery in credit markets after a first round of panic broke out in August over subprime mortgages.
 ''Needless to say, the Federal Reserve is following the evolution of financial conditions carefully, with particular attention to the question of how strains in financial markets might affect the broader economy,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke's comments backed up those on Wednesday by Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, who said that the economy might face bigger problems than the central bank had expected and that policy makers would have to be ''nimble.'' The Fed has already cut rates twice this year. 
 In sharp contrast to the Fed's increasingly gloomy outlook, the Bush administration predicted on Thursday that the economy would experience little more than a downward blip in the next few months and grow as rapidly in 2008 as it appears to have grown in 2007.
 In a new forecast prepared by the White House and the Treasury Department, the administration predicted that the economy would expand by 2.7 percent in 2008, almost as fast as this year, and that unemployment would remain almost as low as it is today.
 ''We continue to see signs of healthy economic growth, which only underscores the resilience of our economy despite continued challenges in the housing sector,'' said Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. ''We are entering a record fifth year of continuous job growth while the unemployment rate remains low, and we believe that these trends will continue.''
 The new forecast was at odds with the Fed's outlook for ''subpar'' growth in 2008, and even more out of sync with predictions of most economists on Wall Street.
 Fed officials foresee growth next year of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent. And even that estimate, officials warned this month, was loaded with uncertainty and could be too optimistic.
 Wall Street economists, most of whom are even gloomier than the Fed, quickly dismissed the White House forecast.
 ''It is completely at odds with the Fed's forecast, the consensus forecast and the message that has been embedded in financial markets for the past six months,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. ''If you support the White House forecast, you are saying that the bond markets are crazy.''
 David Rosenberg, chief United States economist for Merrill Lynch, estimated on Thursday that the economy faced a 60 percent chance of slipping into a recession in the months ahead. Many other analysts place the odds of a recession at 50-50.
 At a meeting on Thursday with reporters, Mr. Lazear acknowledged that the economy was likely to slow in the months ahead and that largely because of the housing downturn, the White House had lowered its expectations from six months ago. 
 ''Obviously, the housing market has been softer than people expected,'' he said. ''We are not the only ones who were surprised by that. For the most part, our revisions are in line with other revisions.'' 
 But Mr. Lazear said that the slowdown would be short-lived and that the economy would expand almost as rapidly next year as it appears to have done this year.
 The White House was closer to the Fed on its estimate about unemployment, predicting that it would average 4.9 percent next year -- up slightly from 4.7 percent today. But many analysts say the Fed's unemployment forecast is too optimistic, because it is inconsistent with its forecast for slower growth. 
 Economists on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve have become increasingly unnerved by new evidence that the panic in subprime mortgages, and in the broader mortgage market, is now leading to a credit crisis for many business borrowers as well. Compounding that worry are early hints that businesses are cutting back on orders for new equipment and that consumers, pinched by high gasoline prices, are cutting back on spending.
 ''These uncertainties require flexible and pragmatic decision-making,'' Mr. Kohn said on Wednesday. 
 The Commerce Department, in its first revision, estimated on Thursday that the economy expanded at a torrid annual pace of 4.9 percent during the third quarter -- the fastest quarterly growth in four years and even faster than the government's earlier estimate. But most economists are expecting growth to slow sharply in the current quarter and into the early months of next year.
