HEADLINE: House Proud

BYLINE: By Ben Lloyd 

 BODY:
IN every cowboy movie I ever saw, the weary horseman checks into a small-town hotel and takes a wash at a little table with a bowl and a pitcher of water. He's nearly dead -- exhaustion, Indians, whatever -- and this little wash puts him back in business.
I always wanted to take that refreshing wash; or maybe it was the room I craved. It was always sunlit, and the little table was charming and practical at the same time. Could I design and build a bathroom that had the same sense of delight in a Brooklyn Heights brownstone? 
 An elegant single-family house originally built for an upper-middle-class merchant, the brownstone had already endured one reincarnation: In the 1940's, it was converted into eight studio apartments. Lilliputian in size, each had the elements of a complete home in one room, including a small bathroom.
My plan was to create a duplex out of four of the studios. Two of them, on the second floor, would yield three bedrooms and a bathroom. For economic reasons, I planned to use the original plumbing stack. By removing the wall between the two tiny studio bathrooms, which were back-to-back, I would create a 13-by-4-foot bathroom suite with three discrete areas: a combined tub and shower sandwiched between two toilets and two hand basins.
Every square inch gained would be precious. How, then, to partition the space without destroying it?
Another challenge: The 1940's studio conversion had turned the town house into a series of joyless boxes. Because of its central location, the bathroom ought to give back some charm that had been stripped away.
They were typical studio bathrooms, poorly lighted and gaudily tiled, which made them even more claustrophobic. And since it was situated in the center of the brownstone, the new bathroom space would still be very dark.
The problems became the solution: build interior windows, rather than walls, around the bathroom suite, turning it into a sort of greenhouse. When lighted properly, it would allow light to spill over into the hallway and illuminate the dark center of the house. It would also suggest the freshness of an outdoor shower. In a small space, a sense of surprise like this can be a useful luxury.
My first idea was to build these walls with a system of aluminum framing used in storefronts, substituting etched glass for clear glass. But that proved too overbuilt and too slick looking. The solution was an elegant system of slender wooden frames to hold the glass, providing both light and architecture.
A carpenter built the greenhouse frame on location, using 1-by-3-inch lumber; a glazier added etched safety glass. Two more ideas fell into place, furthering the greenhouse notion: The stripped-brick wall behind the tub, created by demolition, and a pitched Sheetrock ceiling both contributed to the indoor-outdoor ambiguity and took up no space.
What fixtures to put in such a quaint environment? A whirlpool bath was rejected for size, cost and noise factors. A deep tub for silent soaking, in the Japanese mode, was the next idea. Its elegant utility was appealing, but soaking tubs using Vermont soapstone and Corian proved too expensive for my budget.
T HE answer was found in Chinatown, whose fish stores sell live carp from deep polyurethane tanks sitting on the pavement. (The tanks are designed for bulk industrial use.) The distributor, Chem-Tainers, in North Babylon, L.I., thought that my idea of making a bath out of its plastic tank was the funniest thing it had ever heard.
They come in 16 colors, including natural, which actually has a pleasant translucent quality. It cost about $250, and a plumber drilled a hole in the bottom to attach the waste outlet and made a plate to cover the tub's sloping bottom.
Because the tub area would double as the shower room, we laid a lead pan on the subfloor. To keep the glass walls from getting soaked, I made water-deflecting screens from plastic roofing material whose corrugation suggests the curves of curtains. (The material came from Home Depot.) The screens are suspended from an aluminum pipe-rail frame found at the New York Store Fixture Company, at 167 Bowery, in Manhattan.
We set bricks from the renovation itself in fine cement, pitched downward to the floor drain to remove water spilled by the shower. A new "old" outdoor showerhead came from a specialist plumbing store for $100. A granite Belgium cobblestone, $4 at Home Depot, serves as a step.
The vanities were made by mounting a 16-inch stainless-steel bowl with a hole cut in the bottom for the drain (found at Weisman Salvage on Macdonald Avenue in Brooklyn, about $5) on a custom wooden table whose scalloped edge recalls a tablecloth. The top is glazed with 3-by-3-inch Japanese floor tile, another Weisman find. The tiles are hard and good for a counter top.
The bowl sitting atop the table is amusing and offers more usable space than when it is inset. The beautiful old faucet from the original bathrooms was reincarnated and updated with a modern "shampoo valve" by Delta Faucet, which mixes hot and cold.
All the plumbing for the two vanity areas was hidden in the walls, keeping the look as clean as possible. Flooring here is poured cement with inlaid ceramic tiling to match the table and walls. The new regulation 1.6-gallon narrow tank-toilet fixture, Navajo by Crane ($75 from Star Plumbing Supplies, at 601 Fifth Avenue, in Brooklyn), helps ease the space crunch.
The plain and honest shapes of the bowl and tub echo the charm of the cowboy's room in the movie. Sure, it's simple, but then again, maybe today there's too much ado about frothing.

HEADLINE: Upstairs Or Down, Now It's All in the Family

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
CONSIDER it a trendlet.
More and more brave (and affluent) souls are buying multiple-dwelling town houses and converting them back to their original status as single-family homes. 
 Real estate agents around New York say houses are hot. The number of single-family houses in Manhattan, which had been dwindling for many decades, actually edged up slightly from 1993 to 1995. (The Real Estate Board counted 1,282 in 1995, up from 1,223 in 1993.)
The price for a multiple dwelling can be one-third that of a single-family house (and often much less than a substantial family apartment). While the cost of renovation can equal or surpass the purchase price, some families say there is little that can match the emotional value of a house in the city, with twin comforts of space and backyard. Clearly, carving a homestead out of a former apartment house, rooming house or boardinghouse is a labor of love and obstinacy: in other words, a typical New York challenge.
 "We really wanted the space, though we realized we were taking on a lot more responsibility," said Rita Halbright, who has a travel agency. She and her husband, Jonathan Och, a securities trader for a bank, found a five-story town house off Central Park West for less than $700,000, because of devastation wrought by squatters and a fire. It cost about that much again to convert from 10 rabbit-size apartments. The San Diego design architects Safdie Rabines, with help from Ogawa/Depardon of New York, gave the 100-year-old Victorian a thoroughly modern face lift. Two floors were partly removed, creating soaring volumes from claustrophobic parlors. Restored, it contains four bedrooms, six bathrooms, a study, an office and a double-height kitchen.
Soon after, Mr. Och's firm transferred him to London. The family put the house on the market for $1.7 million. It sold 14 weeks later, for $1.4 million.
"Converting town houses for family use is a trend with emotional roots, not economic," said Nathaniel Rocket, the executive managing director of Massey Knakal Realty Services on East 50th Street. "The people who do this have no interest in resale value. They just want what they want -- a house -- and this is the only way they can get it."
In the 1970's, when families in station wagons were again abandoning gritty New York for the greener suburbs, many of these stately Victorians (typically five stories tall and 16 to 20 feet wide) were divided up every which way into rentable duplexes, studios, even single-room-occupancy hotels, -- that is, if they hadn't already been carved up into boardinghouses in the 1930's.
Rentals were popular in the 1980's, at least until the bottom fell out of the market and fewer people wanted to be on-call landlords to houses full of tenants savvy about renters' rights.
Now, the trend is coming full circle as two-income couples entrenched in their jobs seek out these hybrid apartment town houses. When they factor in the commuting time, the car, the property taxes and the tree surgeons, many conclude they may as well buy a house in Manhattan as in Manhasset.
Rebellion against the strictures of co-ops is also driving people into the house market. "You get much more of a bang for your buck in buying a house over a co-op," said Roger Erickson, a senior vice president at William B. May. "Banks will finance a house up to 90 percent, while many co-ops are demanding 50 percent cash down. I had a client who couldn't afford to buy into a $1 million co-op and got a huge $2.5 million house instead."
And independent-minded house owners avoid the vexations of having board members nose into their finances, make extraordinary demands ("You will carry any dog up to 35 pounds through the lobby," is a fairly common one), and generally enforce a communal way of life.
Many two-income couples are surprised when they find themselves priced out of the apartment market. When Kate Stiassni, a producer at CBS News; her husband, Ned Nunes, a psychiatrist, and their two children outgrew their two-bedroom "classic five" on the Upper West Side, they soon discovered that trying to find an eight- or nine-room apartment catapulted them into the multimillion-dollar market.
They finally found what they wanted in a derelict-looking seven-unit town house on the Upper West Side for less than $1 million; aside from many layers of paint and seven kitchens spread over four stories, it was in great condition.
Even with the house market heating up, two- to five-unit town houses can still be had for $750,000 (an intact family house is more likely to cost $3 million or more).
Still, buyers willing to convert multiple dwellings back into family town houses are a breed apart from those in the market for something in move-in condition. The ones intent on converting a multiple dwelling tend to be youngish couples with a few children. For them, taking on a prodigious renovation is almost like taking on a dare.
"You do it to make a home for your family," said Susan Eve Haar, a lawyer, who so enjoyed converting a three-unit four-story town house in Greenwich Village with her husband, Steve Horowitz, and three young children that she has overseen several similar projects for faculty members at New York University. "Once you start looking at existing houses, you find that they've all been reworked to fill someone else's needs. So you might as well start from scratch to get exactly what you want."
Their house was completely gutted, including the basement, which they deepened by a foot and a half and fitted with a large playroom. The entire job, including five bathrooms, cost about 60 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Haar said.
But before gleefully thumbing through the latest Renovator's Supply Catalogue, anyone contemplating a conversion should prepare to face some potentially formidable hurdles -- tenants, for starters. The costs, both actual and emotional, of removing tenants should be considered part of the price of a typical conversion. Tenants' rights in these conversions, especially for those in regulated apartments, can be complicated legally, and the outcome often depends on powers of persuasion (money helps, too).
Before discovering a 10-unit town house on West 69th Street, Ms. Halbright and Mr. Och had signed a contract on a town house in Greenwich Village with one tenant out of eight still living there. They put into their contract that the place had to be vacant by the closing. When the seller could not get the tenant out after 90 days, the couple got their full deposit back.
Tenants in rent-stabilized apartments may be extremely difficult to budge. (Stabilization is a form of rent regulation applying mainly to postwar buildings. But it also applies to apartments in older buildings that have been rented since 1971.) Roger Erickson at William B. May says that in some cases, owners can prevent leases for rent-stabilized tenants from being automatically renewed, if they can show they need the space for themselves.
But having the law on your side doesn't always make the situation easier. "Who cares if you're in the right?" Ms. Haar said. She said she had to call in armed marshals to evict tenants after all other efforts failed.
Kate Stiassni was luckier. Her house had two tenants, one who had been there for 20 years, when she and her husband negotiated the sales contract. The couple struck a deal in which the seller (an estate) had to make sure one of the tenants left (it was an illegal sublet) while she paid someone to find a new apartment for the other person.
Another important step for owners is to change the certificate of occupancy as soon as possible in order to avoid high property taxes of a multiple dwelling. While the city real estate departments move slowly, there is no reason to worry that they will reject a request to reclassify a multiple-dwelling as a single family house. But if the purchase is made midyear, the new owner may well have to lay out higher taxes until the classification is adjusted. It doesn't matter if the new owner continues to maintain one or two rentals, since one- to three-unit homes are all in the same tax class.
But before an owner can legally do things like removing the sprinkler system required by multiple-dwelling fire-code laws, it is necessary to reclassify the building.
A thorough structural inspection (including front stoops and cornices) is essential. An owner must not only make sure the roof and foundations are sound, but also look for any lead in the pipes or the wall paint, and for asbestos anywhere.
FINALLY, there is the renovation itself. As many proud new owners have discovered, a house with a sound structure does not necessarily mean it is in move-in condition. "Once you start exploring, poking behind walls, checking the electricity, it all starts to unravel," Ms. Haar said. "Don't even bother following the original plumbing lines."
Then there are all those kitchens to be removed (to say nothing of that rarity in New York, too many bathrooms), and sometimes even an institutional stairwell to completely redesign.
In Ms. Halbright's case, the absence of original detail was liberating. "We have contemporary taste and were perfectly happy to be faced with no dilemmas about what to keep and what to modernize," she said.
The freedom to relocate the kitchen and bathrooms wherever it suits the family can also turn out to be an advantage. And while renovation can easily double the original price, modernization (including the creation of double-height spaces), often turns out to be far more economical than attempting to salvage and restore the original.
While a huge renovation may be necessary, total gutting may not. Gilles Depardon, a Manhattan architect who has done several conversions, recently worked on turning a former single-room-occupancy hotel into a family town house. The former owners and tenants lacked the money to rip out or even alter much of the original detailing, which remained gloriously intact under a single layer of paint.
Ms. Stiassni's 1895 town house had been converted to a boardinghouse in the 1930's, then preserved by many layers of paint. "The first people we brought in were paint-strippers, who would call me excitedly every day to announce they'd found mahogany paneling in one room, cherry in another and oak floors everywhere," she said. She managed to keep her renovation within reason by dealing directly with most of her sub-contractors and sticking to the bare essentials: redoing the roof, the plumbing, the electricity and the kitchen. Even so, she admits, it was all-consuming work that demanded constant supervision and a willingness to make 1,001 decisions a day.
As Ms. Haar said: "You have to have money, a strong stomach and a real interest in finding the right replacements for every single door knob." But looking out into the garden on a sunny afternoon through the double-height windows of her huge, ground-floor modern kitchen, or savoring the new stairway that curves up to a parlor floor laden with Victorian detailing, it is easy to see that hers is a home that has been infused not only with heart, but with guts as well.

Partners in Crime?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The defense attorney could not have presented the choice to the jury more plainly: Are you to take the word of David Hale, an admitted crook, or will you believe the sworn testimony of the President of the United States?
The answer was in the ringing verdict of guilty. The reason twelve good Arkansans and true ignored the President and believed the crook is not that they held any animus toward Mr. Clinton, their former Governor, but because detailed documentary evidence supported the prosecution's case against the Clintons' Whitewater partners. 
 The jury also believed Hale's associate, who confessed he had told an appraiser to inflate the value of property because "this goes all the way to the top" -- to Governor Clinton. Not yet proven is Hale's charge that Clinton leaned on him to lend $300,000 in taxpayers' money to the Clintons' partners.
That money was supposed to be used only to help the "economically disadvantaged," but a large chunk was used to buy property for Whitewater Development. If the Clintons knew about this abuse -- and we have seen how avidly Mrs. Clinton was interested in their nest egg -- then they would be accomplices in stealing $50,000 from the poor.
Why is Jim Guy Tucker, the man Bill Clinton chose to succeed him as Governor, central to the looming case against the Clintons? Because he knows too much and may not want to spend 10 full years in jail for mail fraud and conspiracy.
When the New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth first started poking into this mess four years ago, Susan Thomases -- the lawyer assigned to keep the story under wraps -- told him "Jim Guy Tucker raised the flag for us about James McDougal." When Gerth followed up with written questions about McDougal's subsidy of the Clintons' share of the Whitewater investment, Thomases noted on the reporter's letter "BC tells me to call Tucker." 
Asked by Senate committee counsel, "Why on earth would you be calling Jim Guy Tucker about questions relating to Whitewater?" Thomases stonewalled, "I don't know, and I don't remember calling Mr. Tucker." On Oct. 6, 1993, a week after the famed "heads up" from Treasury improperly alerted the White House to criminal referrals that might involve the Clintons, Governor Tucker met with President Clinton in D.C.
After the verdicts were announced, Mr. Clinton, to his credit, did not hide; he came out to tell reporters that "on a personal level, I'm very sorry for Governor Tucker" and the others. (He did not call Tucker, who resigned his office, a quitter.)
A new grand jury has been empaneled in Little Rock, presumably to hear from the three newly convicted partners and associates of the Clintons, as well as the nine others who have copped guilty pleas from the Independent Counsel in return for their cooperation. Another petit jury will soon try a couple of bankers who are charged with slipping cash to the Clinton campaign and who wound up with a patronage plum.
At some point, apologists for the President will have to stop calling Whitewater "a cover-up without a crime." We have just seen an impartial jury nail 24 crimes to people in business or political partnership with the Clintons.
Their four-year cover-up, now being systematically shucked, had a clear purpose: to deter press inquiry and to hinder official investigation into the swamp of corruption that spawned their political rise. The Clintons do not deserve to be castigated for being paranoid about minor embarrassments; they have good reason to hide their proximity to, if not participation in, real fraud.
Obstruction of justice in Washington is a higher crime. It may involve evasion of subpoenas, lying to a government agency and perjurious testimony. Asked what next, the vindicated Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr said only, but ominously, "The Washington phase of our investigation is very active."
Whitewater could get too serious for partisan pleasure. If this is not resolved soon, and if Clinton wins re-election, the nation will be risking one of those awful second terms. Come August in Chicago, some Democratic conventioneer may dare ask the President to "flip the ticket" to a more electable, less vulnerable Gore-Clinton.

Promotional sweepstakes are winning the day, and the payouts are now bigger and bigger.

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
MAKE way, Publishers Clearing House. The Shell Oil Company is now running its biggest promotion ever, with a million-dollar grand prize. And last week the Coca-Cola Company began its Red Hot Olympic Summer promotion, which it called the largest in the company's history, offering $81 million worth of prizes.
As for McDonald's, it offered not one but three million-dollar prizes recently in its Monopoly promotion, surpassing the Disney Video Masterpiece Trivia Challenge, which offered two cash prizes of $1 million apiece. 
 Why the promotional big bucks? "The day when you could offer a $5,000 prize is over," said Fran Caci, chairman of the Promotion Marketing Association of America, a national trade association of 700 promotional companies. "These days you have to offer $100,000 and more to get any attention at all."
Jackpot inflation "is the consequence of lottery fever," Ms. Caci said. "Now 39 states have lotteries, their prizes have gotten huger and huger, and promotions have had to follow suit. Also, America's general fascination with gambling is contributing to the popularity of promotions. People have found that they like to win."
The Shell game, which Ms. Caci believes to be the largest ever for a gasoline company, is called Fast Cars, Fast Win, offering a total of six million prizes, including a grand prize of $1 million. Industry executives have estimated that Shell is spending $20 million on the entire promotion, including nearly $10 million in advertising, which will be managed by Ogilvy & Mather in Houston, a unit of WPP Group.
For years, "promotions were looked at as a short-term fix to give a boost to sales." Ms. Caci said. "But now the most successful promotions are part of long-term strategies that involve image-building for brands and companies."
For example, Shell's television and radio promotional image-building involves tie-ins with the company's racing investments. Not only does Shell sponsor Bobby Labonte, the Nascar driver, and Bryan Herta, the Indy race-car star, but it also sponsors Craig Breedlove, who will try to drive faster than 700 miles an hour and break the world land speed record in a Shell vehicle next fall.
At the McDonald's Corporation, the philosophy in mounting this winter's Monopoly promotion was to "double the prize pool" of its sweepstakes of a year ago, "which was a great success," said Dean Barrett, the company's vice president of marketing. On June 7, McDonald's will announce a new Monopoly game, a tie-in with its Arch Delux hamburger; that promotion will offer two cash prizes of a million dollars each.
And in the Coca-Cola promotion, which will run through Aug. 4, packages of the company's soft drinks will carry inserts offering $1.6 billion worth of merchandise discounts as well as prizes. The Southfield, Mich., office of W. B. Doner & Company created the advertising campaign.
Many companies "are paying more in advertising dollars to support these promotions than ever before," Ms. Caci said.
But television spots for promotional campaigns are especially demanding because they "must make people want to say 'wow,' " said Bryan Harding, a partner at Ogilvy & Mather in Houston, the agency handling the Shell promotional account. Such advertisements "have to be fun, interesting and exciting."
The Shell extravaganza has both components of successful game promotions: "scratch and win" instant notification, as well as a "collect and win" portion, in which customers collect a series of game pieces that make them eligible for grander prizes.
To participate in the Shell promotion, customers (or noncustomers, since no purchase is required) can ask at any of 6,000 participating Shell stations for a game piece -- a sealed paper packet that when opened at its perforations yields a small printed stamp that announces whether the customer is a winner. If the stamp says "Instant Winner" and depicts a prize, the customer can redeem gifts ranging from $1 worth of gasoline to a 1996 Corvette.
But if the stamp says "Collect and Win," consumers are instructed to paste the stamp on slick-paper game boards given out by Shell dealers. Collecting stamps makes consumers eligible for prizes ranging from a free tank of gasoline to $1 million.
The promotion at Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, may serve to distract customers from the high prices at the pump, which have already become an issue in the Presidential campaign and the subject of a Federal investigation. But Shell managers said the advent of the contest at the time of rising gas-prices was a coincidence, since the promotion was planned long before the price of gasoline began to surge.
"No one likes to see prices increase on anything," said Caryn Crump, the brand positioning manager for Shell, "but at least, thanks to the promotion, we can offer customers something when they come in to Shell, and we hope they'll feel good about Shell when they leave." She added that the growing price at the pump "has not had a dampening effect on Shell's promotion."
And the price of such promotions may also be heading higher. "The way things are going," Ms. Caci of the Promotion Marketing Asscoiation said, "perhaps even the million-dollar prize will become passe."

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole's Health-Care Task

 BODY:
Bob Dole says he wants to pass health-care reform before he steps down as majority leader and leaves the Senate next month. The task will not be easy. Bills passed by the House and Senate would perform a valuable service by requiring insurers to offer coverage to workers who lose or quit their jobs, a requirement known as portability, though nothing in these modest bills guarantees that coverage would be affordable for individual workers. But Congress is hung up over three ideology-laden provisions added to one bill or the other. Mr. Dole has yet to resolve the wrangling.
The House bill would enshrine a favorite conservative remedy, the so-called medical savings accounts. The bill would provide a tax break for money deposited into these special accounts and the money would be used to pay routine medical bills. The owners of these accounts would cover their large medical bills by buying a high-deductible, or catastrophic, policy. 
 Proponents say the accounts will discourage wasteful care because individuals will be aware of each dollar they spend. But the accounts will probably do little to discourage waste because an overwhelming percentage of medical expenditures are accounted for by the 15 percent or so of the population that rack up huge bills and therefore are well beyond the deductible of their catastrophic policies. Even worse, medical savings accounts will siphon healthy patients out of the market for traditional coverage, leaving a concentrated pool of sick applicants who will be forced to pay sky-high rates for ordinary coverage.
Mr. Dole knows he cannot push the savings accounts, which conservatives love as a government-free solution to health reform, past a Presidential veto. Some in his party are willing to settle on a demonstration project. Demonstration projects of an untested idea make sense. But President Clinton ought to be wary. For a demonstration project to provide a valid test, it would need to last at least six years -- enough time to watch how healthy people who own the accounts react when they become sick. Will they junk catastrophic coverage? Will they save money after sick years balance out healthy years? Will they forgo preventive care, driving them to high-cost specialists? Shorter periods would not suffice because more than 85 percent of the population are healthy at any one time and would not need to dip far into their tax-subsidized deposits.
Another obstacle to compromise concerns purchasing pools, a sensible way for small employers to join to negotiate discounts with hospitals and physicians. The Senate would encourage such small-employer pools, but keep them under strict state regulation. The House bill would unwisely create loopholes through which small employers could escape government oversight, even state monitoring of solvency and grievance procedures.
The third obstacle is the Senate's well-meaning provision to require insurers to cover mental illness on a par with other conditions. Americans do need adequate coverage of mental illness. But the hastily adopted provision would create major economic problems that will probably doom the measure to defeat. The provision is likely to boost insurance costs by as much as 10 percent and drive employers to drop coverage of 400,000 workers.
The Senate is right that health-care policies should include adequate coverage of mental illness. But the proper way to achieve that goal is for Congress to appoint a commission to come up with a cost-effective package of federally defined basic health benefits. Piecemeal mandates, conceived in haste, are likely to produce unintended adverse consequences.
The only bill that has a realistic chance of passing Congress and getting past the White House is one that sticks close to the Senate bill but forgoes mental-health parity until another day. This is an obvious compromise for Mr. Dole to seize.

HEADLINE: Democracy Denied in Albania

 BODY:
Albania, Europe's poorest country, suffered for decades under a fanatical strain of Communism. Now it seems to have graduated to a harsh form of post-Communist governance.
The Albanian economy, no longer sealed off from the world, has begun to revive and the old ideological tyranny has eased its grip. But last Sunday's deformed parliamentary elections make clear that democracy in Albania remains a distant dream. A new dictatorship may be in the making under the authoritarian rule of President Sali Berisha. 
 International election observers reported seeing stuffed ballot boxes, altered ballots and an intimidating presence of armed security forces and secret police at polling places. On Tuesday, riot police beat opposition demonstrators in the capital city of Tirana. The intimidation came despite the fact that Mr. Berisha's misnamed Democratic Party was considered a sure winner. Opposition parties withdrew from the election even before the votes were counted.
Yesterday two of the election-monitoring groups, including the nongovernmental International Republican Institute of the United States, condemned the numerous electoral violations. But the Clinton Administration has so far refrained from public criticism.
Mr. Berisha has won Western favor by preaching nonviolence to aggrieved ethnic Albanians living under Serbian rule, and by limiting illegal Albanian migration to Italy and Germany. But by ignoring his assaults on democracy, Washington risks signaling other countries in Eastern Europe that political repression is acceptable. Silence may also invite further abuses by Mr. Berisha that could produce political turbulence and increased migration from Albania. It would be wiser to speak the truth now.

HEADLINE: Dollar Pulled Down by Surge In Pound Against the Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The British pound surged against the German mark yesterday, pulling down the dollar as currency traders sold dollars for pounds.
The sharp rise in the pound was caused by strong demand at a sale yesterday of $4.59 billion of British Government securities, or gilts. 
 "Demand at the bond auction basically popped sterling higher," said Peter Wadkins, who heads interbank currency sales at the Standard Chartered Bank.
Bolstering the pound were expectations that economic growth could encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates this year. Higher interest rates would help the pound by making British bank deposits more attractive.
"We're going to see extraordinarily better economic growth in Britain, which means there's a good chance monetary authorities will raise rates," said James Fitzgibbon, a trader and strategist at ING Capital Markets in New York.
The stronger pound pulled other European currencies higher against the dollar.
"Europe is Europe," Mr. Fitzgibbon said. "When one of the European currencies does really well against the U.S. currency, the others do, too."
The pound rose to $1.5305, from $1.5131 on Tuesday and its highest level in two months. Much of the gain came in late trading in New York. The pound also rose to a 15-month high of 2.3562 marks.
The dollar settled at 1.5360 marks, down from 1.5464 marks. It also slipped to 108.20 yen from 108.85 yen.
The dollar's slide accelerated yesteday as American bonds and stocks tumbled and foreign investors cut their stakes, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 35.84 points at 5,673.83.
Despite the sharp rise in the pound, many traders and investors said they doubted the rally could continue.
The pound has been battered in the last year by concerns over the stability of the Goverment of Prime Minister John Major. The ruling Conservative Party has badly trailed Labor in recent polls. But yesterday at least, those fears appeared to have abated.
"The market has factored in terrible problems associated with the Tory Government being replaced by Labor, but the more Labor talks, the more they sound like the Tories," Mr. Fitzgibbon of ING Capital Markets said.

HEADLINE: On Tobacco Road, A Generation Gap;
Young Farmers Are Questioning The Future of a Lucrative Crop

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: BROWNS SUMMIT, N.C.

 BODY:
Luke Lambeth eyed the neat rows of tobacco shoots on his 150-acre farm and ventured an up-to-the-minute assessment of job security on Tobacco Road. "This life was a lot more stable for my grandfather," he said. "But now you have to think ahead. Because you just don't know how long the tobacco is going to go."
To be sure, the rangy, 32-year-old Mr. Lambeth, a third-generation tobacco farmer, is optimistic about 1996. Despite a late start after a harsh winter and a wet spring, he hopes to have a good crop and fetch an equally good price. 
 But "you never know when your livelihood won't be there," he said. "That's my worry. Because I owe everything I own to tobacco."
Tobacco farmers have often been stereotyped as a monolithic group. But there are deep, generational divisions in tobacco country, where farmers have recently transplanted seedlings from their greenhouse beds into rows in the ground.
The older farmers in this tradition-rich industry seem able to shrug off the assaults on the $45-billion-a-year domestic tobacco business -- the intense regulatory scrutiny; the threat posed by cheap tobacco from Brazil and Africa; the attacks by lawyers and health groups, Congress and the White House.
Younger farmers, though, are more concerned than ever that their way of life is coming to an end -- and with it the fast-vanishing family-farm ethos that was a cornerstone of the rural South.
"There is a generation gap, " said Ferrell Guillory, a fellow at MDC Inc., a nonprofit economic development research company in Chapel Hill, N.C. It is the younger farmers, he said, who "are going to have to manage the transition to the future."
The dismissal last week of a giant class action lawsuit that threatened the solvency of cigarette companies barely lightened the load. "We don't hear much good news, so that court case is an encouragement," Mr. Lambeth said. "But it's not going to make any difference to us growers. The companies will still only pay us a nickel a pack for our tobacco."
That kind of skepticism is just one of the traits that distinguishes the younger generation. According to the first national study of tobacco farmers, younger and older farmers hold quite different views about the long-term uncertainties of tobacco, the need to diversify their crops, and the trustworthiness of American cigarette manufacturers.
The generation gap is especially apparent here in the state that grows two-thirds of the nation's flue-cured tobacco, the heat-dried, golden-hued "bright leaf" that is the aromatic heart of American cigarettes.
Younger farmers in North Carolina "view tobacco as a way of life that may not continue, but they want to stay in it as long as they can," said Rick Apple, 38, who grows 100 acres of tobacco with his father.
But older farmers take a less fatalistic view. "There has been some fight or other about tobacco all my life, and I'm not about to throw in the towel,"said Bruce L. Flye, at 63 a third-generation farmer in Battleboro, N.C. Mr. Flye makes half his income from 85 acres of tobacco and the rest from 1,115 acres of cotton, corn and peanuts. "Tobacco has been here since the 1600's and will continue to be," he said.
"But younger farmers are really concerned," said Mr. Flye, president of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, a grower-supported group that helps administer the Federal quota program that prevents boom-and-bust price swings for growers. "The young ones have more anxiety. Their future is at stake."
Indeed, about two-thirds of tobacco farmers under 45 say they have undertaken money-making ventures to supplement tobacco growing, according to the tobacco study, conducted by the Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, and the Center for Sustainable Systems in Berea, Ky., a nonprofit organization that studies rural development.
The study, of 992 farmers in six states, was completed last fall. The ages of those surveyed ranged from 20 to 70, and a quarter were under 50.
"I have learned that there is life after tobacco," said Mr. Apple, whose ancestors began tobacco farming in the 1700's. Breaking with tradition in 1980, Mr. Apple began growing flowers and ornamental trees in a single greenhouse, grossing $4,000. Now, along with his tobacco, Mr. Apple and 20 year-round employees grow flowers and ornamentals in 30 greenhouses and on 12 acres. His thriving garden center, A & A Plants Inc. in Browns Summit, had 1995 sales of $1.2 million.
According to the study, almost twice as many younger farmers as older ones have increased their income from crops like flowers and ornamentals in the last five years. Indeed, tobacco farmers are supplementing their income with everything from alfalfa-growing to chicken-raising and hog-farming.
But Richard Jenks, whose family has been tobacco farming "since the beginning of time," was one of the older farmers who insisted that diversification was no panacea.
"We have about 10 acres of strawberries in our community," Mr. Jenks said of Apex, N.C., where the 59-year-old farmer grows 16 acres of tobacco. "But if everyone starts planting, you won't be able to give those strawberries away."
He added, "Tobacco, it's the only thing pays the bills." Farmers' profits last year amounted to as much as $1,000 an acre for tobacco, far more than crops like corn ($150 an acre), soybeans ($100) or peanuts ($300).
As a state, North Carolina is far ahead of its tobacco farmers: it long ago diversified and enjoys a 4 percent unemployment rate despite the loss of thousands of tobacco- and textile-related jobs. As recently as 1964, tobacco was a keystone of the economy, accounting for 46 percent of the state's cash farm income. By 1994, that had declined to 15 percent.
Despite that decline, tobacco pumps about $1 billion a year into North Carolina's economy. Farmers here still call it the golden leaf, a single, high-value crop that keeps them on the farm.
But "tobacco is in a slow-motion decline," said Mr. Guillory, the economic development researcher. Despite near-record profits for cigarette makers, the tobacco sector of the farm economy continues to shrink along with domestic cigarette consumption. Nationwide, 674 million acres were planted in 1995, down 10 percent from 1993.
"If farmers knew the international realities, they'd want to get out of the business," said Dr. David G. Altman, an associate professor at Bowman Gray who helped conduct the study of farmer attitudes. "They are living in the past, and the floor is going to drop out beneath them."
That prospect might cheer the growing anti-tobacco forces in a nation where, by Food and Drug Administration estimates, smoking causes 420,000 premature deaths a year. Anti-smoking groups have excoriated them, but tobacco farmers, young and old alike, are overwhelmingly united in wanting to carry on their agricultural heritage.
"It is a legal crop," said Steve Troxler, a 44-year-old farmer who grows 110 acres of tobacco in Browns Summit. "Yet people call us names, they label us pushers. That upsets me more than anything else, because tobacco was a thing of pride. The government gets a lot from tobacco taxes, and tobacco produces plenty of employment."
He added: "The attacks on us are based on ignorance and hypocrisy. They don't know who we are. They don't know how hard we work. Tobacco farmers are the pillars of the community. This is the greatest life style in the world for raising kids and keeping a family together."
Still, the study found that younger farmers are more willing than their elders to acknowledge smoking's risks: 64 percent of the farmers under 45 agreed that smoking is harmful, versus just 47 percent of the farmers over 65.
Nor is their intergenerational agreement among the farmers about the good will of America's cigarette makers. These days, the study found, older farmers like Mr. Flye are more likely to be sympathetic. They "supported us, buying the surplus," he said, referring to a crisis in 1994, when the companies agreed to buy hundreds of millions of pounds of surplus tobacco that had accumulated under the Federal price stabilization program, which celebrates its 50th anniversary June 1.
But 80 percent of the farmers said the purchase of foreign tobacco by American manufacturers was a grave threat to their future, and younger farmers are more outspoken on the subject. Mr. Apple, a former president of the North Carolina Tobacco Growers Association, called the companies' actions "shameful."
He added: "They continually raise their wholesale prices, but they have told the growers to lower their prices. They gave Brazil and Zimbabwe the technological know-how to produce better tobacco because it will increase the supply and lower the price."
Mr. Lambeth, whose license-plate holder reads "Tobacco Pays My Bills," went further: "The companies want to keep us where we barely get by. The only time they go down on their knees to us is when they want us to go to Washington. And that's not right."
The companies are used to criticism from farmers. "Sometimes growers are mad at us, but we are all in this thing together," said Nat Walker, a spokesman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. He spoke of the growers' and manufacturers' "interdependence," and cited the company's $1 billion investment in its modern Tobaccoville plant near Winston-Salem as evidence of the company's commitment to North Carolina. Tobacco companies, however, "have to be competitive offshore, and price has an impact on that."
For now, once again, as tobacco reaches toward the North Carolina sun, the future seems only as long as a season. Mr. Troxler, when asked about what lies ahead, is wary. "In all probability this summer will be too something," he said. "Too hot. Or too wet. Or too dry. Or too cold. Because something always comes along."
But Mr. Flye, when asked to prognosticate, summoned up the optimism of his years. Tobacco "is a weed, a golden weed," he said, in a phrase certain to dismay the tobacco critics, "and weeds are hard to kill."

HEADLINE: Arms Case Taints a Diplomat's Future

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, May 25

 BODY:
After 14 years as a senior staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Peter Galbraith had made all the right connections, so when he was nominated to be Ambassador to Croatia in 1993, he sailed through his hearings and was confirmed with nary a dissent. Even Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican, had nice things to said about Mr. Galbraith, a liberal Democratic activist.
As Ambassador, Mr. Galbraith has raised the bar for anyone who wants to be known as an "activist" diplomat. He has spoken out when other ambassadors would have practiced quiet diplomacy, attended meetings when Croats planned war, argued heatedly with his superiors in Washington when he disagreed with the Balkans policy, or lack of one, and always made sure it was at center stage. Yet, he has survived longer than any other senior Clinton Administration official involved in Balkan policy. 
 A few months ago, the youthful-looking 45-year-old, who is the son of the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, was boasting to friends that he was one of the few political ambassadors likely to find a home in a Dole Administration, should that come to pass. Now many in Washington are saying that another post is unlikely for the irrepressible Mr. Galbraith, even under a second Clinton Administration.
Mr. Galbraith, who is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the House International Relations Committee, has been tarred by the disclosure that the Clinton Administration turned a blind eye to the smuggling of arms from Muslim countries -- including Iran -- to the Bosnian Government. Mr. Galbraith has been accused of everything from going beyond his instructions to running a covert operation.
Some detractors also suggest that Mr. Galbraith, a tireless campaigner for human rights in his years on the Senate staff, has gotten too close to a Croatian leadership often assailed for its treatment of minorities.
The Ambassador denies that he did anything illegal or untoward on Bosnia and bristles at suggestions that he has succumbed to "clientitis" as envoy to Croatia.
What is more, he vigorously defends the Administration's arms policy, arguing that it helped the Bosnian Government obtain the weapons it needed to fend off "genocidal attacks" by the Serbs.
While the heat of the spotlight has made Mr. Galbraith sweat a bit at the moment, he has never shunned the glare, either as a diplomat or in the traditionally backstage role as a Senate aide.
Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's Prime Minister, has publicly credited Mr. Galbraith with securing her release from prison in 1984 through his relentless criticisms of Pakistan's human rights abuses.
A few years later, he was one of the first to report on Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against the Kurds, and his campaigning produced the first sanctions against Iraq, long before the Persian Gulf War.
In pursuit of his causes, he often irritated colleagues and members of Congress, who grumbled that he was a self-promoter.
With the Clinton Administration's policy toward Bosnia adrift in 1993 and 1994, Mr. Galbraith had considerable room for his activism. He played a key role in fashioning the federation between Croatia and Bosnia's Muslim-led Government in early 1994 that ended the war between the two and, however shaky, became the basis for the Dayton peace agreement.
Last summer, when the Croats were planning an attack on Serbian separatists in the Krajina region, Mr. Galbraith sat in on a high-level session of Croatian military officials.
At the same time, he assiduously sought a political resolution, even as senior officials at the White House and State Department were hoping the Croats would deal the Serbs a blow. Emerging from an evening meeting with President Franjo Tudjman, he boldly told the waiting press corps that Serb concessions had averted war.
Before daybreak, the Croats launched their attack.
When Richard Holbrooke became Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs in the fall of 1994, Mr. Galbraith found himself contending with a diplomat equally skilled in courting journalists. Last fall, when an agreement had been hammered out for the eventual return of Serb-held Eastern Slavonia to Croatia -- thus avoiding another war -- both Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Galbraith wanted to take the credit.
From his plane flying to Belgrade, Mr. Holbrooke reached the Ambassador on his car phone and explained that he would hold a news conference in Belgrade. Mr. Galbraith said it was a bad connection, that he was having trouble hearing. Then, he simply pulled the plug on the connection. Upon returning to Zagreb, he held his own news conference.
Mr. Galbraith, who has degrees from Harvard and Oxford and a law degree from Georgetown, has not wanted for attention in Croatia. A Zagreb women's magazine, Gloria, called him "the most charming member of the diplomatic corps" and ran a photograph of him aboard an 11-meter sailboat with his crew -- four female foreign correspondents.
Mr. Galbraith is about to leave the ranks of eligible bachelors. In June, the Ambassador plans to marry a prominent Norwegian anthropologist, Tone Bringa, whom he met when she was here working for the United Nations.
One Croatian critic, Zharko Puhovski, a member of the Helsinki Human Rights Committee in Croatia, asserted that Mr. Galbraith has been "a bit more pro-regime than pro-rights of minorities and freedom of the media."
It is a charge frequently leveled against ambassadors, but Mr. Galbraith said it does not apply to him.
He points to last summer, when he joined a convoy of 100,000 Serbian refugees whom the Croats had forced to flee the Krajina region. After duly alerting journalists, he made a public show of support for the Serbs. It was an extraordinary scene -- the American Ambassador in his proper dark suit riding behind a tractor on a flat bed trailer piled with possessions and refugees. The move was scathingly criticized by Croatian officials and the pro-Government press.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
An economist sees a brief but fierce '97 slump. Others don't.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
BORED with namby-pamby economic forecasts that all come out the same? Take a look at the prognostications of Richard F. Hokenson, chief economist of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
There is certainly nothing conventional about Mr. Hokenson's forecast of a brief but fierce recession in 1997 that generates genuine price deflation for the first time since the 1950's. The consequence of that forecast? Interest rates drop by a stunning three percentage points and the Dow plunges below 4,000. It sounds as if we should be afraid, very afraid. But Mr. Hokenson also predicts that this recession will be a harbinger of a very different world to come -- a more productive world where adjustments to economic shocks largely come through changes in prices rather than in output and employment. 
 Forecasts of output, inflation and unemployment are generally similar because they are based on common assumptions about what drives the economy and how Government policy makers will respond. Mr. Hokenson's is very different precisely because it does not depend on the conventional wisdom.
Start with the proximate cause of economic downturns. Where others see the postwar recessions largely as the product of oil shocks and miscues in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, he focuses on demographics -- largely the rate of household formation, which influences demand for big-ticket consumer goods including houses, cars and appliances.
As a practical matter, Mr. Hokenson argues, the number of Americans reaching age 25 is a good proxy for household formation. Modest, steady growth in the numbers of "new" 25 year olds in the 1993-96 period, he says, yielded a better-than-expected rate of economic growth. But by the same token, he predicts, the sharp falloff (to 3.6 million from about 3.8 million) in 1997 will set off a recession.
That is interesting, if not mind-bending. What comes next, though, should turn a lot of heads. In the formal computer simulations of the economy that lie behind nearly all forecasts, prices are sticky. "The best predictor of next year's inflation is this year's inflation," explains Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. In Mr. Hokenson's new economic world, by contrast, sellers will respond to falling demand not by cutting production but by cutting prices.
Why? In part, he says, because retailing is so fiercely competitive: the discount chains strive to sustain volume and market share in hard times. But mostly, he suggests, because manufacturers now live in an environment of ever higher fixed costs and ever lower marginal costs. Just as airlines would rather get $25 for a ticket sold at the last minute than fly with an extra empty seat, manufacturers have strong incentives to sustain production in lean times by cutting prices.
In Mr. Hokenson's recession scenario, falling demand led by consumer durables will reduce the total output of goods and services by 2.7 percent between December 1996 and September 1997. But the recession should be relatively brief -- nine months compared with the 11-month postwar average. And since companies will struggle to use their productive capacity, unemployment should peak around 7 percent -- compared with 5.4 percent today -- far less than one might expect.
The biggest shock in the forecast would be the 1 percent deflation in 1997 that Mr. Hokenson predicts, down from a 3 percent inflation rate expected in 1996. Mr. Hokenson forecasts that the Fed will allow the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to slip to just 1.75 percent while the 30-year bond rate bottoms out at 4.25 percent. With producers unable to sustain margins, profits would fall by 40 percent, leading, in his forecast, to a 40 percent decline in stock prices.
The bottom line? If you believe Mr. Hokenson is right, sell stocks and buy high-quality bonds.
But beyond the immediate shock to the markets, Mr. Hokenson's world is an attractive one in which stockholders bear the risk of recessions instead of workers and the productive capacity wasted during economic downturns is minimized.
Should one take this forecast seriously? Mr. Gordon does not make it easy. A recession caused by demographic changes, he argues, is "inherently improbable" because they are likely to be anticipated by both producers and policy makers.
He also dismisses the assertion that flexible prices will buffer the impact of demand shocks on employment. The wider opportunities in the global market and the shift of the economy toward labor-intensive services, he notes, push in the opposite direction, reducing business incentives to cut prices to sustain output.
At the very least, though, the Hokenson scenario forces a second look at forecasting as usual. If the American economy is indeed changing fundamentally, it stands to reason that it will respond to the next bump on the growth path in unexpected ways. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Reopen Trade Talks With China on Piracy Issue

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it would send trade negotiators to Beijing next week after the Chinese Government offered to reopen talks on Chinese piracy of American movies, music and software.
The talks are scheduled for next Thursday and Friday, a week and a half before the June 17 deadline set by the Administration for deciding whether to impose sanctions on up to $3 billion worth of Chinese imports because of the piracy issue. 
 The negotiations are likely to be just the next act of brinksmanship in the days leading up to the deadline and the possibility of a trade war. The Chinese have already promised to retaliate if the United States imposes 100 percent tariffs on a range of Chinese clothing, textiles and electronics.
The American negotiating team is to be led by Lee Sands, the assistant United States trade representative for Japan and China.
The United States is demanding that China live up to an agreement made last year that cracks down on production of counterfeit compact disks, CD-ROM's, videocassettes and other intellectual property. The Chinese Government has said that it is committed to stamping out the piracy.
"We expect China to take action against the pirate CD factories, intensify efforts to stamp out the rampant piracy in Guangdong province, improve enforcement at the border against illegal exports of CD's, CD-ROM's and other products and open its markets to U.S. intellectual property-based companies and products," the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said in a statement.
"China must now act decisively on these issues," she said.
The Chinese Government, fully aware of the lure of its huge market to American companies, has continued to exploit splits in American business over how far the Clinton Administration should go to protect copyrighted material at the possible expense of manufacturing and consumer-goods industries.
For the last several days, there have been reports in China that the Government has decided to bar the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. from building any further plants in the country. American officials said they knew nothing about the reports.
But Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said tonight that while the company had not had formal notification from the Chinese Government, it was inclined to believe local news accounts of the decision that have been relayed to Atlanta headquarters by Coke employees in the region.
But he said that seven plants already approved by China for construction between now and the end of 1997 would not be affected.
"We don't see any change in the next two years, at least in our bottling business," Mr. Donaldson said. Coke has 16 plants in China.
Pepsico officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
Next week's negotiations will be playing out as Congress prepares to debate whether to renew China's preferential trade status. Although renewal of most-favored-nation status for China is supported by both President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, the outbreak of a trade war could be expected to galvanize China's many critics in Congress.

HEADLINE: Health Plans In New Jersey Face Rivalries

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
New Jersey's fiercely competitive health insurance market will soon become even rougher. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey yesterday agreed to merge with Anthem Inc., a big, diversified Midwestern insurer. The merger will create the nation's second-biggest holder of Blue Cross and Blue Shield franchises.
The deal will help give New Jersey Blue Cross, which already covers 1.9 million residents, the financial heft to slug it out in the managed-care market with the likes of U.S. Healthcare, Prudential and Oxford Health Plans. 
 The combined company would have more than $9 billion in combined annual revenues. That would help the Newark-based Blue Cross company finance the costs of moving thousands more New Jersey residents into health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans that help employers slow the growth of health costs. Managed-care networks are costly to organize and to run, requiring extensive gathering and monitoring of costs, doctors' records and medical results.
There are 26 health maintenance organizations in New Jersey, and the new company hopes to grow even bigger by luring some into additional mergers, said William J. Marino, chief executive of New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
Mr. Marino said 400,000 more managed- care enrollees could be added over the next few years to the 750,000 currently in the Blue Cross H.M.O. and discount network of doctors and hospitals. He said that could bring more jobs to Newark, which will be the administrative headquarters of Anthem East, the regional division that he will head as president.
"Managed-care systems are very labor intensive," he said. "The capital we now have access to will give us the systems, people and geographic expansion we'll need."
The chairman and chief executive of Anthem, L. Ben Lytle, said the company's main source of capital was long-term borrowing, which is less expensive than raising money by issuing stock in its investor-owned unit, Acordia Inc. Banks disdain many Blue Cross companies as too risky too get loans at low rates, Douglas Sherlock, a Philadelphia-based managed-care analyst, said. But Anthem has a strong cash flow and "a very supportive bank group," Mr. Lytle said.
One big battlefield will be the Philadelphia suburbs, where the New Jersey and Delaware Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans last week announced a merger agreement. Big competitors in that market include U.S. Healthcare, based in Blue Bell, Pa., and Independence Blue Cross, based in Philadelphia.
U.S. Healthcare has more than 500,000 H.M.O. members in New Jersey. Blue Cross trails with 220,000 in H.M.O.'s plus 270,000 in a type of managed-care plan that lets enrollees choose an outside doctor if they are willing to pay for the privilege.
Anthem could help New Jersey Blue Cross not only with financing but also with managing claims and other administrative functions. But linking Anthem, based in Indianapolis, with New Jersey Blue Cross will provide "only limited operational synergies," Mr. Sherlock said. Both the delivery of health care and marketing to employees and individuals are essentially local activities that can vary from city to city.
Anthem has Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Indiana, southern Ohio and Kentucky, as well as the big publicly held insurance brokerage unit, Acordia. It has given its various units considerable autonomy, Mr. Sherlock added.
The merger deal is part of a consolidation trend sweeping health care from insurers to hospitals to physician groups, noted Leonard D. Schaeffer, chief executive of Wellpoint Health Plans, a big investor-owned managed-care company that grew out of Blue Cross of California.
"But bigger only means better if you get some economies of scale," he said.
The president of the Medical Society of New Jersey, Dr. Anthony P. Caggiano Jr., had a different concern. He said the merger could be the latest example of "the hostile takeover of the health profession by corporate America," in which the welfare of patients becomes secondary to profits.
"If you stay as a mom-and-pop organization, you're going to get destroyed," said Dr. Caggiano, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Glen Ridge.
New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it would change from its longstanding status as a nonprofit entity to a mutual insurance company, which would be owned by its policyholders, as Anthem is. The deal is subject to approval by the New Jersey insurance department and by the policyholders of both companies.
Mr. Marino said that New Jersey Blue Cross would be a nonprofit subsidiary of Anthem, and that therefore it would not be obligated to repay New Jersey taxpayers for decades of subsidies for the plan.
Mr. Marino said New Jersey and Delaware customers would keep their Blue Cross cards in the new setup. He said rates would be stable, while the parent company would see savings from improved electronic claims processing and patient management systems.
Richard Sinni, a principal with Buck Consultants who advises employers, said New Jersey Blue Cross had already begun "to turn the corner" after having been disorganized a few years ago. Last year, the company won the business of 300,000 state employees, providing the majority of the 557,000-member increase in Blue Cross plan enrollment nationwide.
Mr. Marino, a former executive with Prudential, which is also based in Newark, recruited a management group from his former employer. Indeed, Mr. Sinni noted that the reborn company was nicknamed Pru Cross by consultants and industry executives.
New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield ended 1995 with a surplus of $32 million, bringing its reserves to $188 million. Anthem reported a 1995 loss of $98 million -- of which $65 million was related to the 1995 merger with the Community Mutual Insurance Company, a Cincinnati-based Blue Cross and managed care company.
Anthem, which has its own discount health network in California, Florida and other states as well as a property and casualty insurance company, has 800 New Jersey employees of its own, based in Piscataway.
Mr. Marino will also be a senior vice president and board member of the enlarged Anthem, which will have an 18-member board dominated by 14 members from Anthem.

HEADLINE: Mirage Resorts Says It Plans Three More Casinos in Atlantic City

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
With gambling revenues in Atlantic City reaching a record high last year, an executive with Mirage Resorts said yesterday that the company was working on deals to add three new casino resorts to the city, in addition to the 2,000-room resort the Mirage company already has approval to build there.
Richard Bronson, the president of Mirage's development subsidiary, said he expected to sign an agreement in a matter of days with Boyd Gaming Corporation to build a $500 million resort with 1,500 rooms next to Mirage's planned resort in the city's Marina district. The Mirage resort is expected to cost about $750 million. 
 Mr. Bronson also said that negotiations were under way with other companies to build two casino-resorts, one on the same 168-acre tract where the other two are planned and the fourth on land across the street.
There are now 13 casinos operating in Atlantic City, according to Bradford S. Smith, the chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. The Trump World's Fair casino, which is part of the Trump Plaza, opened this month. And last month, MGM Grand announced that it would spend $700 million to build a new casino resort in Atlantic City.
Mr. Smith said the business climate in Atlantic City could easily absorb the new casinos.
"I don't think we're close to a saturation point," he said. "We're in the middle of the largest population center in the United States, and it's a high-income area."
He said that gross gambling revenue in Atlantic City grew by 9.5 percent last year, to a record $3.75 billion.
Mr. Bronson said the casinos being planned would be "full-blast destination points with casino, entertainment, retail; not just gambling." The Mirage resort in Las Vegas, built by the company's chairman, Stephen Wynn, is known for such attractions as an erupting volcano and live tigers.
Mr. Bronson said he felt confident about the economic potential for casino operators in Atlantic City, and said he thought business there would ultimately be constrained not by the city's financial limits but by the limited land available for development.
Mr. Bronson said of the four casinos planned for Atlantic City, that Mirage would operate its own hotel, that the Boyd company would operate the casino that would be built as part of a joint venture, and that the other two casinos would be owned and operated by other companies.
Mr. Bronson said the Mirage company was waiting for a final commitment from the Governor's office about whether the state would build a road to the Mirage tract. The estimated cost is $330 million.
But some of Mirage's competitors, most notably Donald Trump, are objecting to state financing of the road.
"We strongly object to a private driveway built with taxpayers' money," said Alan Marcus, a spokesman for Mr. Trump. "We don't object to the building of casino hotels. It's good for the city and it's great for the state and it's going to be great for us."
Mr. Marcus said the Mirage company was trying to create a monopoly in Atlantic City's Marina district that would pull business away from the casinos on the city's boardwalk, and that he did not think the state should subsidize the effort.

HEADLINE: Report Is Skeptical of U.S.-Backed Home Mortgages

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
A report to Congress raised questions today about whether the Government should continue to provide financial benefits to two private companies established by the Government to make mortgages more readily available to low- and middle-income home buyers.
The report, by the Congressional Budget Office, is certain to intensify a long-running debate over whether the companies, known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should retain an implicit Government guarantee of the debt securities they issue in their role of purchasing home mortgages from lenders and selling them to investors. 
 The implied guarantee lowers financing costs for the companies and helps push down rates for the mortgages they acquire -- generally on homes costing no more than $207,000 -- thereby making home ownership more affordable.
But some members of Congress have expressed concern that the financial guarantee provided by the Government, although somewhat hedged, could leave taxpayers financially responsible for a huge-scale bailout if either company ran into a financial crisis.
Lawmakers have also questioned whether the mortgage markets had changed so substantially in recent years that the roles played by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could now be fulfilled just as well by other financial institutions that operate without any Government guarantees.
And they have questioned whether private companies that made substantial profit for shareholders and paid large salaries to their executives should receive Government assistance.
In its 45-page report today, the Congressional Budget Office stopped short of recommending that the implicit guarantee be withdrawn. But it argued that there was little justification for continuing it.
"Improving access to mortgage finance may have been a social benefit worth paying for in the past," the report said. "It is now available without subsidy from fully private firms."
The report valued the implicit guarantees enjoyed by the companies at $6.5 billion last year, although this involved no actual outlay of money. The value of the lower mortgage rates for homeowners as a result of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was $4.4 billion, leaving the companies to retain $2.1 billion last year.
Fannie Mae, formally the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, are "a spongy conduit" for Federal subsidies, the report said, "soaking up nearly $1 for every $2 delivered."
Executives from the two companies harshly assailed the report, saying that it was flawed in its calculations and that it failed to understand the role they play in the mortgage markets.
"This is the work of economic pencil brains who wouldn't recognize something that works for ordinary home buyers if it bit them in their erasers," said David Jeffers, vice president for corporate relations at Fannie Mae.
Mr. Jeffers said the companies had efficiently passed their financing advantage along to home buyers, citing a quarter-point to a half-point advantage in the interest rates for mortgages, a direct benefit, he said, from participation in the market, compared with loans not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
And he said that more than 70 percent of Fannie Mae's earnings each year were applied to building its capital base -- its buffer against possible losses. With capital of $13 billion, he said, Fannie Mae was capable of withstanding immense financial shocks without putting the taxpayer at risk.
Anne Schnare, senior vice president for corporate relations at Freddie Mac, said the company was "extremely disappointed" with the Congressional Budget Office's report.
"We don't think this study would pass the scrutiny of anybody familiar with the industry," Ms. Schnare said. "It displays a total lack of regard for consumers and an indifference to the impact that removing our charter would create."

HEADLINE: Feeling Devalued by Change, Doctors Seek Union Banner

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: COCOA, Fla.

 BODY:
With the spread of managed-care companies and their efforts to contain costs, many doctors say they are losing control over working conditions, treatments and incomes. In response, some are taking a most uncommon step to protect their interests. They are joining labor unions.
With typically six-figure incomes, private-practice physicians would seem to have little in common with the toilers of office, field and factory. But as they lose their independence, 4,000 of the white-cloaked stalwarts of free enterprise have taken up the union banner. 
 So far the unionized doctors amount to a tiny number among the 684,000 physicians. But they work in two populous states with dense concentrations of managed-care companies, Florida and California. And as the companies keep spreading, merging and expanding control over health care, the doctors say they expect many colleagues to seek refuge in the unions.
For some it will be a difficult move. "Most doctors are Republicans," said Dr. Duff Sprawls, 47, a hematologist and an oncologist in Cocoa and, now, a union member. "Most doctors' dads were Republicans. They do not see themselves as proletarian. They see themselves as bourgeois."
The doctors have joined two unions that also represent growing numbers of salaried hospital and public-service doctors who have been joining unions for decades, the Florida Federation of Physicians and Dentists in Tallahassee, an affiliate of a big A.F.L.-C.I.O. union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the independent Union of American Physicians and Dentists in Oakland, Calif.
Brevard County, where the Florida union says 107 of 563 private practitioners have enrolled and are paying the $520 annual dues, is a hotbed of union organizing.
"The managed-care organizations have economic power," said Dr. Apolinar A. Henriquez, 42, of Cocoa, an internist and a union organizer. "And we have the power of our group."
As unionists go, the doctors are pretty tame. "I wouldn't strike," Dr. Henriquez said.
The doctors also lack a vital lever of union power. Most unionized workers can set their wages through collective bargaining with employers. But under the antitrust laws that govern businesses, including doctors' offices, physicians who get together to agree on the fees that they charge could go to jail for illegal price fixing.
Many doctors, however, who contract with managed-care companies to obtain patients, now consider themselves so stripped of their independence that they have become de facto employees of the health-care companies. As a result the Florida federation is planning appeals to Washington to obtain the same antitrust law exemptions that some musicians, actors and teamsters' drivers have. Many truck drivers own their businesses -- their vehicles. But they have no control over the rates that they are paid, and they join the teamsters' union, which negotiates their pay.
The unions are helping doctors take on managed-care organizations in other areas.
The president of the Florida union, Dr. Arthur L. Hall, a family physician in Winter Park, near Orlando, cited a typical contract and the changes that the union is negotiating.
The union version gives physicians more freedom to override a company's requirement that surgery patients be admitted to hospitals only on the day of their operations. The union would require that the company state a just cause when terminating physicians' contracts, let them appeal to arbitrators and pay for the costs of arbitration if the physicians win. The companies would also pay costs associated with making available medical records.
The managed-care companies readily acknowledge their power and the threat that they pose to independent physicians who rely on the fees that they charge patients.
The companies' trade group in Washington, the American Association of Health Plans, says 115 million Americans, or 45 percent of the population, are enrolled with the companies.
"Without stating the obvious," the president of the association, Karen Ignagni, said, "we are in a period of tremendous transformation."
In Florida, the medical establishment has no problem with Brevard's prounion agitators. The president of the Florida Medical Association, Dr. Alvin Smith, said, "Those doctors are very, very reputable."
Dr. Hall said the various institutions of managed care -- health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and health insurance companies -- had brought enormous changes in how he conducted his business.
Dr. Hall, 49, said he earned $110,000 a year in 1985 and now made $85,000. He has unprepossessing offices in a plain single-story stucco building just off a busy highway.
The doctor works with seven aides and nurses, with much of the work consisting of processing forms. "Three deal full time with managed-care organizations," Dr. Hall said. "They're submitting claims, resubmitting claims, arbitrating on the phone, negotiating, making appointments with specialists."
Dr. Hall has contracts with four managed-care organizations, including a health maintenance organization that, allocates him $7 a month to care for each enrolled patient.
Rather than stay in business for himself or work under contract with several companies, he could join the staff of an H.M.O. that provides care directly. But in the long run, he said, his income would sink even more.
"I'd be making $110,000 at the start," Dr. Hall said. Then, with management still hammering down costs, he predicted, his pay would be cut in contract negotiations every two years.
"The marketplace has changed," he added. "For years physicians owned the store. Since the advent of managed care, we don't own the store any more. To own the store you've got to be an insurance company. Now we're down to, 'Why does society let these doctors be so rich anyway?' The social and economic status of physicians is going to be very much like teachers."
Under the pressure of managed care, the American Medical Association says, doctors' incomes have begun to fall for the first time, from an average of $189,000 in 1993 to $182,000 in 1994, the last year with available figures.
That decline, the industry says, represents the patients' gain from the shift to more efficient managed care.
Ms. Ignagni of the trade association said beyond controlling costs, the companies were redefining their products. The organizations focus on outcomes -- how healthy they keep their customers -- and not on the prices of treatments.
"It's a different kind of competition," Ms. Ignagni said, "and arguably better for patients."
But doctors here say managed-care organizations, in their zeal to hold down some costs, give many patients short shrift and sometimes spend more than they need.
Dr. Sprawls said that in inducing physicians to increase patient loads, to maintain incomes and, therefore, spend less time on each case, the companies force physicians to prescribe costly testing.
"The more time a physician spends examining a patient," Dr. Sprawls said, "the less you're going to need tests."
But the physicians' bigger complaint is how the companies track them -- the reliability of their diagnoses, the success of their treatments and their use of referrals -- and abruptly shed those doctors who fall short of the organizations' standards.
Rather than join unions to grapple with such practices, tens of thousands of doctors have gone part way toward unionization and negotiating contracts in forming at least 1,500 independent practice organizations, and the two physicians' unions are in the throes of forming their own.
Full-fledged unionization, with physicians allowed all the rights of union members, could depend on the outcome of the appeals that the Florida union plans to make to the National Labor Relations Board to permit physicians to be regarded as de facto employees with no more rights to set their wages and working conditions than automobile workers.
That is a plausible proposition, said Peter J. Kadzik, a lawyer with the firm Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin in Washington and an expert on the unionization of independent contractors like doctors.
"I don't think it's at all quixotic," Mr. Kadzik said, "and it may be very creative. A union is not a bad mechanism under the labor laws to accomplish what they can't under the antitrust laws."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New Concerns About Rates Hit Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices dropped sharply yesterday as the market began to absorb this week's fresh supply of Treasury securities, which comes as investors are concerned that the economy is still expanding at a pace that may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates later this year.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped a full point, to 89 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, from 6.85 percent on Tuesday. For bondholders it meant a loss of about $10 for every $1,000 invested. 
 Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said that yesterday's auction of two-year notes had gone well. But then, he said, the Fed sent up a "trial balloon" in the form of an interview with Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, that appeared on news services. Mr. Alexy said the market interpreted Mr. Broaddus's remarks as indicating that a rate increase could be in the cards, sending the market down. "Within a half- hour, the yield on the two-year went to 10 basis points off its best level of the day," Mr. Alexy said.
Mr. Alexy said that would make the auction today of $12.5 billion in five-year notes more difficult, especially considering that data on initial claims for unemployment benefits and new-home sales, as well as a revision of gross domestic product for the first quarter, will be released.
"That is enough data so that the market needs to be treated with kid gloves, at least until the bidding deadline for the five-year auction," he said.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government-bond trading at Cowen & Company, saw the auction of two-year notes differently, calling it a little disappointing.
Even though the noncompetitive bidding for the note was stronger than expected, "it was not enough to carry an $18.75 billion auction," he said.
"That, coupled with comments by various Fed officials, was perceived to be negative for bonds," he added. "And now the dealers are making room for the five-year tomorrow, and that usually weighs on prices as well."
In when-issued trading, the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.52 percent, up 10 basis points, or one-tenth of a percentage point, from the previous day.
Analysts said there was some early activity in the two-year sector of the market from traders looking to move out of securities with shorter maturities.
The notes were awarded at a high yield of 6.053 percent, up from 5.939 percent last month and the highest since April 8, when the high yield was 6.144 percent.
Margo Evashevski, fixed-income analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, noted that Salomon Brothers had cut the bond allocations in its model investor portfolio to 35 percent from 40 and had raised the cash level to 15 percent from 10, a sign that it expected bond prices to fall. The move came despite comments from a Fed governor, Susan Phillips, in another news service interview, that she foresaw steady economic growth with consumer debt at manageable levels, Ms. Evashevski said.
Despite the sharp decline in bond prices, the market remained within this month's range. "And until next week's employment data," Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said, "most of the market is reluctant to bet that anything more than knee-jerk reactions to headline comments will push the market to the downside."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.902
High Yield . . . 6.053%
Low Yield . . . 5.990%

HEADLINE: Farm Workers Sign Accord With Lettuce Growers, Ending a Long and Bitter Conflict

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SALINAS, Calif., May 29

 BODY:
After nearly 18 years of supermarket boycotts, legal clashes and bitter conflicts in the fields, the United Farm Workers of America and one of the nation's top lettuce growers signed a work contract today, laying to rest one of the oldest American farm labor disputes.
Along with setting out the terms for five years of employment for more than 400 workers who pick Red Coach lettuce, mainly in the Salinas Valley, the agreement appeared to mark the passing of a generation of internecine farmer-laborer fights over California's bounty, labor analysts said. 
 "Things change, life is changing rapidly," said Steve Taylor, president of Bruce Church Inc., which grows Red Coach lettuce. "Businesses that don't change become extinct. And unions are the same way."
When the Red Coach conflict began, Mr. Taylor's father, Ted, was at the helm of Bruce Church, then the second largest lettuce grower in the country, and Cesar Chavez, the farm labor organizer, headed the United Farm Workers, which he had founded.
The dispute that erupted when the two sides could not agree on a contract late in 1978 became one of the nastiest in farm labor history, causing a spate of lawsuits and countersuits, years of boycott activity throughout the country and a long strike. Ten grocery chains stopped carrying Red Coach lettuce because of the boycott.
The agreement signed today provides about 450 workers with a 4 percent raise in its first year, bringing their wages to a minimum of $6.62 an hour, and then raises wages to bring the minimum to $7.23 by its fifth year. It also includes various benefits and a worker pledge not to strike.
Arturo Rodriguez, the president of the union and the late Mr. Chavez's son-in-law, called the new contract "a tremendous tribute to Cesar Chavez's life and work."
Mr. Rodriguez said he believed that the turning point came this February, when an appeals court ruled in the union's favor in a suit by Bruce Church, seeking a damage award for losses from the strike.
Bruce Church, now the third largest lettuce grower in the country, had previously won two multimillion-dollar awards in its suits against the union, but an Arizona appeals court struck them down. Both sides said that ruling made them think again about all the time and resources they had been investing in their labor struggle.
"It became clear we were not moving rapidly toward objectives we had," Mr. Taylor said. "I think the U.F.W. realized the same thing about the same time."
In the view of many labor experts, gaining a contract with Bruce Church was a major triumph for the farm workers after 17 years of stalemate, struggle and acrimony.
"This is a significant moral victory because Bruce Church was one of the most bitter struggles," said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University School. "For farm workers in California, for the generation who went through the whole campaign, it represents a sea change. It shows you can win even against the toughest employer."
Philip Martin, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis, said a major reason for the settlement was the change in leadership at the company and at the union, after the deaths of Ted Taylor and Mr. Chavez. Steve Taylor and Mr. Rodriguez did not bring years of enmity to the bargaining table.
"Ted Taylor and Cesar Chavez got locked in a very bitter battle that was very difficult to solve when both were on the scene," Professor Martin said. "It's a change of leadership on both ends that made this agreement possible."
But labor experts say another factor contributing to the settlement was the renaissance of the United Farm Workers in recent years. After its membership plummeted to less than 20,000 three years ago, from more than 70,000 in the 1970's, it has rebounded to about 25,000.
Since Mr. Rodriguez became the union's president in 1993, the year Mr. Chavez died, he has had success in organizing mushroom pickers in California's Central Coast area around Salinas and Santa Cruz, as well as rose workers in California's Central Valley and winery workers in Washington State.
"For a number of years, the notion among the growers in California was the U.F.W. was in decline, that it had a bleak future and didn't have the kind of public support it once had," said Kent Wong, director of the U.C.L.A. Center for Labor Research and Education. "Developments in the last couple of years have reversed that trend. There is a recognition that they are a force to contend with. Bruce Church saw they weren't going to go away."
In a speech at today's signing ceremony, which was complete with display boxes of lettuce, Mr. Rodriguez, 46, spoke of the "years of pain and suffering" on both sides that were coming to an end.
In a similar enough-is-enough vein, Mr. Taylor, 41, noted after the signing that the labor dispute was older than his children.
Mr. Rodriguez said he believed that, his own role aside, "what people don't realize is that Cesar built a tremendous foundation through the years, not only of medical plans and pension plans that never existed among farm workers, but of leadership he developed among us."
The new $6.62 minimum is considerably higher than the $5.50-an-hour wage that prevails for farm workers in the Central Coast area, agricultural experts said. But at the same time, the new wage is lower, after accounting for inflation, than the $5.25 an hour that the farm workers demanded from Bruce Church in 1979, when the struggle began.
Among the factors that have held down farm workers' wages have been the flood of immigrants into the labor pool.

Pulp Facts
Jarvis Cocker, the leader of the British band Pulp, which is to perform at Irving Plaza on Monday, offered a piece of advice for writing about his band. "Feel free to make up any bits that you want to in your article," he said during a recent telephone conversation. "I'm not bothered. I won't sue you. We don't sue as much over here." 
 This kind of dry wit makes Pulp's latest album, "Different Class" (Island), one of the year's best. In England, where the album was No. 1 last fall, Mr. Cocker has experienced several indignities at the hands of the tabloids. "Ban This Sick Stunt" read the front-page headline of The Daily Mirror after the band printed, on the cover of a single that made fun of rave parties and drugs, instructions for making a paper envelope to store drugs.
 Even in America, Mr. Cocker has been wounded by the media. He was accused of attacking children onstage during Michael Jackson's performance at the Brit Awards, the British Grammys, in February. Upset by what he saw as Mr. Jackson's self-importance, he ran onstage and did a mocking dance before being hauled off by a security guard and arrested. Though a news release distributed by Mr. Jackson's publicity agents claimed that Mr. Cocker had injured the children, a videotape of the ceremony shows that he did not strike anyone, and the charges were later dropped.
"I'm probably going to come over to America, and people are going to think that I'm a child assaulter," Mr. Cocker said.
Though Pulp has been around since 1981, when Mr. Cocker started the band in high school, this is its first tour of America as a headliner. With the recent success of Oasis and the growing legion of Britpop fans here, many people are hoping that Pulp will reach star status in the United States.
It is difficult to say what will happen. "Different Class" has sold only 26,000 copies in this country, but most of Pulp's American concerts have sold out quickly.
"I don't really know that much about America," Mr. Cocker said. "But my songs are about emotions that anybody in any country can relate to. The backdrop is British, but that's where I've been brought up."
The new album "is broader in scope than our others, which were rooted in the north of England," he said. "This one was made possible by my move from Sheffield to London in 1988, to study film making. The whole point of view comes from somebody moving to a capital city, coming into contact with a big cross-section of people and having to view everything through a foreigner's eyes."
Most of the people being viewed on "Different Class" are women. In Mr. Cocker's songs, their husbands are cheated on, their mothers are kissed, their beds tell stories about them. In the last couple of years, Mr. Cocker -- who describes his high school years as those of a gangly, four-eyed misfit -- has metamorphosed into one of England's most unlikely sex symbols. (He was dubbed a "sex god" on the front page of another tabloid.)
"I've always found myself incredibly sexy, though no one else has," he said. "The only reason I'm seen like that is because I write about sex in my songs. Not many people in England do that. Actually, I don't think I'm sexy at all."
Nonetheless, on "Different Class," Mr. Cocker comes across as a suave and cruel Casanova. In the beautiful and elaborate "I Spy," he imagines a plaque being erected at the place where he first touched a girl's breasts; "Underwear," in which a woman has second thoughts about a one-night stand, includes the line, "If fashion is your trade, then when you're naked, I guess you must be unemployed." For effect, Mr. Cocker adds a flirtatious "Yeah?" at the end of his joke. It is one of the many vocalizations (sniffs, hisses and huhs) that he uses to color his lyrics.
"I like to put in all those kind of things," Mr. Cocker said. "It keeps me interested." Then he turned back to Mr. Jackson: "It's a bit like Michael, with his yelps. He likes to get those in every song."
 
The Sound of Departure
R.I.P. Hayman died. Then he came back to life. Then he wrote a song about it. Well, it's not really a song. It's a re-creation of what he says he heard in that nether world. Titled "On the Way . . ." and available from the composer Pauline Oliveros's Deep Listening label (P.O. Box 1956, 601 Broadway, Kingston, N.Y. 12401-0900), it offers 54 minutes of bass-heavy ambience with sliding tones and gentle sound effects on top.
"I wanted to create a sense of infinity," said Mr. Hayman, a composer from Pomona, N.Y. "I liken it to when you walk in a vast space like a cathedral, where there's no music and no sound but you feel the resonance and have an altered state of hearing. When I showed this and played the music at a medical conference for people who had near-death experiences, many came up and said: 'That's it! I've never heard that expressed before.' "
 Mr. Hayman is not the only composer to work with the acoustics of dying. Many New Age tapes include pulsing sounds that are supposed to lull the listener's brain waves into a near-death simulation, and the French minimalist Eliane Radigue has tried to evoke the humming and rolling noises that Tibetan Buddhists believe people hear immediately before death. These sounds, said to be those of the body beginning to disintegrate, as heard on Ms. Radigue's 1990 "Kyema" CD, are actually quite similar to Mr. Hayman's.
Mr. Hayman said his near-death experience occurred in 1989, when he was hospitalized with cardiac arrhythmia. The following year, he began working on an installation in which visitors lie down in a small room where his experience is replicated with a soft, glowing tunnel of light and enveloping sound from multiple speakers.
"Eventually, everyone will have that sensation, I hope, because it was a wonderful revelation," Mr. Hayman said. "There was a great sense of peace that I hope that these digital bits can give a small sense of."
 
A Collaboration
 Polly Jean Harvey, one of rock's most powerful performers, has just completed an album, due for release in the fall. It is a collaboration with John Parish, who plays guitar and percussion in her band. The CD, "Dance Hall at Louse Point" (Island), will not be credited to her band, which she calls P. J. Harvey, but to Polly Jean Harvey and John Parish.
"It's got every kind of extreme in there for me," Ms. Harvey said about the project, for which she wrote the lyrics and Mr. Parish the music. "Within that album of 12 songs is probably the most commercial song I've ever written and the most uncommercial song I've ever written."
 The pair's version of Leiber and Stoller's "Is That All There Is?," written for Peggy Lee, is to be heard in the Julian Schnabel film "Basquiat." Mr. Parish said that he and Ms. Harvey hoped to embark on a short tour early next year, accompanied by the Mark Bruce dance company.

Works Stolen by the Nazis
A long list of paintings, sculptures and art objects confiscated from Jews by the Nazis during World War II was published 11 years ago by the Austrian Government, which had kept the art in a monastery in Mauerbach since the war's end and was offering heirs a chance to claim the works. 
 More than 10,000 items have since been identified and returned, but about a thousand objects remain. Last year, their ownership was transferred to the Federation of Austrian Jewish Communities, in cooperation with the Committee for Jewish Claims on Austria and the World Jewish Restitution Organization.
Christie's announced this week that it would sell more than 1,000 of these works, which were seized from Jewish homes mostly in Austria from 1938 to 1945, on behalf of the Federation of Austrian Jewish Communities. Proceeds from the sale, which will be in Vienna on Oct. 29 and 30, are to benefit both Jewish and non-Jewish Holocaust victims and their families. The sale is expected to make about $3.5 million.
While the Austrian Government says it tried to return the artworks for 11 years, some critics say it didn't try hard enough. "It's the story of the dog that didn't bark," said Israel Singer, chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization and secretary general of the World Jewish Congress. "This sale is an awareness campaign of all the art that was plundered that wasn't returned; it's 50 years too late and 50 years too little."
Walter Greinert, the Austrian Consul General, said: "Yes, it's taken a long time and I am sorry about that, but the Austrian authorities have done all they could. There were three stages of distribution of the Mauerbach goods.
"The first was when the Allied forces handed over many of the art and objects to the Austrian Government to distribute in the late 1950's. Then in the 1960's, the Austrian authorities advertised worldwide asking that the rightful owners claim their objects. Restitution was opened again in the 1980's. We are glad that the problem has been solved to the satisfaction of the Jewish organizations."
Items offered for sale will include 19th-century paintings, Old Master paintings and drawings, as well as carpets, tapestries, furniture, arms and armor, coins and literature. None of the works are of museum quality. Had they been, experts say, they would have been given to a museum by now.
Christie's is forfeiting its usual fees. "We were called in by the Jewish Restitution Organization in 1986 to have a look at the material stored in Mauerbach," Stephen Lash, vice chairman of Christie's in America. "We thought this was a way of righting some wrongs."
The sale is also good public relations for the auction house. Among the important Christie's clients involved in organizing the sale is Ronald Lauder, the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, treasurer of the World Jewish Congress and head of the committee that will oversee the distribution of the sale's proceeds.
 
The Popularity of American Art
So much attention is focused on the Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions, which are a traditional bellwether of the market. But meanwhile, the popularity of American art keeps growing. Last week Christie's had its best sale ever and Sotheby's did well, too. Both auctions, in fact, outperformed the auction houses' evening sales of contemporary art.
"We saw two trends," said Andrew Schoelkopf, who heads Christie's department of American art. "There were new buyers who had never bid at auction before and then there were people buying $100,000 pictures who had previously bought $10,000 ones."
Mr. Schoelkopf also attributes this spring's success to Christie's marketing efforts. For the first time, it advertised in publications like Variety, The Hollywood Reporter and The New Yorker.
Record prices were set at both sales. Of the two auction houses, Sotheby's took in more: its sales totaled $22.3 million. Christie's wasn't far behind, with $19.3 million. The top-selling painting was John Singer Sargent's "Capri Girl," a portrait of Rosina Ferrara that he painted in Capri in 1878. It was estimated to sell for $3 million to $4 million, and brought $4.8 million from an unidentified collector at Sotheby's.
Despite the reported new buyers, those snapping up the most expensive paintings were all seasoned collectors. One was Daniel J. Terra, founder of the Museum of American Art in Giverny. While Christie's refused to confirm the report, American art experts say Mr. Terra was the buyer of its two top sellers: Mary Cassatt's "In the Box" (circa 1879) and John La Farge's "Paradise Valley" (1866-1868). The Cassatt, from the estate of Edgar and Helen Hope Montgomery Scott, brought $4 million, more than three times its $1.2 million high estimate and a record for an oil painting by the artist. The La Farge, a landscape of Newport, R.I., sold for $2.2 million, also a record and well above its $800,000 high estimate. (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect the commission.)
 
 
 
A Two-Week Fair on Broad Street

 The Alliance for Downtown New York, looking to improve the economy of the neighborhood, is holding the Art Exchange Show, a two-week art fair at 60 Broad Street, two blocks south of Wall Street. The show, from Wednesday through June 15, is to include work from 40 New York dealers, including John Good, American Fine Arts and Bravin Post Lee. Bill Arning, the former director of White Columns, is organizing a show called "The Greatest Thing in the World: Oasis vs. Blur and Artists Who Rock."

In a Divided State

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Few elections have meant so much. Israel's voters have called into question the vision of general peace in the Middle East, until now a central policy aim of governments in Jerusalem and Washington.
But the most significant aspect of the election may be what it says about the internal reality of Israel. It shows us an extraordinarily divided society. With about 150,000 ballots still to be counted, Benjamin Netanyahu leads Shimon Peres in the race for prime minister by a scant 21,000 votes. 
 And it is a society very different from the old romantic image of pioneers in kibbutzim, of a secular Jewishness. It is an intensely urban society now, and increasingly influenced by ultra-Orthodox sects. In the newly elected Knesset, religious parties will have more than 20 percent of the seats.
In a sense the voters had a choice between hope and fear: the hope of peace in the process begun at Oslo three years ago, and the fear of terrorism. Judging by seats won in the Knesset, nearly 60 percent of Israelis were more moved by fear.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would probably have won if he had not been assassinated. His blunt speech and reputation for toughness made him a stronger candidate than Mr. Peres, the colleague with whom he finally became friends at the end after years of animosity.
That leads to another point about this election. The big winners were terrorists: Yigal Amir, the right-wing Jewish fanatic who murdered Mr. Rabin, and the four Palestinian suicide bombers who in the name of Islam killed dozens of Israelis this winter. After those bombs Mr. Peres lost 20 points in the polls.
Fear of terrorism trumped what would usually matter so much in a democracy: economic well-being. Since 1992 Israel's economy has grown at the remarkable average rate of 7 percent a year. Unemployment has fallen from 11 percent to 6, despite huge Russian immigration. American and other entrepreneurs have been pouring in investment, especially in high technology.
The economic boom is very much at risk now. Investors want stability above all. They moved strongly into Israel when the beginning of peace with the Palestinians gave Israel an opening to the Persian Gulf states and North Africa.
For the ultimate goal of confident relations with all the Arab world, Israel still needs to make peace with Syria. As long as that is missing, Saudi Arabia and others will hang back. And Hezbollah will flourish in Lebanon.
Prime Minister Peres, with strong support from President Clinton, tried to negotiate a treaty with Syria. He hinted that he was prepared to see the Golan Heights returned to Syrian sovereignty. But the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, would not negotiate seriously.
Mr. Netanyahu said in the campaign that he would seek peace with Syria -- without giving up the Golan Heights. If he believes that will work, as the Duke of Wellington might have said, he can believe anything.
Similarly, Mr. Netanyahu said he would continue the peace process with the Palestinians -- but would end the freeze on Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory. Such a policy would drive Palestinians toward a new intifada, and undermine relations with Arab states.
Some think Mr. Netanyahu could be a Nixon ready to go to China. But unlike President Nixon, he has daunting political obstacles to any real departures from his Likud Party's hard line. His cabinet would include such truculent figures of the extreme right as Ariel Sharon and Rafael Eytan, whose idea of making peace is for Israel to dictate terms.
President Clinton reacted to the election as he had to, saying that he would work with any elected Israeli government. With his own fate at stake in November, he does not want to alienate Jewish voters, many of whom favored Mr. Netanyahu.
But if a Netanyahu government starts planting more settlers in the West Bank, relations with the United States are bound to be under stress. It was settlements that caused the great strain between President Bush and a Likud Government.
One effective restraint on adventurism in the West Bank may be Israeli opinion. For all the skepticism about peace, Israelis increasingly want to separate themselves from the Palestinians. Many pro-Netanyahu voters, interviewed on Election Day, said they wanted what they called the two nations -- Israeli and Palestinian -- apart. That is one premise for peace.

HEADLINE: Farm Program Doesn't Drive Grain Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Free (Not) to Farm" (Op-Ed, May 24), James Bovard raises important issues regarding United States agricultural production policy and its implication for food prices and food security. But the fundamental issue is not the efficacy of the Conservation Reserve Program, which he misrepresents, but the possible transformation of the macro-economics of global grain trade. 
 Having interviewed farmers in the Corn Belt and High Plains over the past 10 years, I can attest to abuses of Government farm programs by a minority of farmers and to the headaches that this complicated regulatory structure created for the majority. As for the reserve program, however, Mr. Bovard's claim that per-acre payments are routinely double or triple local rental rates is simply not true.
The vast majority of land in the program is marginally productive cropland that, if in production, would have resulted in higher surpluses and soil erosion. But increased yields in the absence of the program would have simply increased price support payments by an amount comparable to the cost of the program.
Mr. Bovard may ultimately have the satisfaction of seeing the program dismantled. As Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute has argued with considerable empirical support, China has reached a point in its development where much of its population can afford to eat as Americans do -- a diet based on meat, dairy products, eggs and beer that requires a substantial increase in grain inputs. As predicted by Mr. Brown, China imported 14 million tons of grain in 1995, immediately becoming the second-largest grain importing country behind Japan.
Moreover, the past 10 years have witnessed a trend toward "weather markets," or global price fluctuations prompted by extreme weather conditions in major grain-producing regions. The recent drought in the High Plains is simply one in a string of regional crises.
By now, China's new imports, the High Plains drought and very low global grain reserves have significantly increased grain prices. The central question is whether this portends a long-term trend.
My sense is that because farmers and policy makers have struggled for so long with the problem of excess capacity, there is resistance to acknowledging a new reality in global grain trade. While the release of Conservation Reserve Program land to the forces of the market may temper the effects of burgeoning demand, the time to formulate new international mechanisms for buffering fluctuations in global grain supply has arrived.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Slip on Housing Data, Then Recover

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After faltering in the wake of a strong housing report yesterday, Treasury bonds rallied from session lows to end mixed. Contributing to the rebound was the Government's sale of five-year notes, which was surprisingly robust despite recent comments by Fed officials that have suggested an upsurge in inflation.
The price of the 30-year issue rose 7/32 , to 8813/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 6.92 percent, from 6.94 percent on Wednesday. 
 Government bond prices had been weighed down early as dealers tried to get ready for the Treasury's auction of $12.5 billion in notes, amid investor apprehension about the economy and its implications for Fed monetary policy.
Market participants first had to deal with a Commerce Department report that sales of new homes leaped 6.7 percent in April, far more than expected; additionally, it revised its estimate of home sales for each of the preceding three months.
In addition to the new-home sales report, data were issued yesterday on weekly jobless claims, and the first-quarter gross domestic product was revised downward to a 2.3 percent growth rate from the previously estimated rate of 2.8 percent.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, noted that a sharp drop in business inventories accounted for the entire G.D.P. revision; all other major components showed slight pickups in their first-quarter rates of growth.
"Indeed, this bodes well for second-quarter G.D.P. growth," Mr. Fine said, "as these inventories are in the process of being replenished. But despite the implication for strong second-quarter production, the bond market reacted favorably to the G.D.P. data."
This proved to be rather temporary, he added, as the reported surge in new-home sales immediately raised concerns about inflation. "While many expect the housing sector to slow as the year progresses because of the recent lift in bond yields," he said, "it is clear from the data that this has not happened yet."
Among the main indicators the bond market will consider in the next week, Mr. Fine said, will be the May National Association of Purchasing Management index scheduled to be released on Monday, automoile sales statistics to be released on both Monday and Tuesday and labor-market data due next Friday.
Yesterday Fed officials continued to issue warning flags about rates, making it difficult for the market to regain its balance. At the University of Maine, the Boston Federal Reserve president, Cathy E. Minehan, was reported to have said that inflation pressures could be building, signalling the need to maintain a cautious interest-rate policy. She tied the price pressures to the volatile food and energy components.
Ms. Minehan's comments echoed those of the Richmond Fed president, Alfred Broaddus Jr., and Fed governor Susan Phillips on Wednesday. Some analysts saw the comments as preparing the market for a tightening.
At the Treasury's note auction yesterday, participants were mildly surprised at the aggressive bid, even from the noncompetitive side. Traders said a number of central banks were believed to be solid buyers.
The five-year note auction was awarded at the yield of 6.565 percent, better than the 6.59 percent that had been expected. The yield in when-issued trading ahead of the auction had risen 10 basis points from the previous day's low, a move dealers hoped would entice bargain hunters.
Today, the Treasury plans to sell $7 billion of 7-day cash management bills and $23 billion of 10-day bills through auction to cover the Government's short-term cash needs outside the regular borrowing schedule.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Late Surge Helps the Dollar To Recoup Most of Its Losses

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against most leading currencies yesterday, recovering from early sharp losses as United States stock and bond markets staged a late rally.
The dollar was also bolstered by speculation that the Bank of Japan might buy dollars. 
 The dollar followed the bond market for much of the trading in New York.
"The early bond decline weighed on the dollar," said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ING Capital Markets.
A decision by Germany's central bank to leave interest rates unchanged also dragged down the dollar in European trading, analysts said.
The Bundesbank decided not to lower its securities repurchase rate, disappointing some traders. The central bank instead fixed the rate for the next two weeks at 3.30 percent, where it has been since February.
Lower German rates would hurt the mark by making bank deposits denominated in it less attractive.
"Given the strength of the dollar before the meeting, it seemed a cut was discounted," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "When it didn't materialize, we saw some dollar selling."
The dollar fell as low as 1.5276 marks and 106.68 Japanese yen. After stocks and bonds rebounded, the dollar settled at 1.5344 marks, down from 1.5360 on Wednesday, and at 107.65 yen, down from 108.20. The British pound extended its gains from Wednesday, rising to $1.5340 from $1.5305.
The dollar first moved off its lows early in New York amid speculation that the Bank of Japan might enter the foreign exchange market to buy dollars, traders and money managers said. Bank of Japan officials in New York could not be reached for comment.
"There was talk floating around that the B.O.J. may be in supporting the dollar, and that was enough," said Michael Faust, an international portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif. "The B.O.J. gets enough respect that just the talk led to a nice bounce-back."
The Bank of Japan bought an estimated $20 billion to prevent the dollar from falling in late February, and another $300 million to $500 million last month.
Many traders and analysts, however, doubt the central bank is considering dollar purchases now.
"It's not like there's a run on dollar-yen," said Jack Griffin, manager of currency sales at Fuji Bank. "There's very slim, if any, chance they'd intervene now."

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise After 2 Days Of Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks stemmed a two-day slide yesterday, but the advance was muted by profit taking amid persistent uncertainty about the outlook for inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 19.58 points, to 5,693.41, about 22 points shy of its high for the session but up from a decline of nearly 30 points around midday. 
 Measures of the broader market also ended higher after moving lower early with the bond market. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.77 points, to 671.70. The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.85, to 1,233.48.
The stock market had been concerned about the slump in bonds, which was driving long-term interest rates close to 7 percent -- a level that has spooked the stock market before. Higher rates can mean increased costs for corporate borrowing, slower consumer spending and slimmer profits -- all negatives for the stock market.
But stocks rallied as bargain-hunters emerged.
"The drop encouraged the sideline cash," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "People tend to forget we've added 375 Dow points in three weeks. We've been on a very normal pause to refresh."
The rally gained momentum as bonds recovered after a strong auction of $12.5 billion in five-year Treasury notes. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for many types of loans, backed down to 6.92 percent, from 6.94 percent on Wednesday. The yield moves inversely with prices.
The advance in stocks faltered, however, with the prevailing concerns about a strong economy and an overpriced market.
"The market failed to hold its best gains, presumably on profit taking and the interest-rate outlook," said Eugene Peroni, the director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The stocks that fared well were spread across several sectors. Among the Dow industrials, Exxon rose 1 1/2, to 86 5/8; Boeing rose 7/8, to 85 3/4, and Coca-Cola rose 3/4, to 46 3/4.
Merck led the Dow components, rising 1 1/4, to 65. The company said after the market closed on Wednesday that a study had showed that its Pepcid drug significantly reduced the number of ulcers in arthritis patients who take pain medicine like aspirin for long periods.
The advance in the Dow was restrained by Caterpillar, which fell 1 5/8, to 66 3/8, after the United States Export-Import Bank rejected financing for Caterpillar and other American companies bidding to supply equipment for construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China.
The American depository receipts of a number of Israeli companies fell yesterday after the apparent victory of Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli election for Prime Minister.
A.D.R.'s of Koor Industries, the largest industrial company in Israel, fell 5/8, to 18 1/8. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries fell 1, to 44 7/8, and Gilat Satellite Networks fell 5/8, to 19 1/2. The leading Israeli market index, consisting of 25 issues, fell 4.34 percent, to 214.12.
 Among American stocks, Circus Circus Enterprises rose 2 1/4, to 40 5/8. Both Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley raised their investment ratings on the company. On Wednesday, Circus Circus reported first-quarter earnings that matched analysts' expectations.
Borland International tumbled 3 3/4, to 13 3/8. The company announced after the market closed on Wednesday that it might have an operating loss for its fiscal first quarter.

HEADLINE: For Albanians, in Carts and BMW's, a Hard Road

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, May 30

 BODY:
For Besa Mani, a 17-year-old high school student who watches American soaps, drinks Fanta soda and yearns to be a judge, her country is a confusing place.
For nearly three years, she has walked a few hundred dusty yards to school and retraced her steps back home. She is too scared to go anywhere else. Her father and mother venture as far as the garden gate and no farther. 
 The family is trapped indoors by a centuries-old custom of blood feud that dictates an eye for an eye. Besa's brother shot a man who tried to rape her mother, and ever since the Mani family has feared being killed by the dead man's relatives.
"We can't go out," said Besa, whose modern ambitions contrast with the ancient practices of her mountain region in northern Albania. "Who knows what would happen? The dead man was a bad man. He has a big family. They are everywhere. They have weapons."
Albania, the poorest nation in Europe, sealed off for years by one of the world's most bizarre Communist governments, is struggling to come to terms with the contemporary world.
At the same time that Besa and her family stayed indoors, their neighbors went to the polls in the fourth election that Albania has held since the fall of the Communists in 1991.
But the experiment with democracy on Sunday went awry when the police under the control of President Sali Berisha intimidated voters and then beat opposition party supporters with truncheons in the capital's main square two days later.
Dr. Berisha, supported during his four-year rule by the United States, claimed victory for his post-Communist Democratic Party over a number of opposition groups. International election monitors said the vote was seriously flawed.
There are fears of a return of the deep vein of autocracy that has dominated Albania through the reigns of the Turks, of King Zog before World War II and finally of the hard-line Marxist Enver Hoxha, for whom even the Chinese Communists were too soft.
Switching from a collectivized society to a capitalist one is not proving easy.
When it comes to democratic elections, justice and freedom of the press, Albania has not fared well under President Berisha. But under the tutelage of the World Bank and the United States Treasury, a kind of capitalism -- awash in corruption -- has taken hold. The southern region of Albania has become one big bazaar.
There are probably more Mercedes -- old, battered models that pound the rutted roads -- per capita of population than many other places in the world. In a field outside the seaside town of Durres, hundreds of new and secondhand Mercedes, BMW's and fancy Volkswagens await buyers. The asking price for a new Mercedes stolen from Italy or Germany is $10,000 cash.
Private cars, which under the Hoxha Government were the perquisite of state officials only, now line up bumper to bumper at border posts, for day trips to trade and smuggle.
What is your profession? a border guard asked an Albanian awaiting to enter Montenegro. "Smuggler," the young man said from the window of his car, without the border guard flinching.
But around rural Koplik in the north, where Besa lives and which is the stamping ground of the clan of Ghegs who are thought to have come to the Balkans before the Greeks, the horse-and-cart is still supreme.
Profound mistrust abounds. About 10,000 men are believed to have gone into hiding in northern Albania since the collapse of the Communists. They are afraid, like Besa's father, Sali, that someone will hunt them down and seek revenge for an injustice -- a killing, a land grab, a stolen donkey cart -- deemed to have been committed yesterday or generations ago. Under the Communists, blood feuds were outlawed.
Even if they are dirt poor, Albanian farmers seem to be slightly better off. Land has been returned, although not always to the right owners.
Met Sula, a 66-year-old farmer in the village of Gose, 20 miles south of Tirana, has only a spade and his muscles as implements for his five acres of land where he is now fertilizing young watermelons with cow manure he shovels from the roadside.
"I have my own land now," Mr. Sula said. "It's not my family's old land and it is too far from my house. But it's better than under Hoxha." If he asked for his rightful land back, he would have his pension cut, he said.
The survival of the country, where the per capita income is $600 a year, now depends on three unusual sources of revenue, according to economists.
The first is foreign aid, which the Europeans have given generously as a way of keeping more Albanians from leaving and becoming illegal immigrants to Italy and Germany.
The second is earnings from the 400,000 Albanians who work abroad, mostly in Greece, and send remittances home. And third is contraband, including a high volume of hard drugs that transit through Albania to Western Europe.
In Shkoder, the northern city, new bungalows boasting smart roofs of red tiles imported from Macedonia -- but no indoor plumbing -- attest to the new wealth of the drug merchants.
Privatization of state property has started, although it is often accompanied by corruption that amounts to licensed stealing.
"The most common method of returning property owned before World War II is the following," a young businessman said. "The Government sets a price for the former owner which is prohibitive. The former owner can't afford it. So then the Government says they have offered it, been refused and they offer it instead to the state management at a much lower price."
Religion has been allowed a comeback. Declared an atheist state in the 1960's, Albania was traditionally about 70 percent Muslim, with the rest of the population Orthodox and Catholic.
Dr. Berisha, leaning to the West but looking for help where he can get it, allied Albania with the Islamic Conference. In the last several years, new mosques have been built at a rapid rate. In Shkoder, the biggest northern town, a domed mosque named Ebu-Bekr that is a gift from a Saudi family was opened last year.
So far, Albania's Islam is fairly secular. A fun-fair carousel does brisk business daily just outside Shkoder's mosque.
For Faik Spahia, a 38-year-old builder, the new mosque is a significant benefit. "I finished secondary school and I read lots of books," he said before attending prayer. "But I've never found the truth except in the Koran, which I used to secretly read at home. To me, religious liberty is the most important thing."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Israelis Vote for Peace

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
On Election Day, Benjamin Netanyahu had the support of a substantial majority of Israeli Jews. They included some leftists, plus moderate conservatives, centrists and much of the Orthodox right. This majority voted for peace, not war, with the Palestinians and other Arab peoples. They thought Mr. Netanyahu would be more likely to give them the reality of peace, not a charade of peace, than Shimon Peres.
But the depth and variety of Israeli Jews who supported Mr. Netanyahu and their desire for peace has never been grasped or was ignored by his opponents abroad, from President Clinton on down. 
 For years the opposite has been preached on TV and printed by American and European writers, politicians and academics who had committed themselves to Mr. Peres and the Labor Party. They painted all Israeli and foreign Jews who did not accept the Labor plan for a settlement with the Palestinians as enemies of peace. In the U.S. Bill Clinton openly campaigned for Mr. Peres, violating international conduct and risking Presidential credibility, his strange addiction.
Now that Mr. Netanyahu has won the election except for the counting of absentee ballots -- expected to go in his favor -- it is important to understand how distorted this portrait of Israeli reality was and take it off the wall. Otherwise, achievement of peace will remain far more difficult than it will be if the ideas and hopes of this Jewish majority are decently respected.
Technically Mr. Netanyahu's edge came from a thin majority of the citizens of Israel. That was because 95 percent of Israeli Arabs voted for Mr. Peres. Maybe someday Arabs in Arab states will be given equal voting freedom.
But it is hypocrisy -- worse, fatuous -- not to acknowledge that the election was about the fate of a Jewish state. To work, those decisions must be by a Jewish majority.
More than 55 percent of Jews voted for Mr. Netanyahu. They did so despite Mr. Peres's whopping advantages -- a healthy economy and the tireless choreographed support from President Clinton.
And they did it despite the unrelenting pressure of ugly attack from abroad. No other majority is demonized as eager for bombs from neighbors to fall on its land, eager to keep its children in lifelong danger.
Their offense was to criticize Mr. Peres's peace plan, worked out in stealth. It included giving up most of the West Bank, plus the Golan Heights, the inevitability of a Palestinian state, and ambiguity about Jerusalem. And worst of all, subcontracting Israeli protection against terrorism to Yasir Arafat.
Labor, led by Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Peres, had said it would not do such things. That was before the 1992 election. So, plainly, the majority wondered which promises Mr. Peres would break this time if elected. Is that hard to understand?
The majority was not voting against peace -- the very idea is idiocy -- but for the hope that Mr. Netanyahu and a Likud-led coalition might create a peace they could trust while they slept, not just while they stood at arms.
Mr. Netanyahu would continue peace talks. He will not demand the return of the West Bank territory already given to the Palestinians. But he will ask for adjustments that would give Israel more military security. The Golan Heights: no. And he will insist that Israel, not Mr. Arafat, is responsible for the protection of Israelis against terrorism, from wherever it comes.
Mr. Netanyahu's job will not be merely to stand firm. He will have to do something new for him -- seize opportunities to move toward peace, even if some of his coalition object.
All the while, political attacks will resume against Israel from governments that patted it on the head for doing what they and Mr. Peres wanted. Some Arab leaders may not be so cozy to important Jewish visitors from America.
But others will remember that the only land-for-peace deal, with Egypt, was made not by Labor but by Likud's Menachem Begin. And given Palestinians' itch to run Jordan, maybe King Hussein will find limitation of their armed power bearable.
Those American Jews who will give Israelis anything but forgiveness for a Labor defeat will try to destroy a Netanyahu government. They will resume the warmonger chant against the Israeli Jewish majority and maverick foreign journalists who try to explain it, like me. Bearable.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Data Show Economy Grows Stronger

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Evidence of an increasingly strong economy mounted today as the Government reported that sales of new homes surged in April, especially in the Northeast.
The labor market is also strengthening, as indicated by an eighth consecutive decline last week in first-time benefits for unemployment insurance. 
 And although the Government lowered its estimate for growth in the gross domestic product in the first quarter, it raised its estimate of demand for all goods and services.
"The economy is running at a pace that could generate inflation pressure very soon unless it slows," said John R. Williams, a senior economist for the Bankers Trust Company, one of several who lifted their forecasts today for the April-June quarter.
Cathy E. Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, described the economy today as exhibiting "solid underlying growth." She is one of several Fed officials whose comments in recent days have suggested that the central bank is well aware of inflation potential even as actual reports on prices remain benign.
With scarcely any sign of slackening so far, Mr. William said the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy as early as its midsummer meeting on Aug. 20 to keep the economy from overheating and inflation in check.
Bond prices fell and interest rates rose early today after the robust figures were issued. But the bond market subsequently reversed course and finished with modest gains. [Page D16.]
Sales of new homes not only leaped 6.7 percent in April, far more than expected, but the Commerce Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development also substantially raised their tally of home sales for each of the preceding three months.
Analysts said this was a highly impressive performance despite the fact that some sizable part of the gain reflected home buyers accelerating purchases to avoid a further run-up in mortgage rates.
"The April new-home sales report is extremely significant," said Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, because it shows that high rates "are not yet damaging this most interest-rate-sensitive sector."
New one-family homes sold at an annual pace of 776,000 in April, comfortably above the average 752,000 pace now shown for the first three months of the year. The first-quarter pace was previously reported as just 709,000.
The home sales pace in the Northeast soared 56 percent, to 78,000, during April while the gains for the other three regions, all of them more active, were modest. The West gained 2.8 percent, the South 3 percent and the Midwest 3.8 percent.
The report also showed that the median sales price of new homes rose $1,700, to $138,700, while the average price jumped $11,700, to $173,700. At the end of April, builders held 5.8 months' supply of new homes at current selling rates, down from 6.1 months in March.
As for gross domestic product, the Commerce Department lowered its initial estimate issued on May 2 for the first quarter by five-tenths of a point, to an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent.
But analysts pointed out that the decline was entirely the result of a drawdown of inventories, which left the economy positioned to expand more strongly in coming months. Business inventories, hit by the strike at General Motors, were revised downward at a $13.6 billion annual rate, more than offsetting upward revisions for most other major components of G.D.P. Real final sales -- demand for goods and services other than for inventories -- are now shown as expanding at a 3.7 percent pace compared with 3.3 percent previously.
Current-dollar G.D.P. was lowered to a pace of 4.5 percent from 5 percent while the price index for gross domestic purchases was trimmed one-tenth of a point, to 2.4 percent.
Making its initial estimate of first-quarter corporate profits, the department said profits from current production climbed a hefty $24.2 billion, or 3.9 percent, following a $3.7 billion rise in the final three months of 1995.
The Labor Department's report of first-time jobless claims showed them edging up 1,000, to 346,000 for the week ended last Saturday. However, on a four-week moving average, favored by most analysts because the figures move erratically, claims eased by 500, to 345,750, continuing a decline uninterrupted since April 6.
In still another report today, the Conference Board found that help-wanted advertising in 51 major newspapers edged down last month despite strong linage in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic areas. The research group's index stood at 82 for April compared with 84 as revised for March and 86 in April 1995.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE;
Dole Is Confronted on His View of Welfare

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 30

 BODY:
Bob Dole ventured into a black, drug-infested neighborhood here today and suggested that domestic violence had been produced by the welfare system, a notion that a local social worker immediately upbraided him for.
Mr. Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, was taking part in a roundtable discussion on battered women and abused children at the Anton Dvorak school in the Southlawn section, three miles southwest of the Loop. 
 As a county prosecutor in Russell, Kan., more than 50 years ago, Mr. Dole said he "had to take children away from their parents." He noted that his experience "was a long time ago" but added that the problem was now "magnified, multiplied, whatever the word is."
At today's event, with Mr. Dole seated at a table with Gov. Jim Edgar and a dozen people who work with victims of domestic violence, a reporter asked him why domestic violence had become so much worse.
"I frankly think a lot of it has been the failure of the welfare system, which was apparently designed to fail," Mr. Dole said. "We've spent trillions of dollars on the welfare system, and we've seen the problems mushroom. We've had a total breakdown in this country. It's a total disaster, the welfare. Nobody can defend the present welfare system."
Asked by another reporter what welfare had to do with domestic violence, Mr. Dole said, "Oh, it has a lot to do with domestic violence." But in then describing his welfare plan, he never spelled out any link between the two issues.
His response angered one woman at the table, Berta Hinojosa, who coordinates a program dealing with domestic violence and sexual assault and who raised her hand and took Mr. Dole to task.
"What I see is that you are making it like only people who are on welfare are victims of domestic violence," Mrs. Hinojosa said.
"Oh, no," Mr. Dole interjected. "I didn't suggest that at all. I said that's one way."
Mrs. Hinojosa said: "I work with a whole scope of people in the community, and let me tell you, I don't think that domestic violence discriminates. It's the one thing that does not discriminate. And the only color that domestic violence knows is the color purple -- the purple color that I see on my clients. I don't really think that welfare is domestic violence, or domestic violence is welfare."
Mr. Dole responded, "That's one way to address it for some people, but you're right, all economic classes, whether you're white, black, whatever."
It was one of the more awkward moments for Mr. Dole in his campaign. His advisers argue that welfare is a winning issue for him, and he has been talking for weeks about President Clinton's veto of two welfare bills as a way to illustrate that the President has not kept his promise to "end welfare as we know it."
Now, with welfare a central focus of his campaign, Mr. Dole has begun linking it with other issues. In Colorado and California, this week he associated welfare and juvenile crime.
"Rebuilding the family is the best juvenile crime prevention program we could hope for," he said on Tuesday in Colorado, "and we can start by reforming welfare."
Outside the schoolroom later, Mrs. Hinojosa suggested that Mr. Dole was so obsessed with welfare that he was blinded to other matters.
"I think he's so much into the welfare reform, and accusing poor welfare recipients of the causes of everything that is going wrong in this country, that to me it was important to voice that it is not only people on welfare who are abusers," she said.
In the roundtable discussion, Mr. Dole was asked why, if he was so concerned with "social issues," he had scheduled a shopping trip this morning on affluent North Michigan Avenue instead of meeting with people in this neighborhood, which residents described as 98 percent black and with 50 percent unemployment.
"I didn't schedule time to go shopping," Mr. Dole said, referring to time he had spent shaking hands in a shopping mall and using the credit card of an aide to buy a $70 black leather purse for his wife.
"I just happened to stop in a shop and buy my wife a purse," he said. "We spent a lot of time in these areas, we'll have a lot more time when I'm out of the Senate in 10 more days. But I've been exposed to some of these problems for a long long time in my own state, and I think we've got a pretty good grasp of the problems."
Nonetheless, after the event, Mr. Dole started to climb into his car but then immediately climbed out to shake hands with the few people outside the run-down buildings. Several residents, all Democrats, said the predominant problem in their neighborhood was drugs.
"Domestic violence?" said an incredulous J. T. Hampton, a 30-year-old construction worker, when informed of the purpose of Mr. Dole's visit. "That ain't it. He just wants to jump on that O. J. bandwagon. This is the drug capital of America! You're sitting in the heart of it."
Local police officers attached to Mr. Dole's motorcade said that as soon as his entourage left, the drug dealers would return.
Tonight, Mr. Dole attended a fund raiser here that was expected to raise more than $1 million for the Republican National Committee, before flying to Ohio for campaigning on Friday.
Reporters traveling with Mr. Dole had expected today's event on domestic violence to be an attempt to improve his standing among women. He has acknowledged suffering from the fact that women strongly support President Clinton over him. Last week, the latest Washington Post poll showed that 61 percent of female respondents favored Mr. Clinton, while 31 percent favored Mr. Dole.
But Mr. Dole dismissed a question about the gap, saying: "The polls are already starting to close, and I assume that will include the gender gap. But this is May and the election is in November."
