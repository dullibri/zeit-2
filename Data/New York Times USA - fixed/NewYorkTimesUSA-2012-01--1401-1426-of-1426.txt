HEADLINE: Axelrod's Venue for Romney Barbs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
David Axelrod has found his id. On Twitter.
Mr. Axelrod is President Obama's big thinker, the guy who, more than any other, is responsible for the arc of Mr. Obama's message. His specialty is the extended, detailed defense of the president's approach to the intersection of politics and policy.
But upon joining Twitter following his departure from the White House, Mr. Axelrod has discovered a new skill -- the snarky, sharp-edged retort, delivered in fewer than 140 characters. 
Mr. Axelrod tweeted this on Monday, linking his comment to a White House photo of Mr. Obama in a limousine with Bo, his dog.

The Twitter post was an unmistakable tweak of Mitt Romney, who years ago admitted that he had once put the family dog in a kennel strapped to the top of the family station wagon. Animal rights groups were not happy at the time.
Mr. Axelrod is no stranger to finding ways to condense political messages. He has spent part of his career creating 30-second political ads for his clients. But even by that standard, a Twitter post is a more off-the-cuff, spontaneous medium.
That Mr. Axelrod would dredge up Mr. Romney's dog story is hardly a surprise to any of Mr. Axelrod's more than 52,000 followers (as of Monday evening).
Mr. Axelrod has only posted on Twitter 248 times. But a great number of them have been about Mr. Romney. And many have been just as snarky.
After Newt Gingrich won the South Carolina primary, Mr. Axelrod posted:
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
At Bulls game with my daughter, Lauren, thinking about how turnovers late in game can kill you. Must be thinking same over at Romney HQ!
Jan 21 via David Axelrod
When Mr. Romney was struggling to respond to questions about when he might release his tax returns, Mr. Axelrod posted:
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
Why is this question so taxing? http://bit.ly/wEfkoU
20 Jan via David Axelrod
When it looked like Mr. Romney was trying to lower expectations ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Axelrod took him to task, making sure that he got in a dig about Mr. Romney's reputation for flip-flopping.
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
Yesterday, Mitt predicted victory. Today, he says 3d would be fine. He can't even stick to the same position on THAT!
3 Jan via David Axelrod
Sometimes Mr. Axelrod's Twitter posts are more serious. Two weeks ago, he took Mr. Romney to task for saying that ''Of course, you take out our enemies, wherever they are.''
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
Mitt says, ''Of course, you take out our enemies, wherever they are.'' 4 years ago: ''It's not worth moving heaven and earth'' to get OBL.
16 Jan via David Axelrod
Freed from the restraints of his former White House position as a ''senior adviser,'' Mr. Axelrod is clearly having fun with this new medium.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Axelrod engaged Eric Fehrnstrom, Mr. Romney's senior adviser, in a Twitter war over which of their bosses would be better for the economy.
Two hours later, Mr. Axelrod wrote:
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
@EricFehrn Dude, none of my business, but shouldn't you be in debate prep instead of trying to explain yourself to me?
Mon Jan 16 22:51:45 via David Axelrod
Mr. Fehrnstrom quickly answered back:
@EricFehrn Eric Fehrnstrom
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
Mon Jan 16 22:55:47 via Eric Fehrnstrom
Mr. Axelrod's Twitter account declares that he is a ''former senior adviser to President Obama'' and a ''proud Chicagoan.'' It also states that ''views expressed through this personal account are my own.''
Mr. Axelrod clearly does a lot of personal thinking about Mr. Romney.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Trade Collision Course

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- As the White House prepares for a Washington visit by the man who is expected to run China for the coming decade, trade tensions between the United States and Beijing are on the rise.
On Tuesday, a coalition of big American labor unions, Democratic politicians and trade advocacy groups plans to start campaigning for the Obama administration to file a series of trade cases against China in the auto industry. They accuse Beijing of unfairly subsidizing Chinese auto parts makers and illegally restricting the exports of crucial raw materials that foreign parts makers need to stay competitive.
The group says a 900 percent increase in auto parts imports from China over the last decade, to nearly $12 billion a year, is to blame for job losses in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- three swing states that the administration cannot easily ignore in a presidential election year.
''The Chinese have cheated,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is a Congressional leader of the trade effort along with Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan. 
The group has been preparing its campaign for months. But it may be sensing a new opportunity after President Obama signaled a tougher trade stance against China in his State of the Union address last week, saying he would set up a trade enforcement unit to investigate unfair Chinese practices.
Separately, the Commerce Department is considering whether to levy punitive tariffs against China over green energy technology. And on Monday, Washington was on the winning side of a World Trade Organization ruling against China for its export restrictions on industrial minerals.
All of which promises to test diplomacy on both sides during a Feb. 14 White House visit by China's vice president, Xi Jinping, who is expected to succeed President Hu Jintao next winter as China's leader.
Chinese officials have vehemently denied that they violate international trade agreements. ''Over the past 10 years, China has fully implemented its W.T.O. commitments, and its trade and investment liberalization and facilitation have been significantly increased,'' President Hu said last month.
Senator Brown said Washington's appetite for a more assertive trade policy was whetted last month by China's imposition of steep tariffs on $4.9 billion a year of imports of sport utility vehicles and large cars from the United States.
Hoping to reduce the trade tensions just before Mr. Xi's visit, Chinese officials are preparing to send at least six business delegations on buying trips to the United States, people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them said. Similar delegations have preceded past visits by top Chinese leaders to Washington and have focused on bundling planned purchases of Boeing jets, American grain and other exports into multibillion-dollar contracts that can be signed at elaborate ceremonies.
The Obama administration has also made a few small conciliatory moves. The Commerce Department planned to issue a preliminary ruling on Feb. 13 on whether to impose tariffs on Chinese solar panels to offset reported Chinese export subsidies. But when the United States and China agreed last week that Feb. 14 would be the date for Vice President Xi's visit to Washington, the department pushed back its ruling until March 2.
But small gestures may not overcome the shock among American trade officials and auto industry executives last month when China imposed the tariffs on American vehicles.
An adviser to the Chinese commerce ministry, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, said that decision had been based mostly on jockeying among Chinese factions over the need to show toughness toward the United States and did not signal a broader shift in Chinese policies.
The Chinese move came as American labor unions, Democratic politicians, policy research groups and trade lawyers were already in the final stages of the auto parts campaign that they plan to announce in Washington on Tuesday. Besides numerous Democratic members of Congress, the coalition includes the United Steel Workers union, the United Automobile Workers union, the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute and the trade law firm Stewart and Stewart, as well as the Wessel Group, a trade strategy firm.
Although the U.A.W. and the Economic Policy Institute are new to the group, the others are the same parties that persuaded the Obama administration in September 2010 to start a broad investigation of whether China had violated international trade rules with policies like subsidies for renewable energy manufacturing.
For the new campaign, the coalition has been preparing legal briefs arguing that the administration should file trade cases at the Commerce Department and at the W.T.O. to challenge a wide range of reported Chinese subsidies for auto parts exporters. They also seek United States challenges to China's export restrictions on rare earth metals, which are needed for many auto parts.
The legal briefs also call for a W.T.O. challenge to Chinese rules that pressure American automakers to transfer to China their latest electric car technology, like that for the Chevrolet Volt, if they want these cars to qualify for green-energy subsidies when sold in China.
Notably, the complaints are coming from labor proponents, and not auto parts makers, which have many factories in China as well as in the United States. Like companies in most industries, they have been reluctant to risk retaliation by questioning Chinese policies.
Auto parts from China now dominate the American market for many replacement parts used by body shops, and they are starting to be used as original equipment in the United States as well. Parts categories with big surges in imports from China include radiators, ignition components, wheels and bearings.
The auto parts industry accounts for three-quarters of the approximately 600,000 people directly employed in auto manufacturing in the United States. That proportion has been slowly rising for many years as automakers have concluded that it is cheaper to buy large modules, often made at nonunion factories, instead of using expensive, unionized labor at assembly plants to put together a lot of parts and then install them in cars.
But the auto parts jobs have been a growing share of a shrinking pie, according to a paper from the Economic Policy Institute, which calculated that 400,000 parts jobs were lost from November 2000 to November 2011. The institute's paper, to be released on Tuesday, did not calculate how many of those job losses were the direct result of factories moving to China, as opposed to other causes, like greater automation of American factories.
The Chinese shipments ''have had a big impact, and the impact is growing,'' said Bob King, the president of the U.A.W.
In separate telephone interviews, Mr. King and Leo W. Gerard, the president of the United Steel Workers union, sketched different views on how the auto parts coalition would proceed this spring.
Mr. King, of the auto workers union, said he wanted the administration to confront China but did not favor legislation by Congress that would force specific actions on the issue. The administration's bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009 saved the American auto industry from collapse, he said, and so the White House should be entrusted with ''the flexibility to figure out the best way to protect the interests of the American people.''
But Mr. Gerard, for the steel workers, said he was already working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to force the administration to file trade cases. ''We're going to take the case to the Congress and push the government to take the case,'' he said.
Senator Stabenow, of Michigan, said in an e-mail that there was broad interest in Congress in the issue. ''At first there were just a handful of us working on these issues. Now momentum is building in both parties for measures that help level the playing field,'' she wrote.

HEADLINE: Don't Stop the Debates

 BODY:
Senator John McCain spoke for many nervous Republicans on Sunday when he said it's time to ''stop the debates.'' They've turned into mud-wrestling contests, he said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, and are driving up negative impressions of the party's presidential candidates. 
Mr. McCain, who knows something about unfavorable ratings, is right that the 19 debates so far have left an increasingly sour taste in voters' mouths. Since the debates began, the popularity gap has grown between the leading Republican candidates and President Obama.
But that's not simply because the candidates have increased the intensity of their attacks on each other, nor is it curable by cutting back the mud-fighting, as Mr. McCain suggests. It's also because voters have been exposed to the broken windows of the Republican idea factory. The value of debates is to put the candidates on stage to air their ideas. If voters find them dishonest and divisive, the Republicans are getting the wrong message if they think all they have to do to fix that is to stop talking so much.
Consider some of the ''bold ideas'' the country learned about in just the last two debates in Florida, leading up to Tuesday's primary there.
Newt Gingrich wants to build a lunar colony on the moon in just eight years, and he seems to believe that the private sector can be induced to pay for it. He wants to convene a ''gold commission'' to get the country back to hard money, which would shackle the economy to a single commodity. He wants to end multilingual ballots (disenfranchising millions), promote an uprising in Cuba and end the capital gains tax, which would allow millionaires to pay less of their income to the government than the minimum they pay now.
Mitt Romney promised to get millions of illegal immigrants to ''self-deport,'' apparently by making their lives miserable. He would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for immigrant college students and military service members. He would refuse to extend any government help to struggling homeowners, while repealing the Dodd-Frank law that finally regulated the banking practices that led to the housing crisis.
The debates that Mr. McCain so deplores also gave voters a taste of the incompetent candidacies of Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann, helping to put an end to them. They have properly marginalized Ron Paul and his cranky libertarianism.
And they have given Rick Santorum repeated opportunities to point out that Mr. Romney's bellicose opposition to ''Obamacare'' is an almost comical contradiction to his support for the same idea in Massachusetts when he was governor there. (Mr. Santorum's strong debate performances haven't given him much recent traction in the primaries, though.)
Most of all, the debates have shown the complete lack of interest by all the Republican candidates in the issues of economic fairness. While the candidates argue over their investments and their complex tax returns and who can cut taxes for the rich the most, the contrast to Mr. Obama's newfound voice on shared responsibility could not be more clear.
The long series of debates are an open window onto the failed policies and dubious values of the Republican Party. No wonder some people want to close it.

HEADLINE: How Did the Super Bowl Get So Super?

BYLINE: GEORGE VECSEY


HIGHLIGHT: How do you explain why the Super Bowl is so popular? 

 BODY:
Why is the Super Bowl so popular?
A German correspondent, long based in New York, called me to ask about the appeal of the Super Bowl. (He gets it, but he needed input from other people.)
I had just done a rant on my own Web site that the N.F.L. owes it to the public to present a Super Bowl in a warm climate, just to comfort people in the northern states. Now I was trying to explain the biggest day in American sports.
First of all, I said, Europeans and others around the world already watch the Super Bowl in their own less inconvenient time zones. I was in London a few years ago and the pubs were open late, and patrons could explain who the teams were, and how the game worked.
Television is making sports universal, for the same reason big-time soccer is growing more popular in the United States.
But what is there about the Super Bowl itself?
Well, I said, the athletes are terrific, in all shapes and sizes. The speed and the power.
What about the violence? I said that since we learned in recent years about the damage from brain concussions, even the broadcasters are learning not to chortle so much when an athlete "got his bell rung."
What about the military comparisons? I used to make those comparisons in the '60s during the Vietnam era, I said. But I'm not so sure that comparison still holds.
Why is the N.F.L. so popular? The N.F.L. grew in the comfort zone after World War II. People had money and time. A popular American sport got bigger.
American excess. I passed a store in my town that was advertising a free bucket of Buffalo wings for every order over $50. Even in bad economic times, people are going to party.
It's a great game for television, I said. The officials are really good at interpreting the hand-to-hand combat between receiver and defensive back.
And finally, there are the commercials. It's a whole separate industry, making and publicizing the commercials. Sometimes more people talk about the halftime show or the commercials than they do about the game.
So American. So big. So long. So expensive.
How would you explain to non-Americans the appeal of the Super Bowl?

HEADLINE: A Start-Up Rewards Savers, Not Spenders

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: SaveUp, a new start-up, joins other Web companies that aim to help people manage and learn about their finances. It takes a different approach, its founders say, by turning saving and paying off debt into a game with prizes-- like a $2 million jackpot. Any time users save $1 or pay off $1 in debt, they earn a credit. 

 BODY:
We are accustomed to earning credit card points for spending money. A start-up called SaveUp wants to flip that idea on its head and give prizes for saving money instead.
People who link their accounts to SaveUp get the chance to win prizes like a $750 Panasonic TV, a $50,000 personal makeover or the $2 million jackpot. They also get advice, like ways to link student loans for lower interest rates, and see educational videos or quizzes on topics like compound interest.
SaveUp, which opened in November, joins other Web start-ups that aim to help people better understand and manage their finances, including LearnVest, Wealthfront, Wikinvest and Mint, which Intuit acquired in 2009. But SaveUp wants to turn financial management into a game instead of an overwhelming series of charts and graphs, said Priya Haji, SaveUp's co-founder and chief executive.
"It's meant to be a fun way to think about your finances everyday, but not with too much detail," she said. "There's a small percentage of people who benefit from something like Mint, but 99 percent of people start sweating when they see it."
The founders were inspired by prize-linked savings accounts in other countries, which give people the chance to win the pooled interest earned by many accounts. Those are banned in the United States, so they hatched SaveUp as an alternative.
"The small chance of something life-changing is more influential than something small, like interest," Ms. Haji said.
Users register with SaveUp and link their United States financial accounts, like savings, retirement and student loan accounts. SaveUp joined with Intuit to connect to these accounts so numbers are encrypted and protected by Intuit's technology.
Any time users save $1 or pay off $1 in debt, they earn a credit. They get a chance to play the game with every 10 credits they earn. They can click to play instantly to win something like the TV or makeover, or enter the monthly jackpot drawing.
The prizes are sponsored by advertisers, which include Virgin America, Banana Republic and GameStop. The jackpot, like all its lottery prizes, is sponsored by an insurance company to which SaveUp pays a small premium based on the odds every time someone enters to win.
SaveUp has also joined with financial institutions, like Bank of the West. They pay for referrals and subscriptions so they can offer special products to their customers on the site.
The start-up, which Ms. Haji founded with Sammy Shreibati, its chief technology officer, has raised $2 million in venture capital from BlueRun Ventures and True Ventures.

Volcker Rule Stirs Up Opposition Overseas | Usually, it is the banks that are fighting efforts to impose new regulations on the industry. Now, it is foreign governments fighting against bank regulations in the United States, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
In the halls of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum here last week, Wall Street's top bankers found curious allies in their battle to end - or perhaps water down - the so-called Volcker Rule, that part of last year's Dodd-Frank financial regulation law that says banks are not allowed to make risky bets with their own money.
Finance ministers from around the world lined up to whisper in the ear of Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, who made the rounds in Davos on Thursday and Friday, about a specific element of the Volcker Rule that has them apoplectic. The rule says that United States banks - and possibly certain foreign banks that do business in America - would be restricted in trading foreign government bonds. Yet the rule, conveniently, provides an exemption for United States government securities. Every other country is out of luck. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Knicks Need to Look for Efficient Scoring

BYLINE: MIKE KURYLO


HIGHLIGHT: The New York Knicks have high volume shooters, not efficient ones. 

 BODY:
In recent years, statistics have become more valued by professional teams, although this change has been a slow process. Hall of Fame baseball executive Branch Rickey hired the first full time statistician in 1947, and made numerous statistical formulas to enhance his performance. 
Yet despite his decades of success, most sports owners did not value advancing statistical methods of evaluating players. For instance, noted statistician Bill James did his research as an outsider to baseball front offices in the 1980s and 1990s, until he was hired in 2003 by the Boston Red Sox. Undoubtedly, it was the success of Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane -- and the popularity of the book (and now movie) "Moneyball" -- that made it acceptable to use modern statistics as a primary method of talent evaluation.
Although statistical analysis is more common in front offices today, number-crunchers are still painted with the same wide brush, commonly stereotyped as acomputer nerd who spends more time with spreadsheets than watching the games. The reality is that most statisticians, specifically in basketball, watch more games than the casual fan. They tend to use their numerical knowledge to augment their observational perspective. Additionally, statistical analysts vary in how they evaluate the game, and are not in agreement on a multitude of issues. Perhaps the most divisive issue is the value of shot creation. 
In the N.B.A., a team has 24 seconds from gaining possession to take a shot. Should the team fail to do so, they turn the ball over to the other team, so there undoubtedly is some value in being able to take a quality shot, or assist a teammate in taking one, before the shot clock expires. 
Some statisticians such as ESPN's John Hollinger think highly of this skill, and the stat he created Player Efficiency Rating (P.E.R.) has the penalty for a missed shot lower than the reward for a made shot. Players that shoot a lot, even at a low efficiency, tend to have a high P.E.R. On the other end of the spectrum is economist turned N.B.A. analyst David Berri, who heavily penalizes a missed shot in his statistical method Wins Produced (W.P.). Players who make shots at a high percentage, even at a low volume, tend to have a high W.P.

Because of a large number of variables in an N.B.A. game, it is difficult proving where across the spectrum the value of shot creation lies. But the Carmelo Anthony trade, or perhaps the result of it, might shed some light on the subject.
If you're reading this, you probably already know that the Knicks traded a handful of assets (most relevant, Danilo Gallinari and Timofey Mozgov) last season for Anthony and some other players. You're also likely aware of the intense media pressure in favor of the Knicks trading for Anthony at the time. Last February, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith wrote "the Knicks must go get Carmelo Anthony as soon as possible," and "Danilo Gallinari is good, with promise, but hardly worth holding on to if it means not getting Anthony's services."
Smith's remarks represent those who put a high demand on shot creation. By this standard, Anthony's value was perceived to be much greater than that of Gallinari due to the former's ability to take more shots. Comparing the players' stats at the same stage in their careers, Anthony is able to take nearly 38 percent more shots than Gallinari. On the other hand, Gallinari's true shooting percentage, a measure of a player's overall scoring efficiency, is 45 points higher (59.0 percent to 54.5 percent) than Anthony's. Hence those who put a low premium on scoring volume and higher value on efficiency saw Anthony as overrated.
Nearly a year later, the result of this trade seems to be that higher efficiency is more valuable than higher volume when it comes to scoring. The Denver Nuggets have a robust 14-6 record, while the New York Knicks have a mediocre record of 7-13. Not that the fortunes of these teams are based on the efforts of a single player, but they embody the opposite sides of the volume/efficiency argument. 
The Denver Nuggets are a team that lacks a high-volume scorer. If we limit our scope to players with 100 or more minutes on the season, no Nugget player averages more 16.5 field goal attempts per 36 minutes. New York has two players who fit this criteria, Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. Of the Denver starters, the highest field goal attempts per 36 minutes is Ty Lawson's 13.1. Meanwhile, the Knicks have four starters averaging more than that number.
While New York has more players who are able to create shots, Denver has more players who are efficient with their shooting. The Knicks have eight players with a true shooting percentage lower than 55.0 percent, while the Nuggets only have three. 
Despite lacking a player who can create shots for himself at a high level, the Nuggets have the N.B.A.'s best offense, ranked by offensive efficiency. Meanwhile, the Knicks, with multiple high-volume shooters, find themselves with the league's 24th-best offense. It appears that the ability to score efficiently is more important than the ability to create shots. 
In fact, this isn't a new for the Knicks, who in recent history have attempted to fill their roster with volume scorers (Tracy McGrady, Larry Hughes, Eddy Curry, Zach Randolph, Jamal Crawford, Stephon Marbury) with disregard for efficiency to dubious results. 
So does this all mean? For basketball analysts it means the high-volume scorer who lacks the ability to sink shots at a mediocre rate is likely overrated by all but a percentage of statisticians. For the Knicks' current roster, it means that the team has to work on improving the quality and lowering the frequency of shots among their low-efficiency scorers. For the Knicks' front office it means that perhaps they should abandon their current method of evaluating players and consult with a statistician before their next franchise-altering trade.

HEADLINE: How the Fed Presidents' Assets Stack Up

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve, in its latest show of transparency, has released the financial disclosures filed by the 12 presidents of its regional banks for 2010. Their assets range from modest to many millions. 

 BODY:
12:02 p.m. | Updated 
The Federal Reserve, in its latest show of transparency, on Tuesday made available to the public the annual financial disclosures filed by the 12 presidents of its regional banks for 2010.
Unfortunately, only the Atlanta Fed put its president's disclosure online. So we're posting the entire set in a document viewer.
What did we learn? Some Fed presidents are very wealthy; a few have strikingly little wealth. Some hold shares in individual companies; some prefer index funds. And as a group, they have much more reason to fear inflation, which weighs on the wealthy, than to fear high unemployment, which so far has not cost them their jobs.
The disclosures do not include the value of personal residences or retirement benefits accrued through the Fed. James B. Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, submitted a blank disclosure with a note saying that all of his assets were in those exempt categories. The disclosures also do not include annual salaries, information that the Fed discloses separately. The 12 presidents received an annual average salary of $345,000 in 2010.

The following table shows the minimum and maximum value of the assets reported by each president. As with other public officials, the disclosures assign each asset to a range of values, so that the aggregate also is a range. Only some presidents also reported liabilities, so net worths cannot be calculated.
Excepting Mr. Bullard's blank form, the president with the least reported wealth is Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, whose assets - a checking account, a money market fund and a retirement annuity - are worth no more than $150,000. Two other presidents, Eric Rosengrenof the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and Esther George of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, also reported assets with maximum values less than $1 million.
At the other end of the spectrum stand William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, who reported assets worth at least $8.5 million, and Richard W. Fisher of the Dallas Fed, who reported assets worth at least $21.5 million.
It is not possible to tell which man is wealthier because the top asset category is open-ended. Both men reported half a dozen assets with values above $1 million. How much above $1 million? We have no idea, and therefore cannot estimate a maximum value for their holdings.
Mr. Fisher, a constant siren on the subject of inflation, owns at least $1 million in gold, and smaller quantities of platinum and uranium, popular investments for those who fear inflation. He also owns thousands of acres of land in Texas and other states. But his investments are hardly "an extreme bet on economic catastrophe," to borrow The Wall Street Journal's description of the investment portfolio of another Texan, Ron Paul. Mr. Fisher also owns millions of dollars in municipal bonds, which lose value as inflation rises, and he holds shares in a wide range of corporations, particularly in the technology and industrial sectors.
Mr. Dudley's investments became a subject of controversy when the Government Accountability Office reported in July (see Page 70) that he had owned shares in General Electric and the American International Group during the same period that the Federal Reserve was bailing out the companies and he was a New York Fed official, though not yet president. The Fed granted Mr. Dudley a waiver at the time, judging that a better course than requiring him to sell the shares immediately, at a time when he was privy to closely held information about the companies. Instead, he was required to sell the shares at a specified time in the future. The New York Fed has said that he no longer owns shares in the companies.
An earlier version of the chart with this post misstated the range of value of the assets of the Minneapolis Fed president, Narayana Kocherlakota.

HEADLINE: A Stalwart Park Makes Do With Less

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Edgewood Park in California, which had three full-time rangers in the mid-1990s, now has just one who is shared with two other parks. Volunteers help the park scrape by. 

 BODY:
It's a typical day at Edgewood Park, a 500-acre nature preserve in the hills above Silicon Valley 25 miles south of San Francisco. Even in January, thanks to the mild winter climate, scores of joggers, hikers, picnickers and the occasional horseback rider enjoy the five miles of trails and scenic spots.
The park offers a much-needed nature break for stressed-out cube dwellers from the high-tech companies that populate the area. Yet it also serves as a microcosm of the current challenges faced by the nation's park systems, and the workarounds that many use to overcome them. Rising costs set against shrinking budgets have forced many of the nation's parks to cut services, others like Edgewood to rely more heavily on volunteers and grants, and some to close altogether.
As a regular visitor to Edgewood, I recently joined the Trail Patrol, a group of 50 volunteers who walk the trails, report on ground conditions and offer help to park visitors. In the process, I've gotten a bird's-eye view of the work done to preserve natural spaces there, which I will be describing in a series of posts on the blog. 
On a national level, park attendance has never been higher. Nearly 280 million people visited a national park last year, according to a recent study by the National Parks Conservation Association. This was good news for local communities: the association estimates that the park system creates nearly four dollars in economic value for every federal tax dollar invested. 
Yet the budget for the national park system is about $400 million less than it was 10 years ago, a 13 percent decline from 2001 levels, leading to reductions in staff, services and maintenance. And things could get worse.
The failure by the Congressional super committee to reach a deficit-reduction deal would trigger automatic cuts, reducing the National Park Service budget an additional 9 percent.
The financial picture is much the same at the state and county levels. Cost-cutting forced California to permanently close 70 of its 278 state parks last year. And in San Mateo County, which manages 17 parks including Edgewood, money for parks has declined about 30 percent since the mid-1990's, according to Gary Lockman, the county's parks superintendent.
In the mid-90s, Edgewood had three full-time park rangers. But rangers, like many of the native plants in the park, have become endangered. Today, one ranger is assigned to cover Edgewood and two other county parks.
Making do with less has been a constant challenge. "We've had to get very creative in how we maintain the parks," Mr. Lockman said. "And we've had those hard conversations like, 'Do we pay for interpretative and educational programs or haul away the garbage?' "
Volunteers now cover many of the jobs once performed by park rangers and contribute about 20 percent of the work force hours in the park. 
The Friends of Edgewood, a volunteer group made up of 200 local families, staffs an interpretative center and leads many of the educational programs offered to local residents and schools. Built with donations to the San Mateo County Parks Foundation, the center opened last year.
Volunteers led by the California Native Plant Society spend hours stooped over the grassland areas, weeding out invaders like the yellow star thistle that crowd out the California plantain and other native plants.
The park serves as a laboratory for many conservation projects, mostly financed by grants, including the effort to reintroduce the Bay checkerspot, a threatened butterfly species whose habitat is limited to the San Francisco peninsula. The finicky butterfly has all but disappeared from Edgewood because of the decline of the native plantain, the only plant on which it lays its eggs. 
While local parks may not generate the same economic returns as the larger national parks, they are still important community assets, Mr. Lockman said. "Good parks improve property values," he said, "and people consider parks a key factor when they evaluate the livability of a neighborhood."
Bill Korbholz, the president of Friends of Edgewood, maintains that even with waning budgets, the park should be considered a success story. But he also acknowledges the unique circumstances that have helped preserve Edgewood. 
Thanks to the listing of the tiny Bay checkerspot as a threatened species in 1987, the park was designated as a natural preserve in 1993.
This designation ultimately saved the space from a local developer who wanted to build an 18-hole golf course. The battle to save the park "galvanized the preservation movement," Mr. Korbholz said. 
Many of the community members who came together to fight the development started the volunteer groups and remain active today. 
Not every park has been as lucky.

HEADLINE: Maybe They Should Just Start Super PACs

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: To help offset the payroll tax cut, Republicans want to freeze the pay of federal workers. 

 BODY:
It's not always easy to figure out if Congress is in session. When they're not, they hold pro-forma meetings designed to block presidential appointees. When they are, they hold meetings easily mistaken for the pro-forma versions in which little gets done beyond the routine blocking of presidential appointees. That, or they muck about with Band-Aid solutions instead of actually trying to help the economy.
For a classic Band-Aid solution, see the latest Republican proposal to freeze the pay of federal workers. This might sound like a good idea: The federal workers category includes members of Congress, who don't earn their current salaries. And why shouldn't they share in the pain that is afflicting so many other Americans?
Well, in fact, they already do.

As the Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe reported Monday, "virtually nobody collecting a federal paycheck has seen a pay bump in recent years." President Obama froze the salaries of the top people in the West Wing and other high-ranking political appointees after he took office in 2009. Lawmakers and their staffs have not had a pay raise lately, and there's already a two-year freeze on federal employees' salaries.
Besides, the vast majority of federal workers are not highly paid people (oh and many of them are minorities who tend to vote Democratic and therefore are politically expendable to House Speaker John Boehner and his caucus). Most estimates say the average federal employee makes about $75,000 a year. That's not bad, although it's significantly less than the $174,000 that members of Congress make. (And I'm not even going to get into the rapacious, corrupting fundraising that members of Congress do to keep their jobs, and then act like that's not income.)
What's really silly is the House G.O.P.'s rationale for extending the freeze through most of 2013: It's to offset a $200 million extension in the payroll tax cut. Again, that might sound like a good idea, but the freeze would create only about $60 million in savings, according to estimates I have read. It also would reduce spending by consumers. So it would have exactly the opposite effect of the payroll tax cut, which is intended to stimulate spending and thus the economy. That's just madness, but it's typical of the way the Congressional Republicans approach budgeting these days. Anytime they come under enough political pressure to actually pass stimulus programs, they feel compelled to counteract it through cuts.
The proposed freeze is also in keeping with a Republican standby: That government jobs aren't really jobs, meaning there's no problem with making them unpleasant and reducing the government workforce through attrition.
There's a much easier way to offset the payroll tax cut, which wouldn't be unfair to people who work for a living, whether in the government or the private sector - a surtax on households who make more than $1 million a year. If the Republicans were really serious about cutting the deficit, rather than simply making good on a mindless pledge not to raise taxes, that's how they would do it.

HEADLINE: By Request | Social Spa-ing

BYLINE: REBECCA WILLA DAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The newest La Prairie spa, located in Los Angeles's Hotel Bel-Air, caters to those who go in groups. 

 BODY:
What's Hot: Social spa-ing.
Where to Get It: Hotel Bel-Air Spa by La Prairie in Los Angeles.
Why Have It: "It's a two-in-one: Not only are you participating in a special occasion, but you walk out feeling pampered."
Details: When La Prairie opened its fourth spa worldwide at the Hotel Bel-Air this past October, its director, Nicole Weigand, noticed that people weren't making appointments just for themselves. "In the last six months we've really seen this huge shift from the individual spa experience to the group spa experience," she said. "We're seeing a lot more couples, a lot more parties and a lot more groups, rather than just the individual looking to run away from the world for a few hours." Caviar facials might not seem ideal for catching up on relationship statuses or figuring out who is going to pick up the kids, but it's been doing well for the 4,134-square-foot retreat, which includes a 22-karat-gold light fixture, climate-controlled rooms and the Enclave, a space that can hold up to 10 people and features its own private entrance, sitting area and courtyard with a waterfall. The menu reflects the recent demand for social spa-ing, with four treatments designed with couples in mind, and another, the Day of Pampering, well suited for larger parties. Weigand, who also oversees theLa Prairie spa at the Beverly Hills Hotel, believes the recession played a role in this buddy relaxation boom: "Once we had a little bit of strain on the economy, people looked at spa-ing like a luxury worth giving up. But if they had a reason - or a party, or a partner - to celebrate, or to celebrate with, it makes people feel a little bit better about indulging themselves." Though some may prefer to spend a few hundred dollars on a massage in the company of friends, solo visitors haven't gone extinct just yet; half-joking, Weigand notes that "anyone who is older or has been married for a long time might want to get away on their own."

HEADLINE: MF Global Risk Chief Once Saw Euro Bets as 'Acceptable'

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Stockman, the firm's chief risk officer, is set tell Congress that he did not sound the alarms about risky wagers on European sovereign debt until about three months before MF Global collapsed. 

 BODY:
MF Global's chief risk officer is set to tell Congress on Thursday that he did not sound the alarms about the firm's risky wagers on European sovereign debt until July, about three months before the firm collapsed into bankruptcy. 
Michael Stockman joined MF Global after Michael Roseman, the firm's previous risk chief, clashed with the firm's top executives about the European debt positions. Mr. Roseman argued that the bets could sour and wanted Jon S. Corzine, the firm's chief executive and the architect of the bond plan, to seek approval from the board if he wanted to expand the bets. 
The board sided with Mr. Corzine. And when Mr. Stockman took over in early 2011, he did not immediately adopt his predecessor's skepticism. 
"For the first several months of my tenure, based on analyses performed by my department, I believed that the risk profile associated with the company's European sovereign debt position was acceptable in light of then-prevailing market conditions," Mr. Stockman said in prepared testimony to be delivered before a House panel on Thursday. He added that his risk department team "regularly analyzed" the company's positions. 
MF Global collapsed on Oct. 31 amid a crisis of confidence after it was publicly revealed that regulators were growing concerned that Mr. Corzine had placed a big bet on European sovereign bonds. Mr. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, had wagered that the European Union would not let nations like Ireland and Portugal default. 
Mr. Stockman is prepared to say that he did not raise concerns about the bet until July. 
"As credit markets deteriorated in the summer of 2011, I came to the view that it would be prudent for the company to mitigate the increased risks associated with its European sovereign debt trading position, and to consider entering into hedging transactions to reduce the company's exposure," he said in the testimony. 
He conveyed his concerns to "senior management" and explored ways to wind down the risk, Mr. Stockman said in the prepared remarks. In August, he then outlined his concerns in presentations to MF Global's board. 
"In my view, the board and senior management were highly sophisticated; they knew and understood how the" positions worked, he said, adding that "they were well aware of the increased risks caused by weakening market conditions."
The board finally heeded the warnings. In his testimony, Mr. Stockman said the board ceased adding to the debt purchases. 
But it was too late. Regulators were already breathing down on the firm, and within two months, it would be in bankruptcy. 
Mr. Stockman is to testify on Thursday before the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee, which will hold the fourth Congressional hearing on MF Global's downfall. The committee is to hear from both Mr. Stockman and Mr. Roseman, offering the first opportunity for the risk officers to explain their oversight on the European bond positions. The committee is also to hear from executives at rating agencies that were slow to respond to MF Global's swift downfall. 
Mr. Stockman is not expected to shed any light on another question swirling around MF Global: what happened to $1.2 billion in customer money that vanished when the firm collapsed? 
"I have no personal knowledge of any missing funds or unreconciled customer accounts," he said. "Like everyone else, I am very hopeful that all missing customer funds will be located and promptly returned to the rightful owners."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Bets Heapings of Fermented Milk on the Giants

BYLINE: AIDAN GARDINER


HIGHLIGHT: In a bet over the Super Bowl, Andrew Cuomo put up Greek yogurt, bagels and cheesecake against the Massachusetts governor's pies, clam chowder and chips. Have a different thought? 

 BODY:
Certain foods are emblematic of New York: a thin pizza slice with grease enough to soak through a paper plate, a hot dog bursting with condiments, and the impossible-to-recreate New York bagel. 
On Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo added another element to the table of iconic New York foodstuffs: Greek yogurt. 
The governor took this action in the course of announcing the requisite bet between heads of state over the Super Bowl. S[#x336]h[#x336]o[#x336]u[#x336]l[#x336]d[#x336] When the Giants beat the Patriots, Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts will be sending to a New York food bank several Centerville pies, some clam chowder and 46 cases of Food Should Taste Good chips. 
But in the unlikely inconceivable event the Giants lose, Mr. Cuomo will be sending to New England 46 dozen Ess-a-Bagels, 46 Junior's cheesecakes - and 46 cases of Greek yogurt, which the governor's office characterized in a press release as New York's "newest and hottest export." 
"Greek yogurt is the healthy choice for New York's economy and a natural fit for a bet demonstrating the best our state has to offer," Austin Shafran, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, said in a follow-up call. "New York is working hard to be a global leader in the manufacturing of Greek yogurt, which has shown it has the winning formula to create jobs and economic growth." 
Greek yogurt - ultra-rich yogurt with most of the water and whey strained out - is indeed a , thanks in part to the large amount of milk produced in the state. In 2010, New York produced 368 million pounds of Greek yogurt, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. 
It is even demonstrably yummy, especially the kind with the little sidecar of honey that you can pour on top.
But is it really a signature New York foodstuff? Could the governor have found something more appropriate?

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Early Exit Polls in Florida

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Some findings from the early exit polls in Florida: 1 in 7 G.O.P. primary voters are Hispanic, and there are fewer late deciders and evangelicals than in the other early nominating states. 

 BODY:
The last polls in Florida do not close until 8 p.m. ET, but we're learning what we can about the Republican electorate from the early exit polls.
Late Deciders 
Only about one-fourth of the G.O.P. primary voters said they made their decision within the last few days. By contrast, a majority of voters in the South Carolina primary and near majority in Iowa and New Hampshire decided in the last few days before their contest.
Perhaps the G.O.P. contest is settling down. But also, the lower percentage of "late-deciders" may be partly because it's expected that nearly 30 percent or more of the votes were cast before Tuesday. State election officials say they have received more than 650,000 absentee ballots and early votes. Florida is the first state so far to offer early voting, which has become increasingly popular in recent election cycles.
In fact, tonight's exit polls take into account the combined absentee/early votes. Joe Lenski, the executive vice president of Edison Research, said that it conducted a telephone poll of 600 people for seven days ending Sunday to incorporate the pre-primary tally into the exit surveys. The telephone poll results will be weighted to reflect the actual percentage of the absentee/early vote of the official returns. Republicans are expecting a voter turnout of about 1.9 million altogether.
Some pre-primary polls, including NBC News/Marist poll that was released on Sunday took into account the early and absentee voters in their surveys. In that particular one, the early/absentee voters chose Mr. Romney, 49 percent, to Mr. Gingrich, at 27 percent. But some counties in Florida were accepting early voters, before Mr. Gingrich saw a rise in South Carolina polls and won its G.O.P. -Kate Phillips, David R. Jones contributing.
Hispanic Voters
Florida is the first early nominating state to have a significant block of Hispanic voters, and the exit polls highlight the state's diverse nature. Nearly 1 in 7 primary Republican voters are Hispanic.
In 2008, just over half of Florida's Hispanic Republican primary voters supported John McCain, nearly a quarter of Hispanic voters backed Rudolph W. Giuliani, and about 1 in 7 said they cast their vote for Mitt Romney. -Allison Kopicki
Moderate Shift on Immigration
In a state with a high immigrant population (nearly 9 percent of Floridians are noncitizens), fewer than 1 of 5 primary voters in Florida cites illegal immigration as the most important issue in their vote.
But the issue still resonates. More than one-third of Republican primary voters feel that illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, a position more in line with Mr. Gingrich's than Mr. Romney's. Three in ten voters would like to see illegal immigrants deported back to their home countries, and a similar number believe they should be allowed to stay as guest workers.
This is a shift for Florida's Republican voters. In the 2008 primary election, 40 percent of voters said they wanted to see illegal immigrants deported, while 29 percent supported a guest worker option and 29 percent favored allowing them to apply for citizenship. -Monika McDermott
More Conservative Than 2008
Florida's primary voters are somewhat more conservative than in 2008, but are more moderate than Iowa and South Carolina.
Preliminary exit poll results reveal that about 7 in 10 Republican primary voters in Florida consider themselves conservative, and about 2 in 10 Republican primary voters consider themselves moderate.
In 2008, 61 percent of Florida primary voters said they were conservative, and 28 percent considered themselves moderate.
So far in the nominating contest, Iowa has been the most conservative state, with 8 in 10 voters saying they were conservative, and nearly half saying they were very conservative. Over two-thirds of South Carolina's primary voters were conservative, and over a third said they were very conservative.
In South Carolina, 23 percent of voters were moderates, and Mitt Romney led moderates there by 5 points. In Iowa, only 15 percent of voters said they considered themselves moderate on most political matters, and they split their vote between Ron Paul and Mr. Romney. -Allison Kopicki
Who's the Fairest of Them All?
Even though millions of dollars have been spent on advertising in Florida -- and a good portion of that advertising has been considered negative in the past week or so -- about 4 out of every 10 Republican primary voters cited campaign advertising as an important factor in their decision.
On a separate exit poll question, about 1 in 6 Romney voters said that he ran the most unfair campaign. By contrast, about 1 out of every 20 Gingrich voters said their candidate was the most unfair.
Just as they did in South Carolina, about two-thirds of voters in Florida's Republican primary said that the recent debates were an important factor in their decision. (There have been 19 debates so far.) -David R. Jones
Evangelicals Less Prominent
Florida has fewer evangelical Christian voters than some earlier states, which were an important group for Mr. Gingrich's South Carolina win, and for Rick Santorum's slim victory in Iowa.
The preliminary exit poll results released this evening show that just under half of Republican primary voters consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians.
In South Carolina, nearly two-thirds of primary voters were evangelicals, and 44 percent of them supported Mr. Gingrich. In Iowa, nearly 6 in 10 caucus goers were evangelicals, and about a third of them voted for Mr. Santorum. -Allison Kopicki
The Economy

The Republican primary in Florida comes amid troubled financial times in the state. The state's unemployment rate is higher than the national average, and Florida's Republican voters are feeling it - about 6 in 10 cite the economy as the most important issue in their primary vote.
A greater proportion of voters say they are falling behind financially than had been the case in the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina. In each of those states, two-thirds of voters reported that they were holding steady financially. In Florida, less than that are holding steady -- and more are falling behind. Nearly 3 out of 10 say they are falling behind economically, compared with one-fifth of South Carolina's primary voters.
At least part of this economic concern stems from a foreclosure crisis in the state, a point that Mr. Romney repeatedly made as he campaigned there. Florida has the fifth highest foreclosure rate in the country, and voters are experiencing it in their communities. Half of primary voters describe the foreclosure problem in their communities as a "major problem." Another third cite it as a "minor problem." -Monika McDermott

HEADLINE: A $1 Billion 'Model' Employee Education Program

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: United Technologies has invested $1 billion on college education for its employees, a program that should serve as a model for corporate America, according to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. 

 BODY:
Big companies often seem to be conflicted - if not two-faced - when it comes to their workers. They pay lip service to their employees as their most cherished corporate assets, yet they routinely shed workers.
The payroll cutting is done in the pursuit of efficiency and profits, or because a company is jettisoning a business. That's understandable, though harsh. These days, the obligation a corporation has to its workers, if any, is a matter of debate.
But back in December 1995, George David, then the chief executive of United Technologies, gave his answer. "As a private employer, we cannot guarantee anyone a job," Mr. David said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. "But we are nonetheless obliged to provide employees reasonable opportunities to re-establish themselves, ideally on more favorable conditions, in the event of job loss."
Granted, United Technologies is a big-tech company more than a bits-tech company. It makes products like jet engines, aerospace electronics, helicopters, air-conditioners and elevators. But all industrial products are increasingly animated and controlled by software. And the skills issues - and global competition - that United Technologies faces are common to any technology company.
Mr. David backed up his nice words with United Technologies' dollars, and a commitment. The company, he said, would pay 100 percent of the cost of tuition and books for any employee seeking a college degree - associate's, bachelor's or graduate degree. 
The offer came with no strings. An employee could choose any courses. And the worker could receive a degree one day, and go to work for another company the next.
In good times and recessions, United Technologies has kept the program intact. By now, more than 32,000 company employees have received college degrees in its "employee scholar program," and more than 10,000 workers are currently enrolled. United Technologies has invested $1 billion in the program so far. 
On Tuesday afternoon, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities gave its annual award for promoting higher education to United Technologies. This is the first time the association's award has been given to a company.
David L. Warren, president of the independent colleges association, said the United Technologies program was the most generous it had seen. "We think it's a model for the nation, one that hopefully other corporations might follow," said Mr. Warren, the former president of Ohio Wesleyan University. 
Nathan Boelkins, 33, a chief engineer at United Technologies' Hamilton Sundstrand unit, has taken advantage of the employee scholar program, twice. He received a master's degree in management, and is now studying toward a master's in aeronautical science.
His course work has included some evening classes, but has been mainly online. The company gives employees three hours a week for study during their workdays, but, of course, most studying is done on evenings and weekends.
At Hamilton Sundstrand, Mr. Boelkins leads engineering teams that work on the electrical systems for Boeing 787 jumbo jets. His courses, he said, have improved his skills both in managing people and understanding sophisticated aerospace technology. "I feel like I have the right skills sets for anything that is thrown at me," Mr. Boelkins said.
Not surprisingly, United Technologies has found alumni of the employee scholar program are both more likely to stay with the company than the work force in general and more apt to be promoted.
Measuring the benefit to United Technologies is tricky, but the program appears to have been a rewarding long-term investment, for the company as well as the workers. In 1995, when Mr. David announced the program, he noted that in the previous five years United Technologies had cut 33,000 jobs in the United States, about one job in three, while adding 15,000 jobs abroad.
In 1995, United Technologies had a global work force of 170,000, with 71,000 employees in the United States. In 2010, the most recent year figures are available, the company employed 208,000 worldwide, and 73,000 in America.

HEADLINE: Santander's Profit Plunges on European Debt Crisis

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Banco Santander announced that quarterly earnings fell nearly 98 percent, to 47 million euros, as it dealt with the downturn in the Spanish real estate market and the European debt crisis. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Banco Santander of Spain announced on Tuesday that its net profit fell nearly 98 percent, to 47 million euros, during the final three months of last year, as the bank dealt with the downturn in the Spanish real estate market and the European debt crisis.
The drop in quarterly profit weighed on the bank's annual earnings, which fell 35 percent, to 5.35 billion euros ($7 billion), in 2011. 
During the final three months of 2011, the bank said it had to set aside 1.8 billion euros to offset exposure to Spain's troubled real estate market and an additional 600 million euros to cover a downturn in its operations in Portugal. The bank, based in Madrid, set aside a combined 3.2 billion euros for the year.
As its Spanish business continues to feel the effects of Europe's debt crisis, Santander's operations in other parts of the world are becoming increasingly important. For the first time, earnings from its Latin American division accounted for more than half of the bank's profit in 2011. Yet even in this fast-growing market, Santander said its profit from the region fell 1 percent, to 4.6 billion euros.
Continental Europe represented almost a third of Santander's earnings last year, while profit from its operations in Britain and the United States totaled 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
Santander's large deposit base and diversified worldwide operations have helped it to remain profitable despite the Continent's debt crisis. Earlier this month, Santander said it had raised enough capital to meet new requirements outlined by the European Banking Authority. The regulator is pushing the region's banks to achieve a 9 percent core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, by June.
As one of Europe's largest banks, Santander has also been able to access financing from Europe's capital markets. Last year, it said it had issued 40 billion euros of new debt, more than enough to cover the 32 billion euros of outstanding debt it had to repay in 2011.That contrasts with smaller institutions across the Continent that have struggled to raise debt as investors have shied away from supporting Europe's financial sector.
"Banco Santander has shown it is able to generate results and, at the same time, meet the capital requirements set out by the E.B.A., significantly increase provisions for property exposure and maintain shareholder remuneration at 0.60 euros a share for the third consecutive year," the bank's chairman, Emilio Botin, said in a statement.
In afternoon trading in Madrid on Tuesday, the bank's share price had risen 1.3 percent. Santander's stock has fallen 33 percent in the last 12 months.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expected to Charge Ex-Traders at Credit Suisse With Fraud

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors are said to be preparing criminal charges against former traders at Credit Suisse, accusing them of defrauding investors by mispricing mortgage securities. 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors are preparing to file criminal charges against former traders at Credit Suisse, accusing them of defrauding investors by mispricing mortgage securities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Charges could be filed as soon as Wednesday, said this person, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. It is unclear how many traders will be charged.
The Credit Suisse traders are expected to be accused of overvaluing the positions on their books in order to increase their bonuses from the bank, this person said.
A case would be among the government's first criminal prosecutions involving a bank's valuation of complex securities called collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, which are created from bundles of mortgage bonds. The securities contributed to the inflating housing bubble and its subsequent collapse, which brought about the financial crisis of 2008.
The Justice Department has come under criticism for not bringing enough criminal cases connected to companies at the center of the financial crisis. In November 2009, in the first major criminal case connected to the financial crisis, a federal jury in New York City acquitted two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers on charges that they had misled investors as their portfolio of mortgage-backed securities plummeted in value.
At last week's State of the Union address, President Obama said that the government would redouble its efforts to investigate banks and other financial firms.
A new task force, said President Obama, "will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans."
The Credit Suisse case has its origins in early 2008 when the Swiss bank fired a group of traders for inflating the value of collateralized debt obligations. The Swiss bank was forced to revalue to mismarked securities and take a $2.85 billion write-down.
The losses tied to the pricing errors were a major embarrassment for Credit Suisse, which performed better than most of its competitors during the credit crisis. Credit Suisse, which has been cooperating with the authorities in their investigation, will not be charged in the case. A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to file a parallel civil action, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: The Political Geography of Florida

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: There are more than 4 million registered Republicans in Florida, but they are not homogeneous either demographically or ideologically. 

 BODY:
There are 4,063,853 registered Republicans in Florida. But they are not spaced uniformly throughout the state, and they are not homogeneous demographically or ideologically. Florida's Republican primary electorate is much more diverse than Iowa's, New Hampshire's or South Carolina's.
What follows is a basic guide to Florida's political geography. To help FiveThirtyEight get the lay of the land, we reached out to several people with experience in Florida politics, including Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic political strategist in Florida who ran the 2008 Obama/Biden campaign in the state; Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor in the University of South Florida's Department of Government and International Affairs; and David Johnson, a former executive director of the Florida Republican Party who worked on Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s campaign.
Florida has 10 media markets, which have widely varying shares of the state's registered Republicans:
The I-4 Corridor
The bulk of Republican voters in Florida live in the I-4 corridor, which covers two media markets, Tampa/St. Petersburg/Sarasota and Orlando/Daytona Beach/Melbourne. The Tampa market alone holds about a quarter of the state's registered Republicans. John McCain won most I-4 corridor counties in 2008, but not by much - and Mitt Romney edged him out in a handful.
With such a large portion of the state's Republicans, it can be hard to apply generalizations to the voters in this region. "There are economic conservatives, social conservatives, some Hispanics. It's our melting pot," Mr. Johnson said. 
The Tampa market also includes a string of retirement communities scattered up and down the Gulf Coast, especially in Citrus County and Pasco County. The eastern part of Pasco County, however, is heavy with Tampa bedroom communities. The Tampa area also includes Polk County, which has some heavy industry like mining.
The Orlando market is similar to the Tampa area - and also has plenty of retirees including The Villages, an inland retirement community that has become almost a second home to most presidential aspirants. The Orlando area includes the Space Coast in north Brevard County. 
The I-4 Corridor is usually a swing area in primaries and general elections and is considered the state's bellwether. It might be possible to win Florida without winning the I-4 corridor, but it would not be easy. Indeed, if Mr. Romney is running up large margins in counties in the Tampa area (which usually are among the first to report their results), then it may be an early night for politicos.
Northeast Florida
Mr. Romney won two of Florida's 10 media markets in 2008, and the Jacksonville market was one of them. Conflicting forces are at work in the Jacksonville area this year. On one hand, it might be a place where Newt Gingrich would be expected to do well: Republican voters here are more conservative and church attendance is high. On the other hand, it has many upper-income Republicans and white-collar retirees, among whom Mr. Romney's business experience probably plays well. The Romney campaign has also had a presence in the area essentially since the 2008 election. If Mr. Gingrich does achieve what would be a significant upset, he would probably have to perform well in the region, where about 10 percent of the state's Republicans live.
The Panhandle
There is a saying in Florida that you travel north to go south and you travel south to go north. The first part of that aphorism refers to the Panhandle, which includes the Pensacola, Panama City and Tallahassee media markets. This area resembles the states that it borders, Alabama and Georgia. Panhandle Republicans are the state's most socially conservative. The western Panhandle is dotted with military bases, and is home to a large contingent of active and retired military personnel. This is Gingrich and Rick Santorum country. 
Unfortunately for those two campaigns, the area is not densely populated and constitutes just a small part of Florida's registered Republicans, about 9 percent.
Miami/Ft. Lauderdale
Hispanics make up about 11 percent of registered Republicans in Florida and more than two-thirds of them are in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale media market. 
The area leans Democratic, so Republican turnout is lower than one might expect - the media market holds only about 16 percent of the state's registered Republicans, and they tend to turn out less reliably than those in other areas.
Still, it can play a decisive role in some Republican primaries, having given Mr. McCain much of his advantage in the state in 2008 because of his advantage with Hispanic voters. This year, Mr. Romney is polling well among Hispanics instead. 
The Miami/Ft. Lauderdale media market also includes a significant number of Jewish voters. Statewide, Florida has nearly 640,000 Jewish residents according to the North American Jewish Data Bank, more than any other state except New York and California, and there are large Jewish communities in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.
This population skews Democratic, but the Republican campaigns have been courting Jewish voters. All of the candidates except Ron Paul have taken a very hard line on Iran. And Mr. Gingrich accused Mr. Romney of cutting Medicaid money while he was governor that paid for kosher meals for seniors. And last week, Mr. Gingrich appeared at a Republican Jewish Coalition rally in Delray Beach, where some in attendance wore pins that read: "Obama, Oy Vey!"
Finally, Mr. Romney is expected to be a better fit for the region's generally moderate-to-liberal views on social policy. 
South Florida (minus the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area)
On the Gulf Coast lies the Ft. Myers/Naples media market, the other market that Mr. Romney won in 2008. It is home to many transplants from the Midwest, and Florida political strategists described it as somewhat moderate and Midwestern in its political outlook, with a fair mix of socially tolerant Rockefeller Republicans thrown in. Like the Tampa media market, this Gulf Coast area is also home to many retirees. This is also a region that was hit particularly hard when the housing bubble burst, especially areas like Cape Coral and Lehigh Acres.
On the Atlantic side, just below the Orlando area, lies the West Palm Beach/Ft. Pierce media market. If the Ft. Myers region is Midwestern, the West Palm Beach area is Northeastern, local strategists said, with transplants from New Jersey and New York. 
The West Palm Beach media market is relatively diverse. For example, it includes the counties Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin. All three have sizable retiree populations, but Indian River and Martin are more wealthy, while St. Lucie is more working class. St. Lucie, in fact, has been trending more Democratic in recent years.
Of course, there are socially moderate Republicans in the Panhandle and there are socially conservative Republicans in the Miami area. These generalizations are just that; Florida, because of its rapid population growth, looks something like a Jackson Pollock painting when you go block to block and community to community. 
Still, the Tampa region is the most representative of the state and the first one to keep track of on Tuesday night. If Mr. Romney has a solid lead there, the networks may be more comfortable calling the state early. "As goes the Tampa media market so goes Florida," said Mr. Schale.

HEADLINE: Live Coverage of the Florida Primary

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Welcome to FiveThirtyEight's live blog of Florida's Republican primary. 

 BODY:
Welcome to FiveThirtyEight's live blog of Florida's Republican primary. Polls in the state are closed, and we'll be bringing you the results, data-driven observations, exit poll information and some historical perspective.
We will also be posting some of the best reader comments throughout the evening, so we encourage you to give us your take on what you're seeing.
9:50 P.M. | Florida Wrap-Up
With 96 percent of the vote counted in Florida, Mitt Romney leads Newt Gingrich by 14.5 percentage points. Mr. Romney failed to win an outright majority of the vote, but he had a very strong night overall. He won across the vast majority of demographic categories, and he received more votes than Mr. Gingrich and Rick Santorum put together.
Mr. Romney now has a considerable lead in the Republican delegate count, and a decent-sized one in the aggregate popular vote count. He's received about 250,000 more votes than Mr. Gingrich through the first four early voting states out of about 2.7 million cast, an edge of just under 10 percentage points.
Although the FiveThirtyEight forecasts of Florida struggled to catch up to the shifting momentum in Florida at times, they wound up having a very good night, predicting a 14.7 point win for Mr. Romney, just about the lead he now holds over Mr. Gingrich.
I will have some additional thoughts on turnout in Florida later tonight, which was down from 2008 - and a longer article in the morning that attempts to put Mr. Romney's win into context. 
But we are wrapping up the live blog for tonight. Thank you, as always, for reading.
- 
9:33 P.M. | Florida's Northeast Contrarians
Mitt Romney won Florida relatively easily, but there is one region - Northeast Florida - where he lost counties he won in 2008.
Although John McCain won Florida in 2008, Mr. Romney took nine counties in the Jacksonville area. Jacksonville-area Republicans tend to be more conservative than those to the south in the I-4 corridor. In 2008, Mr. Romney was considered ideologically to the right of the other top tier candidates. Now, most consider Mr. Romney on the moderate side of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
But the area is also home to many upper-income Republicans and white-collar retirees, a natural base for Mr. Romney. These competing forces made the region harder to forecast, would the pro-Gingrich or pro-Romney forces prevail?
Mr. Gingrich prevailed in six of the Northeast counties that Mr. Romney won in 2008: Columbia County, Clay County, Baker County, Bradford County, Union County and Nassau County. Even in Duval County, home to Jacksonville, where Mr. Romney leads, he managed only to match his 2008 vote share, 41 percent. Perhaps, Republicans in northeast Florida simply prefer to play the contrarian to their southern neighbors.
- 
9:18 P.M. | The Most Overrated Issue in Florida?
There was considerable focus on immigration policy in the Republican debates in Florida. However, just 3 percent of voters described illegal immigration as their most important issue in Florida exit polls - no more than the 3 percent who said the same in South Carolina.
- 
8:43 P.M. | Gender and Marriage
As has been noted, female voters were a key factor in Mr. Romney's Florida victory. According to exit polls, Mr. Gingrich actually only lost to Mr. Romney among men by 5 percentage points, 41 to 36. But among women, who were about 49 percent of the electorate, Mr. Romney was favored over Mr. Gingrich 51 percent to 29 percent.
Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. Gingrich, who has been married three times, performed better among married men than unmarried men. He lost married men to Mr. Romney 35 percent to 37 percent, but he lost unmarried men 25 percent to 47 percent.
The difference in preferences among married and unmarried women was subtler. Mr. Romney beat Mr. Gingrich among married women 51 percent to 28 percent, and among unmarried women 44 percent to 28 percent.
- 
8:54 P.M. | Florida's Perfect Track Record
Since the modern nomination process began in 1972, the Republican candidate who won Florida has won the party nomination all 10 times.
This isn't quite as impressive as it sounds since Florida has not always voted early. Nevertheless, it's a streak that Mr. Romney has a good chance to extend (though he would also be breaking the streak of South Carolina always being won by the eventual nominee). 
Florida has sometimes picked a runner-up on the Democratic side. It voted for George Wallace in 1972, Gary Hart in 1984 and Hillary Clinton in 2008.
- 
8:49 P.M. | Romney's Sweeping Win
A quick-and-easy way to measure the breadth of a candidate's win is simply to count the number of distinct categories that he led in exit polls.
According to tonight's exit polls in Florida, Mr. Romney won 56 groups, while Newt Gingrich won 14.
That means Mr. Romney's win was roughly as sweeping as Mr. Gingrich's in South Carolina. In that state, Mr. Gingrich won 51 categories in the exit polls while Mr. Romney won 10.
- 
8:39 P.M. | FiveThirtyEight Readers Anticipate Intrade
After last Saturday's South Carolina primary, I asked FiveThirtyEight readers on Twitter what they thought Mitt Romney's chances of winning the Republican nomination would be if he rebounded to win Florida. The average response was a 87 percent chance.
With Mr. Romney's victory in Florida now accounted for, the betting Intrade currently gives Mr. Romney a 90 percent chance of becoming the Republican nominee - quite close to the reader estimate.
- 
8:26 P.M. | Debates an Overrated Factor in Gingrich Defeat?
Here's one modest surprise from the exit polls, considering that Mr. Gingrich was widely thought to have performed poorly in both Florida debates.
Among voters who said the debates were important to their vote, Mr. Gingrich lost to Mr. Romney by 8 points, according to the exit polls. But that was much closer than among voters who said the debates were unimportant. Mr. Gingrich lost those voters to Mr. Romney by 24 points.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gingrich actually led Mr. Romney 41 to 39 among the 17 percent of voters who said the debates were the important factor in their vote.
It should be noted that because Mr. Gingrich frequently cites his strength as a debater on the campaign trial, voters who are loyal to him to begin with may be more likely to say the debates matter - regardless of Mr. Gingrich's actual performance in them.
Still, the polls in Florida had generally shown a slow and steady decline for Mr. Gingrich in Florida rather than one that was tied in any obvious way to the debates last Monday and Thursday.
- 
8:15 P.M. | No Edge for Gingrich Along Georgia Border
If there's one place Newt Gingrich might have been expected to do well tonight, it's in the counties in the extreme northern part of Florida that border Georgia, where he was elected to Congress.
But so far, Mr. Gingrich is only running about even with Mitt Romney in these counties. 
Between the eight border counties that have reported results so far, Mr. Gingrich has 15,549 votes - slightly behind Mr. Romney's 15,726.
Mr. Gingrich may overtake Mr. Romney by the end of the evening since Leon County - which contains Tallahassee and is more moderate than most of the region - has reported a higher share of its results than most others. Still, that Mr. Gingrich is struggling to hold his ground even along the Georgia border is a sign of his deep difficulties tonight.
- 
8:00 P.M. | Florida and Virginia Give Romney Delegate Advantage
With Mitt Romney's win in Florida tonight, he has won all of the state's 50 delegates - although there is some chance the outcome could be disputed because Florida's winner-take-all allocation is technically in violation of Republican party rules.
But assume that the outcome holds, and that Mr. Romney also wins Virginia on Mar. 6, where only he and Ron Paul are on the ballot. Virginia awards all of its delegates to the winner if he or she gets at least 50 percent of the vote. By definition, the winner in a two-way race will have at least 50 percent of the vote, and the winner is likely to be Mr. Romney in a head-to-head contest against Mr. Paul.
That would give Mr. Romney a total of 96 delegates between Florida and Virginia alone (Virginia has 49 delegates, but three of them are automatic delegates, often called super delegates). Although this represents only 8 percent of the delegates that Mr. Romney would eventually need to cinch the Republican race, it would nevertheless constitute a tangible advantage in the event of a close back-and-forth race against Mr. Gingrich.
- 
7:45 P.M. | Paul Struggles in Florida
One thing we've noticed so far is that candidates who are a good distance behind the front-runners tend to underperform their polls and their FiveThirtyEight forecast - perhaps because some of their voters switch to more viable candidates.
Ron Paul has just 7 percent of the vote so far in Florida - below our forecast of 11 percent.
Rick Santorum is close to the 14 percent we forecast - he has 13 percent of the vote so far in Florida, and that percentage could increase slightly once votes from the conservative Florida Panhandle start to be counted. Still, it had seemed possible that Mr. Santorum could beat his forecast following his strong performance in last Thursday night's debate.
- 
7:36 P.M. | Romney Unlikely to Win 50 Percent of Vote
With 41 percent of precincts reporting in Florida so far, Mitt Romney has 50 percent of the vote. Although all signs point toward an impressive victory for him tonight, he is unlikely to wind up with an outright majority of the vote.
There are two simple reasons for this. First, polls still have not closed in the Florida Panhandle - which should be one of Newt Gingrich's best regions. Second, the votes that have been counted so far contain a heavy proportion of early and absentee ballots, which are likely to favor Mr. Romney more than the votes cast today. It is more likely that Mr. Romney will wind up somewhere in the mid-40s than at 50 percent or higher.
- 
7:29 P.M. | Jewish Turnout Low in Florida
There has been some speculation that Democrats could struggle to hold the Jewish vote in 2012. They had struggled, for instance, in the special election in New York's 9th Congressional District in 2011, which has a heavy Orthodox Jewish population.
But there is no sign tonight of Jewish voters switching their registration over to the Republican side in Florida. According to early exit polls, just 1 percent of voters in tonight's Republican primary identified as Jewish. That's down from 3 percent in the Florida Republican primary in 2008, which also might mean that Jewish Republican voters in the state are not terribly enthusiastic about this group of candidates. Jewish turnout in general elections in Florida is normally about 4 percent.
- 
7:15 P.M. | Romney Has Huge Early Edge in Tampa
Mitt Romney is accumulating big margins based on the votes counted so far - leading Newt Gingrich 52 percent to 26 percent with 9 percent of precincts reported.
It's likely that these numbers slightly overstate Mr. Romney's eventual margin of victory because they consist mostly of early and absentee votes. 
Still, the geographic distribution of the votes bodes extremely well for Mr. Romney. Around 100,000 votes have already been counted in the Tampa metro region - the state's traditional bellwether - and Mr. Romney has about 50 percent of them so far.

7:09 P.M. | Signs of Florida's Economic Problems in Exit Polls
According to early exit polls, 35 percent of Florida voters said they made $50,000 or less in 2012. That compares to 29 percent in 2008.
Although the difference is not extraordinary, the figures are not inflation-adjusted, so ordinarily the share of voters below a given income threshold falls over time. 
What's also interesting is that, although income levels and education levels are ordinarily highly correlated, there has been no corresponding decline in the educational achievement of Florida voters: 50 percent of voters have college degrees, according to the early exit pollss, the same as in 2008. This may well indicate that a sizable number of Floridians are worse off financially than they were four years ago.
- 
6:49 P.M. | The Florida Delegation
There are 50 delegates at stake in today's primary, and all of them will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Given that a new Republican National Committee rule prohibits states that vote before April - except for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada - from awarding their delegates on a winner-take-all basis, you might ask why Florida's delegates aren't awarded proportionally.
The R.N.C. already penalized Florida for moving its primary into January, taking away half the state's delegates. And, apparently, the R.N.C. cannot punish a state more than once. So Florida decided that since they were free from any further delegate fines, it would give all its delegates to the primary's victor.
There is still a chance that Florida's delegate allocation will be proportional after all. The R.N.C. could challenge the state's winner-take-all status at the party convention in August.
In any case, currently, Newt Gingrich is leading the delegate race with 23 delegates, closely followed by Mitt Romney at 21. Rick Santorum has 13, Ron Paul has 3 and erstwhile candidate Jon Hunstman has 2.
- 
6:50 P.M. | Hispanic Turnout Increasing Rapidly in Florida
Although this does not qualify as a major surprise given the state's changing demographics, the increased rate of Hispanic participation in the Florida Republican primary is nevertheless impressive.
This year, according to early exit polls, 15 percent of voters described themselves as Hispanic. By contrast, the percentage was just 5 percent in the Republican primary in 1988. And it was just 7 percent in 2000, even though George W. Bush, who won the primary that year, was considered to have considerable strength among Hispanic Americans. 
- 
6:31 P.M. | Why Gingrich Is Rooting for High Turnout
I generally advise caution against interpreting reports of higher or lower turnout as being an obviously good sign for one or another candidate. But in this case, Newt Gingrich's best chance is for turnout to be as high as possible.
The reason is that Mitt Romney almost certainly has an edge among early voters - various polls pegged it at between 10 and 25 percentage points. 
According to the Florida Department of State, about 632,000 ballots were cast before tonight. If Mr. Romney beat Mr. Gingrich by 15 percent among these voters, that means he's already banked a lead of about 95,000 votes.
The higher the Election Day turnout, the lower the percentage edge Mr. Gingrich will need to catch up to Mr. Romney. 
For instance, if 1 million Florida voters have gone to the polls today, Mr. Gingrich would need to beat Mr. Romney by nearly 10 percentage points to match his advantage among early voters. However, if 2 million Floridians turned out today, Mr. Gingrich would only need to beat Mr. Romney by about 5 percentage points.
Most polls imply that Election Day turnout will be somewhere in between these two thresholds. For instance, if 1.5 million Floridians vote today, that would put the overall turnout closer to 2.1 million after also accounting for early votes. Turnout was about 1.9 million in the 2008 Republican primary.
- 
6:11 P.M. | Historically, Florida Is a Blowout
If FiveThirtyEight's Florida projection is in the ballpark, Mitt Romney will win the state by about 15 percentage points. That's a sizable victory. But historically, it's relatively close.
The only really close Republican primaries in Florida were in 2008 and 1976. This is partly explained by the overall primary calendar.
From 1972 to 2004, Florida held its primary on the second Tuesday in March. At first, this was early enough to ensure that Florida had at least somewhat of an impact on the nominating process. In 1972, there were no primaries in January or February. From 1976 to 1984, there was just one in February. But more and more states began leap-frogging Florida. By 2004, 11 states held either a primary or caucus in January and February.
So in 2007 Florida's politicians moved their primary up to the last Tuesday in January. Back near the top of the batting order, Florida probably won't see margins anywhere close to those of the past, even in years like this one with a clear front-runner.

HEADLINE: How to Avoid Reinventing the Wheel on Tax Reform, Part 2

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: It's hard to overhaul the tax code without an outline upfront of what is intended, which can be used to weigh the impacts of proposed changes against one another, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last week, I explained that much of the heavy lifting on tax reform has already been done in various studies that are still relevant to the problems of the tax code today. I concentrated on one in particular, the 1977 Treasury "Blueprints" study, largely written by the Princeton economist David Bradford. Today and in future posts I want to discuss some others that are easily available on the Internet.
In his 1984 State of the Union address, President Ronald Reagan asked the Treasury Department to study tax reform and send him a report on options. The task fell largely to Eugene Steuerle, then a Treasury economist and now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington.
The Treasury approached the project with an open mind. That is, it was not premised on a particular philosophy of taxation. This was frustrating to some of the political appointees at Treasury, who favored tax reform based on "supply side economics." They wanted a flat rate tax on a consumption base that would largely, if not entirely, exempt capital from taxation. (Mr. Steuerle was a member of Treasury's career staff.)

The final report, published in November 1984, was a balanced discussion of tax issues generally free of politics or ideology - a pragmatic review of practical problems with the tax system and options for improvement that reflected a consensus view among tax specialists. 
The report was not a call for tearing up the tax code and starting over from scratch. It was about taking the tax system as it was, fixing glaring problems and proposing improvements that were doable, rather than pie-in-the-sky reforms with no chance of enactment.
Two key constraints guided the Reagan tax reform effort. First was a hard revenue-neutrality requirement. Because our political leaders actually cared about the budget deficit in those days, a tax cut was not viable; any proposals that reduced revenue had to be offset by provisions that raised revenue. The final package was devised to neither raise nor lower aggregate revenues.
Second was the political reality that Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and were likely to continue to do so after the 1984 election. This was important because the Constitution requires that all revenue bills must originate in the House. If the House refused to move a tax reform bill, the Republican-controlled Senate could do nothing about it.
Thus the 1984 effort necessarily needed to be bipartisan from the beginning, and it was. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, accepted the need for tax reform and was instrumental in moving the ball forward.
For several months after the Treasury study was published, the White House reviewed its options. In May 1985, it sent a detailed tax reform proposal to Capitol Hill. It incorporated some valid criticisms of the Treasury effort and deleted some of the more politically controversial ideas. This proposal formed the basis of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
One lesson of that effort is that it is very, very easy for tax reform to lose its focus absent a detailed outline at the start of the process. Vague principles are insufficient to guide legislation, because it's too easy to ignore and jettison the unpopular revenue-raising side of the coin - the actual reforms - and just do a bill loaded with special-interest provisions enacted at the behest of tax lobbyists.
Also, given the long road to tax reform from the Ways and Means Committee to the House floor, to the Senate Finance Committee, to the Senate floor, to a conference committee and final passage, many opportunities abound for squeaky wheels to demand their pound of grease. 
It is essential that there be some baseline against which to measure progress and experts following it closely enough to know when some seemingly innocuous amendment will interact badly with some other provision to create a perverse result.
Even with the Treasury keeping a close eye on the progress of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, mistakes were made. A glaring one was the provision eliminating the deduction for interest paid on credit cards and other consumer loans. The idea was to curb borrowing for consumption while raising revenue to pay for revenue-losing provisions of the legislation.
However, ending the deduction for consumer interest neither reduced consumer borrowing nor raised revenue, because mortgage interest remained deductible. Banks simply created home-equity loans to finance consumer borrowing and the interest remained tax deductible. By and large, such loans simply replaced those that the Tax Reform Act tried to curb.
Arguably, the result was worse than doing nothing. Excessive credit card debt can be renegotiated or discharged through bankruptcy. But when people start using their homes as credit cards, the results can be more severe. Any downturn in home equity, especially a prolonged one such as we have seen since 2007, risks the loss of people's homes when home equity loans cannot be paid.
President Obama should have taken a page from Reagan's book and asked the Treasury to do another comprehensive study of the tax system. Sadly, he failed to do so in his State of the Union address on Jan. 24. 
In fact, he went in the opposite direction from tax reform, proposing a laundry list of new tax preferences for clean energy, hiring veterans, stimulating manufacturing and other purposes. Any worthwhile tax reform effort needs to start by getting rid of such narrowly targeted tax gimmicks.
According to news reports, the White House still plans to propose some sort of corporate tax reform next month. While the corporate side of the tax code is in dire need of reform, it may be unrealistic to confine tax reform to the corporate sector. 
It would have been better to approach tax reform in a comprehensive manner, as the Reagan administration did in 1984.

9:54 P.M. | From Nevada, Paul Vows to Push Ahead
HENDERSON, Nev. - Mr. Paul just addressed a cheering and hollering crowd of more than 1,000 supporters here, vowing to push through the caucus states and continue a campaign he said was intended to shrink the size of government and its ability to intrude on people's lives.
The crowd booed loudly when Mr. Paul said he had called Mr. Romney to congratulate him on his win in Florida, but they cheered when he added that he told his Massachusetts rival that he "would see him through" the caucus states. That's an allusion to Mr. Paul's "delegate strategy," in which he will try to scoop up as many delegates as possible for this summer's Republican National Convention by campaigning hard in caucus states like Nevada, Colorado and Maine, places where he expects to be more competitive than he was in Florida.
"People are beginning to realize the problem is too much government," Mr. Paul said to applause. "We need more personal liberty."
Amid cheers of "President Paul" and "End the Fed," Mr. Paul hit on the same themes he always does: avoiding foreign wars, scaling back the Patriot Act and introducing a radically new monetary policy.
"They've given us a lousy foreign policy, they've given us a lousy budget, they've given us a lousy recession," he said. "Don't you think it's about time we had a new monetary policy?"
- 
9:24 P.M. | Gingrich Speaks
ORLANDO, Fla. - If detractors of Mr. Gingrich were looking for a downcast speech after his big loss tonight, they were disappointed as Mr. Gingrich spun a silk purse from a sow's ear, declaring that the lesson from Florida was "it is now clear this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader Newt Gingrich and the Massachusetts moderate.''
Despite his 15 percentage point loss to Mr. Romney, a defiant Mr. Gingrich, flanked by supporters waving signs that read "46 States to Go," vowed to impose a "people-powered" campaign on the establishment and to become the party's nominee in August.
The crowd swelled to a few hundred as Mr. Gingrich took the podium with his family shortly after 9 p.m., cheering as enthusiastically for chestnuts from his stump speech as if hearing them for the first time. They applauded his promises to repeal banking regulations, to authorize the XL Keystone pipeline and to send White House "czars" packing on his first day in office. 
Mr. Gingrich mocked the "elite media" that he said had repeatedly left him for dead politically in the past, and promised to continue campaigning for the next six months.
And he said he would combat millions of dollars in negative ads with "ideas" like he said he had done in the past.
Mr. Gingrich scarcely mentioned Mr. Romney, his rival in the coming 46 state battles (make that 45 since Mr. Gingrich failed to get on the ballot in Virginia), but he did aim a few fresh jabs at President Obama.
"I may not get in as much golf as Obama, but I'll get in a lot more job creation,'' he said. 
"I'm not going to compete with Obama in singing,'' he added, "because I'm not running for entertainer in chief.''
Mr. Gingrich criticized Mr. Obama, saying that "if Barack Obama gets re-elected, it will be a disaster" for America.
But Mr. Gingrich predicted that would not happen because of the campaign he plans to wage against Mr. Romney and the party leaders who have lined up behind the former Massachusetts governor.
"Not a Republican campaign. Not an establishment campaign. Not a Wall Street funded campaign," he said. "A people's campaign."
It was a speech that embodied Mr. Gingrich's sincere reverence for American history as well as his view of his own place in it. He quoted from the last line of Gettysburg Address promising a campaign "of the people, by the people and for the people.''
And in a moment both stirring and perhaps "grandiose," to quote one of his critics, the third-place finisher Rick Santorum, he appropriated the last line of the Declaration of Independence: "I promise if I become your president, I pledge to you my life, my fortune and my sacred honor.''
- 
9:10 P.M. | Santorum Chides Front-Runners
Mr. Santorum is not in Florida, but he has a message for the two leading candidates who still are: Cut it out.
"Let's focus on the real issue, which is defeating Barack Obama," Mr. Santorum told a crowd in Nevada after placing a distant third in Florida. "We're not going to do that by mudslinging."
Mr. Santorum promised to give a hard-edged speech linking Mr. Romney's health care plan to Mr. Obama's on Wednesday in Nevada. But he said he would attack the issues, not personal characteristics.
And Mr. Santorum urged voters to move on from Mr. Gingrich's campaign.
"In Florida, Newt Gingrich had his opportunity," Mr. Santorum said. "He said, 'I'm going to be the anti-Mitt,' and it didn't work. He became the issue. We can't allow our nominee to be the issue in the campaign."
- 
9:04 P.M. | The Political Costs of a Nasty Fight
With his resounding victory over Mr. Gingrich in Florida on Tuesday, Mr. Romney showed a worried Republican base a side of himself that it has both longed for and feared that he lacked: the agile political street fighter, willing to mock, scold and ultimately eviscerate his opponent.
But if he has quelled doubts about his toughness, he also emerges from the Florida free-for-all and the three contests that preceded it carrying heavy new baggage.
Mr. Romney was savaged by Mr. Gingrich over his record at Bain Capital, softening him up for the coming Democratic effort to portray him as a heartless capitalist happy to fire people to enrich himself. His release of his tax returns, complete with details about a Swiss bank account, provided concrete new facts for opponents seeking to cast him as out of touch with ordinary Americans.
News Analysis: The Political Costs of a Nasty Fight
- 
8:53 P.M. | Looking Ahead to Nevada 
With Mr. Romney commanding a decisive win in Florida, the campaigns have no time to rest, but will be on their way to Nevada for Saturday's caucus. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul basically skipped over Florida's primary and have already hit the ground and the airwaves in Nevada. And to note, Mr. Romney won the Nevada caucus in 2008, with 51 percent of the vote, with Mr. Paul coming in second with 14 percent of the vote.
Nevada, in many ways, has a similar complexity and diversity to Florida, with a struggling economy, large urban areas of older retired Republican voters and a sizable Hispanic contingent. These characteristics may provide a clue as to how the Nevada caucus could play out. And Nevada is the first state among these early nominating contests to include a substantial bloc of Mormons, who amounted to 26 percent of the state's Republican caucusgoers in 2008 and not surprisingly went solidly for Mr. Romney, who shares their religion.
In December, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 12.6 percent, well above Florida's 9.9 percent, and the national unemployment level of 8.5 percent. Nevada also has the highest foreclosure rate in the country, with 1 in 177 housing units receiving a foreclosure notice in December, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing company.
Florida's exit polls showed that voters who are falling behind financially were divided in their vote Tuesday, with about 4 in 10 supporting Mitt Romney, and the same number supporting Newt Gingrich. Among those who said foreclosures were a major problem in their community, about 4 in 10 supported Mr. Romney, and about 3 in 10 supported Mr. Gingrich.
Entrance polls from 2008 showed that 8 percent of Nevada Republican caucusgoers were Hispanic, and 45 percent were over the age of 60. In Florida on Tuesday, over half of Hispanic voters went for Mr. Romney, while about 3 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Romney had the support of nearly half of voters over the age of 60, and about a third supported Mr. Gingrich.
Over half of Nevada's caucusgoers in 2008 came from urban areas. In Florida, about a third of primary voters came from urban centers, and nearly half of city dwelling voters for Mr. Romney.
(Maine also holds its caucuses on Saturday. More on that state's contest later this week.)
- 
8:53 P.M. | The Economic Story Behind the Vote
Unsurprisingly in a state with high unemployment and record levels of home foreclosures, more than 6 in 10 voters cited the economy as the most important issue in their vote. 
What may be surprising, however, is how economic concerns affected the vote. 
The level of concern was relatively stable across the board. All income groups chose the economy as their top issue, by far, and also cited the foreclosure crisis as a major problem, at the same rates (a slim majority of every group). Seemingly, whether rich or poor, Florida Republican voters share the same economic concerns.
There were some differences in economic views and voting, however, in Florida's larger and more diverse areas, relative to the rest of the state. All regions of the state chose the economy as their top issue, but nearly 7 in 10 voters in Miami and South Florida chose the economy as top, compared to 6 in 10 overall.
Surprisingly, however, voters from Miami and South Florida were also among the wealthiest voters in the survey, with roughly 40 percent reporting an income of over $100,000 per year. South central Miami, which has similar income levels, was the region with the second highest levels of economic concern.
In these regions, Mr. Romney performed his best, receiving more than a majority of the vote in Miami and South Florida and roughly half of the vote in south central Florida. He performed even better among voters in these relatively well-off areas who cited the economy as their top concern.
In contrast, the center of the state, which includes the famed Interstate 4 corridor as well as the city of Orlando, was among Mr. Gingrich's better areas. While Mr. Gingrich still trailed Mr. Romney there, he did so only by single digits. These voters reported much lower income levels than voters in South Florida, and were more likely to report that they were personally were falling behind financially. Overall, those falling behind financially were divided between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney.
Finally, Florida has the fifth highest foreclosure rate in the country, and voters are experiencing it in their communities. Half of primary voters described the foreclosure problem in their communities as a "major problem." Another third cited it as a "minor problem." The home foreclosure problem had little effect on the overall vote. However, among voters in central Florida and Orlando, those most concerned with the foreclosures in their community favored Mr. Gingrich over Mr. Romney by double-digits.

8:46 P.M. | Florida Exit Polls: How Different Groups Voted
A look at how different groups voted in the Florida primary, based on a poll of voters exiting the primary conducted by Edison Research.
- 
8:39 P.M. | Romney Declares Victory 
Mr. Romney celebrated his victory in Florida tonight with a warning to President Obama and Democrats celebrating the divisive Republican primary.
"A competitive primary does not divide us, it prepares us, and we will win," Mr. Romney said.
"And when we gather back here in Tampa for our convention, ours will be a united party with a winning ticket for America," he added.
After briefly congratulating his Republican rivals, Mr. Romney quickly turned his attention back to Mr. Obama.
"Leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses," Mr. Romney said, directing his comments to Mr. Obama. "Well Mr. President, you were elected to lead. You chose to follow. Now it's time for you to get out of the way."
Mr. Romney declared that he stood ready to assume the mantle as the leader of the Republican Party and said that his leadership would "end the Obama Era and begin a new era of American prosperity."
- 
8:36 P.M. | Exit Polls: Good News and Bad News for Gingrich
While Mr. Gingrich was unable to duplicate the success he had in South Carolina, he did continue to outperform Mr. Romney among certain key constituencies in Florida.
Mr. Gingrich's best showing was among those who said the candidate quality that mattered most was that of a "true conservative." He won nearly half their votes, while Mr. Romney did the worst in this category of all four candidates, with only 1 in 10 choosing him. In similar fashion, Mr. Gingrich did well among primary-goers who described themselves as very conservative, winning more than 4 out of 10 votes in this group.
In terms of issues, Mr. Gingrich beat Mr. Romney by about 20 points among voters who cited abortion as their top concern, and had a nearly equal margin over Mr. Romney among those who said abortion should be illegal in all cases. (The abortion issue has long dogged Mr. Romney, who has been accused by his rivals of flip-flopping because in the past he said he supported legalized abortion.) 
Mr. Gingrich was also the top vote-getter among strong supporters of the Tea Party, garnering nearly half of their support, and among nearly 4 in 10 white evangelical Christians.
Finally, Mr. Gingrich tied Mr. Romney for the lead among those who felt they were falling behind financially.
Despite these successes for Mr. Gingrich, the exit polls also revealed major sources of concern for his campaign. Just as exit polls showed in each previous contest this year, a plurality of voters in Florida said that the most important candidate quality was the ability to beat President Obama (nearly half of all responses). However, while Mr. Gingrich carried this group of voters in South Carolina by a margin of 51 percent to 37 percent over Mr. Romney, these figures were almost reversed in Florida.
In addition, among the 1 in 5 Florida primary voters who viewed having strong moral character as their most important candidate quality, Mr. Gingrich did the worst of all four candidates (less than 1 in 10 of these votes).
Finally, the Florida exit polls suggest that stories about Mr. Gingrich's previous failed marriages may be affecting his popularity among female voters, particularly among married women. Among married men, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney were essentially tied. But among married women, Mr. Romney beat Mr. Gingrich by more than 20 percentage points.
- 
8:27 P.M. | Low Turnout at Gingrich Event
ORLANDO, Fla. - An hour after the polls closed and with early returns showing a blowout night for Mr. Romney, there are only about 100 supporters of Mr. Gingrich's milling in Grand Ballroom C at the Rosen Centre Hotel here. They are outnumbered by television journalists on risers and laptop scriveners at long tables. A Politico correspondent quipped that there is "one reporter for each supporter." 
Mr. Gingrich, who arrived in his bus at the hotel at 5 p.m. Eastern, is presumably upstairs watching the television coverage of the returns. He is expected to speak around 8:30 p.m.
He plans to fly to Reno, Nev., in the morning, but he has scaled back his campaigning in the state. His traveling press corps was told to expect a single public event per day in Nevada ahead of the caucuses on Saturday. He canceled two events earlier on the schedule for Wednesday. His Los Angeles-based traveling video team, which has recorded his every event and move in Florida and South Carolina, is being put - as they say in Hollywood - on hiatus.
- 
8:00 P.M. | Romney Wins Florida Primary 
Mitt Romney won the Florida primary on Tuesday after aggressively beating back a challenge from Newt Gingrich and regaining momentum on his relentless march toward the Republican presidential nomination.
Interviews with voters as they exited the polls in Florida allow The New York Times to project that Mr. Romney will win the state by a wide margin over Mr. Gingrich, who will come in second. Ron Paul and Rick Santorum will finish the night behind the two leaders.
The campaign now shifts immediately to Nevada, which will hold its caucuses on Saturday. Mr. Gingrich has vowed to continue his battle against Mr. Romney, whom he calls "a Massachusetts moderate." And Mr. Santorum and Mr. Paul have already left Florida to begin campaigning in states with coming contests.
Mr. Romney won across a wide swath of different voters, according to early exit poll returns. He bested Mr. Gingrich among men and women, Hispanics, and across income and age categories.
Conservatives, however, remain a potential trouble spot for Mr. Romney, who lost to Mr. Gingrich among those who call themselves very conservative and among those who said that the most important issue is that the Republican candidate be "a true conservative."
But Mr. Romney managed to do much better among very conservative voters in Florida than he did 10 days ago. He also ran closely with Mr. Gingrich among white evangelical Christians, who made up a far smaller share of Florida's electorate than they did South Carolina's.
Mr. Romney's victory came after his campaign made the decision 10 days ago to unleash a torrent of negative attacks on Mr. Gingrich's character and his record, using television ads and Mr. Romney's own speeches to cast Mr. Gingrich as erratic and unacceptable.
"It's pretty clear that politics ain't beanbags," Mr. Romney told reporters on Tuesday as votes were being cast.
Mr. Gingrich, who failed to repeat his convincing victory in South Carolina, responded in kind to Mr. Romney's advertising assault. Aided by $10 million in contributions from a Las Vegas casino magnate and his wife to a "super PAC" supporting his candidacy, Mr. Gingrich sought to portray Mr. Romney as dishonest and a flip-flopper.
But Mr. Gingrich's biggest asset in his effort to stop Mr. Romney - the nationally televised debates - became a liability in Florida.
Mr. Romney's aggressive style in two debates last week forced Mr. Gingrich to try and defend his record. And where Mr. Gingrich had won over the audience in South Carolina, it was Mr. Romney who got the crowd on his side during the two face-offs in Florida.
In stark contrast to South Carolina, where Mr. Gingrich's strong performances in the debates helped propel him in the state, voters in Florida who said the debates were an important factor in their vote leaned toward Mr. Romney.
As in past contests, a large number of Republicans who cast ballots Tuesday night said they viewed the candidate's ability to win against Mr. Obama to be their top issue. In New Hampshire and Iowa, most of those voters supported Mr. Romney; in South Carolina most of them backed Mr. Gingrich.
Voters seemed to blame Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich about equally for running unfair campaigns.
Married women were an especially strong group for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, with about half of them supporting him (married men were closely split between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich). And about half of voters age 65 and older backed Mr. Romney, a group that accounted for more than third of all voters - a far older electorate than in the earlier voting states. 
Hispanics, who accounted for about 1 in 7 voters and were heavily courted by the candidates, favored Mr. Romney by a wide margin. That marks a substantial turnaround from 2008, when Mr. Romney did poorly with this group. 
Mr. Romney also ran especially strongly among higher-income voters and Catholics. 
More than 6 in 10 voters said the economy was the most important issue to their vote, and they favored Mr. Romney. The top candidate quality to voters was someone who could beat President Obama, and most of these voters supported Mr. Romney.

7:04 P.M. | Exit Polls: Urban Voters
Another first for Florida - it's the first early nominating state to have primary voters living in major urban centers.
Florida is the fourth most densely populated state in the nation, and most primary voters in the Sunshine State hail from urban and suburban areas. Early exit poll results showed that nearly 3 in 10 Republican primary voters in Florida live in cities of 50,000 or more, and almost 6 in 10 were from the suburbs.
In South Carolina and New Hampshire, about 1 in 10 primary voters came from cities with populations over 50,000, and in Iowa, about 1 in 5 primary voters came from urban areas.
- 
7:02 P.M. | Florida Remains an Important Battleground
For the second election cycle in a row, Florida is playing a big role in choosing the Republican nominee for president.
But the state's real importance may be as the biggest, most important swing state in the general election battle with President Obama this fall.
In 2008, John McCain lost the state to Mr. Obama by three percentage points. In 2004, George W. Bush won it over John Kerry by about the same amount. And of course, in 2000, Al Gore famously lost the state by only a handful of votes to Mr. Bush.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama's strength was in the southeast, around Miami, and in the counties around Orlando, Tampa and Tallahassee. Mr. McCain - like many Republicans before him - did well in the Panhandle.
How important is Florida? When Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, laid out his five "paths" to re-election in December, he called Florida "the easiest way to 270 electoral votes" for the Democrats.
Not that the Democrats think winning in Florida in November will be easy. In fact, four of the five scenarios by Mr. Messina assume that Mr. Obama loses the state. But winning it - and its 29 electoral votes - would allow Mr. Obama to lose some other states while still winning the election.

6:48 P.M. | 'Atheist Republicans' for Paul
TAMPA, Fla. - Voting at this polling location in the neighborhood of Town 'N' Country was very slow earlier Tuesday. Now, there are a few people trickling in to vote after work, but it is still quiet.
Three young professionals stopped for an exit interview of sorts all voted for Mr. Paul. They described themselves using words not heard often on the campaign trail: "atheist Republicans."
The atheists, Tegan Matteo, 27, and Erik Steckler, 28, were not in the most upbeat moods about voting tonight. "Politicians are all narcissists," Ms. Matteo, a teacher, said.
Dr. Steckler, her husband, a radiologist, added: "Sociopathic narcissists."
But they admitted that they felt it was their duty to vote anyway.
"It's important," Dr. Steckler said. "It would be ignorant of us not to participate. We obviously can't say who decides to run. But it's up to us to make our vote heard. Even if your candidate doesn't have a chance at winning, you can indirectly influence decisions that way."
The couple said they understood that a lot of people consider Mr. Paul's libertarian ideas "out there," but in his defense, Dr. Steckler said, "they're not like 'moon base' out there," a dig at Mr. Gingrich, who has advocated the development of a lunar colony while stumping in Florida.
Another voter, Adam Hardman, 30, a lawyer, said he had gotten all of his information about this race from the debates, and that was why he voted for Mr. Paul. "I just really like the policies he stands for."
Now the polling place is empty again.
- 
6:44 P.M. | Exit Polls: Who Is More Empathetic?
While Mr. Romney won out over Mr. Gingrich when it came to asking Florida voters which candidate would be most likely to win in November, it's a closer call for voters as to which one best understands the problems of average Americans.
More than half, according to these early exit results, say Mr. Romney is the most electable candidate, far ahead of the number that say Mr. Gingrich is. But fewer, about a third, say Mr. Romney is the most empathetic candidate, compared with about a quarter who instead cite Mr. Gingrich.
- 
6:30 P.M. | Exit Polls: Abortion
Florida's Republican primary voters are clearly anti-abortion rights - akin to voters in South Carolina. About two-thirds of Florida's Republican voters say they believe abortion should be illegal in either most cases or all cases. About one-third feel that abortion should be mostly or always legal.
South Carolina's voters expressed similar attitudes with 64 percent preferring that abortion be largely illegal and 35 percent expressing support for abortion's being mostly legal.
- 
6:11 P.M. | Exit Polls: Late Deciders 
Only about one-fourth of the Republican primary voters said they made their decision in the past few days. By contrast, a majority of voters in the South Carolina primary and near majority in Iowa and New Hampshire decided in the last few days before their contest.
Perhaps the Republican contest is settling down. But also, the lower percentage of "late deciders" may be partly because it's expected that about 30 percent or more of the votes were cast before Tuesday. State election officials say they have received more than 650,000 absentee ballots and early votes. Florida is the first state so far to offer early voting, which has become increasingly popular in recent election cycles.
In fact, tonight's exit polls take into account the combined absentee/early votes. Joe Lenski, the executive vice president of Edison Research, said the firm conducted a telephone poll of 600 people for seven days ending Sunday to incorporate the pre-primary tally into the exit surveys. The telephone poll results will be weighted to reflect the actual percentage of the absentee/early vote of the official returns. Republicans are expecting a voter turnout of about 1.9 million altogether.
Some pre-primary polls, including an NBC News/Marist Poll released on Sunday, took into account the early and absentee voters in their surveys. In that particular one, those voters chose Mr. Romney, 49 percent, to Mr. Gingrich, at 27 percent. But some counties in Florida were accepting early voters, before Mr. Gingrich saw a rise in South Carolina polls and won its primary.

Ashley Parker reports from a Romney event in The Villages, Fla., where many residents remained undecided in today's primary.
- 
6:05 P.M. | Negative Advertising Flooded Florida's Airwaves
Negative ads were so prevalent in the final week before the Florida primary that they accounted for 92 percent of all campaign commercials that ran.
And the most heavily broadcast commercial this past weekend was not one featuring Mr. Romney or Mr. Gingrich but Tom Brokaw, the former NBC News anchor whose image the Romney campaign co-opted for an ad that used a 25-second clip from an old newscast on Mr. Gingrich's political troubles.
These figures, compiled by the Kantar Media Campaign Media Analysis Group, attest to the bitter turn the race took after the South Carolina primary when Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and the "super PACs" working to elect them unleashed a barrage of attacks.
Mr. Gingrich, outspent and underfinanced, was the primary target.

5:58 P.M. | Exit Polls: Hispanic Voters 
Florida is the first early nominating state to have a significant block of Hispanic voters, and the exit polls highlight the state's diverse nature. Nearly 1 in 7 primary Republican voters are Hispanic.
In 2008, about half of Florida's Hispanic Republican primary voters supported John McCain, nearly a quarter of Hispanic voters backed Rudolph W. Giuliani, and about 1 in 7 said they cast their vote for Mitt Romney.
- 
5:56 P.M. | Exit Polls: Tea Party Support
Support for the Tea Party in Florida is just as strong as in Iowa and South Carolina, according to preliminary exit polls. About two-thirds of primary voters in Florida say they support the Tea Party, and nearly 4 in 10 say they strongly support the Tea Party. About half of primary voters in New Hampshire were Tea Party supporters.
A vibrant Tea Party in Florida helped propel Senator Marco Rubio and Gov. Rick Scott to victories in 2010. Since then, Mr. Rubio has been mentioned by many in the Republican Party as a potential running mate for the eventual Republican nominee for president, but Mr. Scott has seen his popularity wane amid difficult budget cuts.
In South Carolina, Tea Party supporters cast their votes for Mr. Gingrich over Mr. Romney and Rick Santorum, by 2 to 1. But in New Hampshire, 41 percent of Tea Party enthusiasts supported Mr. Romney, and 22 percent cast their votes for Ron Paul.
- 
5:52 P.M. | Exit Polls: Immigration 
In a state with a high immigrant population (nearly 9 percent of Floridians are noncitizens), fewer than 1 of 5 primary voters in Florida cites illegal immigration as the most important issue in their vote.
But the issue still resonates. More than one-third of Republican primary voters feel that illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, a position more in line with Mr. Gingrich's than Mr. Romney's. Three in ten voters would like to see illegal immigrants deported back to their home countries, and a similar number believe they should be allowed to stay as guest workers.
This is a shift for Florida's Republican voters. In the 2008 primary election, 40 percent of voters said they wanted to see illegal immigrants deported, while 29 percent supported a guest worker option and 29 percent favored allowing them to apply for citizenship.
- 
5:49 P.M. | Romney Says a Win Would Affirm Aggressive Strategy
TAMPA, Fla. - Mr. Romney, who first canceled and then rescheduled a morning event on Tuesday, stopped by his Florida campaign headquarters here to greet voters, briefly work the phones and answer reporters' questions.
As supporters and campaign volunteers gathered on the back balcony to await Mr. Romney, they roused themselves into a half-hearted chant of "Mitt, Mitt, Mitt." But when Mr. Romney finally strode out, the group grew more enthusiastic - so excited, in fact, that there was a lone, errant cheer when Mr. Romney referred to the "good debates" Mr. Gingrich had in South Carolina.
"We came to Florida and Speaker Gingrich didn't have two good debates - I did," Mr. Romney said, to louder (more well-directed) cheers. 
Mr. Romney, who has spent the past week in Florida hitting Mr. Gingrich over a variety of issues, said that a win here would reaffirm his campaign's strategy to go on the offensive after a nearly 13-point loss to Mr. Gingrich in South Carolina.
"If we're successful here, it'll be pretty clear that when attacked you have to respond and you can't let charges go unanswered," Mr. Romney said.
Earlier, inside his Florida headquarters, Mr. Romney ran into Jim Talent, a former senator from Missouri and Romney surrogate, who commented on his casual blue shirt and slacks.
"I figured, you know, why not a golf shirt?" Mr. Romney said. "Last time I wore this shirt was at a parade in Laconia, N.H., so, good luck. It's a good-luck shirt."
- 
5:47 P.M. | Exit Polls: More Conservative Than 2008
Florida's primary voters are somewhat more conservative than in 2008, but are more moderate than Iowa and South Carolina.
Preliminary exit poll results reveal that about 7 in 10 Republican primary voters in Florida consider themselves conservative, and about 2 in 10 Republican primary voters consider themselves moderate.
In 2008, 61 percent of Florida primary voters said they were conservative, and 28 percent considered themselves moderate.
So far in the nominating contest, Iowa has been the most conservative state, with 8 in 10 voters saying they were conservative, and nearly half saying they were very conservative. Over two-thirds of South Carolina's primary voters were conservative, and over a third said they were very conservative.
In South Carolina, 23 percent of voters were moderates, and Mitt Romney led moderates there by 5 points. In Iowa, only 15 percent of voters said they considered themselves moderate on most political matters, and they split their vote between Ron Paul and Mr. Romney.
- 
5:44 P.M. | Gingrich Begins to Look Beyond Florida
ORLANDO, Fla. - Mr. Gingrich kept up a busy schedule of primary-day appearances short on speeches and long on voter contact. He shook hands at a polling place in Orlando, at Fred's Southern Kitchen in Plant City, and on the Disney master-planned town green in Celebration, his bus parked between Persimmon Street and Begonia Road.
But the most important visit was to a campaign office in Lakeland, where he thanked a dozen or so volunteers making voter calls. These are the crucial boiler-room workers in the Gingrich campaign's effort to reach 100,000 Republicans over two days, trying to make up with activists' intensity some of the yawning gap separating Mr. Gingrich in surveys with Mr. Romney.
As he heads to his primary night party at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando, Mr. Gingrich has changed his tune from earlier in the campaign when he predicted that a victory in South Carolina, as he won 10 days ago, would set up a sweep of Florida.
Now Mr. Gingrich is looking beyond Florida - well beyond, toward multiple contests in the coming months, when he predicts he will unite conservatives yearning for an anti-Romney. Asked how long the race would last, Mr. Gingrich offered a feisty reply on Tuesday: "Until June or July, unless Romney drops out sooner.''
- 
5:38 P.M. | Exit Polls: Who's the Fairest of Them All? 
Even though millions of dollars have been spent on advertising in Florida - and a good portion of that advertising has been considered negative in the past week or so - about 4 out of every 10 Republican primary voters cited campaign advertising as an important factor in their decision.
On a separate exit poll question, about 1 in 6 Romney voters said that he ran the most unfair campaign. By contrast, about 1 out of every 20 Gingrich voters said their candidate was the most unfair.
Just as they did in South Carolina, about two-thirds of voters in Florida's Republican primary said that the recent debates were an important factor in their decision. (There have been 19 debates so far.)
- 
5:34 P.M. | Exit Polls: Religion 
Florida has fewer evangelical Christian voters than some earlier states, which were an important group for Mr. Gingrich's South Carolina win, and for Rick Santorum's slim victory in Iowa.
The preliminary exit poll results released this evening show that just under half of Republican primary voters consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians.
In South Carolina, nearly two-thirds of primary voters were evangelicals, and 44 percent of them supported Mr. Gingrich. In Iowa, nearly 6 in 10 caucus goers were evangelicals, and about a third of them voted for Mr. Santorum.
- 
5:29 P.M. | Exit Polls: The Economy 
The Republican primary in Florida comes amid troubled financial times in the state. The state's unemployment rate is higher than the national average, and Florida's Republican voters are feeling it - about 6 in 10 cite the economy as the most important issue in their primary vote.
A greater proportion of voters say they are falling behind financially than had been the case in the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina. In each of those states, two-thirds of voters reported that they were holding steady financially. In Florida, less than that are holding steady - and more are falling behind. Nearly 3 out of 10 say they are falling behind economically, compared with one-fifth of South Carolina's primary voters.
At least part of this economic concern stems from a foreclosure crisis in the state, a point that Mr. Romney repeatedly made as he campaigned there. Florida has the fifth highest foreclosure rate in the country, and voters are experiencing it in their communities. Half of primary voters describe the foreclosure problem in their communities as a "major problem." Another third cite it as a "minor problem."
- 
5:30 P.M. | Watch for Romney to Refocus on Obama
One thing to listen for tonight will be evidence that Mr. Romney is ready to pivot, at least a little bit, back to a general election message that attacks President Obama more than it does his rivals.
Mr. Romney's advisers have said that their candidate has no intention of taking his foot off the gas pedal - or off of Mr. Gingrich's neck - as the campaign moves into the weeks and months ahead.
That would indicate that Mr. Romney's speech, even if he wins big, would still be directed largely against Mr. Gingrich in the hopes of maintaining pressure on the former House speaker.
But Mr. Romney's advisers are also aware of the need to get their focus back on Mr. Obama as soon as they can, to rebuild the sense of inevitability among Republicans and begin to reach out to independents.
So listen carefully to what Mr. Romney says after the voting ends. It could be a signal of how he intends to campaign going forward.
- 
5:26 P.M. | Exit Polls: Nearly Half Say Electability Is Top Factor 
The first sets of exit poll results are being released in the Florida primary, and electability is high on voters' minds. Nearly half of the Republican voters in preliminary exit poll results said the most important quality they were looking for in a candidate was the ability to defeat Barack Obama, far more than said they cared most that the candidate has the right experience, is a true conservative or has strong moral character.
Electability was the top quality for voters in the three previous contests, but by varying margins. It was most important to 31 percent of voters in Iowa, 35 percent of voters in New Hampshire and 45 percent of voters in South Carolina.
These voters supported Mr. Romney over Mr. Gingrich by 28 points in Iowa and a huge 51 points in New Hampshire. But in South Carolina, most of them backed Mr. Gingrich. Results later tonight will tell us which candidate won them this time.
- 
5:05 P.M. | As Florida Votes, Paul Campaigns Elsewhere
LAS VEGAS - The only contest Representative Ron Paul is likely to win in Florida on Tuesday is this: highest ratio of votes to time spent campaigning there.
Mr. Paul, a 76-year-old Texan, spent barely any time in Florida outside of two debates, and instead, he has been canvassing the early caucus states where he is betting he can steadily scoop up delegates here and there - enough to influence the party and its nominee on issues like scaling back the Patriot Act, scrutinizing the Federal Reserve and curbing the power of the president to wage war without Congressional approval.
In fact, Mr. Paul has scheduled his "Florida Election Night Party" on Tuesday night more than 2,000 miles away, at a resort in Henderson, Nev., outside Las Vegas. Part of his strategy included eschewing Florida, a winner-take-all primary that awards no delegates for second place, and that was also expensive. Mr. Paul's aides believed they would have had to have spent more than $9 million to be competitive there. 
Recent polls have Mr. Paul barely breaking into the double digits in Florida, trailing Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
Mr. Paul was also seen as having a less influential campaign organization in Florida than in states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, adding to his belief that he had little to lose by focusing instead on places like Colorado, Maine and Nevada, where he was met by big crowds before he departed for Nevada on Tuesday.
- 
5:00 P.M. | Insight Into the Importance of Debates
Voters in South Carolina who thought the debates were very important voted in huge numbers for Mr. Gingrich. That may be different on Tuesday night.
Mr. Gingrich was widely perceived to have been flat during both the debates last week in Florida. (Mr. Gingrich has said so himself, offering a variety of excuses.)
So if Mr. Gingrich loses badly, it could be a sign that the debates remain a vital - and influential - part of the presidential campaign process.
- 
4:57 P.M. | Romney Looks for Big Win
If the polls have been right over the past several days, Mr. Romney will likely emerge as the easy winner of tonight's primary - and the networks will likely project his victory moments after the last polling places close at 8 p.m. Eastern.
But keep an eye on Mr. Romney's margin of victory.
His aides are hoping for a blowout, in part to best Mr. Gingrich, who won by 12 points over Mr. Romney in South Carolina. But they also want to emerge from Florida with the kind of momentum that will make Mr. Gingrich and the other candidates think twice about continuing the battle.
If Mr. Romney emerges with better than a 12-point margin over Mr. Gingrich - and above the 40 percent threshold - look for him to tout that fact in his victory speech. If it's less than that, the message from Mr. Romney's camp is likely to be: A win is a win, no matter how large or small.
- 
4:39 P.M. | Florida Voters Head to the Polls
ORLANDO, Fla. - Florida Republicans went to the polls on Tuesday to decide a hotly contested primary that saw Newt Gingrich trying to corral the state's conservative voters around his candidacy to stop Mitt Romney's march to the party's nomination.
With polls suggesting that he was lagging far behind, Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, was trying to avoid a lopsided defeat to carry his campaign forward to the next series of nominating contests, which kick off Saturday as the focus shifts to Nevada.
Mr. Romney had a relatively light day of campaigning planned for Tuesday. The polls opened at 7 a.m. in most parts of the state and were to close at 7 p.m., although in western parts of the Florida Panhandle, voters can cast ballots until 8 p.m. Fifty delegates are at stake, and it is a winner-take-all state.
Florida is an early-voting state, and the numbers suggested strong participation, with more than 280,000 people returning ballots before primary day, ahead of the pace from 2008, when Senator John McCain carried the state. 
The candidates were also required to release their fund-raising data on Tuesday. And most closely watched would be financial filings by "super PACs," the independent groups that have already spent in the tens of millions of dollars on this race.

HEADLINE: Looking Ahead to Nevada


HIGHLIGHT: Looking at Florida's exit polls and Nevada's political history for insights into the Silver State's caucuses on Saturday. 

 BODY:
With Mitt Romney commanding a decisive win in Florida, the campaigns have no time to rest, but will be on their way to Nevada for Saturday's caucus. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul basically skipped over Florida's primary and have already hit the ground and the airwaves in Nevada. And to note, Mr. Romney won the Nevada caucus in 2008, with 51 percent of the vote, with Mr. Paul following in second with 14 percent of the vote.
Nevada, in many ways, has a similar complexity and diversity to Florida, with a struggling economy, large urban areas of older retired Republican voters and a sizable Hispanic contingent. These characteristics may provide a clue as to how the Nevada caucus could play out. And Nevada is the first state among these early nominating contests to include a substantial bloc of Mormons, who amounted to 26 percent of the state's Republican caucus-goers in 2008 and not surprisingly went solidly for Mr. Romney, who shares their religion.
In December, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 12.6 percent, well above Florida's 9.9 percent, and the national unemployment level of 8.5 percent. Nevada also has the highest foreclosure rate in the country, with 1 in 177 housing units receiving a foreclosure notice in December, according to Realty Trac, a foreclosure listing company.
Florida's exit polls showed that voters who are falling behind financially were divided in their vote today, with about 4 in 10 supporting Mitt Romney, and the same number supporting Newt Gingrich. Among those who said foreclosures were a major problem in their community, about 4 in 10 supported Mr. Romney, and about 3 in 10 supported Mr. Gingrich.
Entrance polls from 2008 showed that 8 percent of Nevada Republican caucusgoers were Hispanic, and 45 percent were over the age of 60. In Florida today, over half of Hispanic voters went for Mr. Romney, while about 3 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Romney had the support of nearly half of voters over the age of 60, and about a third supported Mr. Gingrich.
Over half of Nevada's caucus goers in 2008 came from urban areas. In Florida, about a third of primary voters came from urban centers, and nearly half of city dwellers voters for Mr. Romney.
(Maine also holds their caucuses on Saturday. More on that state's contest later this week.)

HEADLINE: From Nevada, Paul Vows to Push Ahead

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Ron Paul recounted his call congratulating Mitt Romney on his Florida win, during which he added that "I would see him through" the caucus states. 

 BODY:
HENDERSON, Nev. -- Ron Paul just addressed a cheering and hollering crowd of more than 1,000 supporters here, vowing to push through the caucus states and continue a campaign that he said was intended to shrink the size of government and its ability to intrude on people's lives.
The crowd booed loudly when Mr. Paul said he had called Mr. Romney to congratulate him on his win in Florida, but they cheered when he added that he told his Massachusetts rival that "I would see him through" the caucus states. That's an allusion to Mr. Paul's "delegate strategy," in which he will try to scoop up as many delegates as possible for this summer's Republican national convention by campaigning hard in caucus states like Nevada, Colorado and Maine, places he expects to be more competitive than he was in Florida.
"People are beginning to realize the problem is too much government," Mr. Paul said to applause. "We need more personal liberty."
Amid cheers of "President Paul" and "End the Fed," Mr. Paul hit on the same themes he always does: Avoiding foreign wars, scaling back the Patriot Act, and introducing a radically new monetary policy.
"They've given us a lousy foreign policy, the given us a lousy budget, they given us a lousy recession," he said. "Don't you think it's about time we had a new monetary policy?"

HEADLINE: A Rare Public Lament for Lost Earmarks

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: At a news conference of House Republicans to promote a transportation bill, Representative Don Young of Alaska suggests that earmarks would have made the bill better. 

 BODY:
One of the things House Republicans are most proud of is banishing earmarks from their bills, including, notably, the current version of an infrastructure and transportation bill, which has traditionally been a veritable stew pot of pork for member's districts.
 But count Representative Don Young of Alaska as a nonfan. 
 "It's difficult for me not to have earmarks," said Mr. Young, to some nervous tittering at a news conference Tuesday outside the Capitol. A large group of House Republicans had gathered to promote their American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, a bill that links revenues for proposed new energy projects to new transportation and infrastructure projects. 
 The bill, which Mr. Young conceded was kind of O.K., "will not be as helpful as it could be" without earmarks. But, he said, it will help address the dismal state of many of American highways and bridges. 
 Representative John L. Mica of Florida, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, gamely moved on after Mr. Young's comment, and introduced many other members, many of them freshmen, who praised the bill for its lack of earmarks, among other things. 
 The bill, a five-year, $260 billion proposal, would also seek to streamline the approval process for federal projects and move authority to approve work away from federal agencies toward state agencies. The 2005 federal transportation bill -- the last one passed by Congress -- had over 6,300 earmarks. 
 Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is a fierce opponent of earmarks, and the bill is one of his priorities for the second session of the 112th Congress, which began this month. 
"Instead of more stimulus spending or wasteful earmarks, the bill includes major reforms that will help to clear the way for long-term economic growth," said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, "a stark contrast to the meddling, micromanaging and manipulating Washington has done in the past under majorities of both parties."
While both chambers of Congress banned earmarks last year under pressure from both House Republicans and President Obama, the practice of marking up projects for home has another fan. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Tuesday he too lamented their elimination and would not support a long-term ban on them. 
"I've done earmarks all my career, and I'm happy I've done earmarks all my career," Mr. Reid said. "They've helped my state and they helped different projects around the country. And I repeat, I will not stand by and be driven down this path that is one that I think is taking us away from what the founding fathers wanted, three separate but equal branches of government. I do not believe that the White House has the authority to tell me how I should spend money in Nevada." 
The Senate is working on its own method to pay for the transportation funding.

HEADLINE: Connecting the Dots: Mapping Apple's Development and Manufacturing Process

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH, HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO and KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Creating infographics that map the relationships among the players involved in the manufacturing processes for the development of Apple gadgets, then delving into the conditions under which products are made and the role of the consumer in the economy.

PUB-DATE: March 19, 2012
Overview | What are the human and economic costs of manufacturing decisions made by multinational corporations? Who is responsible for ensuring the health and safety of the people who make the things that we use every day? In this lesson, students examine reporting about the labor conditions in Chinese factories that manufacture Apple products as well as the impact on the American economy of Apple's decision to manufacture parts overseas. 
Materials | iPhone or other Apple gadget (optional), computer with Internet access and projector, butcher paper, markers.
Warm-Up | Hold up an iPhone or other Apple gadget and ask students what they know about the device. Allow time for a few students to share their thoughts, then instruct students to find a partner and brainstorm together all the different tasks that had to be done in order to develop and make the gadget and get it into your hands. 
After a couple of minutes, reconvene the class and jot their ideas on the board as they share aloud. If they need prompting, have them identify physical parts of the iPhone (processor, screen, case, battery, camera, speaker, etc.) and suggest that each of these might need to be both developed and then constructed. Prompt students to think about both development and manufacturing tasks and jobs, as well as all the jobs that would be needed to support factories, like cafeteria workers, janitors, managers and so on. 
Once you have a satisfactorily full list on the board, ask students which of these jobs they think are done in the United States. Other questions you might choose to ask include: Which of these jobs do you think pay less than the American minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour? Which pay more? Which require a college education? Which might be physically demanding? Encourage students to respectfully question one another's reasoning as well as to defend their own.
If desired, you might play a two-minute This American Life segment in which Ira Glass asks Siri, "Where do you come from?"
After allowing time for students to share their initial ideas about the economic and human backdrop of iPhone manufacturing, show one of the following short Times videos: "The iPhone Economy," which explores how Apple's choice to have iPhone parts manufactured overseas affects the American economy, or "Made in China," which investigates working conditions in Chinese factories that manufacture iPhone parts. 
If you watch the "The iPhone Economy," afterward ask students what they learned about the economic impact of Apple's decision to manufacture iPhone parts overseas. What more do they want to know about Apple's decision to move manufacturing overseas? What economic responsibilities do American companies have - to the United States economy, to workers, to their shareholders, to consumers?
If you watch "Made in China," ask students what they learned about working conditions in the Chinese factories that produce iPhone parts. What more do they want to know about the working conditions in these factories? Whose responsibility is it to ensure workers' health and safety? The company's, the workers', consumers', the government's? What health and safety standards for workers should be applied, both in the United States and in factories in other countries working for American companies? How should conditions be monitored?
Related | The investigative articles "How the U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work" and "In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad," by Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher, are heavily researched, in-depth examinations of the human and economic costs of Apple's decisions to manufacture their parts in overseas factories. The first article contains the following anecdote:
One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone's screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight. 
A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. 
These two articles are lengthy, and students will not have time to complete them both in class. Instead, split the thirteen subsections included in the articles evenly among pairs of students, and inform them that it is their job is to understand the content in their assigned sections well enough to explain it to those who did not read it. (Alternatively, assign these articles for homework and continue the activity after reading is complete.) 
Provide each pair with the following prompts to guide their reading of their assigned excerpt; they should jot down their answers as they read.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
Who are all the various people mentioned? What are their organizational affiliations and relationships to one another? What do their goals seem to be?
        
What is the central issue? Are there any competing interests or responsibilities here?
        
What sense can you make of the facts and figures in your excerpt?
        
What sense can you make of the direct quotes in your excerpt? Who was interviewed and why?
        
What descriptions or anecdotes are included? What pictures do they paint?
Activity | First, have each group present to the rest of the class the essence of what they read and their answers to the reading questions. 
Next, put students into small groups, and give each group a large sheet of paper and markers. Explain that their task is to draw a map or another infographic that depicts the following:

        
All of the people and organizations included in both articles, and their relationships to one another. 
        
The economic, human and other impact of the nature of those relationships.
        
Central tensions or questions that arise from the relationships between companies, suppliers, workers and consumers. 
Once students have created their infographics, have them share their creations with the other groups. Hold a class discussion focused on the following questions: How does each map characterize the key factors in the story of the "iEconomy"? Do these characterizations seem fair and accurate? How do the infographics help you understand the relationships as well as what's at stake? Looking at these maps, which players (company executives, workers, consumers, government agencies and so on) have the most control over the process? Which players have the least control? Where would you place yourselves on this map? What role do you play, if any?
Going Further | Here are several ways to use to take this activity further or otherwise use the "iEconomy" series for teaching and learning:
 Adapt the lesson idea on factories and sweatshops sent in to The Learning Network by a teacher by comparing labor conditions in contemporary Chinese factories that produce Apple parts with labor conditions in another place and time, like 19th-century American factories. You may want to draw comparisons between the beliefs and tactics of those who fought against unfair labor practices in different moments in history and those who are fighting against unfair labor practices today.
 Examine Business Day's "Compliance by the Numbers" charts, which illustrate the extent to which suppliers adhere to Apple's rules regarding labor rights, health and safety, ethics and more. Identify and discuss questions these charts raise, and then develop proposals for how to improve labor conditions in the factories of Apple's suppliers.
 Read Chinese readers' reactions to the iEconomy reporting, and then arrange Chinese readers' comments on a continuum or matrix from "most supportive" to "least supportive" of Apple. Then use highlighters to color-code the comments by theme (government responsibility, consumer responsibility, corporate responsibility). What patterns emerge? Do commenters who focus on consumer responsibility tend to think that Apple is not at fault? Do commenters who focus on corporate responsibility tend to think that Apple is at fault? Who do students believe is responsible for ensuring the health and safety of workers? Corporations? Governments? Consumers?
 Write questions for the New York Times journalists who reported the iEconomy series, then read the Facebook discussion between the journalists and Times readers. Did other readers ask similar questions to the ones you wrote down? If so, what were the responses? Which questions - and answers - strike you and why? Where might you go to find answers to remaining questions? 
 Take poll that the Times conducted nationwide to understand the general American population's knowledge and opinions about Apple's manufacturing practices, then look at the responses to the original poll. Compare nationwide trends to the trends in your classroom. Where are there similarities? Where are there differences? What do the findings of this survey tell us about consumers' priorities? What do they tell us about consumers' access to information about the products that they buy? How should this information be used when making policy decisions about whether and how governments should regulate corporate labor practices?
 Consider your own role as a link in the consumer economy chain. How much power do consumers hold - both as a large group and individually? What can you do to learn more about where and under what conditions products you buy, use and eat are made? Can one person make a difference? If so, how?
: Choose a favorite product or food item, and investigate where and under what conditions it was made. Then write an investigative-style article, modeled on the "iEconomy" reporting, that describes the development and manufacturing process.
: Hold a performance of Mike Daisey's monologue "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs," a dramatic piece about Mr. Jobs and the manufacture of Apple products that includes a description of the conditions at Foxconn and other factories in Shenzhen, China. (Mr. Daisey released a freely available version of the monologue for performers, including school drama productions, to adapt and use as they see fit.) After staging the piece, hold a discussion with the audience about the issues it raises, including why This American Life retracted the story after learning that some of the material was fabricated by Mr. Daisey.
